        "description":"Picture stimuli depicting females and males working together were shown to college students by either a male or a female experimenter. Subjects' responses to the pictures were assessed using standard need achievement scoring. A significant interaction was obtained between sex of subject and sex of experimenter, such that higher need achievement scores were obtained by males when the experimenter was male. A categorical analysis of achievement attributions in responses revealed no differences in achievement roles and levels ascribed to female or male stimulus figures, although both male and female students ascribed higher occupational status to males than to females.

        "description":"This paper describes training innovations currently taking place in a pre-service teacher education program. The experiences are designed systematically to facilitate self-development. They include (1) learning about human development through autobiographical reflection; (2) applying Transactional Analysis to peer and professional relationships; and (3) improving helping skills via peer-counseling experiences. Student self-report and course evaluation data from four semesters are offered. This evidence shows that preservice teachers find these personal development experiences useful for increasing their self-understanding and their professional effectiveness. (Author)",

        "author":["Mesibov, Gary B."],
        "description":"This paper briefly describes a parent education program in a private pediatric office, including some of the concerns parents have brought to the program and their perception of the advice received. Some of the main problems include negative behaviors, toileting, developmental delays, school problems, sleeping difficulties, personality problems, peer/sibling interaction and handling parental divorce and separation. The main advice includes reassurance to the parents and instructions to ignore inappropriate behaviors; use a time-out procedure; focus more on positive behaviors; and be less punitive about negative behaviors. The implications of the data for future parent education programs are then discussed, and the following conclusions are drawn: (1) Parents want support and  assistance in bringing up their children and are delighted when a service such as the one described is provided. (2) Some child-rearing techniques for specific concerns seem potentially more effective than others, although much more research is needed. (3) Parents concerned enough to call professionals about a problem are not satisfied if only told to ignore the problem. (4) Parents are most responsive when given support and told to emphasize their children's positive behaviors while easing up on their negative behaviors. (5) Parents are very receptive to professionals who call them back to follow up on a problem. (Author)",

        "description":"The effects of density and other situational factors on perceptions of and responses to crowding in classroom learning environments were examined in three separate and concurrent investigations. The first experiment examined the effects of various demographic variables, learning environments and room design variables on crowding. In the second experiment, the effect of two levels of density on classroom achievement was examined in the laboratory. The third experiment examined achievement as a function of class size over a 24-year period in two community school districts. It was concluded from the three experiments that: (1) density is primarily a moderator of arousal; (2) high density can therefore have either positive or negative effects on performance, depending on whether the  task contains learned or unlearned components, or both; (3) the same interpretation applies to psychological reactions (affect) to the situation; (4) if perceived violations of personal space accompany high density, the outcome is uniformly negative; and (5) the effects of high density (positive or negative) can be eliminated by diverting a person's attention away from the other people in the room, or by increasing the degree of cooperation between people.

        "description":"The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether perceptions of role involvement by police patrolmen were significantly related to either future or concurrent job performance. A secondary objective was to analyze changes in the perceived role involvement of new patrolmen during their assimilation into a police organization. The perceived role involvement of a sample of new patrolmen from a large metropolitan police force was measured on four occasions over a period of approximately two years. A surprising finding was that the best performers were those who spent less time and energy on the job. These results plus the decrease of role involvement during assimilation imply that a norm of inactivity exists in this urban police department. If this department is  representative of other urban police forces, then this study has widespread implications for police selection, training, and assimilation. (Author)",

A brief historical review of teenage sexuality is presented in order to put current information in perspective. The present increase in teenage fertility is seen as part of a larger epidemic failure of socialization. A number of recent studies are reviewed and synthesized, especially in relation to the question of whether sex education or contraceptive programs have a reactive effect, by promoting early experimentation and irresponsible sex. Teenage women's method and frequency of contraceptive use is also discussed. Recommendations are given for the kind of clinic service desired by most women, teenage and adult. The value of using available research information about adolescent sexuality for making service  and policy decisions is emphasized. (Author/BP)",

They were tested in third grade in 1973 and again in sixth grade in 1976. These children had experienced racially integrated education from kindergarten onward. In addition, to assess the possibility of cohort differences, 52 black and 153 white third-grade children were tested in 1976. A roster-and-rating sociometric technique was used. Children were asked how much they liked to play and work with each of their classmates. The major finding was that the influence of race on sociometric ratings increased over age. However, omega-squared analyses indicated that the effect of race was much smaller than the  effect on sex. There was little evidence of cohort differences. (Author)",

Based on the theoretical work of Jean Piaget, it attempts to help University of Nebraska freshmen confront problems and follow them through to logical solutions. In its first year, the program's goals were to encourage abstract, formal thought patterns; to facilitate personal growth; and to cultivate positive attitudes toward the university. Various forms of evaluation showed that these goals were satisfactorily met. The second year's evaluation, conducted by means of better standardized and sounder assessments, largely confirmed the first year's findings. The ADAPT program seems to create a climate for exploration that positively influences  student development along intellectual dimensions. These students, by being responsible for their learning, have acquired new thinking skills and have learned to savor the accomplishments that accompany the use of these skills. (Author/BP)",

This paper reviews the available literature on unemployment and the family and relates it to current policy issues. Unemployment is found to be related to family functioning and stability, spending patterns, authority and decision making, and sex roles and the division of labor in the family. On the basis of previous research, it is suggested that research is needed to explore the joint effects of unemployment, social class, and wife employment on the family. In the development of policy, the following suggestions are made: (1) the occupational role of individual workers needs to be integrated with family needs for an adequate income; and (2) a  comprehensive policy combining full employment with an income maintenance program based on family need should be developed to provide economic security for American families.

The symposium reported here was organized and conducted following the 1975 decision but prior to the 1977 one. Three papers in support and three papers against the ruling were read, after which the participants debated the matter. Finally, one pro and one con participant summed up the views for each side. The supporters of the ruling view corporal punishment as an effective deterrent to misbehavior, insist that it is a necessary tool for keeping order in the classroom, and see it as an alternative to permanent suspension. They admit that corporal punishment is occasionally misused, but point to the fact that other  useful tools of a civilized society are also subject to misuse. The non-supporters of the ruling view corporal punishment as a type of legalized child abuse and are convinced that it compounds the teachers' problems by escalating anger in the child. They bolster their position by pointing out instances of abuse that have occurred in the past. Both groups agree that effective alternatives to phsyical discipline, coupled with teachers more adequately trained to handle disciplinary problems in the classroom, would largely remove the need for the continued future use of corporal punishment.

Two further experiments are then described, both of which cast further doubt upon the usefulness of such games as models of any real-world reference system. The author cites the large number of publications existing in this area, and compares it to the small number of validation attempts, suggesting that such studies are worth carrying out only if a correspondence can be established between behavior in the game nad behavior in an external reference system. Because of the difficulty of establishing such a correspondence, the author suggests redirecting validation attempts  away from individual analysis, to focus more on situational variables in games and real-world dilemmas.

The subjects were 384 males ranging in age from 7 to 2l years. Additional groups of subjects were also studied: Koranic students, Moroccan rug sellers, and American university students. Based on the model of memory of Atkinson and Shiffren (1968), it was hypothesized that structural features of memory may be less variable across cultures or lifetime experiences than control processes, which are known to vary with chronological age in educated Western subjects. The recall and recognition tasks were designed to tap both structural features and control processes in memory. Results showed that structural features, such  as the capacity of echoic store (recall) and the rate of forgetting (recognition), were relatively invariant with age and experiential background. In contrast, control processes, such as verbal rehearsal (recall) and rate of acquisition (recognition), depended on such factors as schooling and urbanization. Finally, based on these and other data, it was hypothesized that there exist both universal and culture-specific aspects of memory and cognition. (Author)",

Most enrollment totals and background variables are presented by class level (first, intermediate, and final years) and type of control of medical school (public or private). It is shown that in 1976-1977, the nation's 116 medical schools enrolled a record high of 58,000 students, a gain of 4 percent over 1975-1976. Differences in class compositions by sex between 1976-1977 freshmen and seniors showed proportionally more first-year than final-year women (25 versus 19 percent) and proportionally more final year than first-year men (82 versus 75 percent). About 90 percent of all 1976-1977 medical students held at least  a bachelor's degree, 7 percent also had master's degrees, and 2 percent doctorates. Eighty-five percent of all 1976-1977 medical students were white/Caucasian and 15 percent described themselves as minorities.

        "description":"The impact of changing fee schedules at Florida State University on average student loads is examined. The two types of schedules used in the study are the pre-credit-hour fee schedule and block fee schedule (set amount for full-time students regardless of number of hours). The major variables considered in the study are student level and credit hour load. A change in fee schedule (from block fee to credit hour fee) effects an irreversible change in student course loads. Examination of average student loads by level of student indicates that the average load decreases under the credit hour fee schedule. Tracking of the same students from one year to the next, however, produces a less drastic change. Thus students who entered the university under the block fee system tend to carry  higher loads throughout their university career than do those who entered under the credit hour fee system. With the possibility of returning to a modified block system at hand, a survey of student preference was taken. In general, students indicated that personal preference rather than cost dictated the number of hours they carried. An overwhelming majority were satisfied with their progress toward completion of their degrees. Of the students expressing a preference for a fee schedule, only 52 percent preferred the block type versus 48 percent who preferred the current credit hour schedule. (Author/LBH)",

The responses to the forced-choice items were factor-analyzed, and the report was organized according to a nine-category typology drawn from the analysis. The data are examined in terms of certain demographic characteristics of the survey participants. Freshmen placed the greatest responsibility for their low grades on their own lack of motivation, proper study habits, and  attention to school work. Nonetheless, many students felt that institutional or environmental factors such as university and divisional requirements, faculty teaching and examination procedures, residence hall atmosphere, background in English, and the quality of academic advising also contributed to their problems.

Included in this phase were the development of representational concepts, the design and implementation of the basic simulation model, the collection of data from the participating institutions, and the conduct of some preliminary experiments using the model.

How, if at all, and why do symbol systems, in general, differentially relate to cognition and learning? First, they address themselves to different aspects of the content conveyed through them. Second, they are processed by different cognitive systems or apparati; hence, given, a particular learner and a particular task, some require more mental effort to process than others. Third, symbol systems vary as to the mental skills they require. Finally, media's symbol systems, which are internalizable and used as tools of thought, can  cultivate mental skills. Three functions are attributed to codes that qualify them as skill-cultivators: activating skills, short-circuiting skills, and supplanting skills. If media's symbol systems can indeed affect, or be made to affect, the mastery of mental skills, then using and studying media as convenient delivery systems miss perhaps their greatest potentials and dangers.

A brief matrix typology for the conceptual classification of various solicitation models or strategies is developed. This is followed by a discussion of one such model: the negotiated publisher solicitation or product brokering between a potential publisher and product developer with an explanation of the major dimensions along which publishers vary and how the publishing world is organized. A case history illustrates the use of the models in the various publisher solicitation activities undertaken in a major career education curriculum development project. Based on experiences in the project and the analysis of publisher characteristics and the  procurement process, the author offers recommendations to assist product developers and sponsors in securing a publisher for commercial distribution of their materials. These include: (1) start the search for a potential publisher of a product that is being developed as soon as possible; (2) develop a series of special materials to assist the publisher in evaluating the product; and (3) the sponsor should give special attention to the identification and prioritization of the real goals regarding a product when selecting a publisher.

Information as the output of the mass media is treated as a product, and a model on the consumption of this product is developed by merging elements from consumer behavior theory and mass communication theory. Chapter I gives basic assumptions about the individual and the way in which mass communication functions. A general frame of reference is constructed in chapter II, and some methodological problems are discussed. Chapter III explains the need for information in terms of when and how much. Chapter IV sets up a general explanation of how consumption of information takes place, and chapter V develops a theory which explains how much information the individual will consume in relation to a specific need  for information.

Its rationale is the freedom enjoyed by an informed citizen. General education has had an unstable history due to shifts in organizing principles, failure of consistent definition, lack of leadership, inroads made by excessive departmentalization, the decline of literacy, among others--all problems more pronounced in community colleges than in universities. The crosscurrents affecting community colleges generally also affect their involvement with general education. The race is on between courses and anti-courses; curriculum is in jeopardy of  disintegrating into a set of haphazard events. The key question is not whether general education will survive, but for whom and how. It must be put together in a fashion that serves the various types of students attending community colleges. A general education curriculum demands a faculty group working together, a program head, vertical integration, and its own budget. It should provide modules and specially designed courses for occupational students, integrated thematic courses for transfer students, and special problems courses for the growing number of adult drop-ins.

The model contains four specific subsystems: goal setting, program development, program review, and cost effectiveness. Each subsystem distinctively relates to planning and decision making and each has component data fields that identify and organize information into subject categories. The data fields include community, students, programs, and resources. In order for research in any subsystem to be valuable and an effective determinant in policy making, it must take into account the various aspects of all data fields. Translation of research data into planning concepts  and alternatives is the crux of the research enterprise. After program outcome data have been collected, management guidelines are necessary to the translation process. Establishing guidelines involves setting up systemwide priorities and requires administrators to formulate some decision apparatus for converting data into action. A list of programs, services, and resource materials for the four subsystems is provided and includes such items as measurement instruments and reference works. (TR)",

Data were derived from a district computer center printout, \"Grade Listing of Freshmen Fall 1977\", which listed all students' names, units attempted and completed, grade points and grade point averages (GPA), grouped in terms of last school attended. The nearly 15,000 applicants included students from schools in 38 California counties, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and over 100 foreign countries. Only 48% of applicants completed work at LACC during fall 1977. The average student who finished some work, completed 7.5 units and had a semester GPA of 2.558. GPA of students from local \"feeder\" high  schools ranged from 1.881 to 2.785; four schools averaged above 2.7, while the remaining schools showed GPA below the overall 2.558 average. Among students showing higher than average GPA were transfers from 13 local community colleges, three Southern California state universities, the University of California at Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California, students from 28 out of 34 states, and from 20 of 27 foreign countries.

Martorana describes how public two-year institutions have become increasingly dependent on state and federal financial support, resulting in losses of college autonomy. W. Gary McGuire examines state support patterns in 39 states, with a majority reporting &quot;stabilized&quot; funding conditions not far removed from the declining resources condition. Lee G. Henderson explores the burgeoning role of state agencies. Two models for retrenchment are presented by Herbert M. Sussman, based on responses to operating budget cuts at New York City Community College. Richard DeCosmo considers how budget cuts effect curriculum and instruction, and  Jane E. Matson outlines reduction effects on student personnel services. James L. Wattenbarger discusses two approaches for administrative planners facing resource reductions, while Richard C. Richardson reviews the types of problems administrators will have to face in future, concluding that careful institutional research and planning can help maintain or increase institutional effectiveness. Dorothy M. Knoell and Richard L. Alfred look at some heretical concepts for community colleges to adopt in order to maintain the growth that characterized their early years.

In April 1976, a random sample of 100 full-time faculty, stratified along division lines, were sent survey instruments eliciting information on (1) number of friends, within and outside of respective college divisions and outside of the college, whom faculty members saw regularly, and (2) for a one week sample period, the amount of faculty/administration contact (both formal and informal), where faculty ate lunch, and the numbers of meetings attended and campus activities participated in. Seventy-one questionnaires were returned. Findings indicated  faculty tended to have more friends within their own divisions than from other divisions. Whether this segregation was directly attributable to the House Plan was not determined. Business Education faculty in particular had more friends within their division and fewer outside which might indicate high internal cohesiveness. Faculty interacted with fewer administrators than with other faculty members. About 75% attended one to three meetings weekly, and 60% reported participating in no other campus activities, including extra-curricular activities of Houses to which they belonged. (TR)",

In addition, three groups of students (graduation attendees, those eligible for graduation in June, and those who graduated June 1975) were surveyed as to assistance attained from counselors while at the college, whether counselors helped with post-graduation plans, students' House assignments, the advantages of the House Plan, participation in and suggestions for future House activities, and if the college should maintain the Plan. Counselors reported 558 students visited them during the study period. Of  these, 426 came for academic, 109 for occupational/career, and 23 for personal reasons.

During the first year, the postsecondary institutions participating in the project were to develop institutional performance indicators that reflect institutional uniqueness and instructional effectiveness. During the second year, data on performance indicators would be collected. Volunteer State Community College is one of 11 colleges and universities participating in Pilot Projects throughout the state. During fall and winter 1976-77, meetings involving members of various disciplines and  several divisions were held for the college's faculty to determine what competencies and skills students should have and how competencies and skills could be measured when students exit from specific courses, finish work in a particular discipline, or earn associate degrees and certificates. After skills and competencies were identified, a tentative list of institutional objectives and performance indicators was developed.

        "description":"The history of higher education in the United States encompasses conflicting attitudes towards those in educational leadership roles: educational leaders should be well-trained academicians who somehow know how to manage, or they should be well-trained managers who somehow know how to be academic. However, community college educational administrators are neither one nor the other, but persons trained a bit in both areas who get caught in the debate not to determine purpose but in search of identity. The problem does not involve formal training as much as how management responsibilities should be fulfilled and the nature of the academic commitment. To that end, the behavioral context in which people function as leaders determines the success or failure of that leadership. This  context involves leaders' self-knowledge, awareness of others, willingness to take risks, and capacity for self-confrontation. In addition, successful \"anticipatory\" management necessitates understanding the psychology of decision-making and the significance of the systemic approach, maintaining a balance between change and innovation and between strong leadership and delegation, providing honest adverse news as opposed to suspicious good news, making a clear short- and long-term mission statement, identifying success as well as failure, and getting things done.

The general consortium should be governed by a committee made up of representatives from each  of the member institutions, with the authority to make decisions which affect their institutions. Without decision-making authority, the veto power of each institution's administration could effectively destroy the consortium. The television component of the consortium should be directed by a consortium council, consortium coordinator, campus coordinators, and campus instructors, each having specific responsibilities.

Study I demonstrated that teaching 8-year-old children to use efficient strategies on problem-solving tasks increased both the quality of their performance and their response latencies. In addition, it showed that the children returned to poor performance and short latencies when solving a new task to which they did not apply their strategy. Study II demonstrated that reflectives and impulsives both used short latencies and performed poorly when not using strategies, and that impulsives taught to use a strategy performed more efficiently and with longer latencies than untrained reflectives. It was  concluded that response latency is a function of strategy, and that future studies should concentrate on differences in strategies of information processing between reflectives and impulsives, and not speed of responding per se.

In the first experiment, kindergarten, third and sixth graders were orally presented with three 12-item lists of unrelated words for cued recall. Acoustic, categorical, and functional cues were provided. Responses indicated significantly greater performance with category cues relative to functional and acoustic cues at all grade levels. In the second experiment kindergarten, third and sixth  grade children, and college students were given two 15-item lists for cued recall. One-third of the items in each list were category typical items cued by category labels; one-third were atypical items cued by their category labels, and one-third were familiar nouns cued by unrelated words. Results of this experiment indicated that recall with typical items was greater than recall with atypical items for all ages, and that the difference between typical and atypical items generally decreased with age.

A total of 98 fourth- and fifth-grade girls and boys identified as being high or low in self-esteem were observed with their parents in their homes. Each child was seen with his/her mother and father separately in a structured interaction and then with both parents in a Family Rorschach. In addition, parents were asked to fill out a questionnaire with demographic and attitudinal items and to respond to Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale while their children were given two cards of the Children's  Apperception Test, Human Figures Form. Results indicated that the family climate associated with high self-esteem appeared to be the one in which both mother and father were supportive of their children and of each other. Differences between mothers and fathers in their patterns of behavior towards their sons and daughters were also presented and discussed. Findings were interpreted as revealing no support for the identification/modeling hypothesis, mild support for the reinforcement hypothesis, and moderate support for the directiveness and warmth/involvement hypotheses.

Program objectives were to improve knowledge of basic concepts and vocabulary, reading comprehension, self-concept, and attitudes toward school; increase attendance rates; improve home support; and  increase parent time with children and support of learning objectives. Evaluation instruments included the California Achievement Test, Boehm Test of Basic Concepts, Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale, School Sentiment Index, teacher and parent questionnaires, district attendance report, and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Among the evaluation findings were that: the major cognitive objectives were achieved in both elementary components for kindergarten, second, third, and fourth grade students, but not for first graders; self concepts of kindergarten students improved slightly, those of third graders did not change significantly from last year; attitudes toward school showed no significant improvement during the year.

        "description":"Postsecondary education and all of Indian education are tied to the tribes, the complexities of Indian law, and the tribal powers of self-government which in turn are based on treaties with the U.S. government. Since 1789, treaty relations were entered with nearly every tribe and band within the U.S. territorial limits. Part of the consideration for the treaty promises of education was the cession of almost one billion acres of Indian land. Some have regarded these Indian treaties as transferring control over the affairs of &quot;weak uncivilized and defeated tribes to the sovereign power of the United States&quot;. However, the prevailing view has seen Indian treaties as valid agreements between independent sovereigns. Today the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act  reinforces the government-to-government relationship between the individual tribes and the U.S. government. Yet, Federal policy relating to Indian postsecondary education is inconsistent, is not responsible to tribal authority, does not provide for sufficient funding to meet the expressed needs, and is inequitable in its service to tribes. Therefore, 21 tribes have, through enabling legislation, chartered colleges for the primary benefit of their tribal members. As tribes become increasingly aware of how legislation, including education legislation, affects the reinforcement or diminution of tribal sovereign power, they should become knowledgeable about current legislation affecting tribal education, i.e., the Indian Education Act, the Indian College Bill, and the reauthorization of Title  IV.

        "description":"A request to develop instruments for assessing local foster care costs provided the impetus to examine family foster care in depth. Based on data from original studies done in Delaware and nationally during 1974-75 and on review of other research available, the study examined the history and connection of foster care to rural areas in the United States, the current situation for foster care in rural America, and the adaptations necessary to use current data in estimating the costs of foster care in rural areas. Comparison to other child and family services in rural areas and issues relating to the quality of life in rural settings were also examined. In order to check the usefulness of available data and to get a current perspective on costs for foster families, a random sample  of 200 Delaware foster parents was interviewed. An analysis comparing rural, rural non-farm, suburban, and urban foster family views was conducted. Among the findings were: most parents felt that Delaware's standard payment system for foster care did not cover all areas of direct costs, especially food, clothing, and housing expenses; many felt none of the schooling and recreation expenses were covered; these perceptions were similar regardless of location; foster parents, in general, stated that their perception of costs for foster children were more similar to natural children than different; national cost studies did show rural-urban differences in costs by region of the country.

        "description":"A series of mini courses in the basics of management, information systems, and personnel, the workshop was developed for tribal health program managers. The workshop aimed to provide: supervisory management training which was relevant to the need of tribal health supervisors; demonstrable evidence of understanding and application of new skills; the opportunity for college credit. In Phase One, Community Health Representative (CHR) Supervisors reviewed basic principles of management in lectures, small group discussions, and case studies. For this phase, CHR Supervisors were to develop a program plan according to given instructions. In the second phase, CHR Supervisors dealt with financial management, health statistics, data management and presentation, program evaluation,  community relations, and motivation. The Phase Two challenge was to price the plan submitted in Phase One, &quot;beef-up&quot; the plan with supportive documentation, build in mechanisms for evaluation, and sell it to their communities. The final Phase dealt with the supervisor's role and responsibilities as managers of the work force. Topics included: employee counseling and career development, employee discipline, handling of employee grievances, and tribal personnel systems. A model personnel merit system was outlined to familiarize supervisors with the components of personnel administration. Among the conclusions drawn from the workshop was that recognition of achievement was an incentive that should be built into any training effort. (NQ)",

A full complement of courses leading to an associate degree in Mental Health Technology was developed for the Center and accredited through Central Arizona College. After encountering various problems, the program was altered to capitalize on the skills common to all effective direct service workers, but varied enough in content to satisfy field specialties. The Center's staff also became more responsive to field requests for brief programs serving immediate field needs and worked closer with specific agencies in the field. This report summarizes the program's beginning and  re-orientation, the status of mental health technicians in fiscal year 1975, and the Human Services movement at large. Appended are two articles on mental health technician training and the American Indian, and the roles and future training needs of such technicians in the IHS; a curriculum plan for mental health technician training; a synopsis of the Desert Willow Training Center program; a proposal for the program's modification and expansion; the Human Services orientation and guidelines for certification; outlines for courses on Human Services and applied psychology with emphasis on counseling skills; a list of program activities for fiscal year 1975 and 1976; and a sample of an organizational development workshop outline and follow-up.

The major source of some of the most pertinent information is the American Indian people, the recipients of health services. Gathering the required information is complicated by communication barriers produced by cultural differences. However, a group's culture will be expressed by several patterns of behavior. When observed, or brought out by survey and interview, they may appear to be inconsistent. Therefore, an accurate interpretation of the information received requires a knowledge of behavioral patterns and how these patterns are expressed. This guide presents some guidelines for gathering cross-cultural information.  Discussed are the field survey and techniques used, a systematic approach to gathering information, information sources, cultural patterns, community attitudes toward providing information, communication barriers, interview preparations, establishment of Tribal and Service Unit support, the project's objective and scope, organization of a field survey, survey staff and functions, selection and training of interviewers, the questionnaire and interview schedule, interview techniques, and the final reporting and interpretation.

This report examines the federal response to national needs in terms of R & D support and changing R & D priorities. There are two major parts to the report. In part I, federal R & D priorities are identified in order of financial expenditures in 1977. They are national defense, space, energy, health, environment, science and technology, transportation and communication, natural resources, agriculture, education, social services, economic growth, international development, and crime prevention. Fart II explains federal R & D functions in detail.  A review of the federal budget shows that R & D obligations were an estimated $24.5 billion in fiscal year 1977, representing an average annual growth rate of 5.8% since 1969. The six leading R & D functional areas (defense, space, energy, health, environment, and science and technology) have been the focus of most of the recent growth. Between 1969 and 77, a sharp rise occurred in the emphasis on civilian R & D programs. During this period the defense/space share of the federal R & D total dropped from 77% to an estimated 61%, while civilian R & D programs grew from 23% to an estimated 39%. An appendix presents technical notes and statistical tables. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"This study of Bolivia's National Revolution of 1952 illustrates the effects of a peasant revolution on inequality and status inheritance. It was hypothesized that when an exploited peasantry revolts and overthrows the traditonal elite, peasants would be better off because inequality and status inheritance would decline as a result of the disappearance of the top levels of the stratification system. Also, inequality and status inheritance might eventually exceed their prerevolutionary levels because the revolution provides new opportunities for those with education, ability, luck, or other resources. In this study, data were taken from census tracts, a survey of 1,130 heads of household in six rural areas, and extensive anthropological reports on each area. A model distinguishing  between types and extent of inequality and status inheritance before and after revolution was constructed. Findings indicated that although the standard of living rose for most rural Bolivians as a result of the 1952 revolution, those who had advantages before the revolution usually maintained their advantages afterward. Significant advantages included educational background and family's educational status. The conclusion is that inequality and status inheritance re-emerge after revolution because revolutionary liberation allows previously exploited groups to make fuller use of human capital, physical capital, and resources.

A teacher's supplement accompanies the booklet and offers a bibliography, background information, additional activities, and ideas on how to adapt the materials for different grade levels. The document is presented in 16 chapters. Chapter I discusses ancestors and explains how pupils can trace their family histories. Chapter II cites ethnic groups which were important in Wisconsin's history. Chapters III through VIII provide information about genealogy, vocabulary, places to look for genealogical information, interviewing family and community  members, and finding meaning in names. Students are directed to look for genealogical information in cemetaries, birth and death records, census records, citizenship papers, newspapers, passenger lists of ships, deeds and wills, and state, county, town, and local histories. Chapters IX and X provide student essays on the 300 year history of an American family and on a farmhouse which has beome a family museum. Other chapters offer a genealogical crossword puzzle, a pedigree chart, family sheet, and an individual work sheet. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The document provides background information and guidelines for establishing interdisciplinary peace education programs in Catholic secondary schools. Peace education programs designed by the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA) are intended to help students perceive an ideal world where all people will live in harmony and cooperation. In these programs, students examine existing tensions and political complexities of modern society. The manual is presented in three major parts. Part I describes the NCEA peace studies program, which is based upon commitment to sound educational programming, appreciation of individual dignity, and an understanding of Catholic social teachings. Part II discusses surveys undertaken nationally and among West Coast Catholic schools in 1975  to assess peace education programs and identify curriculum needs. Findings from surveys of 442 national and 62 West Coast Catholic school administrators indicate a notable increase in programming for peace studies in Catholic high schools since a 1973 survey. Problems were expressed by administrators. Most often they had difficulty relating curriculum content to objectives such as respect for human dignity, global awareness, and alternatives to violence. Part III provides suggestions for planning a peace studies program. Information is given on setting goals, relating goals to school philosophy, identifying resources, evaluating peace studies programs, understanding community opposition, and developing curriculum. An appendix concludes the document. (Author/DB)",

        "author":["Stahl, Robert J."],
        "description":"The report contains the results of a survey of precollege psychology in Mississippi carried out between October 1975 and March 1976. The purpose of the survey was to obtain a profile of major psychology activities--separate psychology courses, objectives, textbooks, approaches, and teaching methods. A questionnaire was mailed to 388 Mississippi secondary school principals. The principals were requested to forward the questionnaire to the teachers who taught psychology courses in their schools. One-hundred and ninety eight principals responded. The survey revealed that psychology as a separate course of study for credit was taught in 17.7 percent of the 198 secondary schools. The report is concerned primarily with the responses of the 35 teachers who actually taught the psychology  courses. The analyses include information on school, teacher, class, and student characteristics; popularity of the course; behavioristic or humanistic orientation of teachers; enrollment data; use of state-adopted textbooks; and course objectives, content, and methods. Findings indicated that most precollegiate psychology courses in Mississippi were: (1) related to personality theory, emotions, and social behavior; (2) offered as elective courses in public secondary schools for one semester to 11th and 12th grade students; (3) increasingly popular among students; (4) taught by a combined lecture/discussion method; (5) directed toward helping students better understand and accept themselves as individuals; (6) offered in white rural, urban, and suburban schools with student enrollments  between 150 and 350 and between 501 and 1,000 students; and (7) taught by social studies teachers who used at least one of the state-adopted psychology textbooks.

The data were obtained primarily from population censuses in 1960 and 1970, a 1960 post-enumeration survey, and a 1971 supplementary enquiry. Because Ghana's vital registration system is incomplete, the data are not entirely reliable or consistent. Annual estimates of total population are shown beginning in 1950. An adjusted distribution of the population by age and sex is given for the latest census year, as well as for 1976. Projections of the number of women of childbearing age are shown for each year to 1985. Fertility measures shown in the profile include crude birth rates, age-specific fertility rates, and gross and net reproduction rates.  Mortality is shown in terms of crude death rates, life expectancy at birth, infant mortality rates, and selected life table values by age and sex. Also presented is summary information on family planning, urban population, marital status, school enrollment, number and size of households, and labor force by industry, occupation, and status.

In addition, students identify community issues and problems, and explore their own attitudes about their community. It is designed for use in grade five through junior high school. There are four parts to the community study project. During part one, students interview members of their own families about reasons for living in this particular community, positive community features, population size, economic and cultural life, use of leisure time, job market, and important historical events. Part two involves a visit to community officials and an interview relating to the community's strengths, problems, and changes over the past 20 years. In part three, students  analyze the responses from parts one and two and use the information to make individual reports about their own attitudes toward the community. Students consider whether they would like to settle in the community, what they could eventually do there that would be important, and what they can do right now to improve the community. Part four involves a community forum during which students work in groups to identify community problems, write proposals for change, and create a community song, story, and symbol. Student worksheets and a teacher's guide for conducting the forum are included. (AV)",

The document is presented in four chapters. Chapter I offers a geographical assessment of the world food problem. Major topics are energy and protein need, food excess and deficit, national diets, diet composition, and diet quantity. Chapter II compares food supply systems in developing and developed nations. Chapter III discusses  potential solutions to the world food problem based upon human adaptation of the environment, technology, equitable distribution within and among nations, and population control. The final chapter suggests creation of a world food policy based upon equitable distribution of food, changes in diet in industrialized areas, allocation of resources to developing areas, and creation of smaller, less energy intensive farms in industrialized agricultural systems.

It is most appropriate for use at the college level. Section one defines international tourism and identifies international, national, and regional organizations which promote and study tourism. International tourism involves movement of persons across international boundaries for purposes of recreation, business, education, or family reasons. Section two identifies literature about international tourism, much of which is by European geographers. These sources analyze spatial and locational factors affecting tourism, such as modes of transportation  and world patterns of tourist movements. Section three considers advantages and disadvantages of tourism on regional economy. Section four reviews the types of geographical studies which have been made about international tourism. Section five describes physical and cultural factors that influence the location of tourism. Among these are coastal and mountain areas, landscape attractions, hunting and fishing opportunities, urban or rural historical attractions, and sporting events. Section six explores the possibilities of international tourism as an applied field for geographers. A bibliography of 86 sources, many in foreign languages, concludes the document. (AV)",

The paper is intended predominately for use by citizens' groups as they study the legal and judicial components of land management legislation. It can also be used as resource material for college geography classes. The document is presented in five chapters. Chapter I reviews regulations affecting private land ownership, physical and spatial uses of land, location theory, and urban encroachment upon agricultural land. Chapter II examines local, state, and federal land use policies. Chapter III presents an overview of public land use control, acquisition, and regulation. Chapter IV discusses the  constitutional requirements which govern public zoning regulations, private property restrictions, building codes, and subdivision control. The final chapter describes and evaluates federal open space programs. The conclusion is that, although much important open land has been set aside for federal open space programs, benefits from the programs have been inequitably distributed and planning criteria have been inadequately defined.

Intended predominantly for college students of geography, graphic arts, and public communication, the resource paper should also be of general interest to informed citizens and map enthusiasts. The document is presented in six chapters. Chapter I discusses and defines major elements common to all maps--projection, scale and generalization, and symbolization. Chapter II addresses the process of cartographic communication and identifies factors which influence the successful transfer of a map's message from author to reader. Factors include the cartographer's data, intent, design, and reproduction process, and the reader's understanding, intelligence, biases, and perceptions. Chapter III  explores the relationship between map projections and effective communication and describes methods for constructing three nontraditional projections. Chapter IV examines methods for reducing complexity of mapped patterns. Topics discussed include choroplethic maps, classification errors, pattern and perception, cartographic correlation, and information overkill. Chapter V shows how map distortion can serve a variety of goals, such as route planning, data processing, advertising, advocacy, and research. The final chapter presents concluding remarks. A major conclusion is that both map reader and map author should strive to understand the process of cartographic communication. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Offered in response to a request by the National Science Foundation for information on how knowledge affects policy, the document investigates federal support of social research and development and evaluates the relevance of this research to social policy. Social research and development (R &amp; D) concerns the identification and solution of social problems. Major objectives of the report are to review the process by which R &amp; D policy and programs influence decision makers, determine major avenues of influence, and consider criteria for planning social R &amp; D. The document consists of six articles written by educators, researchers, a government official, and a law student. The first article cautions that no single yardstick can determine the usefulness of social R &amp; D in our  pluralistic society. The conclusion is that assessing usefulness project by project will produce too much superficial, secondary source research. The second article suggests that social R &amp; D should not be subject to tighter control by federal staff but should serve as an intellectual backdrop of ideas. The third article maintains that public commissions rarely make use of social science research, regardless of its quality. The fourth article suggests additional research into knowledge/policy linkages, closer coordination among social R &amp; D administrators, and better uses of funding. The fifth article recommends that researchers make more effort to maintain a constant flow of facts and interpretations to public policy makers. The final article discusses the use of social research in  courts of law. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Summaries of results are presented for student achievement on art exercises from a national art assessment program conducted during 1974-75. Two technical reports document the results of the national assessment. Exercise-by-exercise results are reported in the \"Art Technical Report: Exercise Volume\" (see TM 006 981). This report, a companion to the Exercise Volume, summarizes results across sets of exercises for various groups of students. The introduction explains how national percentages and differences from the national percentage were derived. Chapter one offers summary statistics on students' achievement on art knowledge exercises. Males' achievement levels were significantly higher than the national average. Blacks performed below the national level, and whites performed  slightly above it at all ages. Chapter two reviews affective response summary data. Questions on this part of the assessment dealt with students' attitudes toward art and their open-mindedness toward different styles of art. Whites showed slightly more positive responses than did blacks. In general, degree of participation in art activities influenced degree of positive responses. Chapter three shows a juxtaposition of achievement levels for art knowledge and art affective responses by age groups. For example, it is shown that at age nine, more males than females were positively oriented toward art, but neither males nor females performed significantly differently from the national average on art knowledge.

The three-part survey was the NACW's first step in encouraging and promoting appointments of racial and ethnic minority women to local and state women's commissions. Part one, presenting the ethnic and racial membership composition of current state, county, and municipal commissions, indicates that of the 64 responding commissions, minority women composed about 20% of the membership. Geographic influences on commission membership are also briefly noted. Part two of the survey sought information about general program activities of the commissions. A list of responses, showing the relative  frequency with which each activity was reported, indicates that \"employment\" and \"women and the law\" were most frequently reported, and \"housing\" was least. The last part of the survey asked specifically for a brief description of past, present, or planned activities affecting racial and ethnic minority women. Seven of the most frequently reported activities are mentioned along with the states, counties, and municipalities involved in each. A number of special comments taken from the questionnaires concludes the survey summary. Appendices include a copy of the questionnaire, a cover letter distributed with the questionnaire, and a list of currently active state, county, and municipal commissions. (BC)",

Forty-six five to eight year old students in an instructional program of prescriptive and exploratory components were observed, along with their two head teachers and one instructional aide. Two preplanned observation schedules were used to record frequencies of observed student and teacher behaviors in the ALE over a six-week period. Observational data provided explicit information about the nature  and patterns of teacher functions in the ALE, functions that may be divided into consultative and management facets. Analyses of teacher behavior patterns, instructional climate based on these behaviors, student behavior patterns and their relationship to classroom processes, and patterns of teacher interaction with students of different characteristics were undertaken. The analyses indicated that teachers do direct the ALE to help students become self-directed and self-evaluating. The data also suggested that contextual variables, such as size of instructional group and subject matter, do affect the teaching patterns and teacher pupil interaction. (MJB)",

It is suggested that planning for parent involvement requires a preliminary teacher workshop (setting goals, defining roles, and establishing program policies), and a parent-teacher workshop (defining student-directed focus, program needs, and activities). Actual parent involvement entails making individual plans, contacting volunteers, and encouraging participation. With the completion of these preliminary tasks, parent orientation to the program must be performed (including an examination of the school physical  plant, explaining parent role, pupil characteristics, classroom methods and materials, basic parent-behavior guidelines, and integration of the parent-volunteers into the classroom routine). General suggestions for program evaluation, activities for parents, and topics for the parent-teacher workshop are provided. Three essays on parent-volunteer programs are appended. (MJB)",

        "description":"The issue of control over entry into the teaching profession is discussed from the viewpoint of &quot;the profession,&quot; i.e., the term used by the National Education Association (NEA) to describe its membership. &quot;The profession&quot; includes primarily classroom teachers in grades K-12, but rarely administrators or higher education personnel outside of professional education. Professors of education are also generally excluded in the use of the term. Within the issue of entry control, three matters of concern to &quot;the profession&quot; and to institutions of higher education (IHEs) are examined: accreditation, certification, and control over components of the undergraduate program. The importance of entry control to &quot;the profession&quot; is discussed in light of the present teacher surplus. The role of  the NEA as a constituent member of the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and the gradual evolution of NCATE policy to reflect views of the NEA in regard to institutional accreditation are outlined. NEA activity in the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification and NEA development of a Model Teacher Standards and Licensure Act reflect involvement at the state level in teacher certification procedures. Proposals for control of key components of undergraduate teacher preparation programs, such as professional laboratory experiences, observation, and student teaching, represent NEA activity at the local level. The changing role of institutions of higher education (IHEs) and their constituent schools, colleges, and departments  of education are discussed in relation to NEA pressures in the three areas of accreditation, certification, and program control; responses that IHEs might make to these NEA pressures are explored, and the consequences of these responses (combating, ignoring, capitalizing) are examined.

Typically, developed courses have carefully-designed learning environment specifications, replicable instructional treatments, and well-proven achievement measures. A battery of questionnaires and rating scales concerning interests, activities, and attitudes including a locus of control scale were administered to college freshmen in eight courses. The full-time academic advisors of those students were administered an Advisor's Judgment Questionnaire to record their assessment of the students. A multiple correlation was computed for the prediction of course grades for 152 students using eight variables, which included the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT),  previous grade point average (GPA), and advisor judgment. The multiple correlation, without SAT or GPA, was only slightly lower using seven predictor variables. It was inferred that part of the valid variance in advisor judgment was gained in face-to-face meetings. Some recommendations for attending to additional information when advising students were made; it was suggested that the student's use of time and motivation for alternatives are also predictors of academic success.

Part I of the scale was emphasized in this report; it provides measures of independent functioning, physical development, economic activity, language development, number and time concepts, vocational activity, self-direction, reponsibility, and socialization. Reliability estimates were based on the total group including eight, ten, and twelve-year old children. Item  validity analysis was based on the discrimination between regular and special education groups, although it appears that the raters knew the group membership of the children at the time they made the ratings. The norms from this study were found to be similar to the original AAMD norms for this scale.

The results indicate: (1) The three-parameter model fit the test data better in all cases than did the one-parameter model. For simulation data sets, multi-factor data were less well fit than single-factor data. (2) The one-parameter model ability estimates shared more variance with the item responses than did the three-parameter model.

(4) The three-parameter model required larger samples for calibration than did the one-parameter model. (5) The ability estimates from  the two models correlated highly for most of the data sets.

The fit of these distributions were, with a few exceptions, good to excellent according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For a few relatively simple items, the two-parameter gamma distribution provided better fits. The three parameters of the Weibull distribution were as follows: the location parameter represents the theoretical minimum time required; the scale parameter is related to the mean; and the shape parameter (c) is related to two kinds of difficulty indices. It also appeared that the shape parameter was related to the degree of familiarity of the item and the degree of engagement or involvement of the test takers.  A function related to c was the conditional response rate, which is called the hazard rate in system-reliability literature. The c parameter was found to be sensitive to the conceptual difficulty of items that were equal according to traditional difficulty indices. An index was developed for the efficiency of lessons and this, too, was found to be related to the Weibull parameter. Finally, c was judged to be related to the optimal cutoff point for criterion-referenced tests. (Author/CTM)",

        "description":"Concern was expressed for the possible effects of testing Elementary Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title I students with norm-referenced tests that may be so difficult that many students will have scores in the chance range. The likelihood of such students obtaining equal scaled scores if they were tested with easier out-of-level tests was discussed. In this study, two groups of sixth grade students were each tested with two levels of the California Achievement Test. One group took Level 16, on-level, and Level 15, an out-of-level test, while the other group took Level 16 and Level 14. The results are presented in tables. The author concludes that out-of-level testing of low achievers is, at best, a limited solution or stopgap measure to the pressing instrumentation problems in  Title I evaluation. (CTM)",

        "description":"Student evaluations of teacher effectiveness have been accepted by instructors as helpful indicators of performance, but their validity and use in tenure and promotion decisions has been questioned by faculty. Students and instructors in 207 social science courses completed evaluations of instructional effectiveness at the conclusion of the semester. Each of the 65 participating faculty members designated the course in which his or her teaching had been the most and the least effective. The instuctors then evaluated their teaching in both courses. Instructor and student evaluations contained identical items, samples of which are appended. Faculty and students agreed upon six factors of teacher effectiveness: breadth of coverage, organization, group interaction, individual  interaction, instructor enthusiasm and learning/value. Factor analysis revealed that student and faculty agreement on evaluation factors was high. Student evaluation of the courses designiated most effective by instructors was higher on all scores. The median evaluation was the same for both groups. The study indicated that self-evaluation is beneficial to faculty, and that student evaluation of teaching effectiveness is a valid process worthy of faculty confidence. (Author/JAG)",

        "description":"Defining practical significance in program evaluations is a difficult measurement problem which can only be solved by an intimate familiarity with the measures on which effects are estimated and their content relationship to the program goals. Past attempts to provide general solutions to the size of effect problem have relied on standardized indices which can be estimated and reported without any knowledge of what was measured. Such efforts are viewed here as steps in the wrong direction. Instead, what is called for is a procedure whereby the content goals of the program, the content implied by a test, and the interrelationship between the two are made explicit. The procedure should investigate treatment-by-item interactions and at the same time, describe the measures used so  that persons other than the evaluator can reach their own decisions about practical significance. Analysis of the mathematics sections of four major intermediate level standardized tests (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Metropolitan Achievement Tests, Stanford Achievement Tests, and California Test of Basic Skills) with their taxonomies indicated rather substantial differences in content tested. It was clear that standardized tests are not well suited to the task of estimating item domain by treatment interactions. (Author/CTM)",

        "description":"To determine the relationship between 16 background variables and students' evaluations of instruction, a questionnaire was completed in 511 undergraduate courses at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. Student variables, including grade point average, class size, expected grade, and prior subject interest, rarely explained 10% of the variance in any student ratings and generally explained less than 5%. Different statistical techniques, however, suggested that 12% to 14% of the variance in the student ratings could be predicted by the set of background variables. The variables most important in predicting evaluations were prior subject interest, expected grade, workload/difficulty, and perhaps, percent taking course for interest only. Of these, prior subject  interest was the most important and was better interpreted as a variable affecting quality of education. Background variables did have a small relationship to the evaluations, but results argue against bias interpretation. Workload/difficulty was correlated in the opposite direction as would be expected from a bias effect. No single variable was related to a majority of the evaluation scores. The scores most likely to be biased (overall rating and instructor enthusiasm) were not the scores most related to the background variables. A sample summary of the instructor's rating, and the questionnaire are appended. (Author/JAG)",

A method is proposed for a particular situation: annual funding decisions for projects in a large grant program in vocational education. Outcome and predictive impact variables were ranked by three groups of decision makers on a pilot study. The groups included the Director of the State Department of Education division responsible for funding decisions, the supervisors who make funding decisions, and the supervisors from related bureaus who review and contribute to the decision making process. Statements concerning the impact of vocational education programs on students, employers, and the State Department of Education--to be used as program  evaluation criteria--were sorted into twelve outcome impact and nine predictive impact statements. Each statement was ranked and rated for importance by the decision makers. Results showed high agreement on the ranking and rating of outcome impact statements, and discrepancies on the predictive impact statements. A validation study has been designed. Evaluators can assist decision makers in identifying important outcomes; and in the process, define the decision to be made, the time when it is made, and the data required to link evaluation and decision making.

Sixty percent of the class planned to attend a post secondary education institution; 53 percent actually attended a college or school in October 1972; and one year later the figure was 46  percent. Of the seniors not planning to attend school, very few actually attended a post secondary institution the following fall. Four-year college continuance rates were very high, but continuance rates for those attending two-year colleges or vocational-technical schools were lower. Very few respondents made transitions from a non-post secondary education activity to post secondary education between October 1972 and October 1973. In October 1972, 40 percent had jobs while attending post secondary institutions. The data are presented according to six variables: high school curriculum, academic ability, socioeconomic status, race or ethnic group, sex and geographic region. (Author/BW)",

First, what is involved in implementing a competency-based graduation requirement? The first tasks are the specification of performance standards and the performance skill areas. Then, appropriate certification procedures can be selected, and their reliability and validity can be verified. The second area of concern is the effect of the new requirements on school practices. The curriculum may be narrowed to concentrate on the skills to be measured, the year of certification may influence curriculum development, and expectations for the students may decline. Options for in-depth study of a particular area may be limited, the focus may be shifted to the slow learner, and slow  learners may be discouraged from competing for a diploma. Teachers' organizations may react against the program, the amount of paperwork will increase, and the program may have a negative effect on staff morale. The third areas of concern are financial and legal aspects. The cost of the testing program and of increased remedial programs must be considered, and the probability of lawsuits is quite high. Though competency-based graduation requirements may be valuable, these potential negative effects must also be considered. (BW)",

A case involving conditions in Alabama's institutions is an example of the dehumanizing conditions to which this group is subject. In the landmark case, Wyatt Vs. Stickney, it was decided that institutionalized persons have a constitutional right to adequate care and treatment. The broader question however was whether the Department of Justice should become involved in other mental health cases. A situation involving the Willowbrook State  School for the Mentally Retarded in Staten Island, New York helped to decide this issue in favor of involvement. After these two cases of litigation, the Civil Rights Division was deluged with requests to intervene in ongoing cases or to initiate litigation against institutions. The Division is now actively involved in 22 cases in the mental health/retardation field. Involvement in prisons remains a controversial area of concern. (Author/AM)",

Seventy-five female undergraduates were assigned to an experimental program in which they received failure, success, or neutral feedback with regard to their performance on a digit symbol task. Contrary to prediction, success subjects set more realistic goals than control subjects and did not indicate less positive affect than controls. Also, failure subjects set less realistic goals, felt less confident about reading their goals, and felt worse about their performance than did  success subjects. These findings indicate that reactions to failure, but not reactions to success, interfered with female aspiration behavior. Rather than continuing to search out evidence for fear of success, it is concluded that greater attention should be given to factors, specific to women, that are associated with failure and fears of failure. Possible factors include lower expectations for occupational success and lack of defensiveness against negative feelings aroused by failure. (Author/AM)",

Eighty-eight white undergraduate women recruited from a state college in Connecticut were selected as subjects for the study. The experiment consisted of three parts: filling out an attitude questionnaire which included the 7 items used for the belief manipulation task, an irrelevant intervening task, and the belief similarity manipulation. Findings  indicate that dialect style is one important variable in interracial perception. (Author/AM)",

In order to improve verbal communication between these students, who are usually from middle class, standard English speaking backgrounds and ghetto residents who may speak nonstandard English, phonograph records and tapes of black English are played in the classroom. Dramatizations and readings from ethnic history are used to help students to understand the struggle of minority groups for basic  human rights.

The conclusions of the paper indicate that: (1) there are few if any conventions by which ambition is assessed, (2) the social psychological sources of differential ambition are at best suggested by an unsystematic empirical literature, and (3) in tightly controlled experimental situations, success and failure at  competitive tasks influence levels of ambition and are consequences of it. However, in the natural world, the successes and failures of persons are more likely to result from events in their life cycles such as marriages, divorces, etc. than from their differential ambition to achieve in these competitive settings.

Since educational institutions serve a regulatory function, what goes on in schools mirrors the interests of the status quo in the society. Therefore the question facing educators and community people is not whether schools should reflect the society but rather: (1) What are the interests that educational institutions reflect? (2) What are the manifestations of that reflection? and (3) Can the society and its educational institutions transform themselves? American society is organized to represent the interests of a capitalistic ruling class and schools serve the interests of the ruling class. The manner in which they have accomplished  this purpose has changed as the demands of ruling class interests have altered. Teachers and schools can play a progressive role in transforming the society. The first task of the school as part of a community is to begin to make cultural criticism the basis of its curriculum and its instructional program. An examination of school policies and practices is filled with possibilities for curriculum development if teachers learn to use them. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The inconsistency in research investigations of the process of white flight is especially evident when social scientists become actors in the legal drama surrounding the desegregation of public schools. Social science &quot;experts&quot; for the contending litigants often present contradictory evidence. The resultant ambiguity allows judges and administrators to dismiss the utility of social science and rely on their own intuition of the social process. It is suggested that many of the empirical ambiguities concerning the causes and magnitude of white flight stem from the narrow policy focus of most recent research. By failing to place the process of white flight in a general theory of urban demographic change, researchers become susceptible to conclusions that encourage a simplistic  misidentification of a complex set of behaviors. Extensive reliance on aggregate measures of net change has increased the likelihood of misidentification. The advantages and shortcomings of several methods that permit a richer analysis of trends and determinants of deviations from trends are illustrated by utilizing longitudinal and cross sectional data from American cities. A policy research agenda is suggested, in the hope that a broader perspective will be adopted in future studies of the redistribution of metropolitan population, especially with regard to the role played by desegregation actions.

        "description":"Periodically, fears are voiced that the intelligence level of the United States population is falling. Historically, this fear has been linked to the belief that fertility is inversely related to intelligence. Evidence for that belief is sparse and may be an artifact of the failure of researchers to consider completed families. An inverse correlation between measures of intelligence and number of children in young samples may simply reflect differentials in timing and spacing of births, and not in ultimate family size. Drawing on data from only ever-married and relatively older men in the NBER-Thorndike and Kalamazoo Brothers samples, the authors of this paper find no inverse relationship between test scores and number of children. Since ever-marrieds are expected to show the  greatest negative relationship, these results are all the more telling. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"In an ethnographic study of three recently desegregated junior high schools, the pressures placed upon teachers by students in different academic tracks were analyzed. Students in each track were grouped homogeneously in terms of race, social class and academic performance. The methodology of this study consisted of utilizing students' responses to interview questions along with classroom observations. Though teachers' beliefs about educational goals and the proper character of the student teacher relationship varied significantly in these schools, there was as much variation in the behavior of the same teacher with different tracks as in the behavior of ideologically opposed teachers with the same track. Further, where desegregation was recent, teachers' ideologies showed  significant effects from the behavior and expectations of the socially homogeneous student bodies in the schools where they had taught before desegregation. A conclusion of this study is that when desegregation brings sudden and significant changes in not only the racial but also the social and academic attributes of students, the adjustments required of the faculty in both educational theory and daily practice are an important factor in the social changes which will occur in the school.

Within each of the groups, performance of various subgroups was examined, defined by sex, race, region of country, and parental education. The COD assessment measured performance in the major areas of knowledge and attitudes related to career planning, knowledge about jobs, and generally useful skills. Examination of the differences in average performance reveals that out-of-school 17-year-olds consistently perform less well than the in-school 17-year-olds. Differences in performance were greatest in the area of general  knowledge about jobs and in three of the generally useful skill areas: written communication, computation and measurement, and graphic and reference materials (the fourth area being manual/perceptual skills). Corresponding differences do not separate performances of 17-year-olds attending school and adults. Average percentages of these two groups were close to identical on the four generally useful skill areas.

        "description":"In 1974, as part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) survey in writing, 4,600 17-year-old high school students were asked to write an essay defending their position on women's place in the home. About half responded that it should be a women's choice whether to be a homemaker, career woman, or both. About twenty percent said women should be allowed to work under certain conditions, such as when they do not have children. Nearly thirty percent said women definitely belong at home. Predictably, more females than males felt that women should have a choice about working. In addition, attitudes and reasons given for staying at home were examined extensively. Findings suggest that many young American women are uncertain about their future roles in society; new and  broadening job opportunities for women are encouraging career aspirations that conflict directly with traditional values. Writing ability was also measured and classified as inadequate, barely adequate, competent, or excellent. More than half the 17-year-olds could write competently or better. About thirty percent, however, did not show an understanding of the basic methods of persuasive writing. (TA) Primary type of information provided by report: Results (Selective) (Sex).",

The Career Development Team developed and field tested a career checklist of questions for student use to (1) identify and analyze undergraduate career needs; (2) list available career resources; (3) match the career needs with the resources; and (4) order the phases and  steps in deciding to teach and becoming certified. Of the sixty students who evaluated the checklist in the field test half reacted favorably and 80% said they would use it if given a copy. The Curriculum Development Team concentrated on meeting the need for preservice and inservice experiences in career education and developed six course modules in career education which are offered for credit to students of the College; also they published a monograph of their articles about career education as a team function. Future projects for both teams involve participation of community leaders, and the Career Development Team plans to further test and implement its checklist's use. (Included are a history of career education at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and a draft of the  checklist.) (ELG)",

Six findings resulted from analysis of the empirical evidence: (1) the emphasis that young white women place on on-the-job training is positively related to their expected work attachment; (2) of the two types of training, specific and general, only the investment in general training is affected by future work expectations; (3) postschool investment in on-the-job training is a major factor in wages and wage growth among young women; (4) although  maturation plays an important role in wage growth, its importance declines with age, and its effect is smaller for women than men; (5) significant racial differences exist in wage determination; and (6) young women tend to underestimate the length of their future work life, so some therefore may underinvest in on-the-job training. The incorrect expectations of women regarding the extent of their participation in the labor force were found to account in part for the existing gap between female and male wages. (ELG)",

The findings include the following: for the most part, labor force participation rates for white women of all ages and marital statuses increased while declining patterns of participation were noted for most of the black groups; for white older women (35 to 44 years old), the most notable increases in work participation were among women who were either separated or divorced while the sharpest declines for black women  were also for this same marital category; and overall, participation of black women in the work force is lessening in comparison to white women but those black women who continue to work appear to be relatively successful. The data suggests that there is a large pool of nonworkers who are willing to work (1) if the proper conditions for employment exist, (2) if appropriate guidance, skill training, and other assistance are made available, and (3) if jobs become available.

Findings were reported on students' perceptions of their correctional vocational program, post release employment and educational experiences, and general problem areas encountered during the post-release adjustment period. Major findings indicated the following: (1) overall student impressions of the quality of correctional vocational training were favorable; (2)  unemployment rates for both youth and adults were high; (3) few obtained a job in the same or related field of training; (4) enrollment in an educational institution after release was low; (5) and &quot;lack of job&quot; and &quot;lack of money&quot; were the most frequently cited post-release problems.

Based on this position, a developmental effort was proposed to (1) build a rationale for a practical arts component of the junior high/middle school curriculum and (2) outline a school program of practical arts related to the fields of agriculture, home and family living, health, industry, business and office, and distribution. The  activities included the development of a position paper stating the underlying philosophy of practical arts education, and the projection of a detailed plan to deliver a modern practical arts program. Selected formative and summative evaluation techniques were employed to assess the adequacy of the underlying rationale for the program and of the structure of the program. Selected leaders in education assisted in this assessment. The program rationale that resulted is intended to provide a blueprint for major redesign of schooling in the United States.

Conclusions listed include the following: PA-DRs devoted a high percentage of their time to activities which were in keeping with their training; their employment by a radiologist is financially worthwhile; the PA-DRs's on the average saved thirty-four percent of a radiologist's time; and their acceptability by professional colleagues remarkably high. The statement of overall assessment is that the activities of PA-DRs improved the utilization of radiologic manpower. Data tables and the rating report are appended. (VB)",

Starting with the easiest opportunities that do not require any specialized knowledge since their sales activities resemble those with regular customers, part 1 deals with selling to companies in the U.S. who, in turn, ship or resell goods to foreign customers. Twelve marketing possibilities are given in this category, and sources for other buyers are suggested. Part 2 serves as a guide for manufacturers wishing to develop their own expertise in exporting. Three levels of involvement are recognized in this  stage: (1) direct response to inquiries or leads from foreign customers, requiring quotations, shipment of goods, and methods of payment; (2) establishing a regular sales effort in conjunction with a marketing plan detailing the choice of countries, marketing tactics, and export budget; and (3) developing export momentum which demands a large cash commitment, travel, and the hiring of export specialists. As an alternative to direct exporting, part 3 explores the use of an export management company (EC), giving the pros and cons and suggesting how to develop an effective relationship with an EMC. Throughout the three parts, the minority entrepreneur is discussed with emphasis on the specific advantages and disadvantages of this particular situation. (ELG)",

Because timing is a critical factor in the success of a project, the suggested activities with each audience are discussed in relation to three phases of a project: pre-grant period, grant period, and post-grant period. In summary, a list is provided of eight suggested guidelines for project directors as they implement a demonstration project. (VB)",

        "description":"During 1973, a nationwide study for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was conducted which provided information on nutrition knowledge, beliefs about nutrition, and first reactions to nutrition labeling among food shoppers. This initial research provided a baseline measurement of nutrition knowledge and attitudes among consumers, and in 1975 another nationwide study was conducted. Conducted in two phases, part 1 of the 1975 study consisted of a national survey using data collection instruments which had been revised and refined from the 1973 study. The findings of the survey were reported in the following four categories: nutrition knowledge and information; opinions about food and nutrition; nutrition labeling and open dating; and other food-related beliefs and household  practices. Part 2 of the study consisted of a panel study which examined the formation, change, and development of attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about nutrition. To study the changes, data were gathered again from a sample of people who had participated in the 1973 study. For each of the four categories previously listed, the findings were reported by both gross changes (proportion of shoppers responding in different ways in 1973 and 1975) and net changes (differences between the two figures). (Preceding the reports of this study are two related articles taken from the &quot;FDA Consumer.&quot;) (BM)",

        "description":"This paper reviews thirty national and state studies recently conducted on the needs and interests of adult learners in the United States. The paper also highlights a number of questions and issues raised by the nature of the studies themselves. Issues identified as needing further research and thought follow. (1) There are no reliable, precise figures on the present number of adults involved in organized adult learning activities, nor any reliable means of predicting future numbers. (2) Privileged classes are overrepresented in organized adult learning. (3) Participation begins to decline in the thirties and drops off sharply after fifty-five. (4) Though some information is available, it is increasingly doubtful that there is an ethnic minority profile of educational needs and  interests. (5) The rate of participation in organized learning activities is about the same for women as for men, but educational needs in terms of life style differences require attention (e.g., interests of employed women versus those of full-time housewives). (6) The degree of educational attainment is directly related to future educational involvement. (7) Regional differences in participation exist, with the West exceeding the national average. Generally, it is reported that barriers deterring adults from participation in adult education are situational (time, money, etc.), dispositional (attitudes, self-confidence, etc.), and institutional (location, expenses, etc.). Much more study of the motivational factors affecting adult participation in learning activities is recommended.  (VB)",

Six major questions were addressed: (1) What differences there were in the use of the WIN and welfare tax credits? (2) To what degree were employment tax credits a factor in employer decisions to hire WIN and welfare participants? (3) What features of each tax credit either contributed to or inhibited its use? (4) Was the program cost beneficial? (5) What are the implications of the study findings for legislation, policy, program design and operation? and (6) How can the program be changed to increase its use and make it more cost beneficial?  The findings include the following: neither employment tax credit is extensively used but, of the two, the WIN tax credit is used more frequently; only eleven percent of the respondents who received tax credit certifications stated that the WIN tax credit was an important factor in their hiring decisions; the degree of tax credit utilization was often related to the overall economic health of the community; businesses became informed of the tax credit primarily through local WIN and Employment Service efforts; the emphasis which WIN job developers placed on the tax credit influenced how often it was utilized; and the WIN tax credit is a cost-effective approach for promoting WIN hires among employers who are aware of their eligibility for a tax credit.

Health evaluations of referred welfare clients showed that the commonest health related problems were hypochondriasis, neuroses, obesity, and alcoholism. Clients with remediable health problems were randomly assigned to health intervention and control groups. The health rehabilitation received by those in the intervention group decreased the number of health complaints and reversed hypochondriasis. In addition to other positive findings, welfare grant reduction was substantially greater for  intervention than control clients. A series of surveys were conducted to assist in evaluating the project and developing the demonstration model. Finally, the demonstration model was proposed, specifying target population, modes of delivery, staffing, staff training and tasks, location of staff, administrative pattern, process and implementation.

The second paper analyzes the implications of the developmental characteristics of youth for CEWC and the career education (CE) programs they might be expected to sponsor; questions selected career education assumptions about youth (e.g., high unemployment and inadequate work-socialization); and discusses the implications for CEWCs and CE programs affecting youth school-to-work transitions. The third paper identifies the crucial issues pertaining to establishment of CEWCs, establishes categories of past and current efforts in improving school-to-work transitions, presents outcomes and problems associated with each type of council, and discusses the major ideas and assumptions underlying the establishment of CEWCs.

        "description":"To evaluate the accuracy of the 1970 census' occupational classification system, a comparison was made between that year's responses to census questions and the replies by the same population group to the 1972 Postcensal Manpower Survey (PMS). Each of these questionnaires relied on a different methodology; in the PMS the respondent classified himself directly while in the census a clerical coder translated the individual's response into an occupation category. The study sample consisting of 34,938 participants was chosen from the engineering, scientific, and technical fields. Mismatches were found in 19,620 cases, and were ascribed to the following causes: coding or processing errors, structural or methodological differences, and insufficient or conflicting answers.  Recommendations made to improve the census classification system included the following: (1) coders should read all the answers in the occupational section before making an assignment; (2) use of the lowest-code rule should be examined; (3) certain occupational titles need to be more clearly defined; (4) responses indicating dual occupations should be placed in a residual category, not assigned to one of the two fields; and (5) more occupational titles should be added to the list. Three recommendations for PMS were proposed: the present categorization of university or college teachers of engineering or science should be changed, examples of appropriate occupational titles should be given for each PMS category, and an investigation should be made into respondents' use of residual  categories.

        "description":"A study (based on data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience) was conducted to determine the causes and consequences for women of leaving high school before completion. Four factors (race, school leaving, motherhood, and employment status) were explored by comparing data obtained annually between 1968 and 1973 for 5,000 women, consisting of both dropouts and graduates. The findings indicated (1) that pregnancy and childbirth are the causes of premature school leaving; (2) that the presence of a child prevents many women from finding meaningful work at a reasonable salary and from taking formal training programs; (3) that dropouts are less likely to have had extensive employment experiences before leaving school and to possess the skills employers need  and therefore suffer from higher unemployment rates than graduates; (4) that because of their limited skills and experience, dropouts demand lower salaries than graduates, and welfare then becomes the only viable alternative for them, especially if child care responsibilities are involved; (5) that black women more strongly feel the economic need for further training and are more interested in returning to school; (6) that blacks do not earn as much as white women regardless of their previous work experience; and (7) that black women who have young children are more likely to be on welfare. Due to a decline in the birth rate, an increase in the number of women completing high school, and the recommended increase in availability of birth control measures for teenagers, the future number of  female dropouts and the problems they encounter were seen as steadily declining.

The study examined data on women who had experienced a disruption before 1967 and were not remarried by 1972 and on women whose marriages ended between 1967 and 1972. The study found that most women had been married for ten to twenty years and had children at home when their marriages ended. The end of the marriage was related to a decline in the average economic welfare of the families involved. About 40% of all white women who did not remarry over the seven-year period were poor at least once; probably 15 to 20% were  continually poor or close to poverty. The situation was found to be far worse with black women. At any one time, 55 to 60% of the sample studied were poor by standard definition. At least 45% of black women were poor during most of the period covered by the interviews. Nearly two-thirds of the women who were not poor (from both racial groups) depended primarily upon their own earnings. The results of the survey indicated that special legislation to provide counseling and training programs for displaced homemakers is warranted. The report concluded, however, that proposed legislation defined \"displaced homemaker\" too narrowly to benefit all who need assistance. (BM)",

The nine mannerisms treated were abstracted from the studies of Neugarten and Reichard. The research sample was selected from the members of the Gerontological Society. Six forms of the final research instrument were created, each containing three of the nine behavioral mannerisms. Each mannerism appeared on two of the six forms. Combinations of any two stereotypes appeared only once in the six forms. The sample was asked to: (1) estimate the percentages of the elderly population that could be described by the three stereotypes, (2) recommend the best way to attain rapport with and resolve the problems of each  group, and (3) suggest motivating appeals for making changes. Regardless of type of behavior senior citizens exhibited, there were three universal rules that the gerontologists laid down for the rapport and counseling process. (1) Individual people deserve individual attention. (2) Every person, irrespective of state of mind or background, must be treated with dignity and respect. (3) Listen, observe and empathize before making suggestions. Recommendations for each of the mannerisms are presented. (Author)",

Improper conceptualization and consequent operationalization of the social class dimension is considered to be the most serious contributor to the inconsistent findings. A more appropriate Underclass/ Earning Class model of stratification is suggested. Although no empirical support was found for a relationship between commonly employed socioeconomic status (SES) of father's occupation and self-reported delinquent behavior, indications are that social class is slightly more related to self-reported delinquency using the underclass/earning class model. However, there appears to be no reason to expect social  class to emerge as a major correlate of delinquent behavior no matter how class is measured. (Author)",

Although none of these studies are as rigorous as one might wish and many of them are merely case studies, a review of the literature shows that behavioral marital therapy in combination with social and vocational behavioral alcoholism treatment produces better results with State Hospital alcoholics than does a less intensive traditional alcoholism treatment. When intensity of treatment is held constant, behavioral marital therapy for outpatient alcoholics is not only superior to three alternative behavioral treatments but clearly exceeds the outcome statistics in the nonbehavioral literature. With  the exception of a study treating only the wife, behavioral marital therapy has had positive results in 29 of 31 cases treated. A series of issues and questions future studies should address are listed. In addition, a study to compare behavioral and non-behavioral couples groups is proposed. (Author)",

One result has been the development of a treatment program in which parents are trained to alter their child's behavior. That program has been evaluated on three separate samples of aggressive children. Those tests, however, were conducted with treatment performed by the research staff. The paper reports on the current work in implementing that program in three real-world mental health agencies and evaluating its effectiveness with agency families. The current evaluation includes the following: (a) an analysis of the competence of the social learning-trained therapists in conducting the program; (b) random assignment of client families to  either a social learning-trained therapist or a member of the staff not trained; (c) multiple measures of client outcome including in-home observations of the child and his family using an observation system of demonstrated reliability; (d) other measures include parental symptom reports, and questionnaires from therapists, parents, teachers, referral agents, and physicians; and (e) one year posttreatment follow-up. The article gives further description of the treatment program and the evaluation strategy. (Author)",

Subjects were 736 students. The \"Student Evaluation of Student Services Questionnaire,\" devised by the investigator, was utilized. Results indicate that students in attendance during  both the 1975-76 and the 1976-77 academic years received \"satisfactory\" services both years.

This study tested the prediction that open classrooms provide children at the lower end of the physiological arousal continuum with enough external stimulation to reduce their overt seeking of stimulation. The reduced level of external stimulation in traditional classrooms was predicted to be more suitable for high arousal children. Subjects were 98 children in three open and three traditional classrooms. They were observed and tested on both physiological and performance measures at the beginning and end of their first year of school. Results indicated that observers and teachers identified behavior problems more readily in traditional  classrooms, with clearly differentiated norms, than in open classrooms, in which a wider range of behavior is tolerated. On a measure of concentration, children in the open classrooms took longer to complete the task and made fewer errors at both times of testing. Data analyzed for subgroups of children representing extremes of the arousal level continuum revealed an interesting pattern: high arousal children showed performance decrements over time in the open classroom environment, as predicted by Farley's theory.

Longitudinal stability of locus of control in the face of particular changes in social milieu common during the transition from middle to late life was contrasted with that of verbal intelligence, a known stable characteristic, and that of affect balance, a mood indicator which is more influenced by changes in individual circumstances. Longitudinal data from the Duke Adaptation Study, in which 171 men and 174 women who initially ranged in age from 46 to 69 years were tested four times over an eight-year period, were used to estimate a separate path analytic model for each sex. While stability of locus of control across time is intermediate between verbal intelligence and  affect balance, at all assessments it is closer in magnitude to affect balance. Cross wave coefficients of locus of control and affect balance are consistently smaller for women than for men, which is partially due to a greater sensitivity among women to changes in past and current social milieu. Results identify a differential nature of locus of control. (Author)",

Analysis by age groups did not indicate any developmental trends in these associations.

Higher incidence of adolescent parenting occurred among blacks, low socioeconomic status, and low ability groups. Consequences were observed in terms of various life circumstances and each individual's status on an empirically-derived set of 15 factors defining quality of life. The many negative consequences resulting from young parenthood made it clear that programs to assist young parents must be initiated and maintained. Specific recommendations  include, first, offering counseling or courses in sex education and family living; and second, developing programs to allow and encourage young parents to continue their education.

A single subject design using back to baseline reversals was used to test the effectiveness of each intervention.

Preliminary evidence from the study indicates that many of the values or needs related to marriage, parenthood and occupations may be evaluated similarly by males and females.

Fewer are living with both their parents and a growing share live with the mother only. These trends point toward a shift away from family stability. Similar changes have occurred among both races, but the shifts have been greater among blacks. Racial differences on indicators of family stability are now larger than at previous dates.  The changes in family structure which are revealed by the demographic data imply a shift away from a family system which appeared to maximize the economic well-being of women and children, and toward one which minimizes their economic well-being but maximizes that of men.

However, over the years the training of users has not kept pace with the development of materials and methods of dissemination. The purpose of the Occupational Information Dissemination Project was to study the current status of the use of occupational information and to recommend ways of improving training at both the pre-service and in-service levels. Thus users can become better informed about the existence of current and future materials and their importance in helping students make the transition from school to  work. The project was divided into three phases: planning, data collection, and analysis of data and preparation of report. Major efforts were made to maximize personal contacts with those knowledgeable in the area of occupational information, to collect data from users in fields concerning their pre-service and in-service training experiences, to review related literature, to draw implications, and to make recommendations for improving training and dissemination of occupational information.

The development of the Social Problem Solving program (SPS) is discussed. The following stages are included: entry into the school system, needs assessment, building of a research team, securing permission of the ethics committees and parents, development of curriculum, training of teachers, development of assessment tools, and classroom training sessions. Further discussion identifies the systems which have been linked with the project and relates the strategies and rationale for the linkages. These systems include the families of the students, the school psychology system,  the teaching and administrative staff, and linkages with the university staff and students. (Author)",

In initial evaluation, word recognition scores should reflect only errors of insertions, omissions, mispronunciations, substitiutions, unkown words, and transpositions; symptomatic behavior should not be considered. After the student has read, comprehension questions should be asked on a literal level, on implicit understanding, on vocabulary, and on evaluative skill; all should be wholly context dependent. Baseline criteria for determining unsatisfactory reading should be established in comprehension, word recognition, and symptomatic behavior; comprehension is the most  significant in determining placement. The initial task of the IRI is to place the student at his reading level; this decision is first made on the basis of quantitative data, then an error analysis gives qualitative information. Placement precedes analysis, but both are necessary for effective reading diagnosis and placement. (DF)",

The GAP tests requires the reader to supply words deleted from a passage of continuous prose. Deletions were selected from words shown to be totally redundant from experiments with fluent readers (628 education students at Kedron Teacher's College, Australia, who were given copies of 192 different Test forms). Further experimentation was conducted with 5,505 students, grades 2-12, which showed that even when prose passages of quite high readability (difficult reading) were used in cloze-type tests, discriminatory power  deteriorated in children aged 11-12 years when words whose redundancy was virtually 100% (totally unambiguous to fluent readers) were selected for deletion. Further research indicated that if words were deleted whose estimated redundancies were less than 100%, discrimination between readers was maintained up to ages 16-17 years.

Four projects based on concepts from the audread model are an experimental evaluation of the extent to which first grade students learn to read their own and their peers' spoken language, the development of an experimental test for measuring adults' auding/reading comprehension abilities (decoding skills), a program designed to improve the oracy skills of primary school children, and a job-related literacy training program for adults. Analysis of these projects shows how the audread model affects  them first by suggesting relationships among skills to be explored, and then by constraining the decisions related to content, sequence, and modality in evaluation and instruction.

The paper considers three theses: rapid word recognition, which is essential for competent reading, depends on internalized (automatic) strategies that use the principle of orthographic regularity; phonics instruction, because of its emphasis on regular letter-sound associations, draws attention to the orthographically regular features of printed English words; and the instructional practice of separating certain irregular words helps the reader avoid generalizing from orthographically irregular sequences.  After showing what orthographic regularity is, how it relates to phonics instruction, and the evidence for claiming that it is essential to rapid word recognition, the paper concludes with the assertion that reading instruction must see to it that students acquire an awareness of othographic regularity.

The functions deal mainly with the analysis of typographical factors such as word shape, spacing, and orientation, but they also interact with contextual variables. The research interpreted in the paper proposes an attentional model of reading that begins with decoding graphemic information and ends with interpretation of contextual material. In essence, the model proposes that the more experience the beginning reader has, the more automatic become the successive stages of the reading process; with increasing experience or practice, the reader becomes more sensitive to word shape and spelling pattern shape, pays less attention to graphemic decoding skills, and focuses more  attention on the higher-order information processing stages.

After reviewing various approaches to teaching reading to learning disabled children, a new approach is proposed that combines task-analytic programing, applied behavioral analysis, and selective attention to certain skills. Task analysis discloses the fact that certain skills must be taught, most often correct phoneme responses to graphemes, responding in correct sequences, and blending separate sound units into one word; task analysis also reveals, however, that not all skills commonly included in  conventional teaching programs are essential to problem learners. The paper concludes that more than ever and especially for the learning disabled, teachers need to carefully match the type of instruction to the needs of the individual learner.

The failure to provide a contingent relationship between the given reading skill and student success in demonstrating the skill can lead to repeated apparent successes without the student actually manifesting the skill. Frequently, errorless progressions (shaping behavior) are used to establish heavily cued or prompted behavioral manifestations different from the desired terminal behavior; the cues are then gradually faded. Alternatively, a progression in complexity along the targeted behavior can be designed. Approaches to beginning reading differ principally in the nature of the progression used. The examples that are given indicate that  progression in the target behavior is usually the most effective approach. Hence, basic research on errorless learning provides a framework for an informed judgment on the relative merits of different approaches to beginning reading.

        "description":"An examination and evaluation of the papers presented at the Pittsburgh conference on the theory and practice of beginning reading instruction shows that there is little interaction between basic research in reading and applied work on reading instruction. Classroom instruction relies more on intuition and experience than on laboratory research, while laboratory research frequently bypasses the issues that are most important in applied reading instruction. The reason for the apparent division between applied work and experimental research in reading is that there is no effective theory of reading. Once an effective model of the reading process exists, reading research and practice will unite, and genuine progress will occur. (RL)",

The first issue concerned whether or not a reading problem existed in the United States, and reflected the difficulties in defining the terms illiteracy, literacy, and functional illiteracy. The second issue focused on the difficulties involved in providing just the right kind of reading instruction, including the design and implementation of a reading program and changes in programs to fit individual needs or  evidences of reading failure.

The project was begun in 1962 to find out if teachers could observe the process of learning to read going awry within a few months of the child's entry into school, and to seek ways of correcting that trend if observed. The data were collected in a longitudinal study design from six New Zealand schools. The data indicated that students developed self-limiting and self-improving reading behaviors, complex sets of hierarchically organized behaviors acquired over three to four years of graduated practice. The applications of ideas gained from this research took the form of inservice workshops to make teachers more sensitive observers of student reading  behaviors, helping the teachers to observe, analyze, and correct the students' reading strategies before self-limiting strategies would inhibit reading progress and lead to reading failure.

This gives children practice with the more concrete activities of word composition before they undertake the relatively abstract task of reading. Writing exercises may be given to children in order to provide background information and to show reading/writing applications in functional contexts. Another advantage to teaching reading with the child's written work is that when these children progress to reading, they will be prepared to take an active role in teaching themselves; the exposure to print helps them to answer most of their own questions and to correct their own mistakes.

By presupposing those linguistic factors in reading processes, research was conducted on linguistic awareness of phoneme segmentation, phonetic coding in short term memory, and the phonetic pattern of reading errors. Based on that research, suggested basic procedures for initial reading instruction include coordinated activities in reading, phonics, spelling, and handwriting and a sequence of instruction that starts with letter names and sounds, then helps  the child convert words from speech to print, and finally helps the child convert words from print to speech.

Although outside-in theorists clearly dominate both research and practice, their theories fail to account for such factors as intention, selectivity, prediction, and comprehension. On the other hand, so little is known about the functional information processing functions of the  brain that inside-out theories remain vague in their descriptions. The use of computers to simulate and test hypothesized language and thought processes has helped inside-out theories to a degree, but those computer assisted studies retain outside-in biases. Before the reading process can be understood--and effectively taught--further research must attack the inside/outside problem without the biases of either.

Subjects indicated whether a target letter appeared in a display consisting of three, four, or five letter words, pseudowords, and nonwords; the target letter was present in half the trials. The pattern of results obtained for the kindergarten students was different from the results for the other age groups; kindergarten pupils showed no different mean response times for  words, pseudowords, or nonwords, while all other groups showed ordered response times that increased from words to pseudowords to nonwords.

        "description":"Perceptual units are involved in the reading process in a particular way. Reading starts with patterns of visual perception visual stimuli in combination with either previously learned information or a strategy for selectively attending to part of the stimuli. Whether the visual pattern selected for deeper information processing is a letter, a spelling pattern, or a word group depends not only on the stimulus display (perceptual unit) but also on the dominant contextual mechanism. Research indicates that these mechanisms are driven by &quot;top-down&quot; hierarchical operations on patterns, phonological events, and semantic/syntactic events; the more sophisticated learning strategies are used for more sophisticated tasks to keep processing time at a minimum. Six models of processing  strategies have been used to explain the operations on perceptual units, and their interchangeability suggests that reading strategies specially for word recognition and decoding might be learned in sequence and then used for specific reading tasks. The way individuals learn to recognize the first perceptual units at the new processing levels (new contextual mechanisms) remains a difficult issue that has yet to be resolved.

        "description":"Two conflicting hypotheses exist regarding how oral reading behavior patterns follow from encounter with the text. One hypothesis views them as following decoding (decoding hypothesis), and the other sees them as occurring after comprehension processes have constructed a semantic representation of the message. These hypotheses are further differentiated by comparing &quot;word callers&quot; (decoders) to &quot;dialect speakers&quot; (comprehenders), two types of readers whose miscues seem to emphasize decoding or comprehending strategies. Three experiments were conducted to determine which theory is correct about oral reading. The experiments introduced specific alterations in texts to be read orally, and measured the oral reading errors that were made on the text surrounding the alterations. The  alterations were designed to monitor lexical access, syntactic/semantic integration, and intersentence integration. The results support either hypothesis, depending on the context, the type of material, and the type of reader. All three factors interact to determine whether decoding or comprehension requires more attention in reading diagnosis.

Within the constraints posed by the particular procedures used, instructional characteristics of reading programs were found to have an impact on reading achievement. The time spent in formal reading instruction is a particular variable that is likely to increase reading achievement. Specifically, the impact of time on achievement was greater for second graders than for sixth graders, for low socioeconomic status children than for middle or high  socioeconomic status children, and in compensatory rather than regular reading programs.

The instructional strategies in RU are analytic and inductive, while RS uses strategies that are mostly synthetic. While RU begins instruction with emphasis on syntactic/semantic information, RS starts with an emphasis on graphemic information and letter/sound correspondences. The two programs are compared in this paper in a systematic, simultaneous evaluation of how each program meets its stated objectives. The paper examines the scope, materials, extent of individualization, and the teaching,  learning, and testing procedures found in each program.

This paper discusses three reasons for the problem of teaching reading to these students. First, there exist no comprehensive developmental reading theories, no basic understanding of the reading acquisition process. Second, most innovations that occur in such reading instruction are merely reorganizational, teaching the same sets of skills in different ways. Finally, reading research and instruction have tended to focus on materials and methods rather than on instructional interchange between teacher and students in classroom situations. From the discussion of these failures to improve reading  instruction for blacks, the paper concludes that more research should take the form of classroom observation into the interaction behaviors and processes between teachers, disadvantaged black students, and instructional materials.

Of particular importance are skills in the recognition and manipulation of basic speech sounds, phonemes. The first of the program's three parts takes two and one-half months and consists of learning to recognize starting phonemes in words, recognizing letter shapes, and connecting the letter shapes with their phonemes. During the second part of the program, occupying approximately two or three weeks, children learn to blend phonemes into words, gaining practice in recognizing and manipulating phonemes in any position within a word. In the third part of the program, lasting through the remainder of  the school year, children meet stringent mastery standards for reading with comprehension and learn new words by means of the techniques developed in the first two stages of instruction.

Most bilingual instruction in the United States is based on either the &quot;native language approach&quot; (literacy is achieved in the child's native language first) or the direct method (the second language, at least initially, is the primary language of instruction). Another problem is that it is not clear how the successful transfer of reading skills occurs across two languages, or what factors are relevant to such transfer. Some alternate approaches to bilingual reading instruction (especially Spanish-English) include reading in the standard native  language, using dialect readers, and teaching reading in English but letting children use their native language in informal discussions among themselves. The fact that there is not a &quot;best&quot; teaching method in bilingual instruction, however, makes research in this area a clear necessity.

Basic research should focus on what constitutes good reading, which means that the type of research that will identify characteristics of good reading must be a detailed assessment of variable effects on reading behaviors (not whether &quot;x&quot; improves reading, but how &quot;x&quot; affects reading behavior). An example of good basic reading research concerns the relation of eye movements to reading behaviors. One model of eye movement control assumes little relation between eye movements and cognitive processes, postulating that good readers make rhythmic eye movements across the page and process information from one fixation during a later fixation. Research was conducted in which  visual display materials were manipulated in order to observe and carefully analyze the eye movements and changes in eye fixations of the subjects. This research contrasted with some of the assumptions made in the eye movement control model, showing the need for continued research in eye movements, and indicating how such research could be used to study skilled reading behavior.

        "description":"Recent research has confirmed that hemispheric patterns of dominance are related to reading skills. Reading is more complex than speech because it includes a visuo-spatial element. In the great majority of people, the left hemisphere deals with speech and sequencing skills. Visual matching of printed words requires the spatial skills of the right hemisphere. The skilled reader may go directly from visual word matching to meaning without the intervention of speech patterns. The young learner, however, must proceed step by step to link spoken words with written material. When lateralization is incomplete, mixed or reversed, a conflict occurs between hemisphere dominance and the direction of scanning, leading to the reversal of letters or even words. Many researchers support the  suggestion by Samuel Orton that poor readers often lack consistent patterns of dominance; an example is non-right-handed persons, who may have speech located in both hemispheres, making the normal visuo-spatial skills of the right hemisphere inadequate.

        "description":"In order to provide an estimate of encoding within the active mode and a comparison between three modes of representation (enactive, imagery, and verbal), 36 second grade children from the high socioeconomic community of Beverly Hills, California, were presented with object pairs under one of three conditions (haptic-object versus visual-object versus aural-label). The pairs were presented for old/new recognition response, and it was found that the children responded better to visual-object than to haptic-object and aural-label presentation. In a second experiment, 54 kindergarden children were presented single objects in the haptic-object mode of study, in order to assess retrieval from the enactive mode. Old/new recognition testing was conducted for objects presented in one of  three modes. The pattern of test mode performance suggested that each of the incongruent test conditions produced a decrement in performance relative to the congruent test mode; however, reliable differences between the test modes were not detected. The pattern of performance suggests that visual imagery is a more hospitable mode for the storage of concrete information than either the enactive or verbal, while the similarity of performance in the second experiment suggests that subjects were reasonably efficient at accessing information stored within the enactive mode.

Suggested activities include having students reflect on their personal reading and write a fictional sketch about a favorite author; research a series author to discover the multi-author approach of the series books; compare older versions with newer revised books to uncover sexism, racism, and stereotypes; and discuss stilted dialogue, one dimensional characters, and formula writing. The study of the series books can be extended to include the serial dime novels of the 1800s with their heavy moralizing, poor characterization, and stunted  dialogue, or a historical approach to the author Horatio Alger and his rags-to-riches novels set in the later 1800s.

A short form, self report parent questionnaire was administered to 107 sets of parents whose children had been referred to a diagnostic center for reading disabilities. Results of the questionnaire indicated significant but low correlations between the parent attitude scores and the child's verbal intelligence and reading achievement. Both mothers and fathers rated reading as important for business and homemaking success, with more emphasis on reading for homemaking success. There were no consistent relationships between parental sex, age, occupation, or educational level,  and the perceived reading problems that occurred within the family. Further research that would include extended parent interviews is suggested. (Author/MAI)",

Also reviewed are the  standards of national and regional accrediting agencies and the present practices and future plans of the various states regarding the grant of associate degrees by proprietary schools. Recommendations call for the establishment of a non-academic degree entitled &quot;The Associate in Occupational Studies--(Area of Emphasis)&quot; and of a mechanism for approval of occupational degree proposals from accredited proprietary schools through the current licensing agency, the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.

The survey instrument was also designed to assess the educational interests of the community. Procedures used to develop the survey instrument included a review of the literature to identify concepts essential to good questionnaire design, identification of specific questions and procedures for questionnaire construction used in other community surveys,  input from local campus personnel, evaluation by an advisory committee, pilot-testing of the preliminary questionnaire and a retest to ascertain reliability of the instrument. As a result of the development process, a final questionnaire for use in a telephone survey was constructed.

The study aimed at ascertaining the extent of congruence between community-perceived needs and the needs identified by a core of community \"representatives\" (current and former students and Mexican American educators) who provide input for program planning and implementation. Four hundred and fifty surveys were completed by persons representing the total spectrum of the Hispanic community. Areas of concern in the survey were college goals, communication, counseling, and programs (on- and off-campus). Results of the survey showed a high degree of congruence among  respondents in terms of the perceived needs of the community; 70% rated two-thirds of the survey items as \"greatly\" or \"moderately\" needed. Additionally, it was found that, as the strength of group cultural identification increased, confirmation of the needs delineated by the representatives increased by increments of 10%. Overall, the highest needs expressed were for more community participation in goal setting, more emphasis on ethnic and cultural interests, more minority instructors, and improved counseling and communication related to employment, career planning, and development of self-confidence.

A survey of division faculty members was used to obtain a measurement of the organization and the leadership style of the chairperson. Results of the survey were fed back to the chairperson and members of the division through a series of departmental and division-wide meetings, thereby providing a basis for identifying problem areas and for developing action plans according to a set of internally identified priorities. Subsequent to  implementation of various action plans, a post-measurement of the organization and the chairperson and interviews with selected division members were made, with positive changes noted in the leadership behavior of the division chairperson. Although the changes were not found to be statistically significant, it was noted that short term interventions were effective and that additional organizational change occurred as various individuals within the division modeled some of the facilitative and problem-solving skills introduced in group meetings. A bibliography and selected interview excerpts are appended. (JDS)",

Responses were received from 131 institutions, a return rate of 33%. Over 85% of the responding institutions reported that they deliberately recruited part-time students, using a variety of methods such as newspaper and radio/television advertising, and mailings; fewer than one-fifth of the respondents provided special orientation programs for part-time students; approximately  half of the colleges provided counseling services, although only 7% had counselors who served only part-time students; less than 20% had financial aid programs exclusively for part-time students; and two-thirds of the colleges charged part-timers activity fees, although such students were not entitled to participate in intercollegiate athletics, which are largely supported by such fees. It was concluded that part-time students were welcome customers but were not accorded much attention or service by their institutions. Recommendations to improve college services to part-time students and a list of institutions participating in the survey are included. (JDS)",

Employers (n=172) of 217 graduates were contracted by means of a questionnaire and asked to evaluate the effectiveness of community college programs in preparing graduates for work, to suggest how the colleges might improve their programs, and to relate their priorities regarding the importance of skills, attitudes and knowledge in preparing students for employment. Data analysis  indicated: (1) 78% of the employers felt the colleges to be doing a satisfactory or good job in preparing students for employment; (2) top priority in community college education for employment was given to inculcation of positive work attitudes and habits, and effective human relations; (3) concern for improvement in basic skills was expressed by approximately one-fourth of the employers; and (4) the personal attributes of graduates were given generally higher ratings by employers than were general occupational knowledge, basic skills, and judgement and creativity.

Although final decision on admission still rests with the receiving institution, eleven of the fifteen senior public institutions in Virginia have formal policies regarding community college transfer students which are published for students in handbook or guide form. The remaining four institutions also have written policies and procedures governing transfer admission although these policies are not specifically directed to the Virginia Community College System. Six regional consortia within the state supplement the policies and procedures of their participating members and serve to coordinate interinstitutional matters, including articulation. These consortia guidelines are in  turn supplemented by those of the State Council of Higher Education. Articulation in Virginia has, overall, followed the national norm, and in many instances is more advanced than in other states. Although obtaining the Associate degree is recommended by senior institutions to students wishing to transfer, the general policy is to evaluate each course taken to determine its transferability. Two tables of statistics on transfer applications and acceptances are included in the report, and Virginia articulation guidelines and a brief listing of state articulation agreements throughout the nation are appended.

Program offerings and enrollments were determined through a survey of state vocational-technical schools, community colleges, four-year colleges and universities offering Associate degree programs, proprietary business schools, and other specialized private and public institutions and agencies operating under a variety of licensure requirements. On-the-job training programs and manpower requirements of major state employers were surveyed, and a legislative review was undertaken. Program availability and participation were found to be good, and financial aid opportunities were widely  available. However, governance was fragmented througout a multiplicity of responsible state agencies and licensing boards operating through no less than 15 different chapters of the Kentucky Revised Statutes. It was recommended that a central agency be established to provide comprehensive statewide planning and coordination. Survey findings, an occupational program inventory, a review of the legislative authority of the various governing agencies and boards, and a review of previous steps toward statewide coordination are included in the report.

        "description":"While the use of the lecture method of instructional delivery is recognized as important and valuable, teaching must be directed beyond mere content in order that students can develop other skills that transcend the boundaries of a given course. Small discussion groups in an American Government course, used as a supplement to lecture-based instruction, may be effective in facilitating development of students' oral communications, their ability to analyze and evaluate critically, their capacity to identify relationships between phenomena, and their ability to use people as legitimate sources of information. Discussion groups should be composed of the most diverse members of a class, rather than those who are most similar. The cohesiveness of each group is important to the  efficiency of information-sharing; groups must remain intact throughout the course and should not exceed twelve members. Activities which have been found useful in the context of a class in American Government include &quot;brainstorming&quot; and &quot;consensus-seeking&quot;. Through these exercises, group members gain appreciation for both the processes and substance of group decision-making and interaction and develop skills in interpersonal relationships. Techniques for building and utilizing information-sharing groups in the classroom, suggested group activities, and evaluation data for a course conducted by this method compared to a traditional lecture course are presented.

Responses were obtained from 74% of those surveyed. Subsequent data analysis indicated: (1) matriculated students were more likely than special students to have educational goals involving degrees or certificates although over a third of each group had goals inconsistent with their status; (2) approximately one-third of special students were seeking degrees and were therefore misclassified by the institution; (3) one in five students were unaware of their status; (4) overlap of goals between matriculated and non-matriculated students included  approximately 60% of non-matriculated students and 46% of matriculated students; and (5) overall, students exhibited considerable confusion concerning the nature and uses of the curriculum classification system. These results showed that official enrollment reports by curriculum and program would be misleading and of limited value for purposes of program planning, evaluation, and resource allocation.

Data are based on analyses of videotapes showing face-to-face interaction of five healthy first born infants with their mothers and fathers. The interaction of infants with fathers as well as mothers is a reciprocal and jointly regulated process. Differences between mother-infant and father-infant interaction exist in the quality of regulation and in the temporal structure and content of games parents and infants play. Mothers and infants engaged in more verbal play while fathers and infants played more rhythmic tapping games. These differences provide the anlage for different  functional tracks of development and together foster the development of a wider range of social skills than if only one pattern were available.

        "description":"This document on early characteristics of high and low achieving black children of low socioeconomic status is part of the ETS Head Start longitudinal study, Disadvantaged Children and Their First School Experiences. In the study reported here, intensive case studies were prepared for those study children who, on a 3rd-grade achievement test, were: (1) significantly above or below the average performance for children of similar ethnic or income status in basic reading and math skills; or (2) significantly deviant from the level predicted by their performance on a test of preacademic skills at age 4. It is suggested that the findings of this report are relevant to the current controversy regarding early identification and screening of preschool children. Intensive study of  observer ratings and test performances obtained during the age period 31/2-5 should indicate the extent to which assessment of cognitive, perceptual, affective and social functioning in preschool low income black children can serve to: (1) identify, early, those areas of functioning needing remediation; (2) suggest individualized modes of treatment; and (3) suggest early indices of gifted functioning. Included in the document are chapters on the sample, data collection and processing procedures, results and discussion, summary and conclusions. Appendices include measures used in 1969-74 child test batteries and a summary of data collection activities. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"This longitudinal study examines the early stages of language acquisition in four first-born infants from birth to two years. Selected aspects of vocal-verbal behavior exhibited by the children and their parents were examined. Home and laboratory recordings, diaries, interviews, and developmental observation were principal data sources. Substudies concentrating on the first 24 weeks of life included analyses of (1) fundamental frequency characteristics of nondistress vocalizations; (2) the evolution of prototype conversations; and (3) the perceptual and acoustic attributes of infant vocalization. The children displayed a rich and varied sound repertoire which seems to parallel changing aspects of evolving sensory-motor behaviors. Parent child-directed language appears to have  different functions depending on such factors as the child's developmental level and the parents' perception of abilities and preferences. Preliminary findings indicate that in-depth examination of small numbers of children in a variety of interactive and non-social settings (including the home) needs to begin within the first month of life so that a large body of data, available for repeated scrutiny, can be generated.

Subjects were 97 children 4-5 years of age in six preschool classes. The children were assigned as a class to one of the six training and control conditions. The four training conditions were: (1) role playing; (2) role playing plus empathy; (3) role playing plus empathy plus helping; and (4) prosocial television viewing. The two control conditions were: (1) neutral television viewing and (2) control-for-preschool experience. The training in all the conditions consisted of a half-hour session per day, five days a week for four weeks. The children were pre- and post-tested on tasks designed to assess empathy, cognitive role taking, social role taking,  overt helping, sharing, and cooperation. The results indicated that the most effective training programs were those in which the child received training in various cognitive and social aspects of role taking. However, findings also indicated that even simple observation of standard television programs in which the main characters displayed concern for others could be marginally effective in facilitating altruism.

Pre-school, kindergarten, first, third, and fifth grade children and college students judged which of two visually presented digits was numerically larger. Twelve individuals were tested at each grade level. Response latencies were collected. Children at all levels were successful on the task. Results indicated that response latencies were a function of the ratio of the digit sizes; the larger the ratio, the faster the decision could be made. The children's performance demonstrated that: (1) they know the ordered sequence of the digits (the basis of the ordinal property of number); and (2) that numbers later in the sequence represent a greater quantity. This understanding of the  quantitative basis of number is present even at an age when children do not understand the cardinal property of number symbols. It is argued that the ordinal number property and the understanding of the quantitative dimension which numbers represent form the psychological basis of the number concept. The results are discussed in terms of their relevance for early mathematics education. (Author/SB)",

There were two groups of subjects (training and control), all of whom had failed a horizontality pretest. In the pretest they were presented with outline pictures of tilted jars and asked to draw in a water line as it would look if the jars were half full of water. One week after the pretest, children in the training group were seen in individual sessions and again asked to anticipate the water line by drawing a line on outline pictures of straight-sided jars. Subjects were given explicit knowledge of results as well as  experience copying the actual water line. Results indicated a significant improvement for the training group which held to the follow-up posttest a week later. There was also transfer of training to a round-sided jar not used in training. Results are discussed in terms of Piaget's theoretical notions of assimilation and accommodation as related to explicit feedback and visual-motor practice. (Author/MS)",

A total of 20 second-graders and 16 sixth-graders were tested on a logic game in which winning depended on drawing correct conclusions from logical arguments and on using only the minimum amount of evidence necessary to reach such conclusions. Results indicated that younger subjects drew significantly more conclusions from circumstantial evidence and more often treated logically critical clues as indeterminate. Subjects at both grade levels showed a strong tendency to commit the fallacy of conversion, but older subjects showed improvement in response to  feedback. These results support Piagetian stage theory with respect to verbal reasoning. Younger subjects were seen as reasoning in an intuitive, factual manner, while older ones were seen as reasoning from a logical system, albeit a simplified system that erroneously treats conditional statements as reversible.

Major goals of the program are: (1) to prevent school failure through the early identification and remediation of developmental learning deficiencies and to integrate handicapped children into the regular school program; (2) to provide in-service training to selected early childhood and kindergarten teachers and aides employed by various school districts of New Mexico; and (3) to disseminate information concerning the program. Evaluation of the instructional activities  was based on a pre-posttest design (without a control group) using standardized tests which measured children's language development in Spanish and English, school readiness, and self-concept and personality development. In-service training and dissemination activities were subjectively evaluated using site-visits, observations, records, and self-reports by the staff. Findings of the follow-up study of former REPSAC students are reported in a separate study, not in this paper. Findings indicated that: (1) students made significant gains in language development in Spanish and English and in general school readiness; (2) students developed and/or maintained a positive self-concept and substantially developed in various dimensions of personality growth; and (3) in-service training program  objectives were achieved.

In each experiment, 40 same-sex pairs, half male and half female, were formed into dyadic groupings by combining lower- and middle-SES children into the four possible speaker-listener combinations. The task required one child to locate a toy car in a model city from the verbal description of another child. Task success depended on the efficiency of verbal communication of the pair. The listener was allowed to give feedback in the second experiment only. SES combination main effects were observed only for the number of errors made in Experiment 1, with the lower-SES-speaker, middle-SES-listener dyad making the most errors. Sex main  effects showed general superiority of the girls in the no-feedback experiment. Content analyses of speaker and listener messages revealed several sex by SES interactions in Experiment 2. Results indicate that a complex, concrete task of this kind elicits similar levels of communication efficiency in children of varying social background but suggest that different communication strategies may be employed toward the same end.

One of the questions being investigated was whether the move from a protected elementary school into a larger, more impersonal junior high affected children's self-image more negatively than did a move from 6th to 7th grade within the same school. Subjects were 798 children from 18 elementary schools who were interviewed privately once in 6th grade and a year later in 7th grade. There were three main school populations in the sample: (1) K-8 schools, (2) K-6/ junior high schools with comparable social characteristics, and (3) K-6 junior high schools which were predominately black. The interview consisted primarily of multiple choice  questions concerning self-esteem, social and school behavior. Results indicated that white girls scored lower in self-esteem than black girls or white and black boys. An analysis of the data comparing white students in K-8 schools with those in K-6/junior high programs indicated that girls moving into a junior high school were more likely to show low self-esteem than girls remaining in a K-8 system. Boys did not appear to be affected by school type. Maturation (as measured by the presence of menstruation), achievement scores and dating behavior also affected self-esteem in girls. Results are discussed. (SB)",

        "description":"This paper reports on a procedure designed to alter racial bias in preschool children. Sixty 5- and 6-year-old black and white children initially displaying baseline bias (as assessed with a modified version of the Preschool Racial Attitude Measure) were taught to respond neutrally by manipulating those cues related to social perception (i.e., facial cues, gestures, and contextual cues), rather than those cues associated with color of the stimulus figure. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a control group; (2) a training condition in which race was always an irrelevant cue in making responses; and (3) a training condition in which race was never an irrelevant cue in making responses. The present procedure significantly reduced bias (p &lt; .0005) and  increased the probability that evaluative decisions would be made only in the presence of appropriate social and contextual cues (p &lt; .0001). Critical variables identified as influencing results were those related to perceiving social cues rather than learning to ignore irrelevant cues (such as race) of the stimulus. Results also indicated that a significant number of black children displayed bias patterns distinctly different from those pro-white patterns evident in previous literature. At pretest, these subjects displayed predominantly pro-black and neutral bias patterns. Subsequent research is necessary to determine if these findings mark a trend of black children becoming more own-race oriented. (Author/SB)",

The program involves educationally deprived 3- and 4-year-olds in eight preschool centers located in Title I schools. A parent or significant caretaker of each child enrolled in the program must be able to participate by coming to the center with the child at least twice a month and by following through with learning activities brought to the home by a home visitor. Each center is staffed with a lead teacher and four paraprofessional home visitors. Each home visitor enrolls and serves from 15 to 18 children, visiting each family once a week (for a 45-minute session) and bringing her group to the center  once a week (for approximately four hours). The lead teacher is responsible for center administration, supervision of home visitors and conducting the center's classroom activities. Needs of each child are determined through administration of a locally developed diagnostic instrument, with activities designed to fit these needs. Two guidance counselors are assigned to the program, as well as a research specialist with responsibility for program evaluation. Measurement of program results confirms the need for an early childhood program. (Author/BF)",

        "description":"This paper reviews research findings which are contrary to or inconsistent with the view of early experience as a critical and often irreversible determinant of development. It is suggested that the increasing awareness of the value of a life span perspective is leading to major reevaluation of the role of early experience in development. The disproportionate emphasis on early experience is seen as resulting from: (1) an overreliance on linear, cummulative learning based models of development, which incorrectly equate learning with development; (2) a failure to separate historically and culturally rooted determinants of behavior and development from maturational factors and to distinguish species-specific from culture-specific determinants; (3) a failure to consider that the  interactional processes regulating one developmental dimension are not necessarily the same as for another dimension; and (4) a view of the life span that sees &quot;terminal status&quot; at age 18. It is concluded that a stage-based life-span model provides a more appropriate base for determining optimum intervention periods, for separating cohort and environmental determinants from maturational factors, for supporting a renewal of interest in development throughout the lifecycle, and for stressing the importance of developmental predictors having external as well as internal validity.

Two groups of twelve 8-year-olds and one group of twelve 13-year-olds participated. Each subject performed a compensatory tracking task and an auditory matching task, first alone and then timeshared. The 8- and 13-year-old baseline groups performed baseline trials on each task prior to timesharing trials. Each 8-year-old in the training group was randomly paired with a 13-year-old and given sufficient single task practice before timesharing to equate the 8- and 13-year-old pair members' baselines on both tasks. Results showed trained 8-year-olds to be indistinguishable from 13-year-olds in  timesharing, whereas the 8-year-old baseline group showed significantly greater decrements in timesharing and higher baseline scores on both tasks. These data provide support for the hypothesis that timeshared performance is directly related to level of baseline performance and indicate that once baseline differences are experimentally equated, no age differences in performance remain to be attributed to developmental differences in attentional processes.

        "description":"Peer modeling as a non-punitive disciplinary technique was examined in two studies assessing its effectiveness in increasing self-control of young children in the absence of an authority figure. The first study investigated the effect of observing the rule-following behavior of a peer model on the observing child's subsequent self-control. Preschool and 2nd and 3rd graders, individually exposed to a televised peer model shown resisting the temptation to play with prohibited toys, were found more likely to follow the rules than were subjects exposed to a control film on television that depicted no role-following model. A week later the children were again left with the prohibited toys. Although they were not reminded not to play with the toys nor re-exposed to the model,  experimental boys were much less likely not to touch the toys than were boys in the control group. The second study investigated the effect of having a young child serve as a rule-following model for other children on the model's own subsequent role-following. First and 2nd grade boys who believed they were to serve as televised models for other children violated rules to a significantly lesser degree than did those who did not expect to serve as models. It is cautioned that this sort of peer modeling has not been shown to be effective with all children. Disadvantaged children, for example, were not influenced by the experiences in the second study.

        "description":"This analysis of the structure of children's narratives deals with material gathered from 96 children, aged 3 1/2 to 9 1/2 years, in conversations about events in which they were personally involved. Elements of the narratives and the structural relationship of these elements are examined. Three elements are discerned: (1) chronological recapitulation of events; (2) orientation of the listener to the context of the narrative; and (3) an evaluation of the events which communicates the meaning of the narrator's experience. It was found that children in all ages were able to provide comprehensible, chronologically-ordered recapitulations of their experiences. All of the children provided extensive evaluation. There were no age differences in quantity of evaluation provided, but  older children used a greater variety of types of evaluation. Although children at all ages provided orientation to context, they did so increasingly with age. When the position of the three elements in the narratives was examined, orientation was found to be significantly clustered in the first part of the narratives (increasingly so with age) and evaluation significantly clustered at the end. When the timeline of the narration was compared with the timeline of the experience, three major patterns were seen, illustrating a developmental shift in how children of different ages verbally reconstruct their experiences. Narrative structure progresses from a &quot;leapfrogging&quot; pattern (frequent in 4-year-olds), through an &quot;ending at a high point&quot; pattern (frequent in 5-year-olds), and culminates  in a classic pattern in which the narrator builds up to a high point, dwells on that point by means of evaluation and orientation, and then resolves the action.

Subjects were 105 children attending one of two day care centers and their welfare families. Effects of three intervention and two nonintervention conditions were studied. The intervention conditions included two open ended approaches (one supportive, offering direct assistance, problem-solving and encouragement, the other interpretive, aimed at helping the parent understand the nature of his/her experience) and a problem oriented approach which focused on specific problem areas. The nonintervention control group conditions included families who had been offered treatment but could not utilize it and  families for whom social work services were not available. Children in intervention and control groups were matched for Stanford Binet I.Q. score, sex and age. Assessments were made (at 5, 12 and 24 months after entry in the program) of the parent-child relationship and the child's development, and parent-child and child factor scores were then intercorrelated. Results indicated that parents in all intervention programs (especially those in the open-ended interpretive group) had higher factor scores on being available, affectionate and communicative. Children in the open ended interpretive condition had higher I.Q. scores at 5 months and 24 months after entry into the program. Follow-up testing at the start of kindergarten and one year after families had left the program showed that  treatment children, especially the interpretive group, maintained the I.Q. level seen at the 6-week point, whereas the control groups showed a significant decline.

        "description":"A product of the Kansas Planning and Community Development (CD) Division within the Kansas Department of Economic Division, the Kansas CD Assistance Pilot Project was created to meet the more technical needs of small and principally rural communities (up to 20,000 in population). Funded from July 1, 1974 through October 31, 1975, the Project consisted of a three-man CD team of professional planners with diversified backgrounds who provided technical assistance to small communities and guidance to the Kansas Department of Economic Development re provision of a permanent technical assistance mechanism. During the project period, the Team responded to 33 different requests and became involved in 9 additional multi-community related projects. The Team also became involved in basic CD  research, conferences, and administrative concerns. In response to the need for a permanent decision making capacity in small communities, the Team developed the Community Development Procedural Model based on evaluation of the Programming Resources with Initiative for Development Effectiveness (PRIDE) program, literature concerning CD, and personal experience. The model incorporated a philosophy which coupled local initiative with outside expertise, aimed at community self-development, and included the following five phases: organization; research; goal formulation; planning; and action.

Using Native American field interviewers, the AIEP surveyed a 1.8% random sample of adults from 19 tribal groups representing 70% of the Indian population of Oklahoma. Respondents were asked questions regarding: social background (sex, age, occupation, etc.); tribal characteristics (tribal membership, blood quantum, etc.); educational attainment; and functional literacy (occupational knowledge and consumer, health, and legal literacy). Findings indicated: almost 20% of the Indian adults were not included in the 1970 Oklahoma census of American Indians; 36% of the respondents spoke their tribal language  and 32% preferred it to English; over 51% of the Indian adults had not completed high school; the illiteracy rate exceeded 20% in all areas, going to 42% in consumer literacy and 63% in general computation skills; 56.9% of the total Oklahoma adult Indians were functionally illiterate in one or more literacy areas, and 13.9% were literate in all literacy areas; illiteracy appeared to be reduced by high school equivalence programs and by continuing, vocational/technical and adult education programs; functional literacy correlated with the higher income levels.

Working in close conjunction with the Service was the Monitor Advocate whose duties included: insuring compliance with the court order; participating in on-site reviews, evaluations, and validations; and offering suggestions that would insure equity of service to all users of the Employment Service facilities. In 1976, a considerable number of rural residents commuted to adjacent urban and rural areas seeking and maintaining employment. The rural economy stopped its downward spiral as  overall employment increased and unemployment decreased. There were no important changes in agricultural mechanization or production techniques that had an appreciable effect on employment. Area Offices operated 55 out-reach operations in areas removed from the effective range of offices. Summarizing the 1976 accomplishments, this report presents data on: economic developments, employment and unemployment trends, family and regular hired workers, seasonal agricultural employment, community development, public relations, day-haul activities, composition of interstate farm migrants, commercial fisheries, and the production from the cotton, sugar cane, strawberry, tung nut, and rice agricultural areas.

        "description":"The first U.S. Pharmacopeia, issued in 1820, listed 296 substances of animal, mineral, or vegetable origin in its primary and secondary lists. Of these 130, nearly all of vegetable origin, represented drugs used by American Indians. The number grew at each decennial revision during the 19th century, though some drugs were listed only for a decade. About 220 drugs of Native American use were listed altogether in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary (which began in 1888) up to the present time. Although the number of such listings has declined since the advent of synthetic drugs about 1890, it is significant that 41 new substances of American Indian usage have become official since 1890. However, only 30 substances of Amerindian origin survived in the 17th revision of  the U.S. Pharmacopeia in 1965. These drugs were not always used in the same form by Indians and whites. In the preparation of drugs, whites have used processes, i.e., distillation, which were not known to the Indians. Moreover, Indian usage of remedies has not always corresponded with white usage. This paper presents a brief overview of some of the drugs borrowed by white medicine from the American Indians. These drugs have been grouped into: anesthetics, narcotics, and stimulant drugs; astringents; cathartics; childbirth medicines; febrifuges; vermifuges; emetics; poisons; antibiotics; diabetes remedy; and contraceptives.

Specifically, this statement contends &quot;H.R. 2664, as written, would be an amendment to Section 20 of the Indian Claims  Commission Act. The amendment provides private relief to the Sioux only&quot;, while all sections of the Act as originally enacted and as amended provide for the claims of all tribes equally. This statement recommends, therefore, that action on H.R. 2664 be deferred until the administration can complete a general study of ancient Indian claims and that if this recommendation is not accepted, the bill be modified as specified in this statement. Recommending deferment or specific modifications of H.R. 3377, this statement maintains that waiver of res judicata and collateral estoppel in all Indian claims would be so far reaching that Congress would want to establish this precedent only after most careful consideration.

        "description":"For every 100 Mexican Americans who enter elementary school, only 22.5 make it to college. Of these 22.5, only 5.4 graduate. The situation appears as bleak in the area of graduate studies. However, Chicano or Mexican American oriented groups at universities in the Southwest, often aided by outside groups, have been pushing for institutional changes to increase their enrollment and retention rates. This demand for rapid institutional changes is based on the assumption that &quot;evolutionary&quot; change will not result in a significant narrowing of the educational gap between Chicanos and Anglos. Universities faced with shrinking revenues, decreasing enrollments, and more direct control from legislators and trustees due to public pressure, have found it more and more difficult to comply  with the demands. However, efforts are being made--feeble in some institutions, strong in others--to increase the number of Chicano students. Courses which did not exist before are being offered; financial aid is being dispensed; and some supportive services have been established. Focusing on the problematic situation and the university's response to that challenge, this paper discusses the administration's philosophical orientation, admission-related activities (criteria, recruitment, orientation), financial aid, supportive services (counseling, advising, tutoring), and academic and non-academic activities.

In Bowman, information about the agencies was offered; transportation to and from the agencies was offered in Elloree; and in North, both were offered. Flyers from the agencies and specific releases presenting data in capsulate, simplified form were distributed to churches, civic and social organizations, and community centers in Bowman and North. Videotape film schedules were posted in businesses and public places where people congregated. Transportation notices,  posters, and announcements were distributed at strategic places in Elloree and North. A sample randomly selected from predominantly black neighborhoods in Bowman and North was also interviewed. It was found that transportation produced no effects while communication produced a significant, patterned effect for two of the five agencies. The additional survey revealed a marked discrepancy between agency use figures and reported use of agency services, and a dissatisfaction with the distribution of agency services. (NQ)",

The 1972 General Education Law instituted a new education system, &quot;fundamentally humanist in inspiration and genuinely democratic in vocation&quot;. Underlying the new system was the concept of lifelong education. In particularly underprivileged rural areas, special programs were provided to offset the adverse effects of socioeconomic, cultural, and nutritional deprivation during the early stages of a child's development. The &quot;Nucleos  Educativos Communales&quot; (NEC), the key element in the reform, incorporated all the educational services of the community and furnished the machinery by which the community could take its legitimate place in the educational process. Focusing on the NEC system, this publication examines the theory and practice of this educational reform and its relationships to other reforms. Discussed are the reform's philosophy and aims; innovative structures and reorientation; decentralization; the nuclear experiments; objectives and organizational structure; teaching staff; problems and solutions; and the educational centres at Villa el Salvador, Iscuchaca, and Imacita.

        "description":"The problem of primary education has existed for some time in both the western and eastern regions of the United Republic of Cameroon in Africa. It was generally accepted that the main reason for the poor performance of the education system was the insufficient training of the vast majority of primary school teachers. From the beginning, ENIR (Rurally Oriented Primary Teacher Training Institute) and later IPAR (Institute of Rurally Oriented Applied Education), the new and expanded version of ENIR, were designed as essential means of solving the problem. Their endeavour was to create a ruralized school directed toward meeting the economic and social needs of Cameroon. With an average rate of primary school enrollment of over 60%, the country was reaching a critical point beyond  which squandering of resources and failure to meet real needs would become hard to tolerate. If the system were to become too expensive to operate and too unrelated to the needs of society, the development envisaged under the third five-year plan, combined with the considerable demand for training which it created, would cause a dangerous situation in which the deficit would increase at the same rate as school attendance and very likely even faster. This paper examines the reasons which led to the emphasis on the ruralization of primary education, and hence, the training of teachers able to carry it out; identifies the agents, stages, and mechanisms of innovation; and gives a brief account of the operation and performance of the Cameroonian education system.

        "description":"Socioeconomic characteristics of settled-out Mexican American migrant farmworkers who were in the South Texas-based midwestern migrant stream were examined. By chain identification (each family identified 1 or 2 others), 27 subjects were located. These ex-migrants had, over the years, settled-out in and around a small city (population 40,000) in east central Wisconsin. Generally, they settled-out to enter wage work with little risk-reducing aid. These settled-out families had: a smaller number of children; greater facility in English; more formal education, including more high school graduates; substantially greater income without the child labor; and the willingness to sever supporting ties of kinship and friendship with other Chicanos. Since these characteristics suggested some  rather Anglicized Chicanos, 11 Chicano adolescents were interviewed to determine whether: submergence of ethnicity was necessary for comfortable adaptation to an Anglo sociocultural context, or any anti-Mexican prejudice was encountered in the community. Some generalizations which emerged were: the adolescents expressed little feeling of pride in, or knowledge of, La Raza or of Mexicanness, although one or both parents had been born in Mexico in 80% of the cases; Cesar Chavez was just a public figure to most of them; and they seemed to be aware of discrimination on a very low and subtle level, but attributed it to the individual's idiosyncracies, rather than a group trait of Anglos.

        "description":"The initial step in the evaluation of the Fort Gay-Thompson School Community Council's program was to establish baseline data prerequisite to measuring the change in the program's influence. Surveys were made of the typical program phases regarded as germane to evaluation. Thus, data were obtained on: pupils--enrollment trends, achievement levels, perceptions of school; staff-qualifications, experience, personal background, goals and needs as perceived by teachers, teaching strategies and classroom practices; program--pattern of course offerings, student services, and extra-curricular programs; school plants and facilities; and pupil transportation. These phases were not treated separately since their interrelationships were regarded as highly important. The students, teaching  and administrative staffs of the Fort Gay-Thompson schools, and the staffs of the District's central office, the School Community Council office, and the State Department of Education supplied the data. This report presents the baseline data. Among the baseline findings were: the Fort Gay-Thompson schools showed a continual, although gradual, growth; in 1971-72, the 3rd and 6th grades at Thompson Elementary were below national, state, and county averages in every area except math; adopted textbooks provided the principal planning source for instruction; and unlike the elementary teachers, the high school teachers made little use of sub-grouping in the classroom.

Results were examined in relation to the achievement levels of students in the nation as a whole and those of black and white students. Representing a cross-section of typical schools across the country, the sample consisted of 75,000 students, of which about 2,500 answered a given question. Results were reported by age, region (Northeast and West), sex, and level of parental education. Among the results were: Hispanic achievement was consistently below that of the total national age population and of white students; Hispanic achievement was often  closer to national levels than black achievement; the achievement of male Hispanos was consistently closer to national levels than that of females on the science items; and students who reported that one parent had at least graduated from high school was closer to the national level than those who reported that neither parent had graduated. Appended are: definitions of national assessment Hispanic-reporting categories, special analyses of reading items, statistics of the achievement of the white and black groups in each area; and proportion of Hispanic students within the national assessment samples.

A minor civil division designated rural and experiencing both a declining population and in-migration (northern New York) was examined via survey (99 households) in terms of age, occupational structure, income, education, and size and structure of family residence. Results indicated: migrants and non-migrants differ, the  migrants being younger, more often employed, and less often retired; the migration stream was predominantly return migrants; returned migration was the source of the demographic and economic differences between the migrant and non-migrant populations, the returned migrants being less like the native population than the new migrants. Implications were: returned migration constitutes the major type of movement to a declining area; family relations are paramount in counterstream theory; speculation that urban to rural migration is stimulated by a search for alternative life styles is not supported; differences within the return migration stream necessitate a refinement of migration theory incorporating goal-oriented moves and moves resulting from failure to adapt.

There are seven such controlling assumptions: Congress is presumed to act in good faith toward Indians; the belief that past policies were based upon some intelligent criteria that incorporated an understanding of conditions, the approval of Indians, and a farsighted intention of Congress; the paternalistic assumption that the solution of Indian problems is a simple matter of adjustment of already existing programs; the perception of Indian lands and communities as laboratories which can be used to test various theories of social engineering; the Federal government can use Indian lands at its discretion; sanction of the privilege of the Federal  establishment to avoid difficult decisions; and tribal rights are nuisances that can be abated as need be. In view of the impact of these assumptions, the following specific recommendations are offered to affect fundamental shifts in direction, simplification of complex problems to their elemental factors, and expansion of the manner in which Indians believe they perceive themselves today: uniform recognition of Indian communities; clarification of tribal membership; a standard definition of the status of an Indian tribe; creation of a &quot;Court of Indian Affairs&quot;; arbitration of long-standing Native claims; rejuvenation of the Indian land base; and universal eligibility for government aid based on need.

The issues identified by the field research frequently center on questions of the proper respective spheres of authority of the governmental units involved--Federal, state, local, and Indian. Perspective and an understanding of the present system can best be gained by an examination of the historical development of this nation's policy toward Indians. The current system is an outgrowth of the vigorously debated, and often contradictory, notions of the past defining the Indians' position in American society. Therefore, this report begins with a summary of the historical development of the legal  status of tribal Indians in the United States. The report then examines: Indian tribal government, courts, and legal systems; the current structure of child welfare programs for reservation Indians from a legal perspective; the basic legal problems flowing from the overlay of a federally funded, state administered child welfare system on the three governmental units (Indian, state, and local) concerned; recent attempts at solutions of the problems; and the legal implications of selected alternatives to the present system.

Information was also gathered on the formal and informal programming for the recruitment and retention of Indian students and faculty, and the numbers of recent Indian graduates with MSW degrees and their employment histories. Questionnaires were mailed to Indian students, graduates, faculty, and 84 accredited schools of social work. Responses were received from 19 students, 26 graduates, 10 faculty, and 54 schools. Respondents were asked: their opinions on curricular content and on how social work educational  programs might be improved to better serve Indian students and social work practitioners with Indian clientele. Conclusions drawn from the survey were that: formal graduate educational programs in social work for Indians in off-reservation colleges appeared to be the most effective way of serving Indian students and their communities; much more work needed to be done by schools of social work, including those schools with formalized programs for Indians, to improve all aspects of their programs so that they can better serve Indian people; and there was a need for greater participation by Indian people in many aspects of these programs.

        "description":"Due to various factors, legal and jurisdictional issues often hinder the administration and delivery of Social and Rehabilitation Service (SRS) services on reservations. Focusing on child welfare programs, legal and jurisdictional problems concerning the delivery of SRS services on reservations and the means of coping with them were explored through field research at 10 reservations in 8 states and library legal research. Child welfare services were defined as including foster care, adoption, day care, protective services, and certain institutional and homemaker services. Field research disclosed complex interagency relationships and patterns of service delivery. Three major recurrent legal and jurisdictional problems were uncovered; conflicting legal interpretations about the  roles and responsibilities of state or county offices in providing certain SRS services on reservations; state rulings that the state cannot license facilities on reservations; and reluctance of some state courts and institutions to honor tribal court orders. In the long run, no final resolution of the basic jurisdictional tension will be possible without major Federal legislation, probably including amendments to the Social Security Act. Several alternatives and recent legal rulings are discussed in detail. (NQ)",

        "description":"The relationship between size of farm and the welfare of farm and nonfarm society was examined in terms of total income in the farm sector, the number and size of farms, income per farm, secondary income generation, and consumer food costs using four alternative farm structures: large farm (gross farm sales of at least $40,000); medium farm (gross farm sales of $10,000-$39,000); small farm (gross farm sales of $2,500-$9,999); and typical farm (reflects the mix of the other three farm sizes in 1980 if recent farm size trends continue). Using a linear programming model, the location and quantity of production of feed grains, wheat, soybeans, and cotton were determined within 150 rural areas for each model alternative. National demands for major livestock products and for industrial  and export uses of these crop commodities were estimated for 1980. Outcomes under the differing alternatives were compared nationally and specifically (the North Central Region). Results indicated: a system of all small farms would provide higher prices for farm outputs, higher returns to cropland, a higher total income for the farming sector, and increased economic activity in nonfarm sectors; a system of all large farms would lower consumer food costs, require fewer productive inputs, and allow a higher net income per commercial farm; the typical and medium farm alternatives would serve society similarly.

        "description":"The standard models of post-secondary education in Manitoba, Canada, historically have not met the special needs and problems of the American Indian and Metis populations. Broadly speaking, the academic qualifications of Canada Natives must be raised to a much higher level in terms of vocational, general, and professional training; thus equipped, Canada Natives must create their own job opportunities at the community level so they can become masters of their own socioeconomic destiny. In view of the gross lack of opportunity for basic skill development, education for entry into professional careers, and the inacessability of rural communities, it is suggested that: brochures and calendars regarding post-secondary education be distributed in rural areas; basic literacy and/or  skill development courses be promoted in the rural areas; information re: adult education courses be thoroughly disseminated; literate Native people be encouraged financially to act as tutors to others. In view of the socioeconomic disadvantages and the general disorientation of Indians and Metis living in urban areas, it is suggested that: programs for mature students entering the university be made more flexible via an orientation academic year; special optional courses be made to fit the needs of Native communities; a university extension facility be provided in the North; business administration and the arts and sciences be promoted for Native people.

The four major types of agencies responsible for providing child welfare services to Indians were the state-county social service systems, Federal service system, Indian-run agencies, and  private non-Indian agencies. Of these, the state-county social service systems and the Federal service system were the most active. Barriers to the provision of Indian child welfare services included: failure of state courts and institutions to recognize tribal court orders; the licensing of institutions; interagency relationships; the reluctance of many states to take into account the special problems of providing services to Indians; the lack of Indian involvement; the distance between county welfare offices and Indian reservations; and failure to understand tribal cultures and to foster programs operated by tribal governments.

The similar \"bats task\" asked the student to make a clear decision from the data. Results indicate that logical reasoning abilities developed with age, but it was clear that high school teachers should not assume that their students have these  abilities.

High school biology students from two dissimilar populations were administered ten Piagetian-styled tasks to determine the student's operational level. Analysis of data on operational level and age determined that inner-city students (N=41) were at a significantly lower operational level and found to be significantly older than rural students (N=115). Random assignments of instructional treatments to groups of students within intact classes were made, where each group was instructed by the same teacher and covered identical instructional units. Summative testing following the end of the instructional period was analyzed for difference in mean achievement due to treatments  and level of cognitive development. Results showed that there was no significant treatment effect in within-school comparisons; there was a significant difference in mean achievement in favor of the formal operational students. Significant differences were found in all between-school comparisons except when inner-city concrete operational students in the audiotutorial group were compared with rural concrete operational students in either treatment. Implications of the use of the audiotutorial format with students stabilized at the concrete operational level are discussed. (CS)",

A laboratory approach, in which students measured three-dimensional objects with tools scaled in metric units, was compared to a simulation approach, in which students identified measurements of two-dimensional objects from pictures containing metric tools superimposed near the picture of the object to be measured. In both of these approaches, students first saw a slide/tape presentation prepared by the investigator. Then, self-instructional packages (following either the laboratory or the simulation approach) were given to students. A total of twelve  intact classes from three elementary schools participated in the study. Schools were assigned at random to one of the two teaching approaches. Three investigator-constructed instruments were used: a student attitude questionnaire, a test of student knowledge, and a test of student ability to measure accurately using SI units (both laboratory and simulated items were on the test). The achievement test was used as an immediate posttest and again three weeks later as a retention test. When the data were analyzed, findings showed a significant difference in attitude of sixth graders, favoring the laboratory approach. On both the achievement posttest and retention test, no differences were found between scores of students in the laboratory group compared to those in the simulated activities  group, at any grade level. Students in both groups scored significantly higher on the simulated items of the achievement and retention tests than on the laboratory items on the test. (DT)",

From a sample of 180 astronomy graduates, 110 responded. Data on the 1975-76 sample are presented in tabular form, and comparisons are made with responses to previous studies for several items. Highlights from the analyses indicate: (1) a continuing decrease in the number of physics bachelor's degrees granted; (2) a continuing increase in the percentage of physics bachelors who start graduate study in a physics-related area; (3) a continuing increase in the proportion of women among physics degree recipients; and (4) an improved employment market in terms of a larger number of available positions, but a higher proportion  of the offers make no use of the graduate's physics training.

The more recent development in federal funding requires institutions to show affirmative action accounts for the demand for scientists from minority groups. Considerable attention has been paid to the problems of minority student enrollment in higher education during the past decade; the purpose of this study was to investigate the reasons of minority underrepresentation in the scientific field, focusing primarily on the multitude of variables contributing to this phenomenon in higher education today.

One aspect of the project involved the development and field-testing of The Important Considerations Survey (ICS), an objective paper-and-pencil instrument that attempts to determine a student's level of moral reasoning along Kohlberg's six-stage continuum. Two experimental forms were field-tested on 11 to 16 year olds. After students read four stories containing moral dilemmas, they rated the relative importance of many considerations that might precede decision making. A detailed scoring manual is presented. As outgrowths of the ICS activity, two research projects were undertaken to explore moral reasoning abilities of younger elementary pupils for whom the ICS would  be inappropriate. The Dilemma Decisions Project involved 4th, 5th, and 6th graders in considering moral dilemmas presented in certain situations and in suggesting possible consequences of various alternatives on the actors involved in the dilemma. An attempt was made to assess moral reasoning levels from the class discussion. The Role-Playing Project exposed 2nd, 3rd, and 4th graders to a series of structured role-playing activities in an attempt to influence their moral reasoning levels. Rationale, reviews of relevant literature, and results of the two projects are described. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"The appropriateness of nationalistic education in the modern global society is questioned since nation-states may be superceded by supra-national or global structures. Schools provide a place for society to prepare younger generations to cherish and protect the interests of that society. Human history reflects this trend as it moves from parental training in basic survival skills to more formal and complex schooling. An historical sketch of the movement to unify a diverse group of immigrants through instruction in the English language and courses in American history provides information on the pre-20th century. Stress is on moral behavior and on the movement by organizations such as the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Sons of Veterans USA, and the American Legion to  cause laws requiring patriotic exercises in the schools to be enacted. Examples of contemporary views of world citizenship are given, including one that compares international patriotism with an athletic competition in which rival loyalties may exist, but which permit their subordination to larger goals and common interests. The conclusion is that American schools must work towards a form of nationalistic education which fosters knowledge of global affairs without false natural bias, skill development in critical thinking about global issues, and creation of a sense of global community.

Law-related education seeks to improve the citizenship skills of American youngsters by helping them learn about the law, legal processes, and the legal system. Seventeen articles written by various authors describe legal education programs throughout the United States and suggest practical tips on the many aspects of teacher education which can achieve this goal. The book begins with an article suggesting methods for determining what various segments of the community think law-related education should encompass. Articles in the next section raise some  general questions including building community support, selecting participants, and developing a schedule. The role of law-related instruction in elementary schools is considered in the following section. The next section contains eleven articles which describe a variety of approaches to law-related education. The approaches range from simple awareness sessions to intensive summer workshops. Each article in the book provides the address and phone number of the program being described. The final section contains suggestions for following up teacher education programs.

Perceptions play an important role in an individual's understanding of, and behavior toward, people from other cultures. In the unit students are asked to better understand what their perceptions of Arabs are, where these perceptions come from, and how these perceptions influence their attitudes and behavior toward others. The unit is not intended to provide an historical or cultural background of either Arab peoples or of their role in the Middle East Conflict. Its focus is on student images of the Arabs, on how stereotypes function in human thinking, and on how we can consciously control what we know and believe about other cultures. The  materials can be easily adapted for units on the Navaho, Mexicans, Blacks, Chinese, and other minorities. The activities involve students in compiling surveys, analyzing songs for stereotypes, expressing attitudes about situations involving the Arabs using a rating scale, going on a scavenger hunt to find as much information as they can about the Arabs, and examining textbook data about Arabs. For each activity a brief introduction, the objectives, indication of classroom time needed, teaching procedures, and evaluation methods are provided. All student handouts are included in the document. A bibliography of student and teacher resource materials on Arabs is also included. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This student manual is intended to help undergraduate political science students analyze human behavior. The manual poses the problem of why a group of high school students failed to take their cafeteria trays to the dirty dish room. It presents alternative solutions which students discuss as they explore various interpretations of human motivations which might have caused this behavior. The analysis presented is a prototype of thinking that can be applied to many of our social problems and can lead to a more humane society. The manual presents 30 different theories and viewpoints for analyzing the problem. Included among these are the following: ignorance of expectations and ignorance of consequences (cybernetic model); permissive upbringing, what's in it for me?, small group  rewards (behavior reinforcement); sadism; masochism; attention seeking; preoccupation; sociopathic tendencies; rebellion against parental authority; depression (psychoanalytic model); loser; Peter Pan syndrome; game playing (dramaturgical/role model); lower need deprivation; Jonah complex (humanistic model); emotional contagion; Kohlberg moral development theory; depersonalization; and frustration/aggression (specialized theories). Questions and analysis topics are presented. A list of additional readings is also included. (Author/RM)",

They are chosen specifically for programs which cannot afford expensive curriculum materials. All activities demonstrate the application of universal anthropological principles to the American society. Seven areas which reflect the general functions of culture are identified. Four activities illustrate the cultural relationship between human nature and environment. One project involves students in examining travel guides of the United States which foreign embassies provide. Another project challenges students to be 26th century archaeologists explaining the uses of chap stick and marbles. In the area of subsistence and economic exchange, students can compare slaughterhouse processing  of meat with primitive methods seen in films. To illustrate rules of social organization, students can try greeting friends in a formal manner, or imagine the reaction of McDonalds patrons if a couple came in wearing formal evening attire. Concepts of politics and law can be studied by comparing biographical backgrounds of senators. Role playing of courtship behavior can illustrate rituals in American society, and making a list of common nonverbal gestures helps students to understand ways of communicating. Cultural change can be measured by watching fads come and go. (AV)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to call attention to certain important aspects of self-concept which have been largely neglected in behavioral science research literature. Self-concept is defined as the totality of the individual's thoughts and feelings with reference to himself as an object. Three broad areas of self-concept are discussed. The first area, the extant self-concept, includes the content of the self, the relationship among the parts, the ways of describing the parts and the whole and the boundaries of the object, or the ego-extensions. Previous self-concept research on these structures indicates a general neglect of ordering self-concept traits in hierarchical order. The second aspect of self-concept is the desired self. Meaningful aspects of self-concept largely  neglected in research in the area of the desired self include individual acceptance or nonacceptance of a personal characteristic, the dimensions of self-consciousness, self-confidence, and self-values. The third section discusses the social or presenting self. It purports that the tendency of most research is to confuse the presenting self with the extant self-concept. (Author/DB)",

The author believes a combination of longitudinal and cross-sectional study of classrooms and grade levels is the most effective way of examining the process of transmission. Ethnographic classroom research was carried out in a rural midwestern village over a nine-month period corresponding with the beginning, middle, and end of the school year. Cross-sectionally, every classroom from preschool through 12th grade was systematically observed. Longitudinally, each class was observed all day for at least three days. The research design yeilded testable data and  conclusions that are comparable both within and between classrooms and grade levels in the village as well as between school systems. The author argues that high order generalizations about the process of schooling must be based on rigorous observation schedules such as the one described here. His research illustrates the fruitfulness of an ethnographic approach to classroom research. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"Patterns of problem-solving activity in one middle-class urban high school are examined and a problem solving model rooted in a conceptual framework of contingency theory is presented. Contingency theory stresses that as political, economic, and social conditions in an organization's environment become problematic, the internal structures of the organization must be modified to meet the changing demands. In the case analysis, schools are viewed as networks of interlacing cycles of events dependent upon student and teacher behavioral cycles and upon environmental needs. Researchers, who acted as participant observers, gathered data over six months. They cooperated with school staff in a participatory way, yet were also impartial, confidential onlookers and questioners. The  contingency theory model identifies problem solving as a cyclical process with the following seven key stages: problem recognition, problem screening, problem distribution, decision making, decision implementation, feedback, and problem resolution. Findings of this study indicate that problem solving at high schools can be identified as a cyclical process with several key stages. At each stage forces converge on the problem which determine the course of events leading to the subsequent stage and finally lead to the ultimate resolution of the problem. The conclusion is that a similar cyclical process with similar stages would be found in other schools if a contingency theory perspective was used. Ten propositions on problem solving are offered for further testing in other settings.  (Author/DB)",

        "description":"A critical analysis and interpretation of &quot;The Sorting Machine&quot; by Joel H. Spring is presented. The book, which uses a historical revisionist approach to trace the development and impact of the corporate-government-foundation network on the ideological orientation of the American educational system, makes its greatest contribution by re-examing research into the educational power structure. Spring analyzes the class bias of educational opinion leaders, documents the marketing of math and science curricula, and forecasts the extension of labor power into the social sciences and humanities. Writing from the ideological viewpoint of anarchism, Spring maintains that the contradiction between the individual and the state is of primary importance and has been neglected by the  educational system. The book gives evidence of greater theoretical depth than many works of the historical revisionists but it has shortcomings, including subjective idealism, use of contradictory and unreliable evidence, methodological weakness, omission of crucial issues such as McCarthyism, and oversimplification of problem areas such as curriculum development and the need for educational planning. The conclusion is that Spring's book offers insights for policy makers, educational reformers, and revolutionaries and should be read as a sophisticated attempt to apply a revisionist superstructure to educational policy research.

The objective of this strategy is to enable students to examine geographic concepts and generalizations on a level which they can easily understand. Specifically, strategies for investigating and analyzing self-contained buildings and planned communities as micro-geographic phenomena are presented. Ways in which self-contained buildings and planned communities, which provide opportunities for residence, employment, and recreation within a controlled and easily observable environment, can be used as models for study of metropolitan regions are specified. First, students would be introduced to the nature of self-contained buildings and planned communities. Second, they would be  presented with a three-dimensional self-containment matrix, which provides a framework in which to place answers to basic questions such as who, what, where, when, and to what extent certain functions, people, and percentages interact in certain ways. Working with the variables in the matrix expands the students' understandings of geographic concepts such as population density, personal interaction, and residential area.

Classroom and other educational materials designated and evaluated by the National Right to Work Committee as presenting the right to work issue unfairly, inaccurately, or both, are reported. Reviewed are all current history and government textbook adoption lists from the 20 states which have such lists, plus other materials which may be used in other states. Twenty-three texts and five miscellaneous materials are reviewed. The major portion of the document presents evaluations of the text and miscellaneous educational materials. Listed for each entry are title, author, and states which have approved the text, an  indication of the status of Right to Work laws in those states, textual reprint of Right to Work coverage, and evaluation of the tone, extent, and slant of the coverage. Basic facts about Right to Work laws are briefly presented, including wording of the law in the Taft-Hartley Act, states which have statutes protecting the right to work, dates these laws were enacted, and a sample Right to Work Law. Comments on objectionable terms often found in the materials are discussed, followed by listings of states with statewide textbook adoptions and an index of titles. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"An internship program is described in which geography undergraduates and graduate students receive on-the-job career training as well as academic training. This particular program was begun in 1969 at San Diego State University to help geography students relate their academic training to practical job experiences and to help them obtain meaningful employment after graduation. Urban studies, transportation and environmental specialities, and physical geography seem to be areas best suited for the program. Students earn three units of academic credit for working at least 12 hours each week per semester for agencies that have jobs relevant to the students' backgrounds and interests. Typical hiring agencies include city departments of transportation, parks and recreation divisions,  and U.S. Soil Conservation Service. Students do not receive a salary, thereby ensuring genuine interest on their part and continued job availability even when hiring agencies face economic uncertainties. In 1975 a survey of former interns was made. Responses indicate that 28% had received job offers directly from agencies with which they had interned, and 50% believe the experience was indirectly responsible for their success in obtaining their first position. The spatial perspective, tools, and techniques of geography training are seen to be valuable in related professional work. (AV)",

        "description":"The authors discuss methodology and results of a study to determine the effects of curriculum materials about responsibility on junior high students. Materials are from the Law in a Free Society project developed by the California Bar Association. Four schools in Portland, Maine participated in the study. Three hundred students were pre- and posttested. Two achievement tests and one attitudinal test were administered before the introduction of responsibility materials to the experimental group. After one week of teaching the unit on responsibility, the tests were again administered to the same students. A three-way (grades x ability groups x programs) multivariate analysis of variance of gain scores was performed to test various hypotheses. Only the differences between programs  were found to be significant; those differences could be attributed to a slight but significant increase in the scores of the experimental group students on the attitudinal test. It could be that the one week of teaching was not enough to make a clearly significant positive or negative impact on students. Appendices include copies of the achievement and attitudinal tests, and tables showing pre- and posttest scoring data from the test instruments. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"The effects of instruction in critical thinking are investigated, using instructional materials based on a theoretical model of critical thinking. The model emphasized the role of concepts and processes in responding to instances of valid and invalid reasoning, argument, and evidence. Instruction focused on eight cognitive operations: generalization, representation, inference, analogy, explanation, information source, justification, and attribution. Among the instructional materials were programmed student workbooks, each focusing on one kind of reasoning using valid and invalid examples. Two sets of booklets were developed. One set of workbooks contained instructional activities in a deductive sequence, and the other used an inductive sequence. Pretests, criterion-referenced  achievement tests, student questionnaires, and teachers' manuals were also developed in accordance with the theoretical model. A group of 369 sixth graders in northern California were randomly assigned to work independently in the workbooks in daily, 40-minute periods for two weeks. Pre- and posttest data indicate that instruction based on the theoretical model yielded significant learning in the experimental group. Neither the inductive or deductive method was significantly more effective. Tables illustrate the model, concepts used in the booklets, and inductive and deductive instructional sequences.

A review of professional development literature indicates possible problems. The student who lacks professional and occupational objectives, commitment, and works at less than full potential is described in section I. Section II discusses lack of graduate program standardization, unstructured curriculum, competitive grading, and student exploitation as sources of the problem. Section III describes the central cause of student problems as a double bind, consisting of the contradictory communications that sociology is a discipline of shapeless complexity and that the primary goal of the graduate student is to tie up all loose  ends. These two communications, entitled the fallacy of shapeless complexity and the fallacy of closure, are characterized in sections IV and V, followed by solutions to the problem in section VI. The solution is to improve student and faculty awareness of and communication about the double bind and then to attempt practical reform of examination procedures, degree requirements, and knowledge development.

The bulletins are designed for use by elementary and secondary social studies teachers. The various issues, written in 1976, deal with emerging topics of interest related to reading in the social studies, the basic education movement, and evaluating values education. The format of each four-page bulletin differs slightly, but generally each includes a definition of the topic, interviews with leaders in the field, abstracts of ERIC documents related to the topic, and a short annotated bibliography of books, games, and multimedia products in the field. In the first interview, Lunstrum, favoring a content-centered or functional approach,  suggests that all teachers should be teaching reading skills. In the second set of interviews, three experts discuss their philosophies about basic education and the back to basics movement, and implications for social studies teachers. The final interview examines why evaluating values education is important. It is suggested that successful evaluation is possible when teachers precisely formulate the goals and objectives of values education programs. (JR)",

Map activities include drawing maps of the classroom, mapping an imaginary island using scale and contour lines, and constructing a cardboard box plane table to use when compass or other surveying equipment is not available. Learning position and location can become enjoyable by playing a classroom detective game. One student leaves the room and then must return and identify an unknown object by asking classmates \"yes\" and \"no\" type questions about its location. Treasure hunts which require  students to follow compass readings for specified distances are also suggested. For advanced students, orienteering activities can be applied to classroom, schoolyard, or neighborhood, and can make use of bicycles, canoes, or simple hiking and running. An adaptation is provided for persons confined to wheelchairs. Sample diagrams and maps accompany many of the suggested activities. (AV)",

        "description":"The history of progressive education in Eretz-Israel (Palestine) from 1915-39 is intended as a model of a new pedagogical theory adopted by a changing society. Topics discussed include the Jewish community in Eretz-Israel, pedagogical experiments, progressive education as a pedagogical movement, the relationship between school and society, the role of the educator in progressive education, and learning characteristics peculiar to progressive education. The paper describes and evaluates the alliance between progressive concepts in education and the Labour Movement. Two basic assumptions are offered: first, this alliance is encouraged if the basic pedagogical concepts are in agreement with the ideals guiding the society; second, creation of new man-centered social order encourages  an open atmosphere in which concepts such as progressive education are acceptable. Against this political and social background, progressive education developed through three stages: (1) educational experiments which attempted to initiate pedagogical experiments elsewhere; (2) the pedagogical movement resulting from a dynamic interaction between the school and its social environment; and (3) an educational system characterized by the dependence of school on society as a whole.

The first four chapters explain the organization of preschools, compulsory elementary schools, noncompulsory secondary schools, and higher education. Educational aims are primarily to train workers for farms and factories, not for universities. Four common characteristics of Chinese and American education are concern for the disadvantaged, shortening the school years, political education, and work and study. Chapter five explores Maoist ideology and the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution the quality of education and health care was improved, peasants were introduced to crude industrialization,  elitism and intellectualism were criticized, and the arts were made pervasively propagandistic. Chapter six considers the reactions of Chinese youth to being forced to work in rural areas and to experiencing pressures of party loyalty when they attend universities. The final two chapters point out that the Chinese people are willing to experiment with short training periods to produce needed manpower, as in the case of &quot;barefoot doctors&quot; who are peasants with minimal basic medical training. Throughout the pamphlet, comparisons are made to the American educational system, student protests, and mass media. (AV)",

        "description":"This study investigates the Shaker educational system, analyzes the development of Shaker schools, and examines the innovative practices that the Shakers used to ready children for the world of their time. Originating in England among illiterate working class people, the movement was established in New England in 1774. Basic characteristics of the movement included a rural commune lifestyle; equality of the sexes; separation of adults by sex and of children from parents; and disapproval of intemperance, monopoly, sexual intercourse, capital punishment, and war. Shaker schools were developed in the early 1800's. They combined rigorous discipline with affectionate teaching and study of useful skills. The curriculum was better than that of public schools at the time; teaching  techniques employed open classroom ideas, student tutors, team teaching, infant education, and interdisciplinary studies. Shaker education became less unique late in the 19th century when public school standards were improved and teacher certification was mandated. The Shaker life style itself became less popular in the 20th century as mass marketing, social agencies, equal rights movement, and financial complexity became common. However, as modern-day resources are appearing to be limited, the Shakers' simple life style may attract new interest. (AV)",

The retention tests, administered in June and again in September, measured (1) mathematical reasoning, (2) computation, (3) comprehension, and (4) the ability to read mathematical prose. It was found that the Chicano students who were pretrained in June scored higher than those not pretrained.

The rationale for this type of teaching rests on the claims for teaching students the process of critical (reflective) thinking. In this type of teaching it is necessary to have data before the students. Only then is the teacher to ask the students for conclusions. Six cognitive processes, which the respondent is to perform as solicited by the question, are identified: (1) defining; (2) interpreting; (3) fact stating; (4) explaining; (5) opining; and (6) justifying. Classroom observation indicates that teachers are more likely to have a question and answer exchange with one student at a time rather than broadening the interaction into group  discussion. The implications of this study are that teachers need help in creative questioning in order to elicit thoughtful reasoning and response from students. (JD)",

The subjects were 198 introductory psychology students at the University of Manitoba. Students viewed one of four video-taped lectures: (1) a high teaching style instructor giving a high content lecture; (2) a high teaching style instructor giving a low content lecture; (3) a low teaching style instructor giving a high content lecture; or (4) a low teaching style instructor giving a low content lecture. Before viewing the tape, half of the students  received a positive description of the instructor's teaching reputation and half received a negative description. Following viewing of the lectures, students completed a teacher evaluation and a multiple-choice test on the lecture content. Results showed that teacher evaluations were biased in the direction of the prior information, but that student achievement was not affected. Educational seduction occurred in both positive and negative reputation conditions. (MM)",

If the university-based research community is to collaborate in fulfilling this need, it must support a number of changes in the present system including: (1) reallocation of  federal research monies toward in-school research conducted by university-based researchers in collaboration with local school personnel on school-generated topics; (2) development of a communications network linking all facets of in-school research; (3) development of means to translate theoretical educational research into functionally applicable terms; and (4) provision of school administrator and board member inservice training programs in techniques for utilizing research results. Prospects for the establishment of an effective in-school research effort seem bleak, but the need exists, the task is there. It remains to develop the delivery vehicle for fulfilling those needs.

        "description":"This paper presents the results of three experiments conducted in connection with development of a node-link based teaching/learning strategy. In experiment 1, subjects were instructed to either define concepts selected from a unit of introductory psychology or to describe the relationships existing between pairs of concepts. The cognitive structures of subjects describing relationships were found to be more similar to those of experts in the field of psychology than were those of subjects that defined single concepts. However, confusion in the meaning of the term &quot;relationship&quot; indicated a need for a more structured approach to relationship description activity. One such approach, the Node Acquisition and Integration Technique (NAIT), was discussed in connection with experiment  2. In the first stage of NAIT, students complete relationship-guided &quot;definition worksheets.&quot; Next, these definitions are elaborated through formation of mental images, generation of examples and applications, etc. Finally, &quot;comparison worksheets&quot; lead students through relationship-guided comparisons of pairs of previously completed definition worksheets in search of similarities, differences, and direct relationships between the compared concepts. Students then summarize the relationships thus discovered, an activity equivalent to the relationship description activity of Experiment 1, but built up through a series of well-defined steps. A preliminary assessment of NAIT indicated that it was more effective in enhancing episodic and integrative understanding than a no-treatment control.  Experiment 3 discusses NAIT evaluation efforts in an ecologically valid college setting. (Author/MB)",

Proceeding on the assumption that pupils who disrupt the classroom must be taught discipline, the author discusses ways of modifying the classroom environment and suggests ways to direct and encourage pupils to acceptable behavior. First of all, each day's activities should be \"overplanned\" since many discipline problems develop because students have nothing to do. The schedule of activities should be varied with a diversity of instructional approaches, thus avoiding boredom. Activities, however, should be highly organized. Firmness and kindness on the part of the teacher is important. Courtesy and genuine interest in each student will  bring positive reactions while threatening is, for the most part, futile. In many classroom discipline problems, teachers make the mistake of over-reacting. Calmness is the teacher's best reaction when faced with disruptive behavior. If all else fails in difficult classroom situations over a period of time, the teacher should not hesitate to ask for help from the principal, counselor, fellow teachers or parents. Finally, it is suggested that teaching discipline in a systematic, organized manner may well be the teacher's most important responsibility, because it is the disciplined product of the educational system who will likely make the greatest contribution to our future society.

        "description":"Educational Testing Service (ETS) research that is relevant to the concerns of women and the educational process can be categorized into four areas: (1) research primarily about women; (2) research focusing on sex differences or similarities; (3) research that reports, but does not focus on sex differences; and (4) research identifying methods of determining and correcting for bias or differences. The entries in this bibliography are categorized in the same way. Section I contains research studies that used female only samples or that gave primary attention to the educational problems of women. Included are surveys of women students, information on various test responses of females, educational problems of women, and other bibliographies about women. Section II focuses on  male/female differences or lack of significant differences in various behaviors, traits, or abilities and in test-taking behavior or test performance. It contains studies that provide evidence of sex-linked differential treatment for males and females, and investigations of male and female behavior or performance differences. Section III includes work in which data are reported and analysed separately by sex but that did not focus primarily on sex differences. Undoubtedly, this section does not include all studies of this type. Section IV, although not specifically relevant to women, is included in this bibliography because the procedures discussed in the articles can be used to help identify and control for sex bias and sex differences. The articles deal with identifying bias and  performance differences in testing and in data analyses of mixed sex groups or subgroups. (Author/MV)",

This paper considers several analytical methods that might be used for such situations when pretest scores indicate that these intact groups differ significantly initially. The methods considered include gain score analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (using both raw scores and estimated true scores), value-added analysis, and within group dependent t-tests, all on a common set of real data from nonequivalent intact groups. Seemingly contradictory results were obtained for this data with gain score ANOVA and with ANCOVA. Comparable results should be expected to occur routinely with data from nonequivalent groups. In view of these results,  it is recommended that statistical comparisons across nonequivalent groups be avoided. However, within group comparisons may aid somewhat in such evaluations of alternative educational programs. (Author/RC)",

Supplementary workshops in the arts, (dance, theater, music, painting, sculpture, mixed media, drawing, printmaking, puppetry, crafts, film making, and others) were closely correlated with the reading program. Weekly field trips supplemented the instructional program. A workshop was provided for parents. Based on the evaluator's site visits and California Achievement Test results, the program succeeded in serving the needs of the 130 enrolled  students. Most of the recommendations made in a previous evaluation of the program were implemented: i.e., the program was expanded to more days of the week, the program was emulated by other schools, a workshop in crafts and communications and a parents' workshop were included, emphasis continued to be on self discovery, and, more materials were obtained.

        "description":"This publication discusses the issue of black owned rural land decline. Since the turn of the century, it is estimated that blacks have lost in excess of 9,000,000 acres of rural land. The impact of this loss is tremendous for blacks, both on the economic and psychological levels. Developing strategies to arrest the rapid decline of black owned rural real estate is a high priority on the agenda of concern of the black community. It is noted that landownership is important because it provides an economic base for socio-psychological release and/or identification. In a capitalistic society, landownership is linked with permanence and political power. Black land capable of being usefully developed or converted into capital, constitutes an immensely valuable political resource. If  used correctly, a black land base could be critical to the political base in the black community. The absence of such a base can have a crippling effect on the mobilization potential of the black community in the political process. Among the various, social, political, and economic implications of black rural land loss which are discussed in this publication are: (1) the Emergency Land Fund, (2) attitudes of blacks toward rural land, (3) institutional procedures for resolving tax delinquency in the south, and (4) a case study of black rural land loss in Tennessee.

The purpose of the study was to identify the points at which minority students leave the educational system. The data utilized for the study were the enrollment data for 1973-74 and 1974-75. Cohort-survival models of Wisconsin students moving through high school, from high school to the University of Wisconsin and through the university were used. Ethnic identification was the independent variable. The study had three major findings. Ethnic composition in the school district is itself related to attrition patterns. Minority high school graduates are as likely to attend the University of Wisconsin as are non-minority  high school graduates. The flow of students through the university system may indicate higher attrition for some minority groups compared with non-minority students. The study concluded that without a change in the Milwaukee secondary school attrition pattern, minority groups will never be proportionately represented in the higher educational system of the state. Furthermore development of support programs for minority students in the university system might also have a significant affect upon college enrollments. (Author/JP)",

        "description":"The cumulative deficit hypothesis with respect to age decrement in IQ was investigated in large samples of white and black school children in rural Georgia between the ages of 5 and 18. The cumulative deficits hypothesis suggests that the increasing decrement in mental test scores, relative to population norms, is a function of age in groups considered environmentally deprived. According to the hypothesis, the decrement is a result of the cumulative effects of environmental disadvantages on mental development. About 1,300 school children, approximately 49% white and 51% black, were tested. Subjects were tested on the California Test of Mental Maturity, a standardized test of general intelligence, which yields IQ's for verbal and nonverbal abilities from kindergarten through grade  12. Age decrement in verbal and nonverbal IQ is measured in this study by the average IQ difference between younger and older siblings. It was found that blacks, but not whites showed significant and substantial decrements in both verbal and nonverbal IQ's as a linear function of age in the range from about 5 to 16 years of age. The results of this study on Georgia blacks seem to favor an environmental interpretation of the progressive IQ decrement in view of the comparative lack of such a decrement in a parallel study of California blacks whose environmental circumstances are markedly better than those of the black sample from rural Georgia.

        "description":"This paper reviews the highlights of the literature dealing with multicultural education and cultural pluralism. Bibliographies dealing with multicultural education contain a large body of literature. For the most part the literature reflects confusion as to the best goals and strategies of this curriculum concept. The literature also indicates a belief that this approach to education will foster the ideal of cultural pluralism as opposed to the ideal of assimilation in American society. The literature also includes many treatises dealing with the importance of teachers and their training in this new education effort. Although the quantity of the literature reflects a great amount of interest in this new educational goal, there are some reservations. Although the concept is  favored, there is some skepticism due to the many unanswered questions which accompany the various ways of implementing the multicultural concept. The second part of the paper is devoted to the many questions and issues raised in public school circles by the trend towards multicultural education. These questions are many and varied, involving the philosophy and goals of schooling, and school priorities in the education of students. It is concluded that the present trend in modern education is towards basic competencies, job survival skills, and universal communication skills. A crucial issue confronting multicultural education is whether it can meet these new and publicly demanded goals. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The Bilingual Program in the James Monroe High School in the South Bronx in New York, was designed to offer bilingual instructional and supportive services to ninth through twelfth grade high school students under funding from Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The program was designed to provide a model for replication by other high schools with similar problems. It was distinctive in two ways: (1) it was to maximize use of existing tax levy and teaching personnel, and (2) Title VII funding was to be used only to provide supportive services for the program and for unique instructional resources. The program was organized in a bilingual mini-school in which non-English speaking pupils were offered academic, non-academic and skill subjects in their native  language, (Spanish). In addition, these students were given extensive instruction in English. To reinforce the instruction, the bilingual students simultaneously took other required courses with English speaking pupils. The program also offered a bilingual career orientation course and business skill subjects. The target population consisted of approximately 250 Spanish-speaking males and females. Results indicated that while the students showed gains in reading in English, mathematics and in sciences, these gains were modest and were not statistically significant in line with criteria established for the evaluation. Some of the reasons for the performance on the tests used may be attributed to the tests themselves. (Author/AM)",

It was designed to maintain and/or improve their basic reading and mathematics skills. In addition, guidance support services were extended for the six week summer program so that positive attitudes toward academic achievement could be reinforced. The basic instructional plan included a minimum of one hour of intensive small group and individualized instruction in reading and mathematics interspersed with activities in arts and/or crafts for a three and one half hour school day. The students were grouped in ungraded classes with a teacher-pupil ration of 1:14. The CROFT (Reading) and BASE (Math) criterion referenced tests were administered to determine student  entry level skills and mastery of skill objectives. Results indicate that 81.6% of the students mastered at least one instructional objective in which they had previously shown deficiency. The data presented reinforced the contention of many teachers that the six-week program was too short for the mastery teaching-learning model. Since the skills of many students were not known to the teachers, a great deal of instructional time had to be spent pre-testing or diagnosing student deficiencies. (Author/AM)",

Children were institutionalized for a variety of reasons: they were orphaned, neglected, dependent, in need of supervision, or emotionally disturbed. For each child selected to participate in the program, there was a demonstrable need for extra help in reading and/or mathematics. Participants were expected to improve their reading and/or mathematics abilities. The program was designed to provide regular after school tutorial learning experiences for the children in reading and/or mathematics. The tutors were all licensed teachers. Tutoring took place in the child's place of  residence. Personal, individual relationships between the tutors and each of their students were established. The program operated from September 1, 1974 through June 30, 1975. The analyses of the test score data indicate that the program did increase the reading and/or mathematics ability through the children's participation in after school tutorial and small group sessions. The data from site visits and observations also indicate that the program was successful. (Author/JM)",

The second objective was to improve the reading and mathematics scores of these bilingual mentally retarded students. The program was implemented in 96 classes at 27 schools in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx. Four hundred forty-two students ranging in age from seven years eight months to eighteen years two months were chosen to participate. The program became operative in February 1975. Observations, interviews with participating teachers and data from a survey questionnaire indicated that by using a bilingual approach the students were  able to improve communication skills, develop better student/teacher rapport and through individualization, improve work/study skills. Though test data are inadequate to indicate that objectives were met, it would appear that this program served such an important need that its services should be incorporated into the overall future planning for the mentally retarded. The short duration of the program, the staffing dificulties, inadequate facilities and administrative constraints all contributed to procedural drawbacks. (Author/JM)",

Information was collected on institutional practices associated with land transfers. One hundred forty-seven black landowners from three predominately black counties participated in the study. A questionnaire was developed to collect research data on the attitudes of blacks toward rural land ownership, the perceptions of blacks regarding institutional transfer practices of rural land, and the perceptions of blacks toward rural landownership. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate the data according to demography, sex, age, and attitude agreement or disagreement. The results of the report led to several conclusions. Black landowners are in dire need of  more knowledge regarding real estate legal matters. A large percentage of black owner rural land was lost by illegal means. The illiteracy among rural blacks contributed to land loss, primarily because of their inability to effectively negotiate real estate transactions. Also, black rural landowners did not identify with the local courthouse establishment. One hundred one tables and an appendix of special or unusal landownership case studies is included.

The classification codes are intended: to assist in identification of problems and to describe health status, to make summarizations of problems and status easier for groups of served persons, and to be used in patient care planning, care evaluation audit and review. They can also be used to form a base for field research. This system classifies problems into six major groupings: physical problems or long-term illness, behavioral/emotional/learning  problems, the child's environment; growth and development, stress and transient situations, and child rearing and home management. A seventh grouping describes the child's state of health as \"well\" within the expertise of the nutrition discipline, while also classifying anticipatory needs of children whose current state of health is either \"well\" or \"not well\". The diagnostic codes have been designed as a four digit categorization system. Separate numerical codes have been developed on the basis of frequency of occurrence, importance and preciseness of characterization of the condition or problem. (Author/JP)",

Traditional socioeconomic variables are found to be imperfect measures of background. The correlations between brothers' test scores, educational attainment, occupational status, and earnings are substantially higher than would be predicted on the basis of measured socioeconomic background alone. Nevertheless, the differences between brothers on measures of economic success are large relative to differences  among men in general. Differences in family background explain less than one quarter of the variance in earnings. Biases in the effects of education on occupational status and earnings due to background are not fully eliminated by controlling only measured background variables. Controlling both sibling test score differences and common family background suggests a 30% bias in the education-occupation coefficient and a 54% bias in the education income earnings coefficient. Controlling common family background does not, however, substantially reduce the effect of test scores on income earnings. (Author/AM)",

The overview is organized under the following topics: Funding (which is of concern to all States); disadvantaged and handicapped (the overall consensus being that these needs are not adequately being served); the State Plan (criticism of which is extensive); the need for a comprehensive data system (addressed by all States); the effective utilization of existing facilities (recognized by many  States as essential; the need for reorientation of guidance and counseling personnel (generally recognized by all); articulation and coordination (where emphasis has been placed in two general areas: between postsecondary and secondary, and coordination among agencies); local advisory groups (which have been evaluated as generally successful); and a consensus that flexible programming will provide more services and training opportunities (prevalent among the States).

Six major barriers were identified: Communication methods, confusing and conflicting rules and regulations, turf, information, planning cycle problems, and goal incongruence and role confusion. This report presents the resulting six models (and an introduction) which comprise a conceptual framework for linkage, or overcoming the coordination barriers. Each model includes recommendations for a 1-day seminar agenda and  supportive exhibits which aid in developing seminars to teach the model. The models are titled (1) Problem Identification, (2) Communication Strategies for Liaison Relationships, (3) Implementation: Defining and Solving Liaison Problems (explores the problems of confusing and conflicting rules, turf, and goal incongruence), (4) Public and Private Sector Linkages in the Employment and Training System (explores the relationship between supply and demand in the labor market and the role of intermediaries), (5) Exchange of Information and Interagency Linkages (designed to enable decisionmakers to analyze the information needs of their projects), and (6) Budgeting and Program Analysis. The final section of this report, &quot;Applying the Models,&quot; is a workbook developed by the project staff and is  designed to carry operating personnel through the steps necessary for applying each of the models.

        "author":["McGrath, William T."],
        "description":"An experimental project was conducted between July 1972 and August 1973 to offer adult basic education to high seniority, unskilled employees laid off because of the seasonal nature of their jobs in the fruit and vegetable canning industry in northern California. The project's purpose was to demonstrate that layoff time training (LOTT) would be viable and useful when conducted in an industry with specific screening criteria. The criteria are an advancement system based not only on seniority but also on qualifications, a labor market allowing for outside hiring of skilled and semiskilled workers, a significant number of high seniority employees who are not advanced to better jobs because they lack qualifications they could receive through LOTT, and a significant number of workers  who experience layoff periods which would enable them to participate in LOTT programs. The training program included English as a second language, basic education, and advancement related counseling. Over 400 workers participated, and both unions and management actively supported the program. It was concluded that the screening criteria may well be predictive of whether or not a LOTT program will be successful in a given industry. One measure of the project's success was that through a collective bargaining agreement the unions and management elected to finance its continuation. An appendix includes statistical tables. (LMS)",

Information was secured through a questionnaire to a representative national sample of short term, nonfederal general hospitals. Retrospective data were supplied by a stratified random sample of 394 hospitals (a total of 998 nonfederal acute care hospitals received questionnaires) in order to make projections to the designated population of 5,865 hospitals. The total national cost of in hospital education is estimated to be $226 million (60% for  orientation and 40% for inservice education). Average total costs per sample hospital were figured as well as costs per new nurse for orientation and inservice education. Only direct salary components of the costs were computed, both for training staff and for recipients of the training. In the smaller hospitals the combined cost for inhospital education averaged $11,034 per year and $1.02 per patient day; in the largest these costs were $210,412 and $.95 respectively. AD graduates generally averaged more hours of clinical unit orientation than either diploma or baccalaureate graduates. Average salary costs for training staff for both orientation and inservice ranged from $7,176 in the smaller hospitals to $80,062 in the largest. (LAS)",

It uses the segmented earnings function framework developed by Jacob Mincer and Solomon Polachek and considers the effects of data errors, issues involving data interpretation, consequences of model mis-specification, and the simultaneity problem. The male-female wage gap is reexamined in light of these considerations. It is concluded that appropriate analysis of the corrected data does not support originally published conclusions concernig the shape of the on-the-job investment profile, the importance of \"depreciation\" of human capital, and the proportion of wage gap that can be explained by differences in work experience between  men and women.

        "description":"A study was conducted to obtain an initial view of exemplary programs involving an emphasis on work and education in postsecondary settings. Twenty programs were selected and described on the basis of comprehensiveness of approach, cross-section of institutional settings, cross-section of educational traditions or approaches to career education, preliminary or final evaluation demonstrating a positive change in student outcomes, faculty/guidance/administrator outcomes and community persons outcomes, and overall judgment that significant positive outcomes warrant communication of success to outside institutions, communities, peers, and the general public. Institutions represent three categories: 2-year community colleges, 4-year colleges and universities, and undergraduate and  graduate professional schools. The report contains a summary of the findings and recommendations to the National Advisory Council for Career Education regarding the setting of priorities for postsecondary education and work programs. Analyses of findings are discussed in length, and five major problem areas in developing postsecondary education and work programs based on outcomes for students are identified: Integration of abstract and experiential learning, assessment of student outcomes, credentialing based on student performance, information for planning, and Federal and State administration of postsecondary education and work programs. The report is contained in 39 pages; the remainder of the document consists of profiles of each of the 20 programs, each including description of  origins, purposes, activities, and outcomes. (TA)",

        "description":"The Appalachia Educational Laboratory's (AEL) Experience-Based Career Education (EBCE) Program was a 3-year project designed to develop a community-based alternative career education program for high school seniors. Internal summative evaluation activities consisted of collecting and analyzing preliminary data, establishing necessary evaluation controls, finalizing a data analysis plan, developing or securing and administering instruments, and analyzing the data and reporting the findings. External summative evaluation activities were conducted by AEL and Educational Testing Service personnel to collect summative data on students, parents, employers, and former students. Questionnaires and standardized tests were administered to all students (juniors and seniors in three  experimental groups and two control groups in 11 county high schools) to establish the effect of the AEL/EBCE Program on academic, attitudinal, and maturational variables, using the Student Information Questionnaire, the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, the Career Maturity Inventory, and the Assessment of Student Attitudes. As a result of the formative and summative evaluation activities during fiscal year 1975 conclusions can be reached: (1) The program did successfully serve as an alternative career education program, (2) the program was demonstrated to be an integrated, transportable product since it was successfully implemented in a local high school, and (3) the program was demonstrated to be an enjoyable experience since it was positively received by students, employers,  parents, and former students.

To assess the effectiveness of EBCE as a viable alternative to traditional secondary education, comparison groups of students were established (when possible), and both the EBCE and comparison students were tested with the Student Information Questionnaire, Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, Career Maturity Inventory, and Assessment of Student Attitudes. Parents and employers were administered instruments to determine  their attitudes toward the EBCE program. Positive changes in students' attitudes toward various aspects of the learning environment and in the area of career maturity attitudes were evidenced at most of the sites. Mixed results occurred in the basic skills areas and in the career knowledge/competence areas. Parents and employers were positively oriented towards EBCE: Employers indicated more perceived weaknesses in the programs than did parents.

        "description":"Successful changes that took place as a result of vocational education during the first two decades of the twentieth century are examined and historical parallels are drawn with career education today. The major intent is to give one example of how historical inquiry can inform policymakers who want to design and oversee educational reforms. The success of vocational education is analyzed in terms of (1) structural innovations (such as the comprehensive high school, the junior high school, and vocational guidance); (2) an emerging ideological consensus that schools can--and should--prepare youth for jobs; and (3) the creation of new groups with vested interests in maintaining those structures (such as vocational education teachers, guidance counselors, and IQ testers). The author  concludes that, in terms of ideology, the success of vocational education may be seen in the unquestioned acceptance of the idea that schools should and can prepare youth for rapidly changing career requirements, with the result that career educators tend to narrowly focus their attention on how the schools can best perform that function. Advocates of career education are urged to be aware that designing and overseeing educational reform requires a thorough understanding of all the questions implied (particularly the question of whether schools can prepare youth for jobs) and that historical inquiry need not be immodest about what it can contribute to that process.

        "description":"This paper conjectures about motivational, behavioral, and contextual factors in the transferability of vocational skills--factors which will influence performance when and if movement into or across jobs occurs. It is assumed that skill transfer depends upon similarity within and among motivational, contextual, and behavioral factors, referred to as domains. The basic points of view presented about each domain are (1) the motivational domain concerns interests, attitudes, goals, and reinforcers which guide the individual's actions, (2) the behavioral domain concerns the sequence and array of processes through which an individual arrives at measureable end performance having practical utility, and (3) the contextual domain concerns the performance requirements imposed by the  environment as well as the organizational, information, and physical support provided. The structure and functioning of each domain is discussed in separate sections. A final section considers the implications for education of current knowledge about skill transfer. Characteristics of educational outcomes which would lend confidence in transferability of skills are defined. Educational implications of conjectures made in the paper are examined through a series of recommended steps for educational development: (1) Define and analyze criterion contexts; (2) develop educational tasks; (3) optimize educational sequences; and (4) optimize conditions of skill acquisition.

These categories reflect neither the myriad of role choices facing women today, nor the forces shaping the resulting contexts. This paper focuses upon modules, the component task or activity sequences, which compose the total combination of roles played by members of heterogeneous and highly differentiated societies. Socialization and subsequent opportunities decreasingly channel women into a few constellations. Rather, depending upon her context, she may choose a number of modules to which she attaches varying degrees of commitment. Modules may be added or deleted and the degrees of commitment to each other may alter  rapidly. In fact, the saliency of modules may be manipulated. Increasingly a woman's context, resources and interests, rather than allocation or selection of a core module, determine future module decisions, including degree of felt commitment to each.

        "description":"Contemporary social psychology takes a simplistic approach to the conceptualization and measurement of intergroup attitudes. Most definitions involve only the affective component of attitudes, and most measurement devices are restricted self-report, paper and pencil questionnaires. A broader and more flexible approach is required to adequately gauge the impact of attitude change interventions in complex community settings. A detailed description is given of the development of an interview and rating scale procedure designed to comprehensively assess the attitudinal properties of cognitive complexity, affective positiveness, and behavioral orientations. Descriptions of the questions, definitions of the rating scales, and details of the rating process are provided. Results from two  attitude change studies in community settings demonstrate satisfactory interrater reliabilities. The rating scales generally exhibit homogeneity within the three main areas and independence among the areas. Factor analysis of rating scores yielded moderate indications of three main factors corresponding to the three attitudinal properties. With further testing and refinement, the procedure is recommended for the assessment of attitudes on dimensions which have significance for real world behavior. (Author)",

Projection strategies were manipulated by encouraging subjects either to attribute the cause of their poor performance to the examiner instead of to themselves (blame projection) or to estimate how poorly their friends would have scored on the test had they taken it and not performed well on it (similarity projection). Measures of subjective anxiety, anger, and depression indicated that (a) the failure feedback was effective in increasing stress, (b) blame projection was effective in controlling stress, and (c) similarity projection was partially effective in controlling stress. The results  provide evidence that blame projection can be effective in controlling stress and also have implications concerning the conditions under which the use of projection will and will not be effective in coping with stress. The importance that situational factors may have on the effectiveness of cognitive coping strategies was emphasized. (Author)",

The primary purpose of the program is to provide an organized developmental service that promotes positive child growth and development. This is to be accomplished through zealous efforts to achieve the following objectives: (1) to aid children in their school adjustment and academic development; (2) to assist children in their personal growth; (3) to assist children in their social development; (4) to help children develop adequate human relation skills; (5) to help children understand the world of work; (6) to assist children to alleviate personal, behavioral, and emotional problems; and (7) to aid children in the development of problem-solving skills. Some of  the activities included in the program are: identifying pupils with special needs, assisting with placement of pupils, counseling individually and in groups with children who have learning, behavioral, and emotional problems, conducting small group guidance sessions with pupils, and conducting parent study group sessions. It is felt that these continuous activities and approaches will lead to fewer delinquents and dropouts. (Author/YRJ)",

This program consisted of a series of workshops which focused on self-awareness activities and provided college and career information. In addition, 20 community college counselors received training in the Motivation Advance Process. A framework for a peer counseling program was established as a post-admission service for the women. Recruitment through mass media, cultural clubs and parents' associations resulted in 672 women attending an initial orientation session. Three hundred forty-one women from various socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds were accepted into the  program. Seventy-six percent of the women completed the program and 72.5% (189 women) subsequently applied for college. The majority of women enrolled in occupational programs. Among the most popular choices were A.A.S. programs in traditionally male dominated fields. One hundred twenty-one full time equivalents were projected for the 189 college applicants. The attrition rate after the first year of college attendance was only 4%. The program was equally effective with all population subgroups. (Author)",

The tendency is either to drink moderately-to heavily or else to abstain. These people are in greater poverty than any other ethnic group. Drinking is viewed as a social activity.

It was determined that the status enjoyed by the elderly of these cultures may have been related to the degree of dependency the younger population expressed toward the elderly. The dependency itself appeared to be the result of how much control, direct or otherwise, the elderly had within their own culture. Variables such as cultural emphasis on productivity, and economic, social, and religious independence of the young from the elderly were believed to be some of the major factors involved in the reduction of the status of the elderly, which is explained as not resulting merely from modernization itself.

The first examined children's assessments of the social desirability of traits which they themselves considered to be either male-or female-stereotyped. It was found that both boys and girls preferred traits which they attributed to their own sex over traits which they attributed to the opposite sex. These findings were stronger for girls than for boys. Furthermore, girls judged traits they considered feminine to be more desirable than boys judged traits which they (boys) considered to be masculine. It was concluded that girls exceeded boys in preference for their own sex role. The second study examined teacher ratings of children whose self-concepts more or less reflected masculine vs. feminine norms. Teachers rated both academic ability and general  social adjustment, including need for mental health referral. Among boys, those with more masculine self concepts were rated as inferior in adjustment and academic ability, although IQ was actually unrelated to masculinity. Among girls, masculine feminine self-concept was unrelated to teacher ratings. It was concluded that boys find themselves in conflict between sex-role consistency and teachers' expectations.

In the issues discussed, no claim is made that the trends shown are generalizable to the total population of the elderly in British Colombia. However, that the issues may be of concern to a large number of the elderly is not contraindicated by these data. The additional,  though as yet unanalyzed, data at hand from approximately 400 other respondents eventually should prove useful in confirming or disconfirming the consistency of present trends.

Models for specific form- and content-schemata are proposed; implications for effective strategies for adult reading are derived from the premises of the model; and four kinds of reading strategies (single-pass, exhaustive  multi-pass, extractive multi-pass, and selective multi-pass) are characterized in terms of the model. In addition, potential applications, suggested by the consequences of the theory, are described. These include uses for headings in texts, means for constructing advance organizers for texts, and training of readers to make more effective use of texts by being sensitive to their motivating tasks and by exploiting their capacities for generating expectations about the meaning of the texts, through conceptually driven processing.

The main political issue in recent years has been the overlapping of the concepts of learning disability and reading disability and the consequent conflict of jurisdiction of reading specialists and learning disability specialists. This overlapping may be solved if new, federally proposed criteria for identifying learning disabilities are adopted. Current diagnostic trends involve the search for deviant brain functioning as a cause of reading disability. With regard to dianostic procedures, there is fairly general agreement that the reading specialist should concentrate on analysis of a child's reading and closely related skills and should refer the minority of  nonresponding cases to multidisciplinary centers or clinics for more detailed study. Remedial procedures include the use of behavior modification, many of the principles of which have been practiced by remedial teachers for many years. Probably the main current issue in remedial teaching is how best to use the reading specialist's time: gradually, the reading specialist is spending more time as a consultant and supervisor and less time in direct teaching.

Such a strategy assumes that it is the organization of ideas from several sources which produces integration in learning and that the quality of the student's written or oral output is influenced by the way in which the reading task is carried out. An effective strategy involves five time-management principles to assure that the task is manageable and three general skill or process areas--search skills, flexible reading skills, and idea integration. Following this strategy makes the task possible and interesting, provides internal  reinforcement, takes fallible memory into account, gives a structure for skill use, and produces a final report of better quality.

Designed to complement the Hawaii English Program, the teaching procedure used both group instruction and peer interaction-it was brief, incorporated materials apparently of high interest for children, and was easy to install. Using first-grade and second-grade children, the first study provided no evidence that the group learned to generalize either graphemic bases or the process of blending beginning sounds and graphemic bases to make a word. The teacher and consultants, however, felt that the students were learning. The study was repeated with the same subjects,  preceeded by additional teaching. Results were similar to those of the first study but suggested that the method used for teaching graphemic bases can be effective in teaching sight words to students. Since only three of the six children learned to decode new words of the same or similar graphemic base, the methods can be considered only partially successful. (HOD)",

Growing evidence is focusing attention on self-image as the crucial determiner of progress. Poor progess in reading at the elementary level leads to poor self-image, which in turn hinders the student in work at the secondary and college levels. Studies of students in college-level reading classes show that students with a high self-image read significantly faster than students with a below-average self-image and that teaching students techniques of reading efficiency helps them to develop a positive self-image. Along with helping students improve their self-image, teachers must help them see the role played by each technique for reading  efficiency and must help them understand the interrelationships of the techniques. Through Active Self Discoveries, students explore their reading speed and rate of comprehension while engaged in such techniques as prereading, skimming, surveying, and study-type reading. Vocabulary development centered on context and derivation is also an important part of a course in reading efficiency.

Departmental meetings were held at which reading specialists discussed specific problems; the specialists then visited the classrooms to demonstrate, to test, and to observe.

Although the television adaptation was inaccurate in many details concerning Eric's life, teenagers were moved to learn more by reading about this teenager who struggled not only for life but for adolescent freedom, with style, humor, and class. Thus, they bought the paperback edition of the book in great quantity, read it, and wrote the author many letters describing their responses to the book. Television, by stirring imaginations and emotions and by awakening curiosity, can pull reluctant readers out of apathy and can become a  stimulus to more and better reading. (JM)",

Data were obtained from children and parents through interviews and direct-observation procedures, including the videotaping of parent and child reading a book together. Findings showed that the total scores of children's attitudes, perceptions, and reading habits were not significantly related to their reading-achievement scores; that children who were read to at home watched less television; that the availability of books from various sources was  significantly related to reading-achievement scores; that parents of low-achieving children corrected their children in a negative way more often than did parents of high achievers; that children who had been read to made greater use of the public library; and that children who were read to more frequently also saw adults read more frequently at home and had more children's books at home.

This report addresses the central question of the mechanisms by which order information is attached to memories. The results of 16 experiments indicate the role of some independent variables on temporal coding in relatively short-term memory and in long-term memory. Several experiments in which changes in proactive inhibition are used as an index of temporal differentiation show that the nature of the words making up the lists is involved fundamentally in temporal coding. Other experiments demonstrate that in relatively short-term memory subjects cannot learn to improve their performance in estimating how far apart in time two events occurred. Still other experiments  show that recency judgments for two events improve with practice, but the improvement is minimally influenced by the temporal separation of the events. The context in which memories are established is shown to influence temporal codes only if an ordering metric is a part of the context. Several theoretical propositions are advanced to account for the findings. (Author)",

Analyses of 16 surface structures representing complexities derived from deep structure indicated an overall increase in syntactic complexities from first to sixth grade in all series. Patterns of increases were irregular, showing no evidence of systematic planning. A sharp increase in the number of total structures was found from first to second grade in the three series. There was a leveling off in the middle grades and another sharp increase from fifth grade to sixth. Significant differences  among the series in the use of particular structures occurred most frequently in the middle grades. (Author/AA)",

Focusing on selections in the first three grades of the 1976 Houghton Mifflin Reading Series, the analyses looked at the sorts of selections the students are asked to read, at the amount of text which they are expected to read independently, at the kinds of questions and activities that follow independent reading, and at how much of a reading selection is highlighted through the postreading activities. Analyses indicated that fiction accounted for a majority of the selections; that the amount of text read independently increased from the early part of first grade to the second half of third grade; that the size of silent reading units for  informational selections was smaller than the size for fictional selections; that the number of questions that required information from more than one sentence in a selection increased with grade level; and that the proportion of the stories that were orally recapitulated in the postreading questions dropped from 88% in the early part of first grade to 15% at the end of third grade.

Two studies were involved in the development of this concept. In the first study, an extensive instrument was designed to measure changes in six variables considered indicative of improvement in skills and qualities in narrative writing. The instrument was used to measure the effectiveness of a self-instructional program which employed a number of instructional strategies. The second study focused on one of the instructional strategies: task-related feedback, or information on performance that is directly related to specific behaviors identified by means of a task analysis of  the performance of narrative writing. The measurement instrument was simplified and transformed into a feedback system used by students and teachers. Findings supported the idea that task-related feedback could result in desirable changes. The implication of the study was that the use of the feedback/measurement system, by itself, could be an effective instructional procedure. (Author/LJR)",

Three major sources for this uneasiness are: (1) English teachers are uncertain about their basic purpose. Historically, the emphasis in the English profession has shifted from sharing the best that has been thought and said, to literary history, to rigorous literary analysis, to the function and relevance of the literary work. (2) English teachers are uncertain about the parameters of their subject matter. (3) English teachers are uncertain whether English is essential to the life of our time. In fact, the English profession does have a unique and essential service to offer: training students to read, for pleasure and stimulation as well as understanding, and to write every type of written  discourse. English subject matter should be everything in writing that is the product of the verbal imagination, and teachers must be flexible enough to suit the material to the students and to build bridges between popular works and traditionally admired works. The undergraduate program should focus on training students in the arts of reading and writing; graduate programs should stress the acquisition of skills for future occupations, rather than subject matter; and, increasingly, the obligation of the profession should extend to adults throughout society who seek intellectual stimulation.

These were analyzed using a rating scale that examined content, language, and pictures and that yielded a numerically weighted sexual bias score for each book. Both the studies summarized in the annotated bibliography and the  analyses of the three new samples indicated a consistent male bias. Though that bias was softened in books written by females, the bias was still strong enough to reinforce the stereotyped female image that dominates children's literature.

Children on the verge of metaphoric understanding of metaphors which link psychological and physical states show a mastery of the concept of making a link between the physical and the psychological and grasp the broad polarities of each domain, but make imprecise connections between them. Hypothesizing that the ability to articulate the underlying \"core meaning\" of a word was a necessary condition for correct paraphrase of a metaphoric sentence using the word, a further study showed instead that comprehension of  metaphor does not require knowledge of core meanings of the key words. As an alternate explanation, it is suggested that children's understanding of metaphor is a reflection of (1) their knowledge of the real world and (2) their capacity to think analogically. (AA)",

The students studied the faces of people of various ages; explored &quot;masks&quot; that people wear in different situations; learned about the use of ritual masks; made case studies of individuals to show facial changes that occur with mood changes; studied different facial expressions that people use as one way of manipulating others; related facial expressions to the ego states described in transactional analysis; and studied the relationships between facial type and ancestral background. Throughout the unit the children were encouraged to verbalize about their findings. In addition to expressing their findings in journals, letters, essays,  descriptions, plays, poems, and a class booklet, the children employed fabric collages, a slide presentation, charts, pantomime, and plaster-of-paris masks in reporting their conclusions to others. The teacher, as facilitator, poser of questions, and resource person, performed as a catalyst to enhance such interacting forces as the environment, books, and other people. (GW)",

Results indicated that, of the two ACT subtests, ACT English was the better predictor. ACT Social Studies alone was not significantly related to either of the criterion variables. For the Nelson-Denny, performance was positively related to ACT English and SAT Verbal scores. High school grade-point average varied significantly with Nelson-Denny scores. For  the Cooperative English Test, a three-way interaction was present; in order to predict Cooperative English scores, information would be required on level of ACT or SAT score, sex, and race of the student. Class size, rank in class, autonomy, and complexity did not vary significantly with either the Nelson-Denny or the Cooperative English Test. (Author/AA)",

This was a subsample drawn from the fall 1974 and spring 1975 Virginia Educational Needs Assessment. A direct linear dependency between student attitudes and composition quality was found in this sample. General student attitudes contributed the greater proportion of the variance, indicating that self-concept and attitudes associated with success in school were also associated with success in writing. Student attitudes toward reading were also significant predictors of success in writing. Grade level, while an important predictor, was not as strong a predictor as either attitude  measure. (AA)",

Student responses during the seminar showed that attitude changes--willingness to see things a new way--are essential to teaching (students or teachers) in a two-year college.  (JM)",

To build upon observational skills, teachers may encourage the prewriting habit of journal keeping; journal notation is a helpful step in ordering responses to experience. Other prewriting experiences include sensory perception experiments, note taking, creative drama, and the writing of free verse.

The primary purpose of the study is descriptive, though the results of the descriptive analysis will permit a comparison of twelfth graders' writing with college students' writing. The descriptive analysis is designed to define separately expressive, explanatory, and persuasive discourse according to three kinds of structural patterns: syntax, cognitive strategies, and larger rhetorical patterns. The writing tasks used are arranged into the three major discourse categories; the tasks within each of the categories present the writer with varied audiences and topics. It is anticipated that both the  careful differentiation of writing contexts presented in the tasks and the comprehensive structural analysis will culminate in empirically based and generalizable definitions of student writing performance in three types of discourse. It is also anticipated that the study will yield information about the relationship between maturity and discourse type. (Author/AA)",

The mechanics of English composition are categorized into specific areas of competence; these categories form the basis for three tracks, taught simultaneously throughout the quarter. Students are assigned to that track in which their writing reveals them to be most deficient; at the end of each ten-week cycle, students are retested and may be reassigned to the same track or assigned to a different one. In evaluative questionnaires completed by students, 78% of students have indicated preference for the track method over the regular lecture method. In an effort to evaluate the approach analytically, a study was made to determine whether  students taught by this method in the first quarter of freshman English would earn higher grades in the second quarter than would students taught by the traditional method. Analysis of the results indicated that students taught by the track approach tended to be better prepared for the second quarter course and that the track method is equally effective with students of verbal ability above or below the median of their peers.

The data were spontaneous speech samples volunteered by the participants, who were male and female children enrolled in a Head Start program in Harlem. Findings showed that the subjects' syntactic maturity was comparable to that of their white, middle-class counterparts. Syntactic differences were primarily due to omissions (usually of  tense-bearing elements) and to different restrictions on transformations. There was no evidence to support suggestions of deep structure differences between standard English and black English vernacular. There was some evidence to suggest that young children do not produce as wide a variety of nonstandard forms as do their older counterparts. (Author/AA)",

Results in five major areas--curriculum, cocurricular activities, teacher characteristics, student teachers, and facilities and equipment--are summarized in this report. Nearly 93% of the schools surveyed offered at least one course in speech. About half of the speech teachers had an academic major in speech. The typical teacher could expect to teach English and speech, to coach debate, individual events, or drama, and to have an extensive cocurricular work load. The majority of the curricular programs were traditional in nature, with major units centering on various types of speaking  activities. However, there was an apparent shift toward the inclusion of more instruction in intrapersonal, interpersonal, and small group behavior in the basic course. These and other findings were found to be related to the size of the school. (AA)",

        "description":"A total of 224 college students participated in a study of the relationships between dogmatism and authoritarianism and the characteristics of written discourse. Early in the semester each class completed a public opinion poll which included a combination of the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale and the California F Scale. In a seemingly unrelated task assigned later in the semester, students were asked to write a two-page message to a hostile audience on a topic about which they felt strongly. Three thematic, two logical, and three stylistic content analyses were carried out on the compositions. Analyses of results for the 148 students for whom complete data were available indicated that dogmatism and authoritarianism were related but discriminable entities. Authoritarianism was not  reflected in the various measures of aspects of written discourse, while dogmatism, although highly correlated with authoritarianism, was related to communicative behavior. When persuading others, the low scorers sought more factual judgments, made more assertions, and asked more questions than did the high scorers. In addition, high and low scorers tended to use more qualifiers than did moderate scorers. (AA)",

This study attempts to assess the validity of this assumption by comparing the content of two sources generally available to United States school children: The &quot;Weekly Reader&quot; and television news. For two ten-week periods, the fourth-grade, fifth-grade, and sixth-grade editions of the &quot;Weekly Reader&quot; were analyzed for content. Each article was coded separately for such dimensions as length of item, number of accompanying photographs, and subject. Concurrently, abstracts of network television news broadcasts were analyzed for content, with broadcast time substituted for column inches as the indicator of story emphasis. Variations between the manifest  content of the &quot;Reader&quot; and the content of television news can be attributed to both audience and institutional differences. Generally, findings indicate that the primary value of the &quot;Reader&quot; is as a classroom heuristic--its value as a source of news and political information is minimal. (KS)",

The conceptual framework employed proposes a continuum of audience involvement--in some studies, audience reaction is no more than implied, while in others, audience interaction is examined to some degree. This framework sets the stage for the paper's main thesis: that methods need to be employed in media-effects studies so that audience interaction may be taken into full account. It is contended that more attention needs to be focused on the communication network in the study of health communication and on  the role of mass communication in general. (KS)",

Analysis of results showed that white children indicate significantly higher levels of awareness than do black children and that older children demonstrate significantly higher levels of understanding than do younger children. Several disturbing health and  nutritional implications are discussed, and the study concludes that it is important to know the extent to which subtle or implied appeals are internalized by children of various levels of cognitive development.

The analysis concentrates primarily on efforts to make an impact through external funding--the project approach to innovation. Several of the illustrations are drawn from the experiences of the Teacher Corps and its numerous projects, including one that involved the author. The change process is divided into three stages: (1) the planning stage, during which proposals for projects are conceived, developed, and funded; (2) the implementation stage, when the  proposed impact is expected to be made; and (3) the evaluation stage, when the degree to which an impact has been made is assessed. The three stages overlap at certain points and are not regarded as mutually exclusive or temporally discrete. Recommendations for avoiding negative by-products are made, and consideration is given to the value of incremental change. (Author/MLF)",

Second, artists and musicians can be hired to provide programs for a semester or more inside a school. This requires that the artists and teachers receive special training.

These different judges of effective teaching were found to nominate different teachers, with very low rank-order correlations between the top ten teachers in each group in each school. By using standard evaluative instruments, different judges were also found to favor a different group of teachers. Principals rated the teachers in group (a)  the highest; the teachers in group (c) rated themselves the highest; and students rated the teachers in group (b) the highest. No judge rated the teachers in the control group the highest. This finding was seen as partially validating the results of the &quot;voting method&quot; as used in this study. (Author/JG)",

The first step involved analyzing a set of problems, to determine the knowledge (rules) required for solving the problems. A set of geometric construction problems was analyzed using a method for deriving and simplifying rules or algorithms for solving the problems. Next, assumptions were adopted concerning how subjects learn and apply rules to solve problems. A computer was programmed according to these assumptions, and given some of the simplified rules identified during the previous step, in order to simulate some aspects of subjects'  problem-solving and learning. Various problem sequences were then given to the program, to identify those that were solvable and \"learnable.\" Finally, for initial evaluation of the approach, sequences that were learnable for the program were given to subjects, whose performance was compared with the performance of subjects given random or learner-controlled sequences.

        "description":"Administrative isolation involves the absence of colleagues to share problems, seek advice, offer and receive feedback, and obtain valid information regarding one's professional effectiveness. This condition of administrative isolation is exacerbated for women in administrative roles who are further isolated by their minority status. This paper describes the creation, development, and maintenance of two professional support groups of women managers. The first group was formed with the intent of developing a professional support system, and all of its members came from the same school system. The second group was convened to develop an instrument for obtaining data on administrative effectiveness; implicit in the design, however, was the formation of a professional support system.  The members of the group were drawn from different school systems. Additionally, the paper describes the experience of a male group of educational leaders engaged in the development of a professional effectiveness instrument. Impressionistic comparisons are offered between the men's and women's groups. Finally, the two conditions favoring the development and maintenance of such groups are discussed. (Author/MLF)",

A study was performed to investigate three basic linkages specified in the traditional rational adaptation paradigm during the implementation of a new budget structure in a multicampus community college district. Loose coupling between elements of the paradigm was found to be a dominant feature of the process, suggesting the implementation is perhaps best described as more intentionally (than actually) rationally adaptive.

This proposal is the use of school site management. This reform offers the best immediate and practical prospect for achieving the kind of fiscally and educationally responsive schools we need. Centralized school budgeting as it is now practiced has several deficiencies--it assumes sustained growth, increases educational inequalities, contributes to inefficiencies, and stifles citizen participation. The topics covered in discussing school site management as a significant reform are the school site as the basic unit of educational management, parent advisory councils, the principal as education manager, school site  budgeting, the state's role in school site management, annual performance reports, collective bargaining, and parent choice of school program. The phases of implementation of such a program are also outlined. (Author/IRT)",

Boards with at least two women members were less likely to conceal the decision-making process from the public and did, in fact, have more internal conflict. Women respondents emphasized the importance of \"hearing complaints and grievances of parents\" and \"maintaining contact with state and federal legislators\" substantially more than did their male counterparts.

Still, few students are either offenders or victims in serious incidents. A critical review of the literature suggests the following conclusions about trends in school violence and disruption that vary partially from frequently accepted opinion: (1) while disruptive and violent conditions have worsened in recent years, the origins of the present problems are discernible some 20 years ago; (2) the degree to which trends in the last several years can be determined is  hampered by limitations in the available evidence on the subject; (3) although disruptive and violent conditions may be at unacceptably high levels in many American schools today, not all schools are equally affected and it is not clear that such conditions continue to worsen presently in the aggregate.

Spoken English empasizes oral facility with attention to grammatical structure and pronunciation. Directed Discussion, for advanced students, gives further practice in oral presentations and discussions. Reading English emphasizes reading comprehension and the development of related study skills, including vocabulary and reading rate. Written English stresses syntax, idiomatic usage, and the mechanics of writing compositions. Advanced Grammar reviews English structure and  gives students practice with formal writing styles. Listening with understanding is the focus of the Aural Comprehension course. Selected Problems in English is offered in the immersion program just prior to the opening of the fall semester and is designed to treat problems in various aspects of the language skills. It also serves as a kind of orientation to the American college and educational system.

The current evaluation is the second phase of a three-year study and concerns the 1975-76 academic year. Forty-eight first graders in the bilingual program were matched with a control group on the variables of grade level, sex, age, PMA scores, and socioeconomic status. Fifty-one second graders were matched with a control group according to the same variables. Achievement instruments to evaluate academic progress in reading, math, and language skills were administered. Parent, teachers, and principal attitudes were sampled. Results show that: (1) students in the bilingual program achieved as well in English  language arts and in mathematics as students not in the program at both the grade one and two levels; (2) students were making significant progress in learning the Ukrainian language at both the grade one and two levels; (3) attitudes of the parents, students, teachers and principals were very positive toward the program; (4) according to the perceptions of both parents and teachers, students acquired an appreciation of the Ukrainian culture and an understanding of the Ukrainian Catholic Rite.

        "description":"Two hypotheses proposed to explain the variance in second language tests are investigated. Hypothesis 1 (H1) claims that language skill is separable into components either related to linguistically defined categories (e.g., listening, speaking, reading, and writing). Another possibility (H2) is that second language ability may be a more unitary factor, so that once the common variance on a variety of language tasks is explained, essentially no meaningful unique variance attributable to separate components will remain. Previous studies have provided rather convincing support for H2. Data from 159 Iranian subjects at the University of Tehran, Iran who took a cloze test, a dictation, and the five subparts of the Test of English as a Foreign Language also support H2 in this report.  However, when an oral interview task is included, the picture is less clear. Data from 106 foreign students (from mixed language backgrounds) at the Center for English as a Second Language at Southern Illinois University suggest the possibility of unique variances associated with separate skills.

The evaluation included the pupils enrolled in the first class established at each grade level, and focussed on the following four questions: (1) Are pupils developing competence in the French language; (2) Is the development of reading and arithmetic skills comparable to that of pupils in an English-only program; (3) Are pupils developing a positive self-image; and (4) Has the development of intellectual and cognitive abilities been hindered as a result of instruction in a second language? In addition to data gathered each year from pupils participating in the program, their parents were asked to complete questionnaires regarding their opinions of  the program, as well as their general attitudes toward French and toward learning a second language. The report is divided into two major sections. Part 1 describes both the method for collecting data from pupils, and the results of the data analysis for each of the three grade levels, respectively. Part 2 outlines the results of the parent questionnaires distributed each year. (Author/CLK)",

        "description":"This article considers some of the implications of the position developed by Allwright and Long in their respective papers, both of which are found in this issue of \"ELT Documents.\" Basically the position is that methodological emphasis should be placed on the second language learner rather than on the teacher. Teachers faced with large, not particularly motivated beginner classes, and lacking in expensive equipment, might question this position. A solution might be to discuss the nature of teacher intervention rather than its extent. The search for \"real\" language in the second language classroom is misplaced, but the teacher must ensure that practice in fluency is emphasized as much as accuracy. For this to take place, a considerable part of the responsibility for the content  of language work must be placed on the pupil. This way the kind of work outlined by Allwright and Long will be possible at intermediate and advanced stages without a major break in learning style. This presupposes a number of techniques for use in the classroom which are not currently accepted. These include: (1) giving pupils the opportunity to make mistakes, (2) use of the mother tongue or a mixture of the mother tongue and the second language in the early stages, (3) giving pupils a moment to think about responses before giving them, and (4) practice of pupils' utterances in pairs where possible.

Alternatives that the profession may have to consider in this regard are discussed, and some possible courses of action are suggested. The chances of future survival of discipline-oriented associations such as the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) in the face of competition from unions is considered in the light of a futurist approach. The purpose of the futurist movement in education is to find a new basis for organizing the instructional process. The pedagogical applications of the futurist movement to foreign language education are discussed, including Toffler's system of skills involving three  primary areas: (1) learning how to learn, (2) relating to other people, and (3) making intelligent value judgements. Professional organizations such as ACTFL are needed to identify and implement educational alternatives. Central activities include exchanging ideas about classroom practice, publishing theoretical articles, and applying theories through workshops and conferences. It is also important to have a single professional voice to speak out for the entire membership at the national level. The current status of ACTFL and its importance in making the foreign language instructional program attractive are also reviewed. (CLK)",

Some of the advantages to be gained by the children were greater readiness for school work in general, greater creative abilities, an increase in the level of general intelligence and improvement in general verbal ability. The children were divided into ten groups with a maximum of eight in each group. Four groups of kindergartners had French lessons for half an hour a day, three days a week, and six groups of pre-schoolers had fifteen minutes of instruction per week. Using visual aids to reinforce verbal cues, the children were first taught simple  words and then sentence utterances. It was found that this foreign language experience improved intangibles, such as general verbal acquisition skills, and that elements of the established curriculum were strengthened and reinforced. Three sample lessons are outlined: Colors, Animals and Bing (a review game similar to Bingo). (CFM)",

No such studies have been conducted with Spanish. The investigator hypothesized that since Spanish is a phonetic language permitting easy transcription without comprehension, the dictation would not serve as a good substitute measure of language competence. In order to test this hypothesis 127 students enrolled in first-year Spanish at the University of Colorado were read a 106-word dictation together with a 100-item final examination. The results of each test were then correlated by computer and a Pearson product-moment coefficient of .50 was obtained.  The scores on both tests for all students are displayed on a scatter diagram, and the reliability of both tests was ascertained using the Kuder-Richardson 21 formula. The results indicate general confirmation of the research hypothesis that the dictation is significantly less useful as a proficiency measure for Spanish than for French and English. (Author)",

Examination of the frequency of preposition errors in obligatory contexts reveals: (a) the order of preposition acquisition is essentially the same for the monolingual and bilingual students at both grade levels; (b) the rate of acquisition for the locative prepositions &quot;to&quot; and &quot;into&quot; is lower for the bilinguals than for the monolinguals, although the rate of acquisition for other prepositions is similar for the two groups; and (c) the types of errors  found in the bilinguals' preposition usage differ from those found in the monolinguals'. It is argued that points (b) and (c) may indicate influence of French preposition usage, particularly of the prepositions &quot;a&quot; (&quot;at,&quot;&quot;to&quot;) and &quot;dans&quot; (&quot;in,&quot;&quot;into&quot;), on the bilinguals' acquisition of the English locatives &quot;to&quot; and &quot;into.&quot; Such interference may thus have a retarding effect on acquisition of certain prepositions in a second language.

The traditional testing system used in Romania is described and evaluated, with special attention to EFL testing at all educational levels, as reported in major journals and a few unpublished documents. At the request of Romanian educational officials, an experiment was carried out using an American-made objective-standardized EFL test upon a population of 201 Romanian students of English. Subjects represented three levels: 12th graders,  university freshmen, and university juniors. The conditions of the experiment as well as the basic statistical information the tests yielded are described. Finally, general guidelines for a grounded theory of objective testing of EFL in Romania are suggested. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"Free speech samples and aural cloze test scores were collected from 24 Spanish-surnamed children at the beginning of first grade. The children were members of two classrooms, and each class received instruction from a Spanish-speaking bilingual teacher and an English-speaking monolingual teacher. The children were learning to read in Spanish and English. Spanish and English speech samples, which represented stories formulated by the children from picture books without words, were scored for grammaticality, verb tenses and sentence transformations. The scores were subsequently grouped into high, medium and low language control categories. Spanish and English cloze tests, administered in oral form, were scored for exact matching, appropriate synonyms and retention of appropriate  syntax or meaning. A high relationship appeared to exist between the ability to perform predicting tasks, such as the cloze, and high control of language. When these language tasks were compared with teachers' estimates of reading success, a similar relationship existed; i.e., children with high or medium control of Spanish or English were more likely to be reading than children with low language control. Those children who showed adequate control in both languages were reading in both languages. Some children with high control in one language were learning to read in both languages. (Author/CFM)",

Fourteen types of institutional abuses are outlined in this summary report. Additional data were collected using specially-developed survey instruments (the Institutional Report Forms  (IRF) and the Enrolled Student Questionnaire). Explanatory manuals for private and public agencies interested in using the study findings were also developed. Suggestions are offered for reducing the potential for abuse. Among the recommendations are the establishment of an information system for sharing and disseminating state-agency produced IRF scores and for increased awareness by accreditation agencies. (LBH)",

Comparisons are made between 1976 students and students entering in previous years as well as comparisons with students entering other universities on a national scale.

The results demonstrate that different factors contribute to satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The hygiene factors of policies and practices, salary budgets, supervision and technical factors, and the time element were strong contributors to dissatisfaction. The motivators of achievement, recognition, and growth opportunities were highly associated with satisfying teaching  experiences. The hygiene factor of interpersonal relations with students and the motivators of responsibility and advancement acted in the direction opposite to that predicted according to Herzberg's theory.

Realization of the need to improve the preparation of higher education administrators goes back several decades. Even today many individuals come to those positions with limited training and perhaps no administrative experience. While first-hand experience may be the best way to learn administration in the long run, trial-and-error learning alone can be expensive and inefficient both for the employee and for the institution. Professional development programs have evolved noticeably in the last decade, and a number of regional and national higher education associations and institutions have sponsored major efforts. However, these programs do not meet all the needs of postsecondary  education. Often neglected in administrator training are the department chairmen, who remain the essential link between faculty and administration in most institutions. What might be very useful is some major national service that would help clarify, coordinate, consolidate, improve, and expand on (but not control) the present varied professional development alternatives.

Karl Massanari examines the changes currently affecting the education of teachers--social, political, and those within education and teacher education. From this discussion, the basis is laid for proposals responding to these changes. William Drummond explores the current situation in colleges and universities, examines internal problems in these institutions, and discusses sixteen potential roles for the college-based teacher educator. W. Robert Houston develops the major thesis that social and educational developments call for  new professional roles in teacher education. Roles of those persons responsible for staff development are explored, and on the basis of past and present practices, nine theses suggesting future practices for school based staff development are presented. In summarizing the contextual conditions determining new and modified roles for teacher educators, Massanari examines the characteristics of the arena in which educational professional development takes place and calls attention to underlying issues that will eventually determine what new roles will be created and supported. In his summary critique, Roy Edelfelt reacts to the contributions of each of the preceding writers and argues that the separate efforts of schools and colleges need not be in contest, that there is more work to be done  in pre- and inservice education than all college- and school-based educators can handle, and that the problem lies in developing programs and approaches that satisfy practitioner needs.

The class of fifteen students was divided into groups of three, defined as \"mutual support groups,\" with each member contributing to and responsible for the performance of others. The first task assigned these \"trios\" was to identify desirable competencies, compare them with the other small groups in the class, and finally arrive at mutually agreed upon goals upon which evaluation of performance could be based. In the field these students were assigned to different schools so the group could receive maximum exposure to different teachers, students, and perspectives on curriculum. Shortly before an active week of student teaching, the trios met to discuss plans for their mini-units, to schedule  days for cross-visitation, and to share concerns about likely problems with students or cooperating teachers. Observation and evaluation of members of the group took place during student teaching. The author concludes that this method of instruction, properly organized and supervised, has considerable merit.

        "description":"An expansion is made of P. E. Meehl's observations on nuisance variables and the ex post facto research design. Implications these observations have for educational research design are discussed. Meehle (1970) considered that suggested resolutions of problems in &quot;not truly experimental&quot; (NTE) research (i.e., matching, partial correlation, and analysis of covariance) may generate more problems than they resolve. Three reasons he notes are systematic unmatching, unrepresentative subpopulations, and the causal arrow ambiguity. It is the first of these reasons to which the author devotes most of his attention. An extended statistical analysis of a hypothetical case involving achievement need leads to the conclusions, supported by L. J. Cronbach and Meehl (1955), that a construct  derives its meaning from the network of relationships that connect it with other constructs and with observables. When nuisance variables are partialled out or controlled, the relationships among residual variables are not the same as the relationships among the original variables, and their construct status cannot be assumed to be the same. The author suggests that the most useful way to deal with the problem of interpreting NTE research is to live with nuisance variables by incorporating them into models of behavior, arguing that, if naturally occurring characteristics confound each other, it makes no sense to try to isolate individual effects. Rather, more observations across time should be made in an attempt to capture the interweaving of variables. (MJB)",

        "description":"The rise of interest in the evaluation of teacher education and training during the decade 1967-1977 is charted; a review of related concepts and studies is presented; and three evaluation models for conducting follow-up studies on training effectiveness are examined. Three issues arising to prominence in the last decade are identified and discussed: pay-off evaluation, process evaluation, and goal assessment. A review of the status of process-product findings and studies that produced them are linked with the concepts of competency-based evaluation and follow-up evaluation. Five major process-product studies, comprising the research base from which many teacher competencies have been devised, are examined, their general methodological concepts summarized, and findings listed.  Common characteristics of these product-process investigations are correlated, and limitations of these methodologies in the conduct of inservice evaluations are discussed. Three generic models are presented to portray the variety of methodologies commonly employed in teacher evaluations: Needs Assessment, Relative Gain, and Process-Product. Various context in which these three models can be used are discussed, and case studies are presented to illustrate the contextual characteristics most often associated with each of the evaluation models. Key variables that suggest the use of one model over another are also identified. (MJB)",

There was unanimous agreement between the three groups that there is not enough inservice currently provided to teachers. However, there was wide variation of opinion on what the best type of inservice program might be, who can best implement it, and how it should be financed. Tables and data analysis accompanying this paper illustrate these differences of opinion in the following areas: (1) who provides the most help in an inservice program; (2) teacher and professor perceptions of what format of inservice is most likely to provide innovative content; (3) teacher interest in assuming an inservice instructor role;  (4) parents' attitudes toward inservice programs; (5) what sources of funding should be used for paid inservice education; and (6) what type of inservice education is an excellent or good idea. This study was conducted in three states--Michigan, Georgia, and California--and included both urban and rural communities. (JD)",

        "description":"One aspect of Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development was tested in this research project. It was hypothesized that an adult individual in the concrete stage of development is able to use seriation and classification in dealing with concrete objects, but is unable to think in terms of possibilities. An individual operating on the formal level of thinking, on the other hand, is able to generate the full range of possible solutions to a problem, reasoning systematically and using verbally stated propositions rather than concrete objects. The purpose of this research was to establish an empirical basis for the translation of Piaget's theory of formal operations into teacher classroom behavior and to determine whether teachers can distinguish between concrete and formal styles  of teaching. A recognition task was developed that was designed to measure cognitive functioning in the educational domain. This was accomplished by designing two videotapes depicting teachers teaching the same subject: fire prevention. One teacher operated at the concrete level of thought, the other at the formal level. Seventy teachers viewed the videotapes and were asked to respond by describing observed teacher behaviors and rating the formal and concrete teachers on different characteristics. The subjects were also required to reply to questions designed to reveal how accurately they perceived the information presented in the videotapes, how fully they understood the more technical details of the presentation, and how much teaching experience each of them had. Preliminary results  indicated that teachers may possess the underlying structures necessary for formal thought but their manifestion of formal thinking is perhaps dependent upon the subject matter in which they are tested.

Historically, liberal education has addressed itself to the task of determining and clarifying human needs and values. The major goal of education, as defined in this paper, is that of forming a rational, moral, and active participant in society. Liberal arts curricula emphasizes the development of the complete individual who has social conscience and a willingness to improve all of society rather than to think of education only in terms of production and consumption. Given this definition and description of liberal education, the question is asked, &quot;Is teacher preparation consistent with liberal  education?&quot; The author concludes that a carefully designed program of teacher education can be consistent with the goals and assumptions of the liberal arts college or university. An investigation of the ties between this type of teacher education with other groups and institutions involved in the teacher preparation process is presented. It is pointed out that competency based teacher education and the liberal arts education are not necessarily incompatible, but rather might reinforce the strong points implicit in both philosophies.

Two roles for arts and sciences are described: first, that of enriching teacher lives so that they may enrich others, and second, that of providing a broad background against which teachers may view their own specialties. It is argued that nontraditional means of delivering inservice education must be utilized, since many teachers would be hesitant to enroll in campus-based programs in which their progress would be rated against that of subject specialists. Motivation techniques for involving teachers in inservice courses  include combining inservice with preservice education, assessment-diagnosis centers (with physical examinations, mental/emotional tests, and interviews), and integrative frameworks in which the teacher helps to determine personal development levels and needs. Three programs of inservice education are examined: (1) a counselor entry approach, describing methods for easing counselors into fully responsible counseling positions; (2) a modified counselor entry program applicable to teachers; and (3) a three-stage model of teacher growth proceeding from presentation-centered to interaction-centered, to pupil-centered activities.

The major problem associated with employing more invitational teachers has been one of identification; this study tested a set of self-instructional materials which would supply teacher selection officials with the skills necessary to make accurate assessment of perceptual orientations for use in teacher selection. The results indicate that teacher selection officials can be trained to use perceptual inference data in making teacher selection decisions. The self-instructional material developed provided selection officials with a high degree  of inference skill. A second conclusion was that the ability to make reliable perceptual evaluations depends to some degree on the perceptual orientation of the person making the evaluation. (Author/JD)",

Competency teams were established to identify course equivalencies in specified teaching areas, and the result of this effort was the compilation of a Teaching Internship Handbook to be used as a guide in the program. Seminars were held on the college campus to deal with the content and skills areas of these concerns. The goal of the TEMP program was to broaden the base for decision  making in the professional preparation of teachers by sharing responsibility with persons representing college faculty, the school system, and the teaching profession in order to capitalize on the diversity of talent and the perspective for designing and executing an elementary teacher education program focused on the urban elementary school. Within the cooperative framework of this program, teacher interns worked a full year in the public schools.

The MECCA model incorporates collaboration between the learning disabilities teacher and the classroom teacher within the classroom using a task analysis process for building sequentially on students' successful accomplishments. The basic goals of the program are to provide a classroom-based diagnostic procedure for SLD and to develop the best possible teaching approaches and strategies for each child by combining the knowledge and experience of regular and special educators within the classroom environment. After screening, thirty-seven kindergarten students were  identified as children at risk of failing reading by the end of second grade. These children remained in their respective classrooms with other children but received individual attention, intervention, and diagnosis on a daily basis. Reading and readiness scores of this group at the end of kindergarten and again at the end of first grade were compared to similar children in a control group. Results of this research indicate that appropriate intervention for children with potential learning problems at the start of kindergarten will improve performance in later grades. Another implication of the finding was the efficacy of collaboration between classroom teachers and special educators in individualizing instruction for children with potential SLD problems. (JD)",

        "description":"Data taken from four studies of behavioristic and humanistic precollege psychology teachers in Florida and Mississippi are examined with respect to the objectives for offering and reasons for taking the psychology course, the topics and content that are and should be included in the course, and the audiovisual and instructional aids that are desired by both teachers and students for use in these courses. The teachers were compared in one form or another along 105 different variable combinations and were found to be statistically similar on 104 of them. When the two groups of teachers were compared with the various combinations of student response data, it was found that they were statistically similar on 83 of the 84 variables on which coefficients were computed. Finally, all 15  of the correlations among student data were found to be significant. Hence, only two of the 204 coefficients computed among these various group data were found to be at a nonsignificant level of agreement. Since these teachers were &quot;identical&quot; to one another and in their agreement with their students, the answer to who comes closest to meeting the needs and wants of precollege psychology students is simple: neither. This answer is significant in the fact that there is now empirical support for the argument that humanistic and behavioristic approaches to psychology are not dichotomous, but are indeed complementary to each other.

        "description":"The evolution of collaborative work relationships among teachers was studied in 13 elementary schools implementing the Wisconsin plan for Individually-Guided Education in a Multi-Unit School. Two hypotheses were entertained: that task interdependence in the teaching of students would (l) raise the level of work-related communication among teachers and (2) increase the scope of joint responsibility for the management of working conditions. These predictions were tested with data collected from individual teachers but aggregated to the level of the formal work \"unit\" or team. Data collected at four separate times over a period of two years were employed in the analysis. Results supported the prediction of communication but not the prediction of joint responsibility. Although  positive cross-sectional correlations were observed between task interdependence and both communication and team management, multiple regression analyses for lagged effects produced only two significant results. During the second year of implementation, the extensity of task interdependence did exhibit positive effects on the extensity and frequency of team communication. However, it is suggested that highly intense task interdependence is characteristic of separate pairs of teachers rather than the larger, formal team, and might even be considered competitive with overall team collegiality.

The meanings of &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;theory building&quot; are discussed, including what theory is, the forms it can take, and alternative methods for its construction. The paucity of theoretical effort in current research on teaching is attributed to misconceptions of its scope (i.e., that theory must be all inclusive) and role (a product rather than a process). Glaser and Strauss are cited as the foremost proponents of grounded theory, and the basic components of their research/theory process are described. Two examples of the use of grounded theory in recent  educational research are given. A concluding argument is presented: that grounded theory, in addition to being an effective descriptive tool, may also be an effective method for the generation of prescriptive theory. Use of the process in this latter role would aid in the establishment of a dialectic between educational research and educational practice. (MJB)",

The survey utilized a national probability sample of districts, schools, and teachers. Approximately 10,000 teachers, principals, superintendents, and state and local supervisors were included in the sample. Response rates ranged from 72 percent for local supervisors to 90 percent for state supervisors. A major purpose of the survey was to provide the National Science Foundation with the accurate and up-to-date information needed to make decisions about future funding of curriculum development and teacher education activities. The sample design, and procedures used in instrument  development and data collection, are described in section one. Selected results are presented in section two, and section three discusses some of the implications of these results for teacher education, such as teacher characteristics, sources of information, the use of various instructional materials and techniques, and areas in which teachers need additional assistance.

One elementary teacher's planning decisions were studied during five months of classroom instruction. Both ethnographic and information processing approaches were used to describe distinctive features of the teacher's planning &quot;technology&quot; and to develop two models of teacher planning. Two central aspects of the teacher's planning and instruction that emerged in this study were planning for instructional activities and the use of teaching routines. The structural model identifies five levels of planning used by this teacher: (1) yearly planning; (2) term planning; (3) unit planning; (4) weekly planning; and (5) daily planning. Goals, cues,  form, and effectiveness criteria used at each level are described. The process model represents decision processes differing from the goals-alternatives-choice sequence of the linear planning model. Problem finding, problem formulation, and a design process involving cycles of plan elaboration and mental &quot;trying out&quot; are presented as major planning processes. (Author/JD)",

Four stages of innovation (adoption, planning, implementation, and institutionalization) are isolated and described, and the attention paid by this investigation to the innovation studies (unit organization) is detailed. Unit organization is defined as the arrangement of an (elementary) school faculty into small, permanent, work groups, each with exclusive membership and exclusive instructional responsibility for a large number of children. The outcome variables considered as central elements of the team teaching situation resulting from unit organization are identified as instructional interdependence and collegial  decision making. Various through-time changes and other potential predictors of these variables are discussed. The relationships of fixed and planning strategy variables and of implementation strategy variables to performance on these two outcome variables are described. Using preunitization characteristics of the subject schools, prediction was found possible for both variables through the end of the first year, but not beyond. Strategies of planning for the innovation also showed the same predictive ability. In schools where the innovation was first expressed through gains in instructional interdependence in reading and language arts, and where interdependence appeared to be more a school-wide unit-level phenomenon rather than an isolated teacher-pair phenomenon, the innovation thrived  over the long term.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to generate a theory of role personalization grounded in data obtained from beginning secondary teachers. Role personalization is defined as the way beginning teachers adapt the teacher role to meet their own needs, while at the same time being socialized into the role demanded by others. Ten beginning secondary teachers participated in the study during their first and third years of teaching. Four major motivating needs were expressed by teachers entering their first year of teaching: the needs for respect, liking, belonging, and sense of competence. Three years later they still focused on these four major needs, but the need for respect had less salience. A fifth need, for variety, emerged after three years of teaching. The teachers' concept of  themselves, the role ideal, problems, and perceptions of others changed very little from the first to the third year, although perceptions of their own competence were strengthened. The teachers' needs-disposition permeated their perceptions of role, self, problems, and others, which, in turn, affected the behaviors they chose in enacting the role of teacher. Early in their role adoption as teachers they sought to present themselves as competent and like their ideal, by achieving control of students and not asking for help from peers. Later they sought to present themselves in a manner that would gain student affection. By the third year, in keeping with their growing need for variety, they began to present themselves as innovative and willing to try new things. (JD)",

In illustrating this thesis, the author develops a design generally regarded as a &quot;research&quot; design and shows the evaluative purposes for which the design may be used. A Teacher Corps/Trenton (New Jersey) State College/Trenton Public School inservice program for the improvement of reading instruction skills was chosen as the subject of the study. Observational data on teacher change due to training, effectiveness of varying training programs, and the relationship between change/level of teacher skills and pupil gains in reading are presented.  The data, essentially of an evaluative nature, is extensively interpreted to illustrate the contention that researchers are also learning about the nature of teaching and the structure of teaching performances. The evaluative data also yield information on the relationship between kinds of teacher performances and pupil learning. Through this interpretation, the author illustrates that by carefully designing a study, one can achieve two goals: first, one can develop an understanding about teaching performances related to pupil learning; and two, the effectiveness of ideas about what constitutes the appropriate substance of training and whether or not the chosen methods are effective can be evaluated.

Equity of educational benefits is to include the entire range of educational outcomes: cognitive, affective, and behavioral. However, coeducational classrooms may not provide this equity. Research pertaining to the relative merits of single-sex education versus coeducation is reviewed. Evidence from the International Evaluation of Educational Achievement and several smaller studies indicates that coeducation negatively affects boys in the early grades and negatively affects girls in the intermediate and secondary grades. The demand characteristics of a task, its reward contingencies or motivational context, and its stereotyped nature all impact upon the equality of  treatment of students. Computer assisted instruction is presented as an example of a task which has specific demand characteristics, and tends to impact more favorably on males. Both males and females tend to adjust their performance to match specified reward contingencies; and sex stereotyping of certain educational disciplines has negative effects on the achievement of both sexes. Since Title IX specifies coeducation, educators must seek methods within this framework to achieve equity of educational benefits for both sexes. (BW)",

        "description":"The effects of humorous test questions on test performance of high and low-anxious college students was investigated. It was hypothesized that humor should reduce the anxiety level of high-anxious subjects, and thus improve their performance, while having little effect on low-anxious subjects. Students were assigned to a low or high-anxious group depending upon their responses to the Self-Evaluation Questionnaire part of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Humor was introduced to the test by dropping one of the three incorrect alternatives in the multiple choice section and substituting an absurd alternative. Four experimental groups were formed by assigning low and high-anxiety groups to the humorous or nonhumorous version of the second test. High-anxious subjects did relatively  better on the nonhumorous test, while low-anxious subjects scored relatively better on the humorous test. This supported the conception of an inverted U-shaped function relating arousal to performance: increased arousal induced the humorous questions facilitated low-anxious while hindering high-anxious subjects. Humorous questions should be avoided because of the risk of differentially biasing the testing situation against students who have a higher anxiety or arousal level. Two methodological problems present in previous research--initial equivalence of high and low anxious subjects on the performance dimension, and reactivity and performance-produced anxiety bias--were eliminated in the present design.

Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio,  South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin. Seven of these states--Massachusettes, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Washington--also have legislation pending. In eleven states, minimal competency programs are under study: Alaska, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. The remaining states--Arkansas, Montana, South Dakota, a continuing process, subject to change and legislative action. Despite difficulties in Montana, South Dakota, defining minimum level, and a concern that levels of proficiency will be set so low that they become worthless, evidence from existing programs indicates that these problems are not insurmountable. Three major measures which are available--the Adult Performance Level Program, the Basic  Skills Assessment Program, and the Test of General Educational Development--are briefly described, and 24 bibliographical references are included.

This process requires mastery tests to control the rate of student progress. The proper setting of score levels to represent mastery is a difficult task. The claim is made that, although group-based mastery learning may often delay the progress of the faster students at first, eventually the general result tends to be more efficient for learning for all students as compared to other group instructional processes.

The specified test length for each objective must, however, be adequate to provide sufficient information regarding the student's degree of mastery of the behavioral objective being tested. Just what the minimum acceptable length will be depends on the manner in which test information is used to make decisions about individual students, the level of functioning required for defining mastery of an objective, the relative losses incurred in making false positive and false negative  decisions, the background information available on the student and on the instructional process, and the premium on testing time within the instructional process. Some broad guidelines regarding test length of IPI posttests are included. A number of tables present data on the probability of the students achieving mastery level. (Author/MV)",

Individually administered work samples, however, may not provide as much individual attention to the assessment process as is usually assumed. Two types of group work sample evaluation systems have been developed: the Valpar Work Sample #14, Integrated Peer Performance, in which clients work cooperatively on an assembly line task; and the Micro-TOWER System of Vocational Evaluation. The Micro-TOWER System consists of a series of work samples covering verbal, numerical, spatial, motor, and clerical-perception skills. The evaluation takes place in a separate room, and each of eight to ten clients are provided with an identical set of necessary equipment. During a practice  period, the evaluator demonstrates the work sample, and provides assistance to the clients as they practice. During the evaluation period, clients work on their own. Some of the benefits of group evaluation include increased interaction between the evaluator and client, cost benefits, interaction between clients, and the supportive atmosphere. Some administrative problems, such as staff resistance, space requirements, staffing increases, and costs, should be anticipated. (BW)",

The Fundamental Achievement Series (FAS) is a recent attempt to develop a test that is fair to those considered disadvantaged. In addition to the traditional kinds of items, the FAS incorporates relevant items, tapping verbal and numerical abilities required in common everyday situations. A comparison of responses to relevant items and traditional ones suggests that, when testing disadvantaged adults, it is important to use the more relevant items. Item analysis indicated that on the FAS numerical test, the relevant items were easier, yet had higher discrimination indices. On the verbal test, the relevant items worked as well as the traditional items. The FAS is not free of  cultural bias; differences in test performance do occur between blacks and whites. Performance on both parts of the FAS is related to reading ability. However, adults with poor reading skills have an advantage on the FAS that is not present on traditional paper and pencil tests: the instructions for the FAS are played on a tape recorder.

The system was administered to 211 clients at a vocational rehabilitation center, and consisted of work samples measuring the following job skills: record checking, filing, lamp assembly, message-taking, zip coding, making change, want ads comprehension, and payroll computation. Because the Micro-TOWER is administered to groups of two to ten people, the test developers were interested in whether or not this method of testing generated negative reactions that might interfere with test performance. It was found that the clients taking this test preferred group to individual testing at the rate of approximately two to one. This ratio was consistent and  independent of the individual evaluator administering the test, the nature of the work sample, and the group size. There was, however, a slight tendency for increasing preference for group testing as the size of the group increased. The authors suggest that group testing provides these advantages: the clients encounter a supportive atmosphere; the evaluator has more opportunities to help the test takers who need assistance; and this means of testing is more appropriate for current employment situations in which a large number of people must be served.

The results indicate that a stratified sampling of items, either by item difficulty level or by item discriminating ability, does not consistently yield more accurate estimates of the population mean than does simple random sampling.

Eighty-five culture-specific items were developed for use in the English Usage and Social Studies Reading subtests of the ACT (American College Testing) Assessment Program. Items were administered as four separate tests to equal numbers of black and white examinees in several southern states. An analysis of variance showed no significant interactions between test content and performance by race. Further, no systematic differences in mean item discrimination indices, mean number of item omissions, or internal consistency coefficients were found. Collectively, these results suggest that test content did not have a major effect on any of the  variables studied. Suggestions for future research and the implications of the use of cultural content in both classroom and standardized tests are discussed. (Author/CP)",

This evaluation report attempted to examine the SDSE for evidence of nonresponse bias and to identify strengths and weaknesses for the improvement of future manpower studies. Analysis of the rate of survey response by sex, employment status, type of employer, and reported salary in the four successive survey mailings suggests that nonresponse had no effect on accuracy of estimates of manpower distribution. The SDSE gives an estimate of the number of U.S. science and  engineering doctorate recipients who were awarded degrees as of July 1, 1972, and who were employed in the sciences as of spring 1973. It probably underestimated the number of foreign Ph.D.s employed in the U.S. by 25 to 40 percent. Specific results--when compared with membership studies conducted by the American Chemical Society, the American Psychological Society, and the American Institute of Physics--indicated the SDES is generally an accurate and reliable measure of population characteristics.

Several models of evaluation are described and discussed, including the Countenance Model, by Robert Stake; several Goal Attainment Models; the Discrepancy Model by Malcolm Provus; the CIPP (context, input, process, product) Model by Egon Guba and Daniel Stufflebeam; and the decision-oriented model developed at UCLA's Center for the Study of Evaluation by Marvin Alkin. Scriven's Modus Operandi Method and the Adversary Approach to evaluation are also discussed. The chapter on evaluation designs  describes experimental designs, quasi-experimental designs, and process evaluation. Holistic evaluation and Transactional Evaluation are presented as integrated approaches to program evaluation. The second half of this monograph presents several case studies. They include evaluations of an equal educational opportunity program in the California Community Colleges, Project Head Start, a professional school curriculum, and public school curriculum; and needs assessments of a professional school and a faculty development program. The final chapter deals with the utilization of the results of an evaluation. A list of 112 bibliographical references is appended. (BW)",

Both the Ford budget and the Carter budget revisions for 1977 and 1978 contain policy changes with important implications for cities. In this document urban conditions, the problems of cities, and the role of the Federal government in relation to them are examined. The population shift away from the northeast quadrant to the Southern and Western States is discussed as it relates to urban decline. Three factors are used as indicators of city problems: population decline, old age, and economic conditions. Regional differences in the effects of these phenomena are cited. It is stressed that  the urban crisis is not nationwide, as many large cities are well off. Structural and demographic differences among cities are shown to complicate Federal efforts to formulate effective urban policy. Various types of Federal aid and the trends evident in funding practices are discussed. Detailed information is provided on the types of local projects funded including community development and housing programs emanating from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Means of capital acquisition, revenue sharing, and specific Federal grants to local governments are also described. Strategies for reform and policy alternatives are examined and their feasibility and consequences assessed. (GC)",

Black migration patterns, and urban racial composition, implications of migration patterns for education, the role of the federal government, the role of realtors and bankers, local and state government school board action, the failure of open housing laws, changing racial attitudes, segregation and white superiority, the role of the teacher, student achievement and the multiracial classroom, the busing controversy, and the  political nature of education are all factors to be considered in school desegregation.

They are not sufficiently specific, however, in predicting its quantity, variety or type. In this paper evidence is sought which would explain deviance in children as part of the developmental process. The patterns and sequence of age dated initiations of 13 deviant behaviors during the childhoods of 233 young black men are examined. The behaviors are defined and their frequency and the range of ages at which they first occurred are shown. It is demonstrated that the number of deviant behaviors per child is not the product of a purely random process. The kinds of correlations that should be expected  among acts beginning at various ages and affecting varying proportions of a population are considered. After establishing what seem to be causal connections between behaviors, their practical importance for those interested in prediction or intervention is evaluated. The theoretical implications of a developmental model of deviance are discussed within the context of the field of child development. (GC)",

The education of black people must, if it is to be education, promote the power, privilege and prestige of black people. Factors critical to the education of black children are testing; the curriculum, in particular the teaching of reading; teacher expectations and the allocation of social roles; and racial balance. Programs such as performance contracting, compensatory education or giving kids candy for the correct answer all suggest that the problem rests with the student. This educationist/psychologist perspective or blame the victim approach is in direct opposition to the more appropriate wholistic or systemic view of black education which takes the social structure rather than  individuals as \"the stuff\" of its study.

Program cost analysis results relate to the educational effectiveness analysis results in at least two ways: the cost analysis results can be directly contrasted with reading and math program achievement, attitude, and/or attendance outcomes in order to explore possible relationships between total program cost; and the educational effectiveness analysis which  examines the relationship of specific program characteristics to outcomes can be used as a guide for examination of specific program configurations which show greater or lesser educational promise.

One program discussed was conducted for a large suburban system with more than 160,000 students enrolled. The system had had many racial incidents over the years and was expecting a court ordered school desegregation plan to go into effect. The second school system discussed was a rural system with 17,000 students. It was just beginning to enroll blacks as the city's suburbs pushed outward. The model used in both these school systems consists of six stages. Stages in the model cover the following topics: (1) cultural and racial differences, (2) racism and how it operates, (3) examination of racial attitudes, (4)  source of racial attitudes, (5) what can be done about behavior, and (6) behavior change. The importance of using black and white consultants or group leaders is discussed. The key to the whole model is that it is geared to results rather than intentions. Also, it focuses on long term outcomes. (Author/AM)",

This paper focuses on the controversy surrounding the de jure/de facto double standard and the determination of unlawful state intent. Recent desegregation cases are analyzed and related to the Supreme Court's posture in other decisions involving civil rights. Although trends are difficult to ascertain, it appears that courts are becoming more hesitant to uncover constitutional violations and to order massive student reassignment plans as remedial measures. It is difficult to evaluate whether recent desegregation orders are indicators of a larger systemic change in the law of civil rights or whether the decisions should be viewed  in isolation as having little precedential value. It may be that litigation involving school desegregation is part of a more global legal phenomenon signaling judicial retrenchment from the activist Warren Court era. (Author/AM)",

The \"My Class Inventory\" was administered to fourth grade students in all schools on a pre and post test basis in order to examine changes over a one year period as well as differences among inner city, suburban, and rural student populations. The relationship between achievement and student perceived learning environment using the school as the unit of analysis was examined for the 15 inner city and 4 of the comparison schools. Results indicate that with very gross measures of achievement (grade equivalent scores), there is a confirmation of a relationship between learning  environment and achievement for the 19 schools for which achievement data were available. Increased friction is found to be negatively correlated with higher achievement. Results of a regression analysis indicate that urban and inner city school students tend to show an increase in perception of friction, lower thought processes and higher thought processes; suburban school students perceive relatively less competitiveness in school. The gross lumping of schools by locational categories, urban, suburban, inner city is challenged by these data. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"For research purposes, an individual's education and educational attainment, and his or her ethnic identity, are usually taken to represent static and independent characteristics of the person. However, the processes which lead to categorizations of educational attainment and ethnic identity are not static and are probably not independent. In this paper a research approach to ethnic identity is proposed. It is oriented specifically to classroom settings in the Philippines. The rationale for undertaking research of this kind, including a review of the literature on ethnicity and linguistics, is presented in the context of Philippine education. The approach proposed utilizes methods taken from recent sociolinguistic work in conversational analysis. Insights into native assumptions  that a sociolinguistic approach can yield are suggested. The incorporation of a conceptual approach, in which the meaning of elements of a person's social identity is subject to negotiation and interpretation in specific cases of interaction, is also suggested. Possible implications of such an investigation for Philippine education and sociolinguistics are discussed. A bibliography is included. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"This paper presents the findings of a one year national study. The research was directed at determining the status of culturally pluralistic programs in 29 urban school districts across the United States. Statistical and descriptive information was gathered from 130 urban school districts by means of questionnaires and observation teams. Among the factors which assisted in the implementation of culturally pluralistic programs are the following: (1) reliance on a combination of highly qualified staff and strong district commitment, (2) a large competent instructional staff performing well defined roles, (3) the promotion of parental, student and community involvement, and (4) staff training. There are six strategies which school districts will have to undertake in order to renew  and reform urban instructional programs to provide adequate education to the ever increasing number of culturally pluralistic communities. They are as follows: (1) school district commitment, (2) the development of a new philosophy emphasizing enrichment activities, (3) comprehensive planning, (4) hiring for diversity, (5) differentiated staff development, and (6) formative evaluation.

The students, unaware that they were subjects in an experiment, received high or low effort assignments and high or no praise comments. Two assignments were given to each student from two different materials to assure counterbalancing of teacher, classroom selection, and time of day effects. The effort by praise (2x2) multivariate analysis of covariance and class by praise (4x2) ANOVAs showed that students who received high praise and completed the high effort  assignments formed significantly more positive attitudes than students in the other three groups.

The subjects were 55 black, 25 Puerto Rican, and 52 white males between the ages of 9 and 13. They attended elementary public schools in Newark, New Jersey. A statistically significant two-way race by parental absence interaction analysis indicated that, when compared to their racial counterparts living with both parents, Puerto Ricans living with one parent were equally as aggressive as other youth. Whites were found to be more aggressive and blacks were less aggressive. Also, overcompensation and local minority group status increased aggression among whites, and maternal identification and local majority group  status decreased aggression among blacks. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Two issues currently before Congress may have significant effects on the labor market experiences of retirement age individuals. These issues are the abolition of the mandatory retirement age and the elimination of the Social Security program's earning test. Both of these changes, if they occur, can be expected to affect the retirement decisions of older workers and, on average, to extend their time in the labor force. If this is true, the effects of race and sex discrimination among this group of workers will be prolonged. In this paper, evidence on the extent and nature of this discrimination is presented. The determinants of the market wage rates of older workers are presented. The extent and nature of current labor market discrimination by race and sex are then examined by  estimating the portion of the race and sex wage differentials which cannot be explained by observable socioeconomic characteristics. Evidence of discrimination appears in both cases, and it suggests that occupational segregation or crowding is more of a problem in the male-female than in the white-nonwhite case. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"While it is understood that state compensatory education funds will probably do little to close the gap in public school expenditure levels between wealthy and poor New Jersey districts, it is still important that the educational consumer and the interested observer understand how the system works. Compensatory education funds are the source of financing for preventive and remedial programs mandated in the Thorough and Efficient Law of 1975. The current financing formula, an interim device for allocating funds for the 1977-78 and 1978-79 school years, is a combination approach that takes both academic and economic need into account. Some observers claim the interim formula appears to focus the limited State funds on the poor and urban districts. Critics of the formula believe  that allocations should be distributed in a different fashion, enabling suburban schools to receive a larger share of funds. Thoroughly planned, adequately funded, and well managed, the compensatory education program could help to reverse the downward trend in New Jersey education. Before this can become a reality, however, the State Board of Education must resolve a number of philosophical and programmatic issues. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"A workshop type method of training teachers in the use of counseling techniques for facilitating parent teacher conferences is described. It is based on the Carkhuff model of attending, responding, initiating, and communicating. At each of the four stages, the leader first discusses its purpose and the specific behaviors to be encompassed in the exercise. He then demonstrates the behaviors. Finally, the participants are divided into triads of \"parent\", \"teacher\", and \"observer\" to practice the behaviors in simulation exercises. Attending behaviors seek to assure parents that they are important enough to deserve the teacher's full attention. In the responding stage of the workshop, teachers' attention is directed to the feelings underlying parental statements. There are two  possible types of responses to these statements: those which facilitate communication (interchangeable); and those which make parents feel defensive (subtractive). At the initiating stage of the workshop, the teachers attempt to relate the common themes of the conference. At the communicating stage, teacher and parent work together to solve specific problems. All the training materials used in the workshop are included. (Author/MC)",

This paper deals with the findings of the health history, based on interviews with a total of 304 persons aged 5 and over. Disease patterns showed sex and age differences. Most of the diseases were more prevalent in females than in males, especially beyond the age of 34. These diseases included anemia, hypertension, heart disease,  obesity, and arthritis. However, some disabilities were found more frequently in males. These included fractures, major operations, work disability, peptic ulcers, liver and prostrate diseases.

An introductory chapter discusses the purposes of written license tests and of drivers' manuals, focusing on the needs of groups of drivers based on kind of vehicle, experience, age, driving record, reading ability, residence, and language. Chapter 2 outlines driver information needs for seven categories of drivers and suggests special approaches to the dissemination and assessment of that information. The seven driver categories are new drivers, renewals, older drivers, traffic violators, accident repeaters, drinking drivers, and special vehicle operators. Chapter 3 presents criteria for  development of manuals (content, organization, and style) and other systems for presenting information to drivers (e.g., audiovisual presentations and group instruction). The selection of content for driver tests, preparation of test items, construction of tests, and consideration of alternative information assessment systems are covered in chapter 4. The final chapter describes techniques for evaluating the effectiveness of various techniques in leading to acquisition, retention, and application of driving information. (The guide grew out of a research project to develop and test an information system designed to meet the needs of various categories of drivers.

Each package contains the following three components: a series of job titles sharing the same skill base (job family cluster); an analysis of tasks associated with one or more of the job titles; and the measurable instructional objectives used to conduct training in the job skills. Results of the articulation showed that some low level entry jobs are trained for exclusively at the secondary level and that some high level jobs are trained for exclusively at the postsecondary level, and that a third group (referred to  as &quot;articulated&quot;) may be taught at either level with the only variable being the depth and emphasis of training reflected by the instructional objectives.

Personnel from twenty-five institutions representing twenty-one different states participated in the institute. The institute consisted of a series of instructional components including two national workshops for leadership personnel, twenty-four on-site workshops for training additional resource persons at each of the participating institutions, and follow-up technical assistance to facilitate the implementation process. In addition to the  workshops conducted and the technical assistance provided, two workshop PBTE modules (CE 014 160-161) and a fifteen-minute color slide/tape presentation on the role of the resource person were disseminated. Feedback from the two national workshops and the on-site workshops was very positive, and the stated objectives of the institute were successfully accomplished.

        "description":"In the past, educational programs for Native Americans have failed to train Indians to develop and use their own natural resources. The following four central issues have arisen from testimony regarding vocational education for Indian people: Indian people should be involved at all levels of the program, including planning, implementation, and evaluation; each tribe's economic development plan should be considered as the basis for vocational education in that area; counseling and follow-through should be provided for the students; and curriculum in these vocational education programs should be made relevant to the Indian students. These issues point out the need for research and development efforts in vocational education for Native Americans. Vocational education research and  development implications for Native Americans focus on the following needs: the need to train Indians in the field of vocational education research and development in order to discourage dependence; the need for Indian children to be exposed to career education options on or near the reservation to help them aspire to employment positions related to their future education and training; the need to help adult Indians cope with the rapid economic developments and inherent occupational developments on Indian Reservations today; and the need to help those individuals who, due to family background, perceptual habits, and life style, require the most basic vocational training for tribal occupations. The overall emphasis for future research and development efforts should be to develop human  resources in congruence with tribal development needs. (BM)",

        "description":"In order to determine the effectiveness of improved information dissemination and assessment techniques in reducing highway accidents, a set of seven targeted driver license manuals and tests were developed for the following groups of drivers: new drivers, youthful drivers, renewal applicants, older drivers, traffic violators, accident repeaters, and drinking drivers. The contents of the manuals and tests were based upon an analysis of critical information requirements for each target group and an assessment of existing information deficiencies of drivers relative to these requirements. The manuals and tests were administered to a sample of 30,000 drivers to determine their effectiveness in leading to acquisition, retention, and application of safe driving information. The amount  of information acquired showed knowledge gains ranging between 20% and 30% for all target groups except the traffic violator group, which showed an 11% gain. A retention test administered to the new driver and renewal groups after a five-month interval showed a one-half to one-third information loss. The older driver group showed a slight gain. In addition to the manuals, a one-hour audiovisual presentation of the manual's contents was developed and yielded an information gain of 15% and 20% respectively among reading-disabled and mentally retarded high school students.

First, unstructured interviews of forty-eight farmers and agribusiness persons in seven Ohio counties were conducted to identify those factors they considered when evaluating their county's extension agricultural program. The forty-four factors were identified and were categorized as methods, personal qualities of the agent, and quality of extension information. Second, a questionnaire was sent to 248 farmers asking them to rate the importance of each of the forty-four factors. Based on a factor analysis of the responses, a questionnaire was developed which consisted of forty-three factors classified in the following four  subscales: information, extension agents, extension methods, and educational program. During the third and final step of the study, the questionnaire was sent to 400 farmers and agribusiness persons in eight counties while six extension professionals, using a paired-comparison procedure, rated the quality of the programs in the same counties. The results of this last step indicated that the instrument and the subscales are reliable. It is recommended that the instrument be used by others, both as an evaluation tool and for further research. (The questionnaire is attached.) (EM)",

Model I illustrates the flow of activity from origin of the idea to program design through extensive deliberation with the continuing medical education (CME) unit. Formal veto power over topic selection rests within the medical school departments and the role of the CME unit is supportive. Model II also represents the processing of a program idea with veto power in the medical school departments but includes  educational support services of an Extension Service. Model III represents the processing of an idea with veto power in the Extension Service of the organization. The role of the CME planner/administrator is consultative. Model IV illustrates the processing of a program idea from an external source. The power to veto topic selection is in the CME unit. The fifth model is a general one in which a program idea from inside or outside the medical school is received in the CME unit. The program design is a product of the CME planner/administrator's coordinating effort and planning committee expertise. (EM)",

        "description":"To further develop a previously tested commitment analysis model for analyzing the commitments of local leaders to community education programs, telephone interviews were conducted of 272 leaders (255 men and 17 women) in a rural Wisconsin county of 30,000. The interview questions focused on their commitments to program goals in the latter programming stages of educational offerings on community land use planning, industrial development, and recreational development. The results showed that the model is not only useful for analyzing new educational situations but with some revisions is a viable model for continually guiding the analysis of educational situations. In the revised model, the behavioral commitment of community leaders toward program goals will be different at  different stages of programming. Though previous research has shown static personal possession type commitments (e.g., income, education, and property investment of leaders) as more reliable predictors in early programming stages, these results indicate that the more dynamic behavioral commitments (e.g., earliness of involvement, hours involved in programs, and amount of perceived contact) are stronger predictors in latter stages of programming. These findings suggest that adult educators must continually observe and analyze the situation throughout a community educational program to be fully aware of existing needs, possible barriers, and/or ways to facilitate the program.

(A two-dimensional group growth model and a five-dimensional adult educator model identifying educator functions are included in the study report.) Ten problem-solving situations were  studied in small Wisconsin communities. Comparison of field data (gathered by observations and interviews) from five of the ten case studies generated the following hypotheses: group growth is positively influenced by (1) the encouraging function of the educator, (2) the linking-with-knowledge function, (3) the linking-with-human-resources function, (4) trust between adult educator and group, (5) strong feelings about a community problem, (6) group growth in leadership, (7) low activity educator style in a group with well developed leadership capacity, and (8) high activity educator style in a group without well developed leadership capacity; group growth is negatively affected by the enlisting-support function of the educator. These hypotheses do suggest implications for adult educators  working with community groups, but they must be tested before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Also, further research may suggest modifications to the group growth and adult educator frameworks developed in this study. (DTT)",

This working document begins with a brief introduction to its use followed by personal authorization forms and orders regarding their use for both health and non-health personnel. The next four standing orders are administrative ones covering the management of an emergency, the operation of a dispensary and an infirmary, and the referral of corpsmembers to emergency room and/or consultant or for  hospital admission. Each of these administrative orders includes one or all of the following: flow chart of activities, pertinent content, and instructions regarding the procedures to follow. The remainder of this handbook is comprised of twenty-five technical standing orders and each one includes the activities in flow chart format followed by brief notes on relevant content. Some of the technical orders included are for the management of burns, lacerations, infected wounds, upper respiratory symptoms, abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, suspect acne, oral bleeding, depression, and anxiety.

Section two on historical perspectives covers the tools, techniques, and stances of the employment services, the social changes beginning in the 1960's and their impact on the placement role of the employment service, approaches to the employer, and perceptions of the client. The third section is on labor exchange processes and employability development  strategies; various methods for recruitment and job search are discussed along with placement strategies for each of seven recruitment job search levels. (Included is a Recruitment Job Search Model which represents the job vacancies broadcast by employers and the place where job seekers must be in order to hear the broadcast.) These search levels consist of the following: the internal job market, contacting the employer directly, personal contacts, the closed systems, and the public intermediary market (private employment agencies, employment service, and want ads). The last section covers agency roles and CETA goals in placement, reexamining the quality of placement, making the placement function more professional, and reexamining the medical model. (EM)",

        "description":"To analyze the application of quantitative models to energy-employment issues, the energy problem was viewed in three distinct, but related, phases: the post-embargo shock effects, the intermediate-term process of adjustment, and the long-run equilibrium. Against this background eighteen existing energy models (government supported as well as private efforts) were reviewed to determine their usefulness in addressing employment problems related to the three phases. The models were divided into three main categories: (1) general-economy energy-sector interactions models, (2) energy sector models, and (3) energy subsector models. Thus far, the models have not been utilized in any significant way for the study of employment and manpower issues. Only one of the category 2 models  generates detailed manpower requirements associated with increased investment activity; others in that group as well as several coal sector models could be adapted to do so. Of greatest interest were the category 1 models, but most lack proper price determination mechanism to address long-term questions of adjustment to energy price changes. While most of them incorporate an input-output block to which labor demand estimates are attached, the quality of the specifications was found inadequate. Based on the analysis, five categories of employment and manpower research issues associated with the energy problem were identified: substitution effects, balance-of-payments effects, investment and new construction effects, economic growth and inflation, and distribution of income. (Reviews of  each individual model are appended.) (JT)",

Data were gathered from interviews with twelve staff members at a major university medical center, a comprehensive one-year survey of student enrollments in educational and counseling psychology courses at the same university, and a review of recent literature in dental, medical, nursing, and allied health professions education. The development of each of the three roles was described, including trends, social forces, and legislation. Each role was defined,  and the contributions of educational and counseling psychology to these roles were discussed. Finally, suggestions for further areas of research were made, and the changing population of educational and counseling psychology courses and graduate training programs was explored. The study concluded that the role of educational researcher within university medical centers is still a viable option for doctoral level educational psychologists, the role of allied health professions teacher educator has changed the target population of some educational psychology courses at the graduate level, and the role of primary prevention health care counselor may in the future change the target population of selected courses in educational and counseling psychology even further.

Through a variety of procedures approximately 1,900 persons were nominated as contacts for program information on all day and/or evening non-credit programs in any type of school or training facility. A questionnaire developed with the services of a national panel of consultants contained nineteen items (descriptors) basic to competency-based instruction, a number of demographic program questions, and six open-ended criterion questions. Questionnaires were sent to 1,657 potential respondents and, after a mail follow-up and a telephone follow-up, 277 usable returns were received. Approximately 72% of the returns were from  the public sector and 28% from the private sector (a majority of these from proprietary schools). Several comparisons were made between public and private sectors, and descriptor scores were compared with other variables in the survey. Other analyses included linear regression and canonical correlations to determine the descriptors and criterion questions most closely related to strong programs. One major conclusion was that relatively few high quality programs exist. Complete findings and ten specific recommendations are presented. (JT)",

The literature is reviewed under six headings: the nature of competency-based education (CBE); application of CBE to adult vocational programs; developing and implementing CBE; the use of CBE in business, industry, and labor training; problems involved with CBE; and favorable aspects of CBE. This document summarizes project activities reported separately, including the national survey of competency-based adult vocational instruction in the public and private sectors (complete report, CE 015 756), development of the \"National Directory of Selected Competency-Based  Adult Vocational Education Programs\" (CE 015 755), planning and operation of the project's national dissemination workshop (proceedings, CE 015 758), and supporting activities. Following a brief summary of findings, the major conclusions are stated: (1) The quality and extent of competency-based adult vocational instruction appears to be greater in the public than in the private sector; (2) instances of high quality instruction are infrequent in either sector; (3) persons operating such programs are working, for the most part, in isolation from other adult educators; (4) programs are developed primarily from the initiative of a single instructor; and (5) too many programs purported to be competency-based fail to provide adequately for pre-assessment, progression when objectives are  achieved, learning alternatives, and open entry/open exit format.

Focus is on management information system development efforts as described in the reports, the intent being to identify the level of development in relation to predetermined criteria. The review is organized in two main sections. The first includes (1) introduction (noting the legislative intent); (2) definition of management information systems (MIS); (3) criteria for reviewing reports (twelve MIS factors which are divided into three categories: developmental, technical, and human/organizational); (4) numbering system for rating reports; (5)  results; and (6) fourteen conclusions and recommendations. Among the results noted are these: MIS factors were found to be applicable to only ten of the sixteen reports; in these, developmental factors were rated highest and human/organizational factors lowest; and reports demonstrate general knowledge of basic MIS development principles with considerable room for improvement. The second section includes the author's one- or two-page analysis of each of the sixteen individual reports. Each contains project purpose and summary, comparison of the report to MIS criteria, and general concluding comments. Appended are a list of all twenty-three final reports by state and a one-page abstract of each project not included in the review. (JT)",

The method developed is a straightforward application of human capital theory in which the military's investment in OJT is measured as the present value of the sum of positive differences between an individual's military pay and productivity over time. Data for the pilot study of the method of estimating costs of OJT were collected at Norton Air Force Base, California, in the fall of 1972. The usable sample was drawn from  approximately 700 men in the occupational group Aircraft Maintenance Specialists, the largest Air Force specialty, with the final sample for analysis consisting of sixty-four individuals based on the survey responses of twelve supervisors. The results in the pilot study indicate that the method gives plausible estimates of the magnitude of OJT costs and their relationship to trainee attributes. Measured mental ability and previous education were found to be importantly related to OJT costs, and the \"typical trainee\" approach of estimating costs of OJT was shown to give seriously downward-biased estimates.

The study was based upon information derived from interviews, the literature, and questionnaires sent to twenty-seven corporations. Summaries of the information derived from the data collected is presented according to an alphabetical listing of the corporations, among them AT&T, General Electric, IBM, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, 3M Corporation, Naval Weapons Center, and Union Carbide Corporation. It was concluded that (1) there are few organized and centralized career  development programs in effect; (2) many companies are currently in the process of developing such programs; (3) there is much to be done if the goals of the organization and the individual are to be meshed and obtained; and (4) skills banks and job postings should be tied in with career development to develop skills needed by certain employees in terms of development for manpower requirements. Extensive recommendations are made on the basis of the study, and implications of coordinated human resources development programs are discussed.

        "description":"In order to determine the effectiveness of improved information dissemination and assessment techniques in reducing highway accidents, a set of seven targeted driver license manuals and tests were developed for the following groups of drivers: new drivers, youthful drivers, renewal applicants, older drivers, traffic violators, accident repeaters, and drinking drivers. The contents of the manuals and tests were based upon an analysis of critical information requirements for each target group and an assessment of existing information deficiencies of drivers relative to these requirements. The manuals and tests were administered to a sample of 30,000 drivers to determine their effectiveness in leading to acquisition, retention, and application of safe driving information. The amount  of information acquired showed knowledge gains ranging between 20% and 30% for all target groups except the traffic violator group, which showed an 11% gain. A retention test administered to the new driver and renewal groups after a five-month interval showed a one-half to one-third information loss. The older driver group showed a slight gain. In addition to the manuals, a one-hour audiovisual presentation of the manual's contents was developed and yielded an information gain of 15% and 20% respectively among reading-disabled and mentally retarded high school students. (A bibliography, data tables, and individual test-item statistics are appended. Volume I, a 48-page summary of the 200-page final report, is available separately--CE 014 870.) (Author/JT)",

        "description":"A two-part study was undertaken to determine whether the experiencing of limits to control in areas for which people are known to seek psychological help would be perceived as differentially stressful by characteristically internal and external individuals. A group of 237 nonclient students indicated their degree of perceived personal control over certain stressful life events for which a sample of student clients had sought counseling. Factor analysis of these responses resulted in four Limits to Personal Control scales. Comparisons were made between 30 Internals and 36 Externals. A trichotomy of the I-E distribution from this first nonclient sample indicated that internals anticipated greater control on all four limits scales, as hypothesized. The same four scales were  administered to 66 internal and 54 external nonclient students, but the instructions differed. This group rated how stressful it would be to experience the events comprising each scale. The prediction that Internals would report higher imagined stress than Externals was supported for the two Limits to Control scales dealing with personal events. It was not supported for the two Limits of Control scales related to interpersonal events. (Author)",

The model's application to task analysis and the advantages of using it when constructing assessment strategies and instruments are discussed. Examples of the model's use in building portfolios, behavioral rating scales, and skill demonstration packages are set forth. Such skill demonstration packages can, when properly constructed and organized, identify those individuals whom one can conclude are able to perform various activities related to a job. They will not, however, predict the extent to which these individuals will perform adequately on the job. The authors suspect that skill demonstration packages may be most useful in diagnosing areas in which a given counselor needs  to improve skill, as opposed to being used in predicting a counselor's level of effectiveness.

(2) What are the relative influences of family status, family processes, school processes, and individual ability on academic and nonacademic behavior of males and females? and (3) Do the same influence processes operate for males and females or are there important sex interaction effects with family or school characteristics? The study utilizes survey data from 4,079 white students in 10 middle schools and six high schools in Maryland that differ significantly in authority structure. The sample of students from grades 6, 7, 9 and 12 is diverse in social and family processes. Results show: (1)  significant sex main effects of five outcomes--self esteem, college plans, academic subject preference, adjustment in school and report card grades; (2) clear differences in patterns of influence of variables--family and school processes are more important for personality and school coping skills, and family status and individual ability are more important for college plans and standardized achievement; and (3) no consistent, significant sex interactions.

Each chapter was written by a particular set of authors. However, the points contained in the chapters had to receive the general agreement of a committee whose membership included representatives not only from the research community, but also from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the treatment community. After completing the first three chapters, the reader should have the information needed to determine whether to do a follow-up, and how to plan it in detail and make staffing assignments, if the decision is to proceed. The remaining chapters provide detailed guidance for implementing each of the  research stages. A few of the areas covered are: techniques for successfully locating respondents, interviewing techniques, confidentiality, guidelines for preparing the data for analysis and conducting the analysis, and suggestions on how a report might be organized. The appendix includes many specific examples of interview questions and interviewing training materials. (Author)",

A parent who consistently anticipates bad behavior may produce a child with a negative self-image. On the other hand, an adult who assumes that the child can do no wrong may produce a child with a positive sense of self, but also a narcissistic orientation toward human relations, or a low tolerance for frustration, and a lack of internal controls. Two studies examined aspects of parent-child relationships. In general, results suggested that the greater the father's negative perceptual style score, the more frequently were father and child negative behaviors emitted during the family tasks.

They serve as a brief yet practical introduction to the issue of sexism as it affects men. The first section provides background information about the issue of male sex role stereotyping. It is for the teacher's use only. It describes the techniques society employs to instill sex-typed behavior, the characteristics of the male stereotype, and the high cost of this masculine mystique. The second section contains classroom strategies and lesson plans intended to help students identify, analyze, and evaluate the male role stereotype and sex role stereotyping in general. When students become aware of how society channels them into sex role stereotypes, they will be better prepared to make  independent decisions about the lifestyles and goals they wish to pursue based on their own values, interests, and abilities. It is important to note that the male stereotype discussed in these materials is characteristic of white, mainstream, United States culture. (Author)",

Attitude towards college was measured by the Brown-Holtzman Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes (SSHA). A t-test was utilized. Findings  indicated that the experimental group had a better attitude than did the control group.

Their responses were differentiated according to age, sex, race, and level of education. Data were also analyzed using the varimax rotated factor matrix procedure to determine significant factors that the scale was, in fact, measuring. Loadings on four distinct factors accounted for 92.7% of the variance measured by the scale: fear of isolation and immobility, fear of pain, fear of the future, and fear of physical decomposition. Analyses variance revealed that older respondents had significantly less death anxiety as measured by this scale than did younger subjects. Males indicated significantly less death anxiety than did females in this sample. No differences in death anxiety were found by  race or educational level.

No attempt is made to evaluate each program individually, or to rank them comparatively. Rather, report recommendations call attention to the wide range of alternatives being explored, and from which those planning to  launch additional programs can make a selection appropriate to their problems, goals, and resources. Excluded from this survey is a wide range of treatment programs, both institutional and community, which are available to offenders generally, including sex offenders, but which are not tailored to the specifically sexual problems of sex offenders.

        "description":"Recently, the military system has begun to feel the impact of the military family. Whenever sudden dramatic changes or transitions occur, crises may result either for the individual or for the institution. At present both the military system and the military family are in a period of rapid transition. Perhaps one of the most important changes that has occurred within the military since World War II has been the change from a single-man's Army to a married-man's Army, Navy, or Air Force. A more recent change is the growing acceptance of women service personnel as an integral part of the military structure. With the increasing numbers of women affiliated with the military, including servicewomen and wives of servicemen, their importance to the military and their impact upon the  military organization increases. Perhaps this change may be even more than proportional, when the ingredient of the changing role of women in society in general is added to the equation for change. The papers included as part of this symposium focus on: (1) the various pressures and transitions which have been occurring from within and without the military system; (2) the impact of these transitions on individuals, institutions, and policies; and (3) the changing relationships between individuals, families, and the military system. Effects of the transitions now in process are discussed, and an attempt is made to show how events outside the system (wars, depression, legislation, and court decisions) often adumbrate these effects.

For this study, two types of strategies were investigated, a cautious strategy involving preference of unknown texts in familiar knowledge contexts and a curiosity strategy involving preference of unknown texts in unfamiliar contexts. The experimental variation of the learning goal instructions and the number of assigned texts revealed that adult learners do  optimize their decisions, and while they tend to favor the curious strategy, they do make concessions to the cautious strategy. This is done to the extent that the text is demanding, the instructions suggest doing so, and the suggested learning goals are perceived as requiring it. (Author/MAI)",

The &quot;giant-word syndrome&quot; and its proposed concomitants of absence of developmental stages, deviant imitation, and confusion about homonym use are rejected on the basis of evidence from these children, who are members of the same speech community as the Bereiter-Engelmann subjects. It is suggested that different discourse constraints, not linguistic deficit, are the source of the Bereiter-Engelmann findings. The problems inherent in the Bereiter-Engelmann language program, which is based on a behavioristic model, are briefly discussed.  Instruction such as that advocated may be beneficial for the limited number of children involved because it teaches them the school-honored dialect, but the overall effect is to augment the antipathy that already exists toward stigmatized varieties and to increase the difficulties that their speakers have in adjusting to the school culture.

        "description":"The development of a story grammar represents an attempt to describe the higher order cognitive structures that are used to encode, represent, and retrieve information from stories such as folktales or fables. These structures, defined as a set of rewrite rules, specify the types of information that should occur in stories and the types of logical relations that should connect story components. They guide a listener or reader in determining when information, critical to the cohesiveness of a story, has been omitted from a text or when the logical organization of a story has been deviated from the expected sequence of events. Predictions about story memory have been derived from story grammars and tested in several different studies on story memory. The results of these studies  have shown the validity of using a story grammar approach to comprehension. Some of the results, however cannot readily be explained by the rules included in current grammars.

This group favored a narrow base of ownership maintained solely by international carriers engaged in international telephone and telegraph communication. The Justice Department and the Kennedy Administration disagreed with the FCC proposal, however, and sought a joint satellite venture that assured  competition and haste in production. After great debate, Congress passed a compromise bill that provided for a private communication satellite corporation (COMSAT) with stock divided equally between the public and the communication carriers.

Thomson chose to use the wet-plate process, despite its problems and demands, because of the quality of negative possible. As one of the earliest European photojournalists to work in Asia, Thomson produced work that goes beyond mere documentation; it presents the grandeur of the Asian landscapes and gives probing images of living people that together convey a full sense of the land. He also experienced many difficulties with malaria, hostile people, and harsh climates. He  was especially interested in the &quot;small trades&quot; and in anonymous individuals who could not pay for their portraits and who are thus underrepresented in the works of most Victorian photographers.

This literature review questions the conclusiveness of the evidence that is usually cited. The term \"formal grammar instruction\" has been one source of problems; most studies have failed to distinguish between a body of grammatical principles and a method of teaching those principles. Correlational studies are examined and found to have contradictory results, as well as to provide no indication of causal relationships. Finally, four experimental studies that compared one instructional method to another are reviewed and found to have weaknesses in design or interpretation.

This article examines the form and content of the journal and considers some of the previous research on it. The article states that the journal contained the first report of a lynching that was published in the United States, ran campaigns to purchase and free slaves from sympathetic owners, held meetings with its subscribers to discuss their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the content, ran editorials on colonization, printed land offers for the formations of black communities, ran notices of births, deaths, marriages, and social events in the black community, and sold advertising space. The article states that the journal had between 800 and l,000  subscribers and, using the 1850 census literacy rates, concludes that the majority of the readers were black. (MAI)",

        "description":"Although some teachers doubt that sports literature should be taught in the college English class, the study of sports literature is enjoyable for studeents to read, think, and write. In a course entitled \"The Rhetoric of Sport: Society, Media, Literature,\" students study the role of sport in society through reading articles and books that show the interrelationships between sports and such social issues as race, politics, hero worship, and violence. They learn about sport in the media through readings that show how language is used in sports writing, how the rhetoric of sports journalism shapes attitudes toward sport, and how the language of sport has been assimilated by government and business. Finally, students learn about sport in literature through reading works that deal  tangentially with sport, such as \"The Great Gatsby,\" as well as those unique to the sports scene, such as Roger Kahn's \"The Boys of Summer.\" A list of course readings is appended. (Information on the organization of a freshman composition course taught through the use of sports literature is presented in a separate document.) (GW)",

This booklet summarizes current brain research and examines its implications for educators seeking a balanced curriculum that does not neglect activities controlled by the right hemisphere and over-emphasize those controlled by the left. Among the topics discussed are the following: the need for Western culture to develop the holistic mode of thinking; ways to balance curricula through the use of curricula through the use of right hemisphere courses on such subjects as art, music, and drama; the need for new processes  of student evaluation that measure children who are oriented visually and metaphorically but not verbally; and strategies for balanced instruction in each of the content areas. Finally, an overview of the evolution of human consciousness and its implications for education is given. The overview suggests that when the two hemispheres begin to operate in balance and are used appropriately, a synergetic mode of consciousness will result, which can lead to peak experiences and synchronization of the holistic and linear modes.

Communication studies in the United States have taken a route very different from hermeneutics. They are based on attempts to understand the subjective intentions of a psychological self, while Gadamer, in attributing greater importance to the developing interaction structure than to the subject, presents understanding as reaching agreement concerning the subject matter. While communication researchers in the United States try to eliminate prejudices and reproduce the other's state of mind through empathy, Gadamer explores ways of increasing understanding by making prejudices appropriately operant.  Developing a hermeneutic consciousness in the United States has implications for future communication studies. Attempts should be made to ground all studies in the life experience of everyday actors, to reduce the reification of experience that comes from present concepts, and to question the propriety of the assumed research task of verification directed toward constructing objective knowledge.

In broadcast media, the opportunity, or access, has been largely determined by two factors: economics, or who owns the means to an audience, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation of the limited frequency spectrum. Historically, the Supreme Court has extended the FCC power beyond license distribution to matters involving programing. Eventually, the &quot;fairness doctrine&quot; evolved to ensure the consumer's right to hear, through a federal evaluation of the broadcaster's fulfillment of editorial responsibilities. However, a reasonable interpretation of the First Amendment states that the government is to have no direct control  over the process by which people are informed. The means of transmission may be subject to external constraints, while the message is free from any form of intervention. If broadcasters are to be held accountable for their programing, then they must be free to accept responsibility for their expressions. (MAI)",

Results showed that interpersonal diffusion appears to be a selective, goal-oriented phenomenon; that it results from a variety of divergent need states, including requirements for social status, information, catharsis, and social contact; and that altruistic motivations are central in initiating the interpersonal diffusion process. Five potential sources of invalidity and limitations on the extent that these  results can be generalized are presented, and four tables of research results are appended. (CC)",

Part two contains brief reviews of 90 instruments, observation and category systems, and general assessment procedures designed to generate information on some aspect of an individual's functional communication.

This four-part paper outlines the likenesses of the two groups, indicates where they differ, and focuses on the social and political dimensions of consciousness raising. The first section lists the following similarities between the charismatic movement and consciousness raising: use of some of the same specialized words or labels, standardized responses to questions, rationalization of persuasion as good for the target person, concentration on disclosure of feelings, and polarization, which involves constant exposure to group doctrine. The section on the social dimensions of consciousness raising asserts that the process developed as a response to  widespread needs for satisfying interpersonal communication and has become the exclusive property of the radicals. This response, according to the final section of the paper, involves confrontation as an extension of communication. The resulting radicalization displays a rhetoric of self-persuasion and a group-centered nature that is characterized by the prevalence of fantasies and myths, frustrated attitudes, and the search for relationships.

Answers to the interview questions were analyzed in terms of overall perceptions, positive experiences, and negative experiences, and selected demographic variables were examined for differences between those who had positive and those who had negative perceptions of touching during labor. The results show that, in general, being touched was a positive experience; young subjects (ages 15 through 19), nonwhites, and single or divorced subjects perceived touch more negatively than older, white, and married subjects. Variables were also analyzed regarding who gave the touch, the part of the body touched, and the meaning of touch to  the receiver. Attitudes toward touch were shown to be context-related. Suggestions for hospital staff are given, based on the research results, and several hypotheses are presented for further research. (CC)",

Yet, after thousands of research studies, educators are unable to say that those interactions have any significant impact on learning. Reactions to this state of affairs may be characterized in terms of the following positions: teaching is an art, not a science; teaching plays a very minor role in learning; teaching is a creed; and teaching is problem-solving. A theory of school learning may be posited that is based on three independent variables: student ability, student motivation, and quality of classroom communication. On a percentage basis, student ability may  account for 50% of achievement variance, student motivation for 25%, and classroom communication for up to 25%. (GW)",

One hundred and five subjects designated and evaluated three relationships each--those with an acquaintance, a friend, and an intimate friend--producing a total of 247 existing relationships for study. The subjects' evaluations were assessed according to two main variables: perceived closeness and friendship labeling. Results showed that the breadth and depth of communication, the perceived understanding, and the frequency of verbal metacommunication (talk about the relationship) increased as perceived closeness increased. In terms of the friendship-labeling variable, it was found that higher-level friendship labeling was associated with increased depth of communication, perceived understanding, and frequency of  metacommunication.

Chief Justice Burger's stand, which represented that of a five-man majority, was based on the presumption that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment because it is a form of expression utterly without redeeming social importance. Justice Brennan's position which represented that of the minority, was based on the presumption that legitimate state interests in protecting the public welfare and morality preclude constitutional protection for obscenity. An analysis of the fundamental issues raised in the Burger Brennan clash of opinion reveals basic flaws in the logic of the majority position and suggests that the  issue needs to be reexamined.

A union's identity is those attitudes held in common by the members; its identification is the attitudes toward it held by those in the surrounding community. During a strike, the previous patterns of identity identification are disrupted; community members who saw the teachers as neighbors jointly engaged in educating their children may now see them as unreasonable and greedy. After a strike, teachers may view themselves as no longer in servitude, while community members may view them with less respect for being \"unprofessional.\" These identity identification discrepancies can be resolved if  teachers' unions enact the following three suggestions: increase visibility in the community on an on-going basis so that the union is not heard of only during strikes; make more contacts with leaders of other community groups, turning their potential resistance into advocacy; and convey a clear, consistent, and factual message to the community.

The volume concentrates particularly on management education and training for development sectors (or public systems) carried out by postsecondary educational institutions in these countries. Part 2 sets forth concrete examples of the management constraints operative in the sectors of population and agriculture and derives the management requirements for the two sectors. Part 3 examines common models and alternative models for management education for development sectors. The teaching methods  and materials that are most effective in implementing whatever curricula are adopted are also considered. Part 4 concerns strategies for institutionalizing public management education and training programs. Studies of India and Nigeria illuminate the broad range of public policies and institutional arrangements that determine program effectiveness. The chapter concludes with discussion of the role of external assistance agencies in institutionalizing management education programs. (Author/MLF)",

Two hundred twenty-seven students across seven grade levels in 32 schools were randomly selected for observation on a minute-by-minute basis throughout the school day with an instrument developed specifically for the purpose. Five groups of students were observed: Title I students, non-Title I students in Title I schools, students in non-Title I schools, State Compensatory Education (SCE) students, and non-SCE students in SCE schools. The areas observed were area of instruction or activity in which the student under observation functioned for the  major part of the preceding minute, the group size, any adult contact, the place in which instruction occurred, and the materials used by the student. Among the findings was that only 47-50 percent of the school day was used for instructional activities. Numerous charts and tables of data are included. (Author/IRT)",

In addition to simply locating effective predictors of implementation, an attempt is made to examine the relative impact of variables associated with two theoretical perspectives--social psychology (school culture) and sociological (school structure)--and to synthesize the two. The structure and culture variables have unique contributions to make to the understanding of change outcomes, although they are differentially effective in predicting two dimensions of change: quality (\"how different\") and quantity (\"how much\"). In addition, there are interactions between the structure and culture variables that have a significant impact on the change process. It is impossible to  develop an adequate theory of planned change in schools without paying attention to both significant structure features of the organization, such as pattern of authority, size, and teaching technology, and to characteristics of the internal organizational environment, such collegiality, morale, and tension or conflict. The finding that quality of change and quantity of change are best predicted by different sets of variables adds testimony to the need to develop a more sophisticated conceptualization of the outcomes of the change process.

It entails identification of the alternative choices involved, the assignment of values (costs/benefits) for possible outcomes, and the expression of the probability of those outcomes being realized. With this information at hand, one can then systematically combine the values and probabilities to show the probable gain or loss that is associated with alternative choices. Chapters 1 through 5 provide an overview of the major technical aspects of decision analysis: structuring models, assigning probabilities and values, conceptualizing personal probabilities, developing inferences from evidence, and  determining information value. The concepts are developed in the context of defense or defense-related examples. Chapter 6 provides a case study in the form of a dialogue, between a decision analyst and a task force commander, centered around the use of decision analysis in resolving a decision problem faced by the commander. The case study is designed to exemplify all the principles developed in chapters 1 through 5. (Author/IRT)",

School districts often have difficulty in mobilizing appropriate resources to solve a problem. Administrative staff members must assume responsibilities that require planning and management skills for which they have not been trained by either academic courses or job experience. The Pennsylvania Executive Academy was established to help school districts resolve pressing local educational problems. The academy provides school district administrative teams an opportunity to acquire planning, management, and problem-solving skills and to use these skills in designing action plans to  solve problems. This operational handbook contains an organizational chart, job descriptions, program descriptions, and outlines the academy's role and the procedures necessary to obtain its services. (Author/MLF)",

The Austin, Texas, Independent School District's board of trustees passed in 1975 the first version of the minimum competency testing requirement for Austin public school students. It stated that students not demonstrating an eighth grade competence (as measured by standard achievement tests) in reading and math cannot graduate from Austin high schools. The problems encountered in implementing the board's mandate, such as test selection, test security, and test  administration, are described in this speech. (Author/DS)",

Data were collected on student achievement, teacher and administrator attitudes, and parent opinion. The quarter system evaluation found that the majority of students, teachers, and parents are satisfied with education in Austin. However, several areas of concern were revealed, including student academic achievement, graduation requirements and preparation of students for posthigh school plans, student advising and scheduling, curriculum, communication  with parents, and opinion about the year-round school.

Each child wore an FM transmitter-microphone for 3 1/2 consecutive days. Prliminary analysis of the acoustic data was in terms of actual data time, parental lesson time, and number of engaged (verbal interactions) and unengaged times in the natural environment. Descriptive analysis was then performed along four dimensions: an overview of the household, the vocal controls directed to the child, the vocal movements displayed by the child, and the non-vocal movements displayed by the child which were the setting for engagements. Two major conclusions were that each child spent the major portion of the day unengaged thus limiting the opportunities for the  establishment of verbal behavior; and that the nature and functions of the engagements which did take place were unlikely to enhance the establishment of verbal behavior. The results underscored the need for parent education programs. (DB)",

In order to determine whether phonological confusion is a source of dialectical interference, the Kamehameha Early Education Program (KEEP) Phone Discrimination Test (KPDT) was developed for the one hundred twelve students in the KEEP school (K-3). This research report describes the development of the procedure for item inclusion and for administration of the test. The research sought to answer the following questions: (1) whether bidialectal confusion difficulties should be assumed, (2) whether all confusions of this sort are idiosyncratic in nature, and (3) whether there is a need for a program to eliminate confusions due to differing phoneme inventories of an idiolectal or  dialectal nature. Eight Hawaiian-Creole-speaking children selected by KEEP personnel were the subjects in the development of the test. The final version concentrates on five phoneme pairs which appear to be sources of allophonemic confusion for the children tested. It appears to test (at the allophonemic level) points of overall phonemic confusion which could be predicted to be sources of difficulty in learning phoneme-grapheme correspondence. This report includes a test sample and directions for its administration and use. (AMH)",

The instruments discussed in the first section are described in detail: the technique of elicited information, development of the test items,  administration and scoring procedures, and analysis of the results. The studies discussed in the second section were aimed at determining the normative pattern of acquisition of SE features and exploring the effects of various instructional approaches on SE feature acquisition. In this section there is also discussion of studies done with a few supposedly non-verbal children. Conclusions are drawn which deal with the correlation between improvement in Standard English, Creole English, and general language facility and educational development. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"This is a report of the results of an investigation of a test of plurality and past tense in standard English (SE). This research replicated Gleason's 1957-58 study in Boston. The subjects were 27 speakers of Hawaiian Creole English (HCE) in a kindergarten class in Honolulu. The results showed that the children produced very few SE plural and past tense forms. Several interpretations of the results are given. First, HCE-speaking children do not possess the categories of either past tense or plurality. Secondly, the experiment failed, not the children, who in other settings, produce plural forms. With regard to past tense formation, there was probably interference from a Creole rule. In addition, the test situation may have been threatening to the child for cultural reasons.  Finally, the test and the testing situation may have been adequate, but the complex language situation in Hawaii may tend to delay complete language development. It is concluded that the same test is not always appropriate in all cultures and that such an investigation can produce damaging results if it is not interpreted properly. (Author/AMH)",

Tests of English language skills were administered to early immersion, grade 7 immersion, and English control students. Tests of French language skills were administered to the same groups and to a group of seventh grade native French speakers. A questionnaire designed to measure attitudes towards various ethnolinguistic groups was administered to the three groups of Anglophone students. A language use questionnaire determined students' use of French in and out of school. Results show that: (1) immersion programs are not detrimental to the development of English language skills or to academic  achievement of children in such programs; (2) early immersion has a greater impact on the development of French language skills than does seventh grade immersion, but that the latter fostered the development of speaking skills; (3) at the end of the seventh grade, neither the early nor grade 7 immersion programs appear to have had any ameliorative effect on the attitudes of English Canadian students towards French Canadians and European French people; and (4) immersion students use French more outside of the classroom than do control students.

They were asked to look back on their schooling and to appraise its effects on their lives. Their parents were asked to do the same. Questionnaires designed to elicit information on competence and use of French, assessment of French instructional programs, and plans for the future were given to all those who had started school in a French immersion kindergarten twelve years previously, and to their parents. Questionnaires were also given to pupils and parents who had been in the original English comparison classes. Results show clear appreciation for the early immersion experience both in students and parents.  Students in early immersion express a feeling of well-being and satisfaction with their proficiency in French, which is much more advanced than that reached by the English comparison students. Immersion students also show a more positive attitude towards French-speaking Canadians, express more desire to stay in Quebec and to become fully bilingual. Appendices of the report consist of summaries of the commentaries of the students and their parents. (CLK)",

Learners are required to fill in the blanks in short texts, or &quot;discourses,&quot; which as far as possible are so constructed that there is only one lexical item that would be judged an appropriate filler by native speakers. This technique can be tested by means of a questionnaire administered to native speakers. The main advantages of this technique are that it can be used to test specific hypotheses about learners' interlanguage and to compare different  populations, including both learners and native speakers. Certain difficulties that arise in item construction and data analysis are also discussed in detail, particularly the problem of limiting both syntactic and situational possibilities, the significance of inappropriate responses, and the wording of questionnaire instructions.

The following principles should form the core for the intermediate year: (1) The course must be based on the language itself; it must reinforce and increase the student's knowledge of the language in a systematic way. (2) The course must contribute to the student's liberal education. (3) The student must learn to appreciate the fact that language is an instrument of communication. (4) The student must learn that  language can be of practical use. The content of the course follows from the foregoing principles. Basic components of the course include emphasis on correct usage, especially of verbs and idiomatic expressions, study of the culture of the country, and the use of a wide variety non-fictional and fictional materials, audio-visual materials and visits from native speakers.

Although these disciplines have traditionally been separated, they have common areas of concern, and there are indications of a growing interest on the part of speech pathologists in such linguistic subfields as sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and neurolinguistics. Speech and hearing publications are paying attention to theoretical and methodological linguistic models, and descriptions of communication disorders are using linguistic paradigms as a basis. Given the interest of speech pathology in linguistics, there is both an obligation and an opportunity for linguists to define new roles for themselves within speech pathology. This requires the identification of  common areas and methods by which the linguist can adapt linguistic concerns so that they are meaningful to the speech pathologist. Areas of common interest include communication disorders, phonetics, language acquisition, and language variation. Linguists may have to expand their data base to include the particular interests of speech pathology; they may need background information in areas not traditionally stressed in linguistics; and they must understand the goals of speech pathology as a professional field.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to provide classroom teachers with background information about code switching and its role and function within a bilingual community. The many facets of code switching and its varying characteristics are described in some detail, as well as code switching in the classroom and the importance of the teacher's attitude toward this linguistic process. Code switching has been found to be neither random nor meaningless, nor does it necessarily reflect language weakness. Rather, code switching is a device that conveys social information (concerning, for example, role relationships) or that is used as a stylistic process (e.g., to add color or emphasis to an utterance). Code switching also seems to be rule-governed, with mastery of the structure of both  languages a prerequisite. Code switching will not usually take place in the monolingual English classroom. In the bilingual Spanish/English classroom, it has been found that (1) code switching takes place primarily during Spanish instruction; (2) students seem to follow a teacher's switching pattern; and (3) Spanish is used essentially to teach the lesson, while English is used for classroom control. The implications for bilingual education are varied and complex. Policies concerning language use in bilingual schools must reflect the goals of the bilingual program. Until such goals are established, teachers should accept code switching as universal and creative verbal behavior among bilinguals. (AM)",

        "description":"The question of tenure as an economic variable is discussed. Using data from the 1973 ACE Survey of Teaching Faculty, a statistical model is provided to estimate time from Ph. D. to tenure. Results show that the tenure rate (the chance that a nontenured faculty member will be granted tenure in any given year) did increase during the period of rapid growth in academia from 1960 to 1968 in all types of institutions and in all fields within these institutions. After 1968, the tenure rate continued to increase in public institutions, but more slowly. However, in private institutions, the tenure rate remained constant or declined between 1968 and 1972. It is concluded that tenure rate did behave as an economic variable in the sense that higher tenure rates occurred at the same time as  the rapid increase in employment in academia.

Using procedures developed to measure prestige of occupations in national surveys, the attribution of prestige attached to university positions was determined. One hundred and eight positions were scaled and the scale's validity and underlying scaling criteria evaluated.

Results of questionnaires completed by 317 Yale undergraduates including 101 premedical students, in 1977, are presented. It was found that students do hold a fairly strong negative stereotype of the premedical student who is seen as excessively hard-working, competitive, grade-conscious, narrow in interests, less sociable than others, and more interested in money or prestige. It was also found that premeds themselves share the negative stereotype held by many others. It is indicated that the self-descriptions and occupational values of premeds suggest that some aspects of the stereotype may precede the situation while other aspects seem more likely to be  situationally induced. An analysis of subgroups within the premed group is provided, with comparisons between the self-descriptions and occupational values of men and women, whites and non-whites, and science majors and premeds majoring in other subjects. It is shown that students' attitudes toward premedical students are completely independent of their evaluations of the status of physicians. (SPG)",

The success factors were then grouped into four broad categories for analysis: faculty initiatives; resources; organizational facilitation; and support staff interpersonal relationships. Correlations between these factor groups and the reported success of projects were examined in order to develop models that could be useful in the prediction of successful ID projects. Preliminary data indicate a strong dependence on  faculty initiative and cooperation to make their projects work, whether they are supported by administration and adequate ID staff or not.

Twelve variables were used to define and compute similarities between pairs of schools. Two- and three-dimensional models were derived.

The conceptual framework for education outcomes developed by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS) is explained. The basic elements of any educational outcomes are discussed, followed by a presentation of other factors important for an in-depth understanding of particular educational outcomes. Six elements identified as critical to defining and differentiating among educational outcomes are: output/impact (degree of directness which characterizes the relation between educational process and educational impact); form (mode or fashion in which the outcome is observed); measureability  (degree to which the outcome can be quantitatively described); change status (degree of modification of the status quo associated with the outcome); focus (basic entity that is affected by outcome); and neutrality (value-free character of educational outcomes). Outside factors associated with educational outcomes relate to the producer/facilitator, audience, intention, functional area, and time of outcome. (SPG)",

Three general factors are revealed as being instrumental in influencing faculties in the collective bargaining movement in higher education: financial factors, governance factors, and job security factors. Other factors noted in the literature include the political views of the faculty and self-interest and philosophical beliefs of faculty about unionism. Viewpoints concerning the possible consequences of collective bargaining in higher education ranged from the potentially positive features of collective bargaining to the seriously detrimental effects of unionism on the structure, governance, salaries, and future of our  existing institutions of higher education. A definite trend towards faculty unionization in higher education was observed, especially from 1969 to 1975.

        "description":"Data collected in a fall 1975 survey of the spring 1974 graduates of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) were used to analyze the effects that various student characteristics have on the selection of post-college activities by bachelor's degree graduates. A 25-percent stratified, random sample was used with a response rate of 75 percent. The sample of 255 appears to be reasonably representative of the entire graduating class. Path analysis was used so that causal inferences could be drawn, but the categorical nature of some of the dependent variables requires conservative interpretation of the findings. Results indicate that grade point average, sex (men), and race (black) positively affect attendance at graduate or professional school; that student  background variables have little direct affect on selection of post-college activity; that grade-point average and major field (science and math) positively influence the decision to pursue a doctorate or first professional degree (law, M.D., or D.D.S.); and that SAT scores have the strongest direct affect on grade-point average of those variables included in the study. Implications of the findings suggest that ability (achievement) is an important determinant in the lives of college graduates and that while student background variables are of much less importance, they do have some influence.

NCES projections cover the 10-year period of 1975 to 1985. NCES projects that total enrollment will grow by 22.0 percent from 1975 to 1983, when it peaks. By 1985 enrollments are projected to have dropped 2.1 percent from their 1983 peak. The Carnegie estimates of headcount, degree-credit enrollments by level and type show the same general pattern of slowing growth, decline, and recovery depicted by NCES projections. The headcount enrollment is projected to grow 2.8  percent between 1980 and 1985, fall 4.1 percent from its 1985 level by 1990, and grow during the last decade of the century by 6.3 percent. Cartter projected that undergraduate enrollment will increase until 1982 at which time it will enter a decline, shrinking 7.2 percent by 1990 and continuing to decline through 1993 with relatively steady recovery for the rest of the decade. Graduate and first- professional enrollment is not predicted to suffer losses until 1987, with graduate enrollment shrinking 7.0 percent and first-professional contracting 5.1 percent between 1987 and 1990.

This paper briefly describes the theory-base of the TICCIT system; it summarizes some recent advances in instructional theory for sequencing and synthesizing related parts of a subject matter; and it describes three major implications of those advances for the design of future theory-based CAI systems. Those implications concern (1) the selection of content; (2) the use of strategies for sequencing, synthesizing, and summarizing; and (3) the provision of knowledge necessary for the learner to make good strategy decisions.

        "description":"The complexity of the design problem for modern computer based information systems has increased significantly over its predecessors. The problem presented to the designer is to configure a system which satisfies the user criterion while achieving system resource related performance criteria. The purpose of this paper is to present an evaluation technique for addressing the problem of multiple criteria performance evaluation of information systems. The goal of this technique is to provide the designer with an evaluative procedure which: (1) seeks to establish a causal relationship between user goal attainments and system resource expenditures, while allowing for the collection of heretofore hard to obtain evaluation information; (2) measures the impact of individual user classes  on internal system performance; and (3) identifies those information system activities which should be modified to improve system performance related to those goals. All of this is achieved by maintaining resource utilization statistics on a user class basis. It is thought that such an evaluation framework is capable of eliminating many of the numerous non-satisfactory designs by directing the designer to the most advantageous ones. (Author/DAG)",

Subjects were 181 students, predominantly female, enrolled in a one-year teacher training course at McGill University. Treatments consisted of two versions of a series of ten CAI lessons, one written to appear highly personalized, the other non-personalized. Significant results were found in two areas: the group receiving the personalized version scored higher on exams and took longer to complete the course. No significant difference was found between the groups in attitudes towards CAI after the course, although both showed an increase in positive attitudes. On the 18 personality variables studied, only one (achievement via independence) was found to  interact with treatment, and one (self-acceptance) with attitude toward CAI. Analysis of the findings suggests that personalization may make CAI appear less dehumanizing, and result in better learning. (Author/CMV)",

Test instructions explained a penalty would be levied for incorrect responses and that no change in score would occur for omitted items. It was hypothesized that any response on \"nonsense\" items would be an indicator of risk taking behavior. Results of correlational analyses indicated that the proportion of linear risk taking variance explained by age and sex was low, but that a moderate proportion of nonlinear variance was associated with age differentiation. By comparing data with those reported in  a previous study of New York state students, an age function for risk taking on objective examinations across a large life-span proportion was constructed. Comparison findings showed that high school students had higher risk scores than mature adults, who, in turn, had higher risk scores relative to young and middle-aged adults, suggesting the possibility of a nonlinear age function for risk taking from the second to the seventh decade of life.

In order to determine if one or the other explains more effectively the actual use of the learned target skill, two hypotheses were tested: (1) cooperating teachers utilization of the target skill would serve as a model of performance for the student teacher; and (2) the ecological system of the classroom acts as a supporter and promoter of the target skill. Thirty-two randomly selected first-year graduate students in an elementary education credentials program underwent microteaching training, one-half in  situations where the cooperating teacher made high use of the target skill (asking probing questions) and one-half in situations where low use of the skill was made. After the microteaching phase, each group was divided in half and recombined to form two new groups with opposing experiences. The two new groups then underwent a one-week teaching experience, one in classroom settings accustomed to use of the target skill, the other in classrooms where the skill was little used. Observation and analysis revealed that, while members of both groups who had undergone microteaching in the target skill high usage classes initially made use of the skill, continuation of the usage was maximum in those classrooms where the students were accustomed to previous teacher utilization of the skill and  could respond appropriately. Thus it would seem that the second hypothesis is a more effective explanation for target skill usage. (MB)",

Suggestions include: (1) inform all of the involved groups--students, teachers, parents, school officials, community members--of the drug education curriculum and make them aware of each stage of program implementation; (2) gain cooperation and assistance for program implementation; (3) ensure commitment of the various groups involved; (4) train all groups to deal with drug-related questions; (5) maintain contact  with all involved groups; (6) anticipate trouble areas; (7) be experimental, but not sloppy; (8) be realistic--expect things to go wrong; and (9) listen to others.

The following factors were examined to determine whether attitudes toward them differed significantly among the selected students: (1) rapport with cooperating teachers, (2) rapport with principal, (3) teaching as a profession, (4) rapport with university supervisor, and (5) professional preparation. The study found significantly more positive attitudes towards the five factors among early childhood and elementary students compared to special education students. No differences were found by placement  situation. Significant correlations were found between Rapport with Cooperating Teacher and Rapport with University Supervisor. The study strongly suggests that the variables influencing the attitudes a student forms during his professional training and student teaching experiences are complex and require a search for adequate models of supervision and the types of situations that produce acceptance and enthusiasm in the student.

        "description":"This study was conducted to determine whether differences in teachers' perceptions of their jobs primarily reflect differences in the teachers themselves, or whether the variance in attitudes also reflects significant differences in the characteristics of schools as workplaces. Data on seven dimensions of job satisfaction (teacher attitudes toward the school principal, curriculum, materials and procedures, colleagues, community attitudes toward education, teaching per se, and compensation) were collected from a questionnaire administered to 650 public school teachers in seven schools of a Midwest urban school district. Data analysis proceeded in two steps: (1) investigation of whether teachers in different schools have significantly different levels of job satisfaction. For all  seven schools this significance did exist, indicating that the prediction of a teacher's job satisfaction necessitated knowing at which school the teacher worked; (2) Investigation of attributes affecting each dimension of job satisfaction. A priority specifications of characteristics believed to be determinants of each dimension of job satisfaction were made and compared to teacher questionnaire responses, and the resulting general themes presented. Teacher demographic characteristics and school characteristics explained only some variance in job satisfaction, suggesting a need for more detailed information on these characteristics and on the attitudes teachers bring to their jobs. Implications of the report indicate a need to recognize a multifaceted concept of job satisfaction, with  school policies designed to take into account possible differential effects on various aspects of satisfaction.

The study sought to answer two primary questions: (1) Do teachers as a group use new information to readjust their expectancies of students rather than form quick and stable expectancies on the basis of a few initial cues? and (2) Are some information sources held in higher esteem than others by teachers and, if so, what influence does this information have on the expectancy that is formed by the teachers? The study emerged from the Cognitive Information Processing/Social  Interaction (CIP/SI) model, which considers the source/content dyad and the context as components of the system by which humans develop expectancies. Information content and source are manipulated in order that both their independent and interactive effects can be measured. Subjects were 240 elementary inservice teachers in Kentucky. Teachers were asked to rate a hypothetical student on three opinion or attitude scales of (1) trust, (2) social ability, and (3) academic ability. The rating took place after the viewing of a silent videotape of a child in a classroom situation and again after successive bits of information were added to the situation. The data analyses revealed evidence that suggests that teachers as a group constantly use new information to readjust their expectancies of  students. Question two was not answered.

Problems in the field center around (1) the mechanisms, attitudes, political structures, and reward systems existing in elementary and secondary education; (2) the time span allowed in developing proposals and conducting research and for results to become evident; (3) the self-reinforcing attitude of distrust and doubt among educators, who are wary of new research because of previous unfavorable research. Responsibility for changing the quality of research rests in four basic  areas: (1) the financial support system, (2) participatory school systems, (3) the researchers, and (4) research training programs. Given the problems involving current systems which do not, and cannot, effect rigorous applied research in education and the general distrust regarding research as an effective change agent, the author makes nine recommendations to improve the situation, involving (1) organizational systems, (2) legal status of research organizations, (3) regional orientation, (4) materials and equipment identification and acquisition, (5) model research activities, (6) communication and implementation of data, (7) information dissemination, (8) communication and implementation of successful programs, and (9) feedback into training programs.

Subjects of the study were members of thirty kindergarten classes in the Kindergarten Extended Day (KED) Program of the St. Louis Public School System, designed to provide supplementary instruction to students identified as deficient in basic skill areas. Eight independent variables characterizing facets of implementation were observed during classroom operation of a language and thinking (LAT) program: (1) time on task, (2) teacher preparedness, (3) correct following of procedures, (4) proper use of materials; (5)  teacher effectiveness in maintaining student attentiveness and elicitation of student responses, (6) student interest in the lesson, (7) extensity of coverage, and (8) preparation time for lessons. The dependent variables of the study were student achievements in five of the ten LAT packages (Colors, Shapes, Sizes, Directions, and Blends) as measured by the LAT Criterion Mastery Tests. Statistical analysis of data resulting from observation ratings and mastery tests shows that teachers did vary in their implementation of the LAT program, but that the variation in implementation was not related to class achievement. Most of the variance in achievement levels was due to variance in initial ability. An extensive reference list and three appendixes conclude the report. (MB)",

Selected independent variables served as hypotheses regarding which behaviors are likely to occur during concept instruction and which are likely to be relevant to student concept learning. Two basic assumptions guided the selection of relevant behaviors: (1) Teacher behavior should be examined in terms of intent. Intent may be derived from instructional objectives. (2) Relevant process variables should be derived from existing theoretical or empirical bases that provide support for expecting certain relationships between instructional behavior and student outcomes. For this investigation,  a record of classroom communication between teacher and students was made on audio-tape recordings. Analysis of classroom interaction between teacher and pupils included evaluation of how accurate and complete was the teacher's knowledge of the subject and how effective was the teacher in conveying concepts to the pupils. Teaching techniques were analyzed in the light of resulting student understanding and achievement. (JD)",

A 22-item questionnaire, based on a 110-item survey, asked parents and teachers to rate the importance of affective teacher characteristics. The question of whether parents and teachers feel affective teacher behaviors are an important part of the classroom environment was explored. Teachers were also asked to evaluate other teachers' performance. Questions related to teacher behavior and attitudes toward such topics as the treatment of the individual child, racial and ethnic prejudice, the relationship of the pupil to school and society, and how moral values can be strengthened. The first section of this study investigates parents' evaluation of the importance of  these and other topics and their judgment of the degree to which teachers demonstrate these competencies in their classroom. The second part concerns teachers' evaluation of an identical list of competencies in handling these concepts and the degree of concordance between their evaluation and that of the parents. (JD)",

Two questions were addressed: (a) Do students who have more time allocated to a particular subject area also learn more in that area? and (b) Do students who spend more \"engaged time\" in a particular subject area learn more in that subject area? Achievement tests in reading and mathematics were administered in nine grade 2 classrooms on two occasions approximately eight weeks apart. In the inter-test period, time allocated to specific content categories was reported daily by teachers. In six of the classes \"engaged time\" was assessed by direct observation. Quantities of allocated and \"engaged time\" were related to achievement in a series of regression analyses.  Instruction time and student achievement were positively related. Substantial differences in amounts of time were necessary before this relationship could be detected. The strength and consistency of the relationship varied considerably. (Authors)",

The complex dynamics of interaction between teacher, student, and educational researcher are explored. Conventional research in education is characterized as relying heavily on methods adopted from other types of research in such fields as agriculture and science. This methodology is not always valid in dealing with human beings who are changeable, volatile, and subject to varied pressures both within and outside of the classroom. Doubts about the amount of impact conventional research has on actual educational practice are raised. A system of \"quasi-clinical\" inquiry is outlined. This is a wholistic approach in which the researcher includes observation of teacher and student interaction,  grouping patterns, playground fights, teacher isolation, etc. It is not restricted to examination of presentation of cognitive material; pretesting and posttesting. The quasi-clinical approach to educational research uses repeated measures in conjunction with planned interventions; studies role changes and relationships among participants; and has the dual objectives of generating knowledge while participating in a helping relationship with school personnel.

A branching questionnaire, which asked subjects to respond only in those areas relevant to their own experience, was sent to a sample of students enrolled at the State University of New York College at Potsdam. The data indicate that: (1) perceptions of the actual conditions within the teaching profession do not seem to act as strong determiners in career decisions; (2) subjects do not seem concerned with salary, career status, safety, and the  nature of the client; (3) teacher education programs are perceived as highly vocationally oriented and useful only in obtaining positions in the teaching profession; and (4) students may be forming their perceptions from informal and not completely accurate sources. The results tentatively suggest two strategies for dealing with declining enrollment: (1) altering students' perceptions in relation to the employment outlook of college graduates so that it is more in tune with reality; and (2) making undergraduates more aware of the possibilities of education as a profession.

The difficulties involved in using the common pretest-posttest experimental design are described. To grapple with these problems, a study was conducted on the effect of environmental changes on student behavior, employing a time-series design and time-series analysis. The hypothesis tested was that minor changes in the physical setting of the classroom could produce predictable, desirable changes in students' behavior. Formal observations of students' locations and activities were conducted six times a day for two weeks, using a time-sampling-by-child instrument. The data from the six daily observations of all children were reduced to daily summary statistics indicating the percentage of  time children were observed in a particular area or engaged in a specific activity. The data were then analyzed using time-series techniques. Results indicated that most of the desired behavior changes were produced, thus supporting the hypothesis. The same experiment was conducted using the traditional statistical methods. The conclusion was reached that time-series techniques appear to have great potential for educational research. (JD)",

The course evolved as a function of continuous process evaluation developed out of the realization that it was unnecessary to teach completely separate methods courses in special education for teacher certification in the areas of mental retardation, behavioral disorders, learning disabilities, and orthopedically impaired. The Joint Methods Course was developed to provide teaching modules in which the critical teaching skills in these areas were cross-categorized. Team teaching was provided for instruction in the modules. Students in these courses were pretested before entering a module and posttested upon completion. The students were asked to continually  evaluate their experiences in this method of instruction. Over a period of several years, student criticism and suggestions were considered and used to modify and change the curriculum and the structure of the course. Some modules were eliminated; others changed or enlarged. Eventually the joint methods course was discontinued. However, it was determined that the standard module format is an excellent model for writing subsequent modules. It also has the advantage of assuring consistency across diverse content, which facilitates student and faculty use. In addition, faculty gained extensive experience in writing competency based instructional modules. (JD)",

The following points are emphasized in regarding arts education as a basic: (1) Aesthetic experience is basic because it is a primary form of experience on which all cognition, judgment, and action depend. It is the fundamental and distinctive power of image making by the imagination. It furnishes the raw material for concepts and ideals, for creating a world of possibility. (2) The source of meaning and its exfoliation into ideas, theories, values, visions, plans, and invention is the imagination. (3) The case for arts education depends on what art can do to clarify and enrich experience that the other subjects in the curriculum cannot. (4) Art  orders feeling by giving it an expressive form perceptible by the senses--an image. Finally, the aesthetic response is indispensable to all experience and instruction in the aesthetic response is both possible and necessary. (JD)",

The standards are proposed primarily for the use of state departments of education; they emphasize an approved program approach to accreditation based on college curriculum with well developed rationale, comprehensive objectives, and continuous evaluation. These standards are also intended to help upgrade the quality of instruction in institutions engaging in teacher education and to promote a greater degree of uniformity in accreditation procedures among states. Chapter I provides a general discussion of accreditation procedures to assist state education agencies in reviewing, developing, and applying standards for legal accreditation or approval of teacher education  programs. Chapter II covers the organization, administration, and operational provisions that support a program in teacher education. Chapters III and IV present standards that deal with specific areas of teacher education. Chapter V presents standards that emphasize the importance that the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification (NASDTEC) places on the continuous development of new programs for the preparation of school personnel. These standards were designed to create an awareness on the parts of both the program developers and the accrediting agencies of the concerns that must be considered in the conception, approval, and implementation of innovative and experimental programs. The NASDTEC recommended procedures for the development of state lists  of teacher education programs approved as meeting NASDTEC standards for the purpose of interstate certification is appended.

        "description":"This document discusses how the organization of instruction influences the encoding and structuring of new material in the memory and the subsequent transfer of such information to novel situations. A theory of instruction for problem solving that considers relevant cognitive variables and that specifies the conditions for productive learning is described. First, an historical introduction to productive learning is presented including reference to the Gestalt problem solving literature, meaning theories of arithmetic instruction, and the discovery learning issue. Second, productive learning is defined and the basic external and internal (cognitive) variables are identified. Third, a theoretical framework for discussing productive learning based on the concept of assimilation is  forwarded. Fourth, results are given from a series of experiments in which a meaningful context for instruction was presented either before or after the introduction of technical information to research subjects. The assimilation theory predicts that subjects in the \"before\" groups should be more likely to engage in productive learning since they have a meaningful context available during learning into which new information may be assimilated. Results from these experiments generally uphold the prediction. (Author/MM)",

Records of individual students were kept throughout the year, first on a daily basis and later on a weekly basis. These logs provided a detailed record of the time allocated to different skill areas. (2) Observers recorded the amount of time students spent actually engaged in learning. Engaged or active learning time is that subset of the allocated time when a student appears to be attending to the learning task. Teacher logs were collected at two grade levels, the second and the fifth, and in two subjects, reading and mathematics.

The conclusion was reached that monitoring the use of time in the classroom is an important factor teaching effectiveness. (JD)",

Their task was to rank the importance of each competency in the preparation of teachers on a continuum from &quot;most&quot; to &quot;least.&quot; There were seven ranks in the continuum, and a further condition forced the respondent to put at least nine competencies in each rank. This stipulation was included to prevent large numbers of competencies from being given the same rank. Responses of each group of participants were analyzed, and some significant  differences were discovered. It appeared from the results that student interns and faculty shared a similar philosophy, which seems to be student-oriented and humanistic in nature, while the responses of the cooperating teachers seem to reflect a concern with classroom management.

        "description":"Grouping is a statistical procedure through which members of the same group are considered as a single unit of observation. There are methodological and inferential problems associated with various grouping procedures in various settings. This extensive paper focuses on making inferences about individuals when the analysis uses data that is grouped over individuals (for example, school means). The paper identifies five research contexts in which grouping is used, reviews the literature on grouping where only two variables are considered, and proposes a method for clarifying the problems involved in grouping. The method involves introduction of a new variable, a &quot;grouping variable,&quot; into the analysis procedure. The grouping variable is essentially the value assigned to members of  a group taken over all possible groups. The relationship of the grouping variable to the variables of interest forms the basis for a taxonomy of grouping situations which can then be assessed for certain statistical qualities. The paper discusses the logic and statistical basis for the method, considers the method in a variety of settings, and extends the logic to more complex cases. Empirical examples are presented and considerations for future developments are discussed. (JKS)",

There are various ways to assign group membership and various ways to assign values of variables to groups. There are methodological problems associated with grouping in general and with particular methods of grouping. This paper argues that a wide variety of complex analytical problems concerning inferences from grouped observations can be understood from the use of a few simple principles. The paper focuses on multiple regression models which use grouping and shows that the effects of grouping depend centrally on the quality of the specification of the regression model used. Simulated examples as well as examples from the literature are presented and  discussed. The principles developed are then extended to more complex cases. In particular, estimation from grouped observations in systems of simultaneous equations and in dynamic models for panel analysis are examined. (Author/JKS)",

The Delphi-Discrepancy Evaluation model is designed to assess and prescribe. The five phases of the model include: (1) establishing a standard by using the procedures of the Delphi Technique, (2) gathering data about programs based on the standard, (3) determining the discrepancy status of programs, (4) analyzing these discrepancies in relation to criteria and other programs  in the population, and (5) prescribing and remediating based on the analyses of discrepancies. Bringing together successful techniques such as the Delphi Method, Discrepancy Evaluation, and the notions of Euclidean Distance to bear on a particular evaluation problem should facilitate analyses and render decision-makers with more valid information for formative and summative purposes.

During its two years of study, the Task Force carried out a series of three USOE-supported activities designed to identify specific skills and knowledge required in educational research and evaluation. The first activity included two steps. First, the Task Force drafted lists of skills they thought were necessary in conducting research and evaluation in education. Second, the lists of skills were &quot;reality tested&quot; through interviews with 60 employers and supervisors of research and evaluation personnel. The second activity was not  strictly empirical in nature, although it used as input the results yielded by the interviews described above and depended on informal observation for the rest. In the third activity, a task analysis of research and evaluation activities in 13 agencies was conducted. These agencies included universities, research and development centers, private research agencies, regional educational laboratories, and public schools rated by the Task Force members as doing high quality work. The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the results of these three previous Task Force efforts into a single list of competencies frequently needed in educational research and evaluation. (MV)",

In the field of educational evaluation, procedures for conducting student case studies are not readily available. Although case studies, consisting of descriptions of exemplary educational projects, have been used in the past, little attention has been given to using student case studies as a basis for program evaluation. This paper addresses the purposes for using this methodology in evaluation, describes some procedures for conducting a case study, and illustrates the procedures and findings based on the use of this methodology in evaluating an Experience-Based Career Education project.

Woodson Senior High School. The purpose of the program is to improve academic achievement and student attitudes. This program is a third year continuation of the program initiated in 1972-73. Original students were selected in 1972-73 from student listings supplied by feeder-school counselors. The 300 students originally entering as tenth graders in 1972-73 have continued in the program and are now in their senior year. The third year program was expected to complete the development of pilot exercises for staff and students alike in the  development and implementation of individualized programs. Included in the evaluation are a description of the project, methods and procedures, and data analysis and results. The latter includes a comparative analysis of student attitudes, student reactions to the component, data on absences, standardized test results, the individualized curriculum for the component, teacher reactions to the component, teaching methods, teacher ratings of their classes, staff development, and teacher evaluation of the component.

        "description":"For the past five years a group of doctors at the University of Wisconsin has been developing a realistic computer-based simulation of the patient-physician encounter. Utilizing the time-shared computers, large memory and high speed logic, they have developed a highly sophisticated program which permits the physician to work-up and diagnose patients in the in-patient and out-patient environment. This program has been tested in over 1,000 simulated encounters and is currently operational at a number of medical centers around the country. Criteria for standard evaluations have been developed and tested. The main drawback is that the physician must communicate with the computer via a relatively expensive computer terminal. In order to overcome the necessity of using expensive  computer terminals they propose to combine their fully operational simulator with a Voice-Response System. Combining these two systems would permit a physician to take a simulated encounter using any standard telephone (touch-tone or dial). The physician would communicate with the computer by dialing in the necessary test request, diagnosis, etc. The computer would communicate with the physician through easily understood verbal responses. This interaction could take place anywhere there is a telephone and literally thousands of encounters would be possible simultaneously. (MV)",

        "description":"Research using Social Security data to measure the effects of government manpower training programs on the earnings of participants is discussed. Previous studies employed a longitudinal set of Social Security summary earnings records of over 50,000 individuals who participated in Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) institutional training in 1964 and 70,000 individuals randomly selected from the same file. This study used Social Security's Continuous Work History Sample (CWHS) to demonstrate that these prior studies have substantially underestimated the impact of training on earnings. The studies being criticized employed a model of income determination that did not take into account the fact that trainees were induced to join the program because they were having  difficulty finding or holding adequate jobs. The basic technique used in this paper was to compare actual post-training earnings of trainees to the earnings of a control group whose earnings potential at the time of initiation of training was identical to that of the participants. In order to compare the two groups, a model of income determination was specified and estimated using regression analysis. Since it was not possible to identify trainees in the CWHS or to obtain a reliable measure of unemployment and loss of job tenure in the summary earnings records, the estimation procedure was based on knowledge of the simple correlations among the variables.

The four methodologies covered in order are: (1) Quantitative and Psychometric Analysis, (2) Ethnographic  Analysis, (3) Historical, and (4) Managerial Analysis. The two methodologies not reported here, but used in the project, are the Comparative Case Study approach and the Classroom Learning Environments Studies.

In this paper an approach to biased item identification using ICC theory is described and applied. The ICC theory approach is attractive in that it, (1) appears to be sensitive largely to cultural variations in the trait gauged by test items, (2) does not assume total scores to be valid indicators of true ability, (3) places the identified degree of item bias on a quantified metric, and (4) is applicable to items of sufficiently varying degrees of difficulty. While sensitive to some factors other than item bias, namely, local independence, item inappropriateness and poor  parameter estimates, the approach may prove useful to the measurement field.

        "description":"Several sets of data are analyzed, all of which demonstrate that estimates of achievement rates can differ dramatically when different time periods are used for an evaluation of a compensatory education program. Specifically, it is found that including the summer months in an evaluation often considerably reduces estimates of achievement and hence monthly achievement rates. In other words, achievement gains made during the school year are not sustained, even until the next fall. These findings are consistently supported by the data regardless of the standardized achievement test used, the grade level, the subject area, or the program. An evaluation of a one-year program should at least take account of fall-to-fall achievement. For multi-year programs, evaluations should be based  on a time period that includes the summer following each year of the program. Including the following summer in an evaluation will allow the conclusion to reflect the extent to which student achievement is sustained and will, therefore, provide more useful information to those concerned with improving programs.

Tables were constructed using two levels of success--&quot;C or better&quot; and &quot;B or better&quot; first semester grade point averages. The tables were smoothed using each method and evaluated according to how closely the smoothed tables corresponded to observed data at the same institutions in 1971-72 and in 1972-73. The smoothed tables were more accurate than those based  on 1969-70 observed relative frequencies. A linear regression of observed relative frequency on predictor value was most accurate; two extensions of an isotonic regression method were nearly as accurate. A commonly used regression method was found to be less accurate than most other methods. (Author)",

Sympson explicates the role of latent trait theory in measurement for criterion prediction and in criterion referenced measurement. C. David Vale then discusses the use of adaptive testing procedures to make ability classification decisions (i.e., cutting score decisions). In the fourth paper Steven M. Pine argues that a major problem in current efforts to develop less biased tests is an  over-reliance on classical test theory. Item characteristic curve theory is offered as a more appropriate measurement model. In the final paper by Isaac I.

Analyses were applied to data gathered at the kindergarten, elementary, and secondary levels on four affective instruments and four achievement measures over a two-year period. Relationships found on the first year's data were positive but very small, although significance was reached in some comparisons, partially as a result of the large sample sizes. Additional analyses were carried out using entry-level California Achievement Test (CAT) and affective measures as predictors for end-of-year CAT scores. Further analyses are proceeding on the following year's data. (Author/RC)",

        "author":["Rudner, Lawrence M."],
        "description":"Using conventional mental test theory, item parameters of an aptitude or achievement test vary with each group of examinees, and as such are somewhat limited in their use and interpretation. Within the last 25 years, measurement models have emerged in which item parameters are considered to be invariant. Generically referred to as latent trait mental measurement or item characteristic curve theory, these models have precipitated the development of sophisticated tailored testing techniques which capitalize on the item parameter invariance feature. This paper examines the invariance feature for the Birnbaum 2 and 3 parameter logistic models. The investigation is in two parts, the first theoretical, the second empirical. Even with somewhat inadequate data, the empirical  investigation supported the theoretical considerations. (Author/RC)",

In view of the breakthroughs in several testing problem areas brought about by the use of latent trait theory, it is clear that the field of latent trait theory will become increasingly more important to measurement specialists and test practitioners. This paper comprehensively reviews this field and addresses four matters. First, the nature and characteristics of latent trait theory are introduced. Second, a review of many of the technical developments in the field is  provided. Third, several promising applications of latent trait models are described. Finally, some additional areas for research and development are suggested. (RC)",

The study determines whether the application of reliability or &quot;true score&quot; corrections alters the results obtained via an analysis employing uncorrected covariates in such a fashion as to appreciably change the policy-oriented conclusions of an evaluator. The data on which this paper is based were collected for the 1976 Follow Through evaluation and include measures on a total of over 5,000 children who began the program in kindergarten (Fall 1971) and  completed it in third-grade (Spring 1975). Results indicate that application of true-score corrections using three separate reliability estimates to covariates employed on analysis of covariance did not change the conclusions of the Follow Through evaluators.

        "description":"A national random sample of over 14,000 high school seniors was studied with respect to socio-cultural differences in responses to cognitive test items. Six different cognitive tests and ten different groups were analyzed. The tests were: vocabulary, picture-number, reading, letter-groups, mathematics, and mosaic comparisons. The groups were: American Indians, Blacks, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Other Latin-Americans, Oriental-Americans, White Northeastern, White North Central, White Southern, and White Western. Proportions of each group responding correctly to each item of each test were computed and then transformed to an interval scale of delta-values. The delta-values for the White North Central group were then cross-plotted with each of the other groups to yield an  elliptical pattern of points for each comparison. The major axis of the ellipse for each cross-plot was determined and the distance of each item-point from it computed. These distances were used to create a vector index of cross-cultural stability. Items having notable patterns of instability were examined closely for factors which might explain such an outcome. The greatest instabilities were noted among the vocabulary items. These vocabulary instabilities appeared to be attributable to linguistic differences, primarily those existing between Spanish-speaking groups and other groups. Vocabulary items involving cognates were relatively easier for the Spanish-speaking groups. It was also observed that reading test items having material relevant to black culture was relatively easier for  blacks than were other items in the test battery. (Author/MV)",

For simplicity these factors are described as if each were dichotomous, when in actuality each is a continuum; a test method may be more or less direct, conditions more or less standardized. Moreover, as shown here, the dimensions are depicted as independent, when in practice they are not--for instance, indirect methods of testing are often used to attain objective scoring; and process criteria to achieve standardized conditions. Nevertheless, this simple framework provides a useful analytic tool for developers and users of performance tests. It can guide the development of a test, or be used after the fact to  identify weaknesses in existing tests. More generally it defines problem areas confronting the performance testing practitioner--problem areas which must be addressed by research and creative development work if performance tests are to be used reliably and validly.

These two objectives are to fund special services to low achieving students in the poorest schools and to contribute to the cognitive, emotional, social, or physical development of participating students. In designing the research, NIE recognized that all of Title I's purposes cannot be addressed within a single research project, using a uniform research strategy. NIE therefore decided to implement separate studies to address each specific purpose of the Title I program. In keeping with this strategy separate studies were undertaken to  describe compensatory education services currently being delivered and the effects of these services on children. The study uses data gathered from the research on selected programs to interpret the data on services and to determine, for selected instructional areas, the apparent potential for success of practices in use throughout the country. This paper illustrates the NIE research strategy and presents some preliminary findings from the survey of services. (RC)",

Indications of the program's impact were found in the large percentages of school personnel who reported increased interest in individualized instruction, reaching pupils' homes, and furthering their  own education. Respondents also gave the program an overwhelming vote of confidence in response to the question, &quot;Would you like to see the Follow Through Program continued?&quot; All of the staff developers, 83 percent of the teachers, 98 percent of the classroom aides, and 96 percent of the parents answered affirmatively.

        "description":"The findings and conclusions of an inquiry into the use and value of college academic records as a primary basis for predicting later occupational success are summarized. The inquiry revealed a wide variation in the meaning of grades from school to school. The quality of students accepted by different colleges varies widely. This variation is modified, but not eliminated, by college experiences so that there remain large differences in quality among college graduates. These great differences are masked by the apparent uniformity existing in grading systems among colleges, when in fact grading systems vary widely both between and within colleges. The recent phenomenon of grade inflation has only intensified this masking effect. Because grades vary widely from school to school,  grade point average may be of little value in predicting success either in specific occupations or in other adult accomplishments. Although technical inadequacies of much research in this area make conclusions difficult to draw, much empirical evidence implies that grade point average is a poor predictor of later vocational achievement. At the very least, the evidence suggests that no single measure of college achievement should be used alone as a basis for selection decisions. (Author)",

The reading and mathematics components of the District of Columbia Title I program was evaluated using both types of tests and two of the three models. The third analysis design was initially considered for implementation, but serious violations of its requirements by the data disqualified that model for eventual usage with this year's District of Columbia data. This paper presents a description of the three  models and the results derived from implementing two of the three. Additionally, a differential growth rate associated with development as evidenced in the norms tables of various currently used instruments is discussed and potential areas of further research are highlighted.

The Jargon-Loaded reports were rated as more technical than the Jargon-Free reports. The least difficult format was the Jargon-Free Subjective report and the  most difficult was the Jargon-Loaded Subjective report. The Subjective reports were rated as more practical and the Jargon-Loaded Subjective reports were rated as less believable than Jargon-Free Objective reports.

Aspects of TW observed included stem cue and specific determiner identification and usage and the elimination of similar and absurd options. Subjects were observed three times at two year intervals in grades 5, 7, and 9; 6, 8, 10; 7, 9, 11; and 8, 10, 12. Results showed low to moderate internal consistency for the 16 item TW scale and test-retest correlations of approximately the same magnitude as KR20 indicating TW was somewhat stable over the intervals observed. Sex by year MANOVA trend analysis showed no sex effects and no sex by year interactions. A significant linear trend was observed  over all four-year intervals with a quadratic trend appearing in the 7, 9, 11 sample. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"Cooperative testing is a rather specific and practical aspect of validity generalization or test transportability. It refers to two or more units of government combining their testing and/or recruiting efforts. The Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 (P.L. 1-648) made specific provision for cooperative examining in stating that the Civil Service Commission may join, on a shared-cost basis, with State and local governments in cooperative recruiting and examining activities under agreed upon procedures and regulations. Cooperative testing can also be thought of as the referral by one government to another of any names prescreened by any test or qualification. The need for broadening the concept of cooperative testing became evident as review of existing and proposed cooperative  agreements raised psychometric, legal, and policy questions concerning the interchange of test scores, including the extent of Federal responsibility for ensuring the job relatedness and fairness of tests used for more than one government. This review took place in the spring of 1973 when a task force of operating, legal, and psychometric experts met within the Civil Service Commission. The results of that review, as they relate to cooperative testing, are the basis for this paper. (Author/MV)",

The primary focus of the Assessment Program is on providing meaningful data on school, district, and state achievement. At the same time, valuable information on each student tested is available to schools in optional student and classroom reports. This guide explains the variety of report forms used to present the results of the 1976-77  assessment of students in grades 3 and 5. Chapter I contains background information about the program and the assessment procedures. Chapter II illustrates and describes each report form. Chapter III discusses considerations in interpreting results to identify strengths and weaknesses at the curriculum, classroom, and student levels. Appendix A contains new statewide basic skills objectives and describes the procedures used to develop them. Appendix B discusses state-established criteria for determining whether or not each student has achieved each objective. (Author/MV)",

The principal findings are: (1) While the Total Program (TFT) shows continuous improvement in both Math and Reading in Grades K-3 across the five years, it is the Behavior Analysis Model (BA) which has produced the greatest positive program effect. (2) Across the five years and across Grades K-3, BA easily ranks first among the models in both Math and Reading. (3) The closest model to BA in K-3 performance across the five years is the Bank Street (BS), which  ranked second among the models in Math and third in Reading. (4) The Parent Implemented Model (PI) could not be ranked over the five years because it was not tested in 1972-1973. The Philadelphia Process Model (PP) ranked second in Reading across the five years, principally because of improved performance in 1975-1976. It ranked fifth in Math, however. The Education Development Center Model (EDC) ranked third in Math, and fourth in Reading, having improved substantially since 1974-1975.

A conference was held at Berkeley in April, 1976, to consider this situation. Participants included professional evaluators, teachers, parents, students, and interested others. One outcome was this hypothesis: The efficacy of information produced in an evaluation effort varies inversely with the number of organizational levels that the action the information describes is removed from the decision process the information is intended to influence. In support, it is noted that any information has a syntactic aspect, a semantic aspect, and an effectiveness or influence aspect. It is then argued that the syntactic aspect is violated in trying to  detect small effects by aggregating data across organization levels; that greater error variance is produced in such an effort; that the most useful information semantically is that from the same organizational level as the user; and that information from other levels is certain to be less motivating. Recommendations include humanizing evaluation, involving the evaluated, removing racism and sexism from evaluation efforts, use of more appropriate evaluations by teachers, increasing the relevance of evaluation to decision makers, and organizing a public constituency for change of evaluation philosophy and practice.

Quantitative measures included indices of language productivity, vocabulary diversity, spelling, and syntactic maturity. Power of specific indices to account for variation in overall writing quality was examined through use of multiple regression analysis. Subjects were 983 students in grades four, six, nine, and twelve; they were chosen from 20,000 participants in the Virginia Educational Needs Assessment Project who comprised a stratified random sample of 57 of Virginia's 140 school divisions. Subjects were matched on sex and levels of ability and achievement so that this sample resembled a nationwide rather than a  statewide sample. Results of the correlation analysis indicated that quantitative and qualitative measures of writing skills are significantly related. Results of multiple regression analysis indicated that sizable amounts (from 21 percent to 57 percent in this study) of the variation in the qualitative assessement of writing performance can be accounted for by using the following quantitative predictors: total words written, total sentences written, percentage of unique words written, percentage of unique words misspelled, and number of words per T-unit.

A multicultural curriculum can be viewed in two ways by educators: (1) as a necessary evil implemented to appease the vocal minority, and (2) as an attempt to meet the student demand for curriculum relevance. In the second case, a multicultural curriculum has the potential of becoming a viable and exciting concept. This scholarly discussion indicates that developing a multicultural curriculum requires a change in educators' attitudes, materials, and instructional methodologies. Educators need to examine the nature, the rationale for, and the methods  of implementing a multicultural curriculum. These issues are explained. (Author/BS)",

The Court of Appeals had ruled that extensive cross-town transportation was to be used in order to achieve racial balance in every school in Austin, Texas. The Supreme Court reviewed the case in light of Washington V. Davis and decided that the Court of Appeals erred by a readiness to impute to the Austin School officials a segregative intent far more pervasive than the evidence justified, and that the Appeals court erred in ordering a desegregation plan that far exceeded any identifiable violations of  constitutional rights. The Supreme Court found that the remedy ordered by the Court of Appeals exceeded that which was necessary to eliminate the effect of any official acts of omission on the part of the school system.

MHDC, a nonprofit developer contracted to purchase a tract within the boundaries of the Village of Arlington Heights, Illinois in order to build racially integrated low and moderate income housing. The contract was contingent upon securing rezoning as well as federal housing assistance. MHDC applied to the Village of Arlington Heights for the necessary rezoning from a single-family to a multiple-family classification. The Village denied rezoning stressing zoning factors that were operating in the area. After the Village denied rezoning, MDHC and individuals from minority groups filed a suit for  injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the denial was racially discriminatory and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The District Court held that the Village's rezoning denial was motivated not by racial discrimination but by a desire to protect property values and maintain the Village's zoning plan. Though approving those conclusions, the Court of Appeals reversed the earlier Court ruling finding that the ultimate effect of the rezoning denial would disproportionately affect blacks, particularly in view of the fact that the general suburban area, though economically expanding, continued to be marked by residential segregation. The Supreme Court reversed the judgement of the Court of Appeals finding, after re-examination  of the evidence, that the MHDC and minority respondents failed to carry their burden of proving that discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor in the Village's decision. The Supreme Court concluded that Arlington had not been guilty of discrimination. (Author/AM)",

It may be considered by some as a celebration of the Bicentennial. It begins with a discussion of the condition of blacks during the Revolutionary War and continues with an examination of this condition during the following four periods: 1) the Revolutionary to the Civil War, 2) the Civil War through Booker T. Washington to Plessy vs. Ferguson, 3) Plessy vs. Ferguson to Brown vs. Board of Education, and 4) Brown vs. Board of Education to the present. Throughout the discussion of each period, there are detailed references to specific books, documents, journals, acts and conventions, reflecting the black experience  during a specific period of time. In addition quotes from prominent blacks and whites (e.g. John Hope Franklin, U.S. Supreme Court Justice John M. Harlan) are used to illustrate specific historic occasions. Included is a detailed list of &quot;Legacies to Black Education&quot; (important events in black American education organized according to the four historical periods designated by the paper). A bibliography is included. (PR)",

        "description":"This scholarly paper assesses biases due to measurement errors in structural equation models of the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status by estimating unobserved variable models with data from the remeasurement program of the 1973 Occupational Changes in Generation-II survey. It is noted that reports of social background and achievement variables by nonblack males are subject to strictly random errors, while reports of black males appear subject to significant nonrandom errors. When measurement errors are ignored for nonblacks, occupational returns to schooling are underestimated by about 15%, the effects of some background variables are underestimated by as much as 22%, and variation in socioeconomic achievements not attributable to education or social origins  by as much as 27%. Biases appear to be substantially greater for nonblacks. Consequently ignoring measurement error exaggerates racial differences in returns to schooling and occupational inequality not attributable to social origins. (Author/AM)",

The purpose of this program was to improve the reading skills of high school students (grades 9-12) whose reading fell two or more years below their grade level. The program was conducted in 8 alternative independent mini high schools in the New York City school system. Among the program objectives were the following: to improve reading levels, to generate more positive attitudes toward reading, and to provide students with reading skills that would improve performance in other academic areas. The program combined an individualized approach to reading together with high interest level reading material. One of the major strengths of the program was the  teaching staff and their ability to establish an excellent working relationship with their students. One of the major weaknesses of the program was poor student attendance at some schools. Student reading levels were improved and more positive attitudes toward reading were generated for many of the students who did attend school. (Author/AM)",

It was designed to reinforce the cognitive growth of disadvantaged high school students who were referred from one of three Title I programs: Skills Remediation in Reading; Remedial Mathematics; and Native Language Arts, English as a Second Language. The program provided supplementary counseling and family consultation to eligible students and operated in 32 high schools. The treatment group consisted of 2,873 students who received intensive services of at least 10 small group sessions or 12 individual sessions. The control group consisted of a subset (1,061 students) of the treatment group who participated in the same main component in the previous  year or semester and who did not receive intensive service during the previous period. Findings indicated that students in the remedial reading program showed statistically significant improvements in grades 9 through 12, when the treatment length was for one year and in grades 9 and 10 when the treatment length was for one semester. Remedial math students showed an improved average monthly gain, but these were not statistically significant. The number of students from the ESL program was small (19) students) and results did not indicate statistically significant gains. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The Elementary Secondary Education Act Title I program, Summer Reading Remediation for Incoming Pupils 1975, had two goals: to improve reading skills by supplying an intensive program of remediation in reading and to orient incoming students to their new school environment and its staff. Participating in the program were 2807 ninth and tenth grade students. They were both pre and post tested. All student participants were selected from Title I intermediate and junior high schools. They were identified as retarded in reading. They were volunteers. The program consisted of one 50 minute period per day, five days a week. Reading skills were also stressed during a daily reinforcing activities period (metal shop, typing, drafting, etc). Statistical analysis of gain scores as measured  by the Metropolitan Achievement Test showed that students who were in the program for a maximum of 14 instruction days made significant gains, on the average, over one month's improvement. Some reasons for the large gains obtained were: the small class size (no more than 15 students per instructor), the diagnostic-prescriptive approach to reading remediation employed, the availability of a wide range of materials, and the fact that remediation in reading comprehension and vocabulary skills was integrated into other class activities (metal shop, typing, drafting, etc.).

The purpose of the program was to improve achievement in reading and to provide meaningful socialization activities for these children during the summer months. The major objective of the program was to help pupils achieve mastery of instructional objectives in reading. The CROFT (Reading) criterion referenced tests were used as assessment measures. The program was staffed by 178 teachers  and 46 paraprofessionals under the supervision of 21 teachers-in-charge. Two assistant coordinators and a project coordinator supervised the entire program. The participants were selected from twelve special day schools for socially maladjusted or emotionally disturbed children, nine psychiatric hospitals, 16 day and/or residential treatment centers for emotionally handicapped children, and 30 day and/or residential treatment centers for addicted children. These 67 sites, located in all of the five boroughs of New York City and four sites in upstate New York, were clustered into 21 school organizations for the purpose of supervision of the instructional program. An analysis of the data indicated that 70 percent of the participants mastered at least one instructional objective and that  they did benefit substantially from the program. (Author/BS)",

This report describes the program and evaluates its effectiveness for the summer of 1975. A major goal of the program was to bridge the gap from intermediate to high school. Pupils were selected on the basis of their reading and math scores on the Metropolitan Achievement Test, or if they were rated as having moderate to severe difficulties on the Oral Language Ability Scale for Rating Pupils' Ability to Speak English. The latter students were placed in the ESL component. A total of 3,6l0 students participated in the program, and of these, 299 were in the ESL  component. For students in the ESL component, the goals were to improve understanding, speaking, reading, and writing of English. Activities provided included structural dialogues, choral repetition, reading selections and responding to questions which assessed comprehension, the writing of letters and vocabulary lists. Findings indicated a statistically significant different from pre- and post testing as measured by the Stanford Achievement Test-Primary II Word Reading, Reading Comprehension, and Listening Comprehension Subtests. The majority of ESL and non ESL students, were oriented to their new high school in a positive way. Despite deficiencies in library and guidance services, the overall program must be judged a success. (Author/AM)",

The Carnival provided an individualized reading program which related each child's developmental pattern as it was revealed in art workshops to a reading plan especially designed for the student. There were three, 12 week sessions in the Carnival. The students met twice a week at the Carnival Center where a small reading laboratory existed. These  students met with the reading improvement teacher three times a week in their respective schools. At these in-school reading laboratories, the children worked in small groups on reading-communication skills in activities and study sessions that were based on the art experienced at the Children's Art Carnival. The Carnival program supplemented the regular school program by offering indivudalized one-to-one instruction which provided a choice of ways to learn reading. Findings indicated that the Carnival Program was successful. The children evidenced a great deal of personal and attitudinal affective development according to Psychological Center personnel. They progressed in reading and linguistic achievement as measured on the Prescriptive Reading Inventory. (Author/AM)",

The program operated in four BCRMD schools. Each school was provided with a project team made up of a Bilingual Resource Room Teacher and a Bilingual Paraprofessional. The primary goal of the program was to provide equal educational opportunity for non-English speaking children through activities that would maximize their native language proficiency while  developing competence in English. The program also sought to train bilingual teachers and to develop a bilingual-bicultural curriculum. The bilingual resource room teams served two kinds of Spanish-speaking students: those most limited in English speaking ability, and those less limited. The first group received daily bilingual instruction in CORE curriculum, language arts, math, English as a second language and cultural heritage. The second group received supportive bilingual instruction three times per week. Unlike the first group, these students received their developmental reading instruction in English. Findings indicated that success was achieved in Spanish reading, mathematics, CORE curriculum, cultural heritage and self concept. Pupils failed to achieve success in English as a  second language.

This program was designed to improve effective communication skills for hearing handicapped students whose native language was not English, and whose language deficiencies prevented them from effective participation in the learning process. A total of 47 students, all of Hispanic background participated in the program. The program supplemented the regular services provided in resource rooms and in a work-study program for the hard of hearing in several schools. In the resource rooms, handicapped students received supportive services for part of the school day, and the remainder of their time was spent in regular classes. The program consisted of individual and  small group language lessons conducted for at least 40 minutes daily. The evaluation included pre- and post testing with the newly prepared Rating Scale of Pupils' Ability to Speak English and the Rating Scale of Pupils' Ability to Speak Spanish tests. Although the results did not reveal significant changes, the program served a target population in need of its services. As an adjunct to the resource room program, the program appears limited to the extent to which it went beyond the scope of the services already provided. (Author/AM)",

The purpose of the program was to improve the reading level of the students through a corrective reading component designed to supplement the regular reading program of the schools served. Students in the program had to meet the dual eligibility criteria of residence in a target area and a level of educational achievement below minimum grade level competency. Emphasis in the selection process was placed on students between grades one and six, although students above that level who showed significant retardation were given service.  Instructional time varied from one school to another. Classes ranged in length from 45 to 60 minutes. The instructional methods used by each teacher varied, but they were geared to meeting the needs of individual students. The evaluation had two aims: to determine if the implementation of the program had been conducted in accordance with the proposal guidelines and to determine if there was a statistically significant increase in pupil reading achievement for the 1974-1975 period, as measured by standardized tests. In terms of implementation, it was found that the program and the proposal guidelines coincided. In terms of pupil achievement, it was found that achievement in reading was outstanding, on the whole, the only exception being grades 10 and 12. (Author/AM)",

Supplementary workshops in the arts (dance, theater, music, painting, sculpture, mixed media, drawing, printmaking, puppetry, crafts, film making etc.), were closely correlated with the reading program. Weekly field trips supplemented the instructional program.  Parents attended an orientation session and were provided opportunities to participate in workshops taught by an arts and crafts instructor and/or the social worker. Parents also participated on the advisory council of the program. The various components of the program were competently coordinated, supervised and administered.

Priority for participation in the program was given to those pupils who had previously participated in the Title I nonpublic school corrective reading program and who had made little or insufficient progress. Students attended centers in groups of five students per teacher. They received instruction for three to five sessions per week in class periods ranging from 45 to 60 minutes. Two teachers  were located at each of the eight centers so that a total of about four hundred students could be served. Instruction centered around the use of the Random House High Intensity Learning System in Reading. This system is composed of three major components: the classroom management system, a library of reading materials, and a staff development program. The classroom management system contains a compilation of 500 specific reading objectives with a listing of the precise instructional activities that foster the attainment of the specified objectives. The evaluation objective, &quot;showing significant improvement in reading&quot;, was achieved. Program strengths included a favorable teacher student ratio, the quality of the teaching staff and their effort, skillful supervision, the selection of  appropriate facilities and materials, and the eclectic approach of program staff.

The program was designed to provide continuity of instruction in reading and mathematics from spring to fall for girls who were at least two years behind in reading and mathematics achievement. The summer program was initiated at four schools, one each in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. Each of the schools provided instruction for pregnant girls during the normal school year. During the summer, these schools provided corrective instruction for about three hours in the morning. Participation in the program was voluntary. Students attended classes in corrective reading, corrective mathematics, and a class that reinforced instruction  in the previous classes through instruction in the use of business machines such as the typewriter, and keypunch. The program used a diagnostic and prescriptive approach to instruction. The program tests used for diagnosis and mastery testing were used for program evaluation. Analysis of the classroom testing data indicated that about 80% of the students in reading and 85% of the students in math, achieved mastery in at least one instructional objective. Further analysis showed that many students had mastered a significant number of objectives prior to instruction and that some teachers administered few objective tests to their students. One reason for this was due to the relatively low levels of reading and mathematics skills measured by the test materials. (Author/AM)",

Its main objectives were to increase (1) the basic English skills of students in the expressive areas; (2) vocabulary and reading comprehension in English and Spanish; (3) competency in math and science; (4) student awareness of cultural heritage and ethnic background; and (5) student attendance. The target population consisted of 250 Spanish speaking boys and girls. The staff included a project director, three content area specialists, a bilingual counselor, two English as a Second Language  (ESL) teachers, and a number of assistants. A native language arts teacher and an additional education assistant were included for a part of the program. There was a reduction in staff during the project as a result of a cut in the education budget. A battery of tests were administered to students both as pre and post tests. Additional assessment measures employed were uniform final examinations, a project-developed examination to assess knowledge of ethnic culture, and attendance records. Statistically significant results were reported for the majority of objectives. The statistics as well as a detailed interpretation and discussion of the results are included in the report.

This center functioned mainly as a clearinghouse, resource library, and dissemination unit on bilingual/bicultural education. The program's primary objectives were related to goals such as obtaining behavioral gains on the part of the professional personnel, evaluation and field testing of bilingual education materials, dissemination of essential bilingual information to personnel involved in planning, developing, and implementing bilingual programs. The evaluation of the objectives was based on materials and acquisition listings, library inventories and tallies, analyses of services rendered, dissemination data,  and data on the performance of workshop participants. The program had also intended to carry out a limited study of student performance assessment in a small pilot project in reading in Spanish to improve the reading achievement of the non-English speaking child. This objective was not carried out. The accomplishments of the center during its third year of operation were impressive. The need to provide information on bilingual/bicultural education to personnel involved in planning, developing, and implementing bilingual/bicultural programs was fulfilled. Through its coordination functions, the duplication and fragmentation of the efforts of the field personnel was being reduced or avoided. The appendix of this report includes an evaluative annotated bibliography of textbooks for bilingual  programs. (Author/AM)",

The supportive services were guidance, homework help and paraprofessional assistance. The program was aimed at first through twelfth graders, who were six months or more deficient in math. Instruction was in small groups with periods of individual instruction where applicable. The program emphasized a positive approach to remediation, an abundance of materials, a discovery approach to learning real life expereiences and the use of games. Analysis of the data showed that the the average student gained ten months over what his/her predicted scores would be in ten months of  instruction. The guidance and homework helper supportive services had a statistically significant effect on learning as measured by test scores. The paraprofessional services were not shown to be statistically significant as a factor in successful student learning. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This paper examines the role of urban schools in an advanced industrial society such as the United States, and the extent to which structural changes in the economy intervene with schooling to determine the social positon of urban workers. It suggests that in order to realistically assess the basic assumptions and rationale for urban school desegreagtion, in order to evaluate their consequences, and in order to delineate the linkages between educational and economic opportunities, the effects of recent structural changes in the economy and how they affect schooling for black youths in the inner city must be considered. Furthermore, it notes that the development of a dual labor structure has made it increasingly difficult for workers without special skills and/or higher  educational experience to enter the better paid and more desirable jobs in central cities. The point is made that the employment problems facing inner city youths are not simply a consequence of inadequate education. They are also the result of the labor market duality that has developed. A conclusion of this paper is that the strong association between urban public schools and the production of the low wage labor supply will not be significantly affected by programs to achieve desegregation, or by any other programs to improve inner city schools if they are not also designed to offset the problems of educational content and quality which have become attached to the education of the working class in urban schools.

The paper indicates that negative stereotypes that depict blacks as minstrels, cooks, servants, and as slow-witted and inept persons still prevail in the mass media. Although contemporary media is replete with negative stereotypes of blacks, in most instances the negative images are more sophisticated and less observable than those of the period prior to the 1960's. At times, however, the stereotypes are more blatant, as on the cover of a Rolling Stones' record album which depicts a wide-nosed black man with an exaggerated  grin. The black stereotype is perpetuated in the pancake house called \"Sambos\" which originated in the southwest and is currently franchising stores in the midwest. Unconscious of their own prejudice, and unaware of the sensitivities of those persons who have long been ridiculed and degraded, many whites continue to hold biased images of blacks. (Author/AM)",

The major objective of the program was to increase student competency in math computational skills. Approximately 3,000 high school students in grades 9 through 11 from 32 high schools were selected as participants. Class size was reduced to 15 students to allow for individualized instruction. Math labs equipped with calculators, printing calculators and programmable calculators were available for student use. Their use was designed to interest students in math and to make students familiar with these machines since they are often used in business and might increase students' employment opportunities. The program was staffed by a  project coordinator, teacher-trainers, teachers, and teacher-aides. The Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT) Computational Sub-Test was administered as a pretest and as a posttest. A historical regression analysis of the achievement test data revealed statistically significant differences in the scores.

It was funded under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Title I. Twenty-nine teachers provided sessions with each child for two or more sessions per week. The children were two or more years behind in reading and mathematics and were designated as eligible for homebound instruction due to physical handicaps, hospitalization, school phobic responses, and other reasons. The youths who participated in the program were from Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. About one third of the youth were from families in which Spanish was the dominant language spoken in the home. There were three  times as many boys in the program as girls. The age range was from seven to seventeen. The Wide Range Achievement Test was used on a pre-post testing basis. The results were analyzed in terms of a one way analysis of variance to determine if the gain or loss in reading and mathematics varied by the number of tutorial sessions held. The results of the analysis of the data for 202 youths revealed that the gain or loss in reading and mathematics did not vary with the number of tutorial sessions held and was not statistically significant. Recommendations for refunding the program included provisions for longer programs with more lead time and more diagnostic and background information available regarding each child prior to program operation. Implementation of these recommendations would  enable the teachers to develop strategies for prescriptive teaching. (Author/AM)",

It was funded under the Elementary Secondary Education Act, Title I. The classes were selected by principals and teachers from the respective schools on the basis of students' educational deficiencies related to reading. A total of 105 students participated in this two month program. It involved utilization of the resources of the Gateway National Park. The rationale for the program was that content related reading skills could be improved through actual investigative manipulative activities in a natural environment. It was predicted that this kind of activity would be supportive of reading and writing exercises. The  program concentrated on three selected skills for reading in the content area: (1) fact, fiction, and opinion, (2) classification, and (3) construction and interpretation of graphs. Activities designed for students included: mapping the area they were working in, collecting material from the beach, studying wild life, and planting and raising flora indigenous to the shore area. An analysis of the subtest scores for each of the three SRA Reading Diagnostic &quot;Probe&quot; Tests concerned with fact and opinion, classification, and graphs, indicated significant differences between pre and post measures, even within the short time span and three times a week schedule of the program.

        "description":"This paper describes the early history, present status, and future trends of the Bureau of School Lunches of the New York City Board of Education. A review of its early history indicates that although various citizen groups and the Department of Welfare served lunches to needy children prior to 1946, it was the passage of the National School Lunch Act in 1946 that institutionalized the concept of feeding lunches to all children in school. In the 30 years since the Bureau was founded there has been a six fold increase in the average daily number of lunches served. Newly passed New York State legislation will require the New York City School System to offer breakfast in every school beginning in the fall of 1977. By 1980, a 26% increase in food service is anticipated as a result of  the expansion of the breakfast and school lunch service and the addition of summer lunches. In addition, an experimental &quot;fast food&quot; operation is being started in two New York City High Schools. It is scheduled to start in September of 1977. Two major issues face the Bureau of School Lunches. The first deals with expenditures and the second deals with the quality of the school lunches. It is of primary importance that the meals be nutritous and that they be accepted and eaten by the children. In order to provide quality meals and maintain minimal costs, action must be taken in three major areas: management systems, operating systems, and food service systems. (Author/AM)",

An interdisciplinary approach which covers all major approaches to the problem and which presents contrasting viewpoints on school integration and minority student education is used. Effecting change in the classroom and the schools is the central concern of this book. Beyond the usual exclusive concern with subject areas which can be manipulated statistically, this tome includes the perspectives of historians, lawyers, economists, and even non-specialists. Factors treated at some length include the historical and legal background of the education of minority groups, the ideology of racism, a continuing reexamination and questioning of prevailing views of the role of social class and  race in learning, and the impact of minority communities upon the schools. Separate chapters deal with Spanish-surnamed and American Indian students. The impact of schooling is examined in the areas of academic achievement, self-concept and aspirations, and the relationships of students with their peers and with their teachers. The findings presented in a conclusion to this work indicate that desegregation works for both white and black children. It narrows the achievement gap between them. In addition, minority children gain a more realistic conception of their vocational and educational future through integrated settings. Positive racial attitudes by black and white students develop as they attend school together. This book is a companion volume to another book titled, \"A Chance to  Learn\" which includes fuller documentation on the historical and legal materials that are cited in this volume. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"In depth interviews were conducted with a reputational sample of 40 New Jersey white women known as highly involved activists in the civil rights movement for this study. It aimed: (1) to develop theory on the relationship between white women's active participation in a minority movement and their roles as women; (2) to note the relationship between awareness of racial injustice and the discovery of structures through which the individual could act, (3) to note linkages between participation in civil rights and other movements; and (4) to examine the assumption that white activists as a group were estranged by the black power phase or lost their commitment to the cause of racial justice. A small number of the women interviewed came from socialist or labor backgrounds; more came  from families having a religious or humanistic ethic stressing individual worth. Among the findings of the study are the following: (1) little conflict was reported between activism and the mother role; (2) the husband-wife relationship was not affected in a consistent way, (3) many activists had yound children and did not work full-time while active; (4) most became aware of the need for black leadership; and (5) many continued their activism by finding new supportive roles to play.

It is organized around five modules. Each module consists of a grouping of functional activities for which separate allocation formulae are utilized. The modules cover the following areas: (1) community school boards and district administration, (2) instructional services, (3) continuing education and extended use of school buildings, (4) furniture, supplies, equipment, textbooks, and library books, and (5) furniture and equipment. The funds in these modules are distributed to the thirty-two community school districts by formulae, and in fiscal year 1976-1977 the monies allocated to these modules represented nearly  two-thirds of each school district's total budget allocation. Charts, graphs, tables, and step-by step examples are used throughout the paper to explain and simplify this complicated budget distribution description. (Author/AM)",

The data analyzed were the answer sheets of 2269 black students and 2285 white students taking the 85-item Verbal Section of the College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Test. The study of item characteristic curves is a feasible and fruitful way to investigate item biases. It has definite advantages over less sophisticated methods. More than a third of the 85 test items were found to have different characteristic curves for blacks and for whites at the 5% level of statistical significance. It is in many cases not clear from reading it why a particular item is biased in a particular way. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper places race relations theory within the general theory of human behavior which combines behaviorist psychology and Marxist theory. It argues for a revisionist theory of race relations where a situation or condition leads to a behavior pattern (discrimination) which in turn leads to an attitude (racism or prejudice). This conceptualization of institutional racism stresses social structure rather than internal or psychopathological expressions in human beings. The contention that discrimination and prejudice are rational acts and attitudes of psychologically normal persons is combined with Karl Marx's view of race relations as relations of conflict. At the group and at the individual level, behavior is rationally motivated by a strategy of maximizing reward and  minimizing punishment. Understanding the foundation of race relations as the desire to maximize rewards and minimize punishment, the revisionists state that the basic race relations problem, and the basic conflict in the strategy of the majority group which makes their mini/max position dependent upon the continued exploitation of a minority group is the key to the elimination of racism in society.

These two dimensions were arrived at through a factor analysis of racial attitude items. Findings indicate that the dimensions studied constitute separate and distinct responses for all three groups of students and indicated that student reactions to intergroup school experiences are complex. Black students in all black schools scored more on the avoidance end of the approach -avoidance dimension while the black students in the integrated schools scored on the approach end. The black students in the all-black schools  scored on the integration end of the integration-separatism dimension while the black students in the integrated schools scored on the separatism end. White students in essentially all white schools scored on the avoidance and separatist end of the two dimensions. The white students in mixed Latin schools were more acceptant of the minority students than the white students in the mixed black schools. No differences on the two dimensions were found among the Latin students in schools of different ethnic compositons. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights focuses on the desegregation of metropolitan schools. It begins by summarizing the research on the causes of racial isolation in metropolitan areas, and connects this research to issues raised in Milliken V. Bradley. In this case, the Supreme Court noted that legal decisions affecting school systems depended on whether metropolitan school and housing segregation was due to private choice and demographic factors, or whether they were due to racial policies in which the government participated. This report concludes that racial segregation in the inner city is due to policies of racial containment to which government contributes. Next, the Commission examines the remedial issues connected with metropolitan desegregation.  Some have assumed that a metropolitan remedy poses major administrative and fiscal problems, that it breaches traditions of local control, that it involves massive busing, and that it is busing that provokes the resistence to desegregation. Each of these objections is analyzed with some care along with the positive advantages that may be associated with a metropolitan remedy. Finally, the state of the law and the current political context in which judicial decision making is occurring is discussed. This discussion indicates some of the cooperative steps that should be taken for constructive solutions. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This document presents a study of the effects of father absence upon the academic achievement of black children. Children in remedial reading and math programs from 20 Title I schools in a single midwestern metropolitan school district were studied. The father absence rate for black children in this school system averaged 30%. The study indicates that children from father absent homes are over represented in the Title I remedial reading program. Ranging from a low of 48.38% in the 5th grade to a high of 70.14% in the 3rd grade, their overall percentage is 58.17, nearly double the expectancy. An analysis of the Title I remedial math program reveals a similar pattern. With an expectancy of 30%, black children from father absent homes range from a low of 49.29% in the 5th grade, to  a high of 64.51% in the 4th grade, with an average of 56.75%. No attempt was made to ascertain the percentage of white children from father absent homes in Title I remedial programs because no referent on which to base expectancy was available for this population. Nationally, the rate of father absence in white families is slightly over 10%. The over representation of black children from father absent homes in the Title I remedial program would tend to support the notion that father absence does have a definite effect upon some children's academic achievement.

One hour personal interviews were conducted with 213 white and 18l black families to gather information on areas such as leisure patterns and values, family life patterns, neighborhoods, educational values, interracial contact, political and community participation, civil rights involvement, ethnic identification, jobs and occupations, and social mobility. Evidence presented in the survey suggests that middle income blacks are similar to middle income whites in the number of female heads of household and the number of children in the family. In most other areas of concern the white and middle income black groups differed. The  survey found that in integrated neighborhoods there was less contact between whites and blacks of middle income than was commonly assumed occurred, and that in the integrated neighborhood where the survey was conducted, both races were more pessimistic about the end of discrimination than were whites and blacks in segregated neighborhoods. In terms of occupational mobility, blacks did not see their chances of promotion being as lucrative as their white counterparts. An overwhelming percentage of blacks stated that the school system did not do an adequate job of educating the city's youth. The whites were more indifferent to the quality of education in the schools and felt that the schools were doing an adequate job for low income youth. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"A brief paper presented at the American Educational Research Association Annual meeting (April 1977) describes the development, and analysis of the Instructional Management System (IMS) which is used in the Lansing elementary schools. The report is divided into three sections: a historical overview of the program, a description of IMS, and an assessment of the advantages, disadvantages, and outcomes as assessed by the teacher. In an effort to make the lowest achieving students successful, the teaching of 30,000 elementary students of diverse backgrounds and socioeconomic status in 56 schools was achieved by decentralization of decision making on a school-by-school basis, teacher participation, parental involvement, and implementation of IMS. These actions were mandated by  Elementary Secondary Education Act, Title I funds used for the program. The implementation of the IMS includes 140 reading objectives and 150 math objectives which are representative of skills students in all schools should master. Accompanying each objective are pre-tests and post-tests. Additionally, record keeping cards for reading and math are utilized to plot pupil progress through the system. Advisory committees are comprised of teachers, administrators parents, and evaluators who review items, suggest time-saving testing techniques and effective management practices. The positive and negative results of the development and implementation of IMS are reported. The advantages of IMS are: immediate information on skill level, appropriate educational objectives, greater test  reliability, and better communication between teachers and parents. The disadvantages enumerated by the teachers are: feelings of being pressured to achieve a certain number of objectives, and very little input into the development of the IMS components. Additionally, students are occasionally overtested; time required to master particular objectives is not equal; and collecting, recording, and analyzing data is too time consuming. In the IMS program, teacher confidence is increased and teacher morale is strengthened as a result of greater teacher participation. As a result of the success of this IMS program a system similar to it is being developed for the secondary level. (Author/JP)",

        "description":"A project designed to develop valid performance based curriculum materials for selected occupational programs had the following objectives: (1) To identify a common core of basic skills for seven occupational cluster areas; (2) to prepare catalogs of performance objectives and criterion referenced measures for seven occupational cluster areas; (3) to field test the catalogs on incumbent workers in the occupational areas; (4) to conduct inservice education for curriculum developers on the utilization of performance objectives catalogs; (5) to utilize the performance objectives catalogs in designing curricular materials; and (6) to disseminate the catalogs to other States for utilization in curriculum development. The project used an adaptation of the Air Force system for task  analysis and performance objectives development to design the catalogs and then translate them into curricula materials. Catalogs developed addressed the following occupations: Alterationist, auto parts clerk, bookkeeping/accounting/payroll clerk, cosmetology, licensed practical nursing, masonry, and nursery production. One result of the project was a model for an integrated approach to criterion-referenced curriculum development involving a process for literature review, task analysis of incumbent workers, performance objectives development, and curriculum field testing. The following products also resulted from the projects: (1) A state-of-the-art study of the curriculum development related to each occupation selected; (2) a list of occupational tasks required for each occupation  selected; (3) a catalog of performance objectives, criterion-referenced measures and performance guides for each occupation, and (4) a variety of curriculum materials for each occupation studied.

        "description":"Questionnaires were sent to 307 persons, with 135 responses returned (40%), to determine who had used the Michigan Consumer Education Center services and to determine attitudes toward Center services. Five categories of persons were contacted: Those local representatives who had coordinated inservice training sessions provided by the Center; 1973 and 1974 graduate summer workshop participants; a random sample of Annual Michigan Consumer Education Conference attendees; a random sample of persons using the Center's library loan services; and a random sample of those who actually visited the Center or utilized its consultant and advisory services in some way. Findings/conclusions showed that (1) of all respondents in all categories, over 80% of them had taught a consumer education  course or unit within the last three years (reinforcing the current assumption that teachers actively involved in classroom settings provide the core of the Center's clientele, and that programs must continue to be planned primarily to meet the practical needs of teachers), (2) from the survey response, support for the Center by the users of its services is very strong, (3) programs and materials of the Center have received wide acceptance by those who have worked with them, and (4) the main burden for the improvement of consumer education throughout the State really depends on those who directly implement programs at the local level. This evaluation report includes a definition and scope of consumer education; the history, goals, and services of the Michigan Consumer Education Center;  its objectives and accomplishments for the 1975-76 period; and its future directions.

Three separate research efforts were conducted: (1) A demographic profile and analysis of the 11-county region including description of the population of each county with regard to age, sex, income, level of education, occupation, and labor force status; (2) a survey of adults in the region about their continuing education needs and interests (half-hour interviews by trained volunteers with 1,502 randomly  selected adults from 64 communities--farm workers, service workers, blue collar workers, white collar workers, unemployed, and homemakers); and (3) a survey of providers of educational services in the region (questionnaire surveys of four categories of providers: degree granting 2- and 4-year colleges and universities; public schools, vocational, private, and proprietary institutions; social, cultural, government, religious, and professional organizations and agencies; and employers. It was found that a large majority of adults in the region wish to continue their education beyond the years of formal schooling, and many institutions, organizations, and agencies are attempting to provide appropriate continuing education services for them. In general, findings showed that the activities  offered by the providers of learning opportunities are in the same learning areas cited as preferences by adults. To provide data to improve services and increase adult participation, specific findings from the study are presented in the report under the following categories: Adult interests and participation, learning opportunities and adult needs, recommendations for a more responsive system of continuing education, and toward a regional continuing education information management system.

        "description":"The effects of the 1974-75 economic recession on the effort to ensure equal employment opportunity for the Nation's minority groups and women are examined in the first section of this report, which documents the layoff of disproportionately large numbers of minority and female workers during the recession, generally resulting from the fact that many were only recently hired and thus had earned little seniority. It is concluded that the recession seriously eroded affirmative action gains of recent years, frustrating the intent of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11246, as amended, and other programs enacted to help minority and female workers narrow the historic economic gap between them and white male workers. The likelihood of continuing high  unemployment and future economic slowdowns, which threaten not only vulnerable minority and women workers with low seniority, but many white males, particularly youths, as well, is analyzed. The social costs of such unemployment, particularly that involving job losers and discouraged workers are described. Two sections of the report discuss layoffs and seniority and review the legality of layoffs by seniority when disproportionate numbers of minorities or women are affected. Alternatives to layoffs are explored in the fourth section, some of them already widely practiced in Western Europe and by some industries in the U.S. (e.g., reduction of hours, early retirement, rotation of layoffs, cuts in cost other than wages). In the concluding section suggestions are made for explicit Federal  guidelines by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with regard to the \"last hired, first fired\" conflict based on the principle that all seniority-based layoff policies should be invalid as they apply to any work force that does not mirror the relevant labor market and the composition of which cannot be explained successfully by the employer.

        "description":"The Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ), a structured job analysis questionnaire that provides for the analysis for individual jobs in terms of 187 job elements, has been found in previous studies to be useful as the basis for predicting the mean test scores of incumbents on a sample of jobs in terms of the nine tests of the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) of the United States Training and Employment Service. The present study was directed toward use of the PAQ as the basis for predicting test-related data for various commercially available tests considered to measure the same constructs as those measured by the GATB tests. Data were obtained for a sample of 96 jobs, the data consisting of a PAQ analysis for each job and data for the incumbents on various commercially  available tests. The data for the various jobs for which any given test had been used were grouped into categories for the constructs represented by the individual GATB tests. The available norms of the tests representing any given construct were converted to a set of standard scores with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 20. The PAQ job dimension scores were then used as predictors of whatever test-related criteria were available for any given construct. The PAQ-based predictions for the criteria of mean test scores and cutoff scores were all highly significant. However, the predictors for actual validity coefficients were understandably low. The prediction of whether or not specific tests would be &quot;valid&quot; were also significant. Although the predictions supported the utility of  the PAQ-based job-component validity model, a number of problems probably resulted in overly conservative predictions. A later analysis will be carried out after the sample size is increased. (Author/JT)",

        "description":"This is the first part of a two-part fifth volume in a series of annual reports on the status of vocational education in the United States. It primarily reports the developments that have taken place each year in the numbers and characteristics of students enrolled, programs, costs, and results. (The entire study, initiated by Congress in 1971, is known as Project Baseline.) Chapter I is a brief overall summary of the past five years, and chapter II is a summary of the statistical tables in Part 2 (a separate document) of this report as well as previous years. Information covers enrollment (expansion in 1974-75, growth among the States, occupational areas, co-op, youth organizations, percent of secondary students, analysis of data on women, disadvantaged and handicapped, and  ethnic minorities), expenditures, completions and placements, instructional personnel, and manpower training under CETA. Chapter III discusses title II of the Education Amendments of 1976 (Vocational Education Act) and examines some serious data problems. Chapter IV discusses information on vocational education that has not been covered by previous and present statistical summaries i.e., impact of Federal legislation, strengths and weaknesses of vocational education today, student benefits, duplication between manpower training and vocational education. The financing of continued expansion of vocational education in the face of dwindling tax resources is discussed in Chapter V. Chapter VI is largely a discussion of Project Baseline's role in the five years of its existence and what its  role may be in the future. Appendixes include the text title II of the Education Amendments of 1976 and other data related to the Baseline project. (SH)",

Although the conceptual issues raised are quite general and could be applied to a wide variety of government financed investments, emphasis is on application to manpower training programs. Following the introductory section, major topics discussed are Some Elementary Concepts in Public Project Analysis (a review), The Case of Manpower Training, and An Assessment of Tax Based Ratios. It is concluded that the use of any tax based cost/benefit ratio is conceptually invalid in that these ratios do not serve as adequate proxies for the net increase in socially useful output received  through manpower training programs and they discriminate quite arbitrarily among people based on personal characteristics and other factors that have little relation to the question of economic efficiency.

Implementation of this strategy involved two interrelated activities--an interregional demonstration and the establishment of a national dissemination network. Five intervention strategies (which are described separately in this report) were used in conducting the demonstration activities in the States of New York and New Jersey (Region II) and Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska (Region VII). These activities involved the selection of Program Innovation Centers (PIC's) and  other dissemination methods for identifying improved program practices and products produced locally and for providing intensive technical assistance to interested programs in adapting and using practices and products. The project's second set of activities, involving the national dissemination network, identified, reviewed, and disseminated improved practices, products, and systems and was responsible for three publications: &quot;IDEA Review,&quot; a quarterly inventory of innovation; &quot;IDEA Bulletins,&quot; brief brochure descriptions of selected and recommended innovations; and &quot;IDEA Report,&quot; a prototype of a more detailed analysis of a particular innovation or a replication manual. This report of project efforts includes a discussion of eight conclusions/findings (presented as &quot;lessons learned&quot;)  relating to the dissemination of practices and products for improved adult education programs, and recommendations for a national clearinghouse on adult education and for the role of State departments of education in dissemination activities.

        "description":"The purpose of the research project was to develop an applied or technical mathematics curriculum which would meet the needs of vocational-technical students at the community college level. The research project was divided into three distinct phases: Identifying the mathematical concepts requisite for job-entry competencies in each of the occupational areas, arranging these mathematical competencies into a structure of sequential units, and developing curriculum materials for each of these units. Staff members from 10 community colleges in Texas participated in the survey to help determine and validate job competencies for the occupational areas of diesel mechanics, auto mechanics, radio/TV repair, air conditioning, welding, machine shop, printing, drafting, and electronics. The  specific project results included (1) a list of mathematical concepts requisite for entry-level competencies in each of the selected occupational areas, (2) a set of structured, sequential technical mathematics units designed to meet the needs of vocational-technical students in the selected occupational areas, (3) curriculum guides for each of the technical mathematics units, (4) self-instructional learning packets for each of the technical mathematics units, and (5) performance-based pre- and posttests for each of the technical mathematics units. This final report consists of four major components: Narrative report; the taxonomy (composite and individual) of competencies (appendix C); five exemplary minimodules (appendix D); and curriculum guides for each of the major divisions of  competencies identified in the taxonomy (appendix E). Appendixes C and D constitute most of the document. (HD)",

        "description":"In addition to the goal of totally acquainting faculty members with the concept of performance-based education, the 1-year project at Northern Montana College had four major objectives: (1) Identify colleges, universities, technical institutes, and area vocational schools throughout the Nation which are currently conducting performance-based programs in vocational-technical teacher education and 2-year vocational-technical programs, (2) identify performance goals and delivery systems for each department within the vocational-technical division, (3) translate existing courses into performance-based criteria and implement them into the teaching schedule for field testing, (4) and begin implementation of a feedback system which is essential to the process of evaluating and refining  the performance goals and delivery systems adopted. Faculty were scheduled for meetings with the project staff to establish specific timelines for the development of existing courses and/or programs. Courses were identified for translation to a performance/competency approach via identification of performance goals, and in a number of cases modules were developed with explicit delineation of behavioral objectives and alternative learning activities. To obtain feedback concerning areas to be developed the staff conducted a survey of 507 graduates representing all program areas offered in the division. Responses enabled the staff to focus on specific courses to be adapted to the new mode; responses also guided development of delivery systems. For courses implementing performance based  education during the project year, the staff designed and administered opinionnaires to obtain evaluative data regarding the courses. Conclusions and recommendations are included in the report. Copies of the graduate questionnaire and student opinionnaire are appended along with opinionnaire results for three courses: Auto Engines, Shop Maintenance, and the Nursing Program. (JT)",

        "description":"A 1-year study was conducted to implement a computerized data system for the comprehensive evaluation of Individualized Manpower Training System (IMTS) Learning Resource Centers (LRCs). Data for the system were collected by the administration of student, staff, and center summary forms especially designed for the purpose by the University of West Florida. Original plans were to collect data at eight IMTS and three control sites. Data from five IMTS and two control sites entered the system. All completed forms were sent to the Florida Vocational Technical Adult Education (VTAE) Computer Service Center at St. Petersburg where the data was keypunched and machine-stored. A copy of the punch card deck was sent to Baltimore, Maryland, where the analysis programs for the system were  designed, written, and executed. In general it was found that the installation of the IMTS procedures at the five LRCs were sufficiently uniform to permit meaningful comparison among the sites. If it is taken into account that this first run of the data system must be viewed as much an evaluation of the system itself as it was aimed at evaluating the IMTS programs, then the overall outcome of the experience can be rated as highly positive. (The report contains chapters on description of the IMTS system, aspects of evaluation system design and implementation, data collection procedures, results of implementation, and summary, conclusions, and recommendations. Approximately half of the contents are appendixes of related materials, e.g., list of IMTS training packages, data collection forms,  software for the analysis of the computerized data system, and raw data of IMTS site summary file.)

Chapter 1, an introduction, discusses briefly the uses of job analyses in trade and technical course construction and instructional materials development, in career counseling and placement, as well as in competency and performance evaluation. Job analysis principles are presented in chapter 2: Complete and accurate identification of the job, complete and accurate description of the tasks of the job, and indication of the requirements the job makes upon the worker for successful performance. The other four chapters contain explanation and instructions for developing the various sections of a job analysis  schedule. Chapter 3 deals with the first four items on a schedule (Job Title, Data and Number of Sheets, Alternate Titles, and Dictionary Title and Code). Chapter 4 deals with the \"Work Performed\" item of a schedule, which should present a statement regarding the tasks performed by a worker in accomplishing the purpose of his/her job. The guidelines for writing this section include focus on introductory sentences, task arrangement, treatment of unusual equipment and terms, and citation of degree of skill and percent of time. Chapter 5 covers the items on a schedule dealing with performance requirements: Responsibility, Job Knowledge, Mental Application, and Dexterity and Accuracy. Chapter 6 deals with the comments section of a schedule: Equipment, Materials and Supplies, Definitions of  Terms, and General Comments. Three model job analysis schedules are appended: Part Programer (Numerical Control), Lubrication Man (Vehicle), and Check-Out Clerk (Grocery Store). (JT)",

Domain study, state-of-the-art, task booklet, field review catalog, and final catalog of objectives and criterion referenced measures were developed in six of the  curriculum areas. Four handbooks were developed: Development of Kentucky's Model for Individualized Modules, Development of Vocational Education Modules, Development of the Instructor's Manual, and Management Handbook. A slide-tape presentation was developed for curriculum writers and teachers to use as a basis for developing slides and tapes to supplement the modules. An 8-week workshop was conducted to develop individualized modules in the 10 areas. During the project approximately 500 modules were completed. Consultative services, workshops, and inservice training were provided to local school districts, area vocational schools, and institutions of higher learning. Modules developed were field tested in 20 schools in Kentucky.

The first phase of EDNEED II focused on the gathering and cataloging of all State vocational education agency data collection forms. Each item of information on a data collection form was classified in relation to the most appropriate Project EDNEED question(s). In the second phase, field visits were made to 10 States to gather more information on  alternative approaches to answering the top priority EDNEED I questions. The field visits provided information on the problems that would be encountered in collecting the necessary data and aggregating them to the appropriate levels. In this first of a four-volume final report of Project EDNEED II, the informational needs identified in EDNEED I are discussed in relation to the data currently available at the State level as indicated by State agency data collection forms. The procedures used to derive and organize the vocational education data base are described, and an exemplary core of questions and data elements is presented which represents information that is both highly needed and widely collected.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the teacher competencies needed in order to develop valid and effective occupational learning experiences for educable mentally retarded (EMR) students based on available diagnostic test data and information. Four-member teams were selected from each participating school (four secondary and two postsecondary schools). Each team had a special educator, a vocational instructor, an audiovisual specialist, and a counselor, special educator, or vocational educator depending on the most effective team organization within the participating school. An action research design was used. As vocational teachers on the teams identified problems in modifying instructional materials, teaching strategies, and classroom procedures, team and staff members designed  solutions. These solutions were then implemented by the vocational teacher and evaluated. Transportability of the developmental experiences and the resulting products were assessed with teams in one or two of the other participating schools. Three workshops were conducted focusing on (1) identifying participants' competencies in relation to those needed to develop effective instruction; (2) techniques for effective communication, task analysis, rewriting reading materials, and developing mediated instruction; and (3) teaching techniques, classroom management strategies, and practical evaluation. Some of the competencies which vocational teachers need to acquire are use of evaluation information in designing and managing instruction, behavior observation skills, performance evaluation  techniques, individualizing instruction for EMR students, identification and restructuring of jobs, task analysis procedures, and skill in designing concrete learning experiences. Based on the evaluation of the workshops and critical competencies identified by the participants, a 2-week workshop agenda was developed which should provide the basic competencies needed. Two computer programs were also developed to retrieve jobs from a data bank which match specified DOT job titles (Dictionary of Occupational Titles) and present information on EMR characteristics. The suggested 2-week workshop agenda and the competency lists are included in the report. (Appendixes, bound separately, contain participant and staff vitas, materials from the three workshops, and other project materials.)  (JT)",

The author first notes 15 social trends, identified through the efforts of Research for Better Schools, Inc. (RBS), that will influence the education of the young in the decade ahead. (Some of RBS's activities have been a design for four alternative educational possibilities based on RBS research; the conducting of two national symposia to explore with educators, economists, and others, how today's social trends and technological trends are likely to influence tomorrow's schools; and the establishing of a consortium of  schools, school districts, and other agencies with the express purpose of helping compare future-oriented goals and activities.) In view of expected social trends and changes, the author notes specific implications for career and vocational education. In the discussion of the creation of a comprehensive plan to utilize RBS research results in schools, nine goals for schools are identified, and based on the cited goals, RBS's four alternative designs for schools are described. The second part of this document consists of the author's response to questions relating to future educational leadership, the cost of education, and school-community involvement. (SH)",

Data analyses suggested that students with no vocational education courses performed better in areas of higher mathematical concepts but that students with the most vocational education scored higher in practical applications of mathematical skills. The expectation that students in career and vocational education mathematics activities would acquire mathematical skills relevant to the world of work appeared confirmed. The major recommendation was that vocational  educators should formulate mathematics objectives for their students so that a specific prediction of achievement differences might be tested.

The survey, based on a stratified random sampling technique, produced 660 questionnaire responses from completers of seven different vocational programs in 45 separate school sites. The employer survey, limited to employers of those completers that were working in the field for which trained, produced 125 questionnaire responses. The dominant conclusion was that most of the students and their employers are very satisfied with part-time adult preparatory training in Oklahoma.

(The project's five major objectives were (1) to increase self-awareness of pupils by providing insight into their skills, potentials, and abilities which relate to the world of work, (2) to promote career awareness, including the professions, among project participants, (3) to provide opportunities for career exploration, (4) to provide skill development in the business, metal, and graphic communications clusters, and (5) to provide job placement services and counseling for students upon leaving school.) Project design and components discussed include general project design, staff development, curriculum infusion, elementary  career exploration in an area vocational-technical school, ninth grade career exploration program, vocational evaluation center, cluster program, computer based career information program, slide tape program, microfilm career information program, job placement, activities 1973-76, and organization and participants. Project accomplishments are also briefly discussed. Third party and test/data evaluations are included, and conclusions and recommendations are made for the three years of the project. The appendix contains the model, rationale and objectives for career education (K-12), and a discussion of the James Russel Lowell School's multi-image experience room and its application to curriculum.

This analysis yields results which both complement and update the earlier Low and Spindler report titled &quot;Child Care Arrangements of Working Mothers in the United States (ED 040 738). Data is presented according to the study sample, which was divided into two racial groups--blacks and whites--which were further subdivided into three categories by the age of the woman's youngest child. (These categories are women whose youngest child was under three years of age, three to five years of age, and six to thirteen years of age, referred to in  the study as infants, preschoolers, and young school-aged children, respectively.) This report is divided into four major sections. The first section explores the kinds of child care arrangements used by employed mothers. The second section examines child care expenditures. The third section analyzes the characteristics of women who prefer some form of child care other than their current arrangement. The fourth section summarizes and emphasizes the policy implications of the findings. Nineteen tables of comparative data are included. (WL)",

        "description":"To determine the decisionmaking and communication patterns of disadvantaged farm families (DFF) and the linkage between interpersonal sources of information used by them and research-based information sources, a pilot study was conducted with the following focus questions: (1) Who are North Carolina's DFF and what are their characteristics? (2) What kinds of farm and home decisions are DFF making and how rational are the processes utilized by them in making these decisions? (3) What communication media are available to DFF, the major sources utilized by them in making farm and home decisions, and what credibility they assign to these sources? (4) What is the degree of linkage between interpersonal information sources used by DFF in making farm and home decisions and  research-based information sources? and (5) What is the relationship between selected sociopsychological variables and the degree of rationality in decisionmaking; the availability, usage, and credibility of media (i.e., interpersonal, mass, publications); and the degree of linkage between interpersonal information sources used and research-based information sources. The population was drawn from DFF residing in three northeastern North Carolina counties and was screened to obtain a sample that met the criteria for income, size of farm, and family. A research instrument was constructed, and data gathered by interview teams were analyzed through the use of several statistical procedures. The report includes (1) summary, implications, and recommendations; (2) technical report (background,  methodology, and results); (3) list of references and glossary; and (4) appendixes, which contain research questionnaires, categories and definitions of DFF decisions, and additional data.

The four projects examined illustrate the following initial categorical bases: Community mental health services, primarily limited to counseling juveniles (East Central Kansas Mental Health Center); juvenile and family counseling in a community setting (Brooklyn Family Reception Center); traditional elementary and secondary education (Bethlehem Area Community Education Project); and employment evaluation and testing for the handicapped (Atlanta Rehabilitation Center). This report is divided into two major parts. Part I, Four Local Approaches, first presents  the initial focus of each project. The reasons for initiation, how they were organized and funded, services provided, and the approach to program expansion are then discussed. Part I also describes the nature and evolution of the funding of each project in relation to the pace of growth. The experiences of the project developers in obtaining, maintaining, and expanding their financial bases are also described to provide insight into the role finances play in service integration. Part II, Four Case Studies, describes each project in depth. (The four projects were not selected based upon any set of criteria to ensure that they were typical or representative of service integration projects. Rather, they are four diverse examples of expansion from a single categorical program base.)  Organizational flowcharts are included for each project. (SH)",

        "description":"Approximately three years after a sample of vocational education teachers in Florida took the General Examinations, College-Level Examination Program (CLEP), the impact of the use of CLEP scores by teachers (392) in their professional development was assessed. Indicators of professional growth were teaching rank, salary, and degree status. Teachers who used CLEP for credit and/or admission to degree programs in vocational education advanced in rank and degrees held with greater frequency than teachers making no use of their scores. No difference in salary increases between the two groups was found. Subjects overwhelmingly endorsed the use of credit for prior off-campus learning in furthering their professional development. Conditions favorable to the study prevailed in Florida  when the study was made: (1) The CLEP tests were given at no cost to the teachers, (2) State universities in Florida modified their admissions standards to allow subjects to enter degree programs of study with CLEP scores, and (3) a uniform cutoff score was used by the universities for granting credit for CLEP. Unless a generally similar set of circumstances prevailed elsewhere, the degree of association between the use of CLEP scores and indicators of professional growth reported in this study might not occur.

Background on the need for national research and development in career education, goals and conceptual framework for the NIE career education program (in progress since 1973), and sub-problems identified for addressing the goals are discussed in detail. Nine strategy packages are then presented for program. Each describes the problem, recent history, projected 1977 activities, relationship to  earlier work, and references. Headings for the strategy packages are (1) career decisionmaking and measurement of career information, (2) career awareness and career choices, (3) restricted occupational socialization in young children, (4) counseling and information services, (5) expanding career exploration opportunities for junior high, senior high, and postsecondary students, (6) work skills required when mobility rather than occupational stability is typical, (7) coordinated planning for career preparations, (8) certification of occupational competencies after Griggs, and (9) adult continuing education.

Synthesized competency lists are included for vocational educators at the teacher, middle manager, and administrator levels. Competency statements are also included for personnel to administer career education programs at the elementary, junior, and senior high levels, including counselors, coordinators, and administrators. Findings and recommendations for the project are presented. The appendixes (more than half of the total  contents) include all original sources of competency studies used in this project. (The intention is that the document may be used as a comprehensive compilation of research in this field.) Competency lists contained in the appendixes are as follows: Model Curricula for Vocational and Technical Teacher Education: Performance Elements and Examples of Module Titles and Performance Objectives; For Initial Teacher Preparation in Both Broad-Based Vocational Education and Specific Service Areas; For Middle Management Positions; For Administrative Positions; For New And Related Areas--Career Education, Community College Instructions, Part Time Vocational Education Call Staff, and Vocational Counselors.

(The project presents a model program of higher education for incarcerated offenders, consisting of the in-prison phase, transitional phase, and release phase.) Specific project characteristics are discussed and include a 4-year academic program for prison inmates; an in-prison component which offers a full-time, fully accredited academic program; therapy; career, academic, and personal counseling services; a transitional phase (school release, school furlough, early parole) which enables the inside-program participant to transfer his program to the college campus intact with therapy and counseling services as well as full financial support; a release phase (parole or discharge) offering continued services  and full or partial financial support as needed; and NewGate staff (director and counselors), who maintain a neutral administration concept separate from prison and university financial control. Evidence from the literature is offered as support for this type of correctional treatment approach. Other areas discussed are the growth of prison higher education programs and the objectives of the NewGate Resource Center. A final section (21 pages) discusses problems confronting the development of new programs based on the NewGate demonstration model and is titled &quot;The NewGate Resource Center: Issues Faced by the NewGate Expert as Change Agent in the Replication of the NewGate Demonstration Programs.&quot; (TA)",

Findings from the studies were written in eight monthly reports (which are appended), from October 1975 through May 1976, and sent to all area vocational-technical schools as well as selected university and State education personnel. The ministudy dealt with such topics as student experiences with high school, job, and college; success after high school as measured by job status,  salary, and college achievement; sex and curriculum differences related to success and satisfaction; and several other issues. Although school personnel offered lip service concerning the usefulness of this type of research, no invitations were received to visit schools and help school personnel to use the results of the research, so the extent to which the impact part of the objective was met is questionable.

From these descriptions, conceptual correspondence is derived between formal operations theory and teaching behavior.

The review of existing evidence on the changing labor market position of college graduates focuses on the work of Margaret Gordon and Richard Freeman with some attention to several other authors whose work is closely related to theirs. A reanalysis of questions on the relative earnings of recent college graduates uses data from two sources: The Current Population Report's series \"Consumer Income\" and data on the experiences of new labor market entrants since 1967 taken from the National Longitudinal Surveys sponsored by the Department of Labor. On the issue of whether there have been changes in relative  earnings among recent male college graduates, the author concludes that the existing work is incomplete and involves inappropriate comparisons, casting doubt on the usefulness of findings and implications. He draws the following conclusions from reanalysis of published data: (1) There are declines in relative earnings among new labor market entrants as a group and (2) declines in relative earnings among older and more experienced college graduates. He contends that results do not support the hypothesis that a recent oversupply of college graduates has led to declines in relative earnings among new college graduates. (Author/JT)",

One of the main  goals of the institute is listed as the strengthening of communication between educators and the business-industry community, which was achieved by the participants' exploring local employment opportunities, through tours, seminar sessions, and informal conversations with area businessmen. The educators' formulated plans for implementing career guidance in groups and on an individual basis in their own schools are also presented.

Most placement officials reported slight increases in the number of recruiters visiting college campuses. Chemical engineers continued to be actively sought but civil engineers' prospects were hurt by weakness in the construction industry. Accounting majors were receiving attractive offers but supply may be outrunning the demand for them. The health field had many openings although registered nurses, for example, might not have been selected for their first choice of a position. In the middle as far as job opportunities were concerned were the graduates in the  business area. Graduates with majors in scientific fields and those with computer science courses should have been able to find suitable positions. Those with majors in education, humanities, and social sciences, on the other hand, found it more difficult to find jobs for which they had been trained. This report also discusses government spending in relation to college graduates, recruiting to meet affirmative action goals, relocation, and the value of a college education. (TA)",

        "description":"Based on interviews with placement officers at more than 24 colleges in New England and information sought from corporate placement officials and college seniors, the job outlook for many 1975 New England college graduates seemed favorable according to early spring indications. Campus recruiting, as measured by the number of firms scheduling campus visits, was fairly active in late 1974 but worsened as the economic downturn continued in 1975. In areas of occupation, demand for most engineers was relatively favorable, there was a strong demand for accounting majors, and some encouragement for general business graduates, but liberal arts and science graduates faced a less favorable outlook.

        "description":"This paper extends previous numerical results of the Flexible Equal Employment Opportunity (FEEO) model, a goal programing model (developed by A. Charnes, W. W. Cooper, K. A. Lewis, and R. J. Niehaus) consisting of Markoff transition elements imbedded in a goal programing framework with priorities that allow for element alteration to provide the organizational flexibility (in policies of promotion, recruitment, and training) necessary to achieve long-range equal employment opportunity (EEO) goals while still preserving the high priority of meeting the shorter range day-to-day operating goals of the organization. In the first section of the paper EEO goal-setting procedures are documented. Focus is on demographic considerations (making goals realistic from the labor market point  of view) and upward mobility (consideration of affirmative action policies for the internal staff). A second section provides a numerical example with actual Navy data of the extended version of the model through which internal promotion and upward mobility considerations can be evaluated explicitly. A discussion is then provided of the implementation and continuing research possibilities. (JT)",

The research strategy was built on the ranking of mines according to the effectiveness of their training with an effective training effort being defined as that training which is associated with concurrent or subsequent low or reduced injury or severity rates. Aggregate training and injuries data were used to evaluate the overall training effort at 300 mines as well as specific efforts in twelve categories of training course objectives. (Data was gathered from articles in training and mining publications, telephone and mail contacts, and onsite visits to over 40 mining companies.) From such evaluations,  recommendations were derived with particular emphasis being placed on identifying program characteristics that tend to be associated with effective training. Recommendations were also formulated with reference to role changes in industry and government interaction with respect to training programs, new or additional training programs, changes in the types of course materials and training methodologies, and recommendations concerning new areas of investigation. This document, the first of a two-volume report, is a summary consisting of narrative descriptions of several training programs found in the survey of the mining industry, the major results of an analysis of relationships between various measures of training and injuries, and the main conclusions and recommendations.

        "description":"A study examined the effects of feedback on the job attitudes and behavior of female sewing machine operators. The control group design involved all 165 piecework operators at the experimental site (a garment factory in a large southwestern city) and a random sample of 54 operators selected from a sister plant of the same manufacturer 10 miles away. Pre- and posttests were administered one year apart. Treatment involved implementing several program elements: Variety in job assignments, task identity (grouping into subassembly teams), task significance (repairs became responsibility of team members), autonomy (supervisors would monitor work only between teams), and feedback (daily to each team on its quality levels as a group and by operation). While significant improvements  occurred in the cohesion and goal commitment of operators in subassembly work teams, these improvements were especially likely to occur among long-term operators. Marked improvements in product quality were associated with feedback from management. Turnover and absenteeism also decreased, but overall satisfaction did not increase and intrinsic job satisfaction actually decreased. Operator work expectations increased as a result of their involvement in this field experiment. (Findings are discussed with reference to theoretical and practical issues in work systems redesign.)

Data are reported in three areas: (1) Making Career Decisions (knowledge about one's own interest and abilities, work-related experience, job-related values, and results for population groups), (2) Knowledge about Jobs  (specific and general job knowledge, national percentage for success, and results for population groups), and (3) Basic Skills (computation and measurement, graphic and reference materials, written communication, manual and perceptual, national percentages of success, and results for population groups). Results are reported for different population groups based on the following variables: Males and females, blacks and whites, region, parental education, size and type of community, personal education, and family income. Data are reported in graph form. (TA) Primary type of information provided by report: Results (Overview).",

To reach these objectives, three major project activities were performed. First, a questionnaire was administered nationally to facility executive directors or administrators, auxiliary presidents, volunteer coordinators, and individual volunteers to gather information about volunteer participation and activities. This resulted in the second activity--the development  and testing of handbooks relating to volunteers, for use by volunteers and nonhospital and hospital rehabilitation facilities. The final project activity involved a series of eight seminars which focused on using the project-developed handbooks and other training tools, broadening acceptance of different forms of volunteering, providing new knowledge, and developing important skills relating to volunteer activity. This final report of the VIR project details all project activities, background information, and results. The appendixes include the project questionnaire, a listing of the handbooks developed, and other information related to the project. (SH)",

Chapter 1 introduces the guide and suggests its uses for administrators, teachers, and counselors. Chapter 2 describes a method for conducting a preliminary survey of community resources (organizations and people available to help the schools by providing sites for various experiences). Chapter 3 describes curriculum models. Some are short-term activities which mainly help students explore arts and humanities careers, e.g., interviewing workers, shadowing workers, going on field trips, and private study. Models for long-term  experiences include independent study or volunteer project, teacher aids and student tutors, internship, and apprenticeship. The following components are presented for each curriculum model: General information (design, grade level, credit/salary, time commitment), description, objectives and student activities, and supplementary resources. Chapter 4 offers planning and coordinating suggestions in such areas as funding, legal considerations, union relationship, recruiting and preparing students, and monitoring and evaluating programs for out-of-school experiences. Concluding the chapter are brief descriptions of several programs which link arts and humanities workers with the school system. Appendixes list possible community sites for out-of-school programs, selected unions involved in  arts and humanities occupations, and State arts councils which award financial grants to school systems and can also help educators with limited local sites for out-of-school programs get in touch with appropriate workers in other communities who could assist in a program.

Some of the activities require one student to complete, others may need two or more students working in a team. Some activities also require followup checking within a few days to months. Thus long-range planning and activity schedules are experienced by the students, and are typical of out-of-school work experiences. The activity guides cover the areas of grounds maintenance (41 activities), greenhouse (21 activities), landscaping (16 activities), and horticulture mechanics (10 activities), and are numbered consecutively for convenience in making assignments to the students. Each guide includes the title of the  activity (e.g., pruning established evergreens, sodding a lawn area, and composting), tools and equipment needed, materials and supplies needed, procedures, special information, and a referral number for cross-reference between or among other guides related to the activity to which the student is assigned.

Focus in the selection of material is on revealing the individual's struggles against pervasive patterns of discrimination in schools, work situations, military service, housing, and the like. Two introductory sections place these accounts in the context of economic and social developments taking place in the country at large and in  the central cities of the northeast, using material drawn from all the interviews. A conclusion compares and contrasts the experiences of older blacks and young Puerto Ricans and discusses the qualitative characteristics of the operation of labor markets and employment systems which emerge from the material collected.

A problem with this type of contract is that the S may have to permanently forfeit an item for a failure to lose weight when in fact his/her eating behavior has been appropriate. The following procedure was developed to overcome this problem. A projected weight loss line (PWL) and a deviation line (DL) were drawn on a graph. At any deadline when the S's weight was above the PWL, the subject was temporarily denied access to an item until the next weigh-in when the S's weight fell on or below the PWL. On any deadline when the S's weight fell above the DL, the S permanently forfeited one reinforcer for every pound above the DL. Two female Ss participated in the program. A reversal  design demonstrated the effectiveness of these procedures. (Author/CKJ)",

The theory of groups across time is in a different psychological domain than that of short-term groups. For example, in long-term groups changes in group membership are inevitable whereas in short-term groups these changes are rarely experienced. As a result the time perspective of the group members becomes salient, calls for maintaining a state of equilibrium, and necessitates dealing with strategies of changing membership. Three of the central concepts in long-term groups include continuity (A sense of the relation among the past, present, and future of the group), images of the future, and attachment. The implications of this orientation for theory and research are  elaborated.( Author)",

To evaluate the function of training material built into an infant day care system, an experimental design was developed to efficiently analyze the transmission of skills from one worker to the next across several \"generations\" of workers. When staff members were simply instructed to train their replacement \"until they knew their job,\" each successive generation of worker was markedly less accurate than the last; however, when explicit training materials were available to the  staff members, high accuracy was consistently maintained across successive generations of workers. This \"generation design\" requires only as few as eight subjects for an experimental demonstration of the adequacy of the training materials for transmitting skills across successive generations of staff.

        "description":"The concept of creativity is present in the thinking of all cultures. The idea of bringing new order out of non-order and new form out of the formless is basic to the concept of creativity. Despite the efforts of numerous researchers, defining giftedness or creativity appears to be a timeless problem. Presently there is still no universally accepted definition of giftedness and a real need to adequately define and identify the gifted or creative child is apparent. In 1969, Congress passed a bill to provide better identification methods and educational programs for the gifted child. The identification of the gifted child is all important because it is from such talent that we draw statesmen, writers, technicians, scientists, and future leaders. The present paper reviews some of  the attempts at defining giftedness and creativity. The need for considering creativity as a process is discussed and the implication for assessing creativity or giftedness explored. A conceptual model for the identification of the gifted or creative child, that includes the multi-dimensional evaluation of intelligence, creativity test scores and creative production is discussed.

Evidence from direct clinical experience indicates a strong dependency upon adequate diagnostic evaluations, and continued training in this area is strongly encouraged by practitioners within institutional and community agencies.

The humorist has an adamant sense of his own significance without having to prove himself better than others or to prove his worth through some role performance. Connections with humankind--past, present, and future--are keenly felt by the humorist. Paradoxes of life must be appreciated for one to be a humorist. The humorist does not repress one pole of a paradox but keeps both extremes open to awareness. His sudden switches between perceptual poles gives the humorist his distinctive smile of \"resolution.\" Several of these paradoxes are illustrated. The \"Big Three\" of psychoanalysis are brought together by the author in his theory of  Humanistic Identification and its relevance for humor. Experiences using sense of humor for staff survival, eventuating in the use of humor as a mode of psychotherapy with the drug addict, are also explored. (Author/MML)",

Results indicated that the two personal-social problems were rated as more serious than the vocational problems on all dependent measures. Additionally, the feared rape problem was considered the most serious and needing the most counseling sessions, whereas the women with existenial anxiety were perceived as being most able to profit from counseling, and were offered the most empathy.

Percentages were calculated to determine what percentage of each sample scored masculine, androgynous and feminine on the BSRI. As hypothesized, the majority of males in both samples scored masculine while the largest percentage of females in both samples scored in the androgynous category. The author concluded that given the males' perception of sport as an agent of masculine orientation, sport tends to attract highly sex typed males. However, the  traditional perception of sport for females with its emphasis on process and product, tends to attract the more androgynous woman. (Author)",

Four studies involving 239 mature women are reported which examine the effect of changing instructions on expressed interests; the expressed satisfaction of mature women with KOIS results; the extent of profile differentiation; and the usefulness of male-normed scales with female clients. Conclusions are that the KOIS can be effectively used with re-entry women and that the profiles do reflect individual diversity; re-entry women consider KOIS results reasonable and the KOIS responses are not easily manipulated. Most women score higher on the female-normed scales than the corresponding same-normed male-normed scales; cross sex scales should  be examined by women to expand alternatives considered. (Author)",

        "description":"In this paper, the authors report that in many of the cases they have treated, the living situations and/or environments to which patients were returning upon discharge, were not suitable for either maintaining, or improving upon, the gains achieved while hospitalized. As a result, a community residence training program, based upon a behavioral principles model, was developed and is described. The program targets those patients who appear to have the potential to learn the skills necessary for self-care, with the focus centering around the principle of Successive Approximations. Consistent with this model, and in an effort to establish appropriate expectations during the training process, the program was divided into three separate developmental areas: (1) self-maintenance  skills, (2) social-interpersonal skills, and (3) work skills. After four years of training programs and placing several groups, pairs, and even individual patients into the community, continued follow-up reports indicate the success of the program. The authors feel that the continuity of residence in the community for the period of time the original group maintained (ranging from 13 months to four years) as well as the need for less support, is significant evidence that this program works.

The effect of a \"rational\" treatment on the appraisal of threat is investigated. Five groups of 13 college students each heard one of five treatment orientations before viewing slides showing the victims of automobile accidents. Subjects were divided into the following treatment groups: rational, content-denial, mystification, suppression, and control. While subjects viewed the slides, their heart rates and endosomatic skin potentials were monitored and self-reports of distress were obtained. A measure of avoidant behavior was obtained after the slide presentation. The results of the self-report measure indicated that the \"rational\" and\"suppression\" treatments led to significantly lower self-reports of distress than the other conditions. This suggests that \"rational\" treatment is effective in altering the appraisal of threat. These findings were not supported by physiological and behavioral measures. (Author/JLL)",

        "description":"An exhaustive analytic review of large bodies of research indicates that rates of premarital intercourse among teenagers have risen sharply since 1966. This is particularly true for white females, for whom the rate is probably about three times that of the 1920's thru the mid-1960's; for white males the rate seems to have risen about 50%. By age 17 or 18, rates for white males and females are about 40%; for black males, probably 95% and black females, about 70%. Premarital intercourse seems to be occurring earlier for both sexes and both races. A sharp decline in double standard attitudes and behaviors is noted. Most adolescents are not promiscuous; sex relations generally occur in an affectionate steady relationship. Only about 15% of sexually active teen-agers appeared to use  effective contraceptives consistently (as of 1972). Higher incidence of premarital intercourse, improved physical health, earlier maturation, poor contraceptive practice, and a drop in the early marriage rate probably account, to a large extent, for rising rates of out-of-marriage births to adolescents. Several factors account for the far higher illegitimacy rates among blacks: less use of abortion and effective contraceptives, and fewer forced marriages. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper describes how the author has used children's stories, published in the People's Republic of China, to explore the ethnocentrism in American academic social psychology. The stories are read to students in the author's undergraduate classes in social psychology, who then discuss the themes of the stories. Comparisons are made with stories commonly available to children in this country. Major emphases in the stories from China include: (1) an emphasis upon helpfulness and cooperation in the pursuit of group goals; (2) a minimizing of roles defined by sex, age, or social prestige; (3) the early introduction of children into adult roles; (4) error seen as ignorance, calling for reeducation rather than punishment; (5) care of personal and group belongings. The frequency of  these themes is contrasted with their appearance in American children's literature. Attention is then directed to the cultural differences which have been noted, as these relate to emphases within areas of interest common to American social psychologists. To date attention has included the various psychological needs identified by Henry Murray, with particular attention to the achievement motive. Maslow's need hierarchy is reexamined in terms of the orientation of the Chinese stories, and a similar reexamination is made of Kohlberg's stages of moral development. (Author)",

Low-power persons were hypothesized to be motivated to take another's cognitive perspective in order to reduce their uncertainty and to help them decide how to act to increase their outcomes. Low-power persons were also expected to reciprocate the other's cooperation or competition; high-power persons were expected to be indifferent to the other's behavior. Results indicated that, compared to high power subjects, low-power subjects were more (a) interested in knowing the other's intentions, (b) cooperative, (c) attracted to the other, and (d) willing to facilitate the other's outcomes to the  extent the other had acted cooperatively. Results may be interpreted as suggesting that the arrogance of the powerful and the vigilance of the less powerful may be due, in part, to unequal motives for cognitive perspective-taking and for responding to the other's cooperative gestures.

Results showed the binaural tasks to be sensitive to individual differences, revealing a wide range of performance scores on each task and a variety of performance relationships between the two tasks. These results tended to have high reliability. In addition, comparisons between tasks suggested that the dichotic listening task is the most difficult of the  three tasks. Finally, significant practice effects were apparent for binaural tasks. Altogether, it was concluded that the three listening tasks used in the present study represent a useful method for the investigation of individual differences in and performance patterns of selective attention.

The research reported in this paper utilized an adapted version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale in a preliminary attempt to develop an adult diagnostic tool.

This term \"myth\" has been interpreted by many gerontologists to mean that intellectual functioning does not decline even late in life (except shortly before death). Furthermore, this interpretation of maintenance of functioning has been generalized to other cognitive performance. Learning and memory data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study have been analyzed. Laboratory measures of serial and paired-associate learning and performance on the Benton Revised Visual Retention test indicate that verbal learning and memory-for-designs decline late in life. The primary results are based on pairs of measures at least six years  apart of men over the entire adult range. These results were supported by comparisons of two independent samples from each of several birth cohorts. The two samples were measured at different times and provided estimates of age changes within cohorts. The samples measured later were older than the early samples; and for the groups late in life, performance favored the younger samples. The participants in this study are predominantly educated healthy men. These findings are not consistent with the hypothesis of maintenance of cognitive performance late in life. (Author)",

        "description":"This symposium examines recent research on sex restrictiveness as a potential indicator of sex bias. Two specific questions are addressed: (1) Can useful non-sex-restrictive raw score interest scales be constructed? Research results are reported for more than 10,000 persons in six samples including 9th graders, 11th graders, college-bound students, college sophomores, and adults. (2) Are sex-restrictive interest score reports more valid than non-restrictive reports? Data for two longitudinal validity studies (Ns=1,400 and 1,000) and two concurrent validity studies (Ns=1,400 and 10,500) are summarized. Results of this research, together with research on the construct validity of sex-restrictive and non-restrictive reporting procedures, indicate that sex restrictiveness in interest  score reports is not a necessary concomitant of validity; hence it may be indicative of sex bias.

        "description":"At an all-day workshop for 50 counselors from public schools and community colleges, researchers presented a 15-item attitudinal questionnaire regarding perspectives, characteristics, and conceptual information about women. The findings of this research are: (1) male counselors are either neutral or slightly positive in attitudes towards women working, while female counterparts hold significantly more positive attitudes toward women and careers, (2) general attitudinal changes for both male and female counselors become focused on the counseling process itself; (3) attitudes can be changed regarding careers for women; and (4) both male and female counselors are influenced by sex stereotypes.

The research attempts to (1) successfully develop a biographical inventory (BI) which can accurately predict vocational needs and (2) extend the construct validity of the Minnesota Importance Questionnaire (MIQ). This paper describes the initial findings of this project in which the following hypotheses were tested: (1) There is a systematic relationship between developmental personal history factors, as measured by a BI, and vocational needs; (2) The same consistent set of relationships can be found across samples from different populations; (3) A weighted BI can significantly predict vocational needs; (4) A weighted BI developed on subjects from one population can  significantly predict needs for subjects from a different population. Subjects were 206 college students administered the MIQ and BI forms A and B. The findings support Hypothesis 1 for seven of the MIQ needs, partial support was found for six of the needs, and the hypothesis could not be supported for seven of the needs. Only moderate findings were found in support of Hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 3 was confirmed for six of the 20 MIQ needs and there was no evidence found supporting Hypothesis 4. (YRJ)",

The movement toward objective measurement, employee participation, multiple raters, and the like, represents a definite improvement over traditional trait ratings. Still, internal improvements of appraisal systems may not be adequate to overcome the contextual factors that inhibit appraisal in organizations. Such things as the nature of managerial work, environmental demands, and organizational characteristics generally clash with the internal structure of appraisal systems. Designing appraisal systems congruent with organizational realities will require a new set of assumptions about what an effective appraisal system should  look like. (Author)",

This paper examines the assertion training model and its coverage of four major stages in which the participants are helped to: (1) distinguish assertion from aggression and nonassertion from politeness; (2) develop a belief system to support assertive behavior; (3) develop skills for dealing with excessive emotions which interfere with assertive behavior and other  internal obstacles to assertive behavior; and (4) develop assertive skills through active practice models.

Findings indicate substantial effects on verbal reports of pain, avoidance behaviour, psychophysiological indices, power function parameters, and sensory decision theory indices. Discussion centers on how social models affect illness role-taking, alter emotional qualities of pain, and influence enactment of previously learned pain and illness behaviour. A recent investigation examining restrictions in communication networks among experimental participants is described. Hypotheses concerned the impact of a tolerant model, the additive effect of public disclosure of pain experience, and the effects of a coactive peer companion on personal distress.  Findings indicated exposure to tolerant models substantially reduced pain reports and encouraged persistence to higher electric current intensities before describing them as unendurable and withdrew. Psychophysical scaling of the data indicated that the different forms of communication influenced power function exponents. They were smaller subsequent to exposure to a tolerant model indicating that fundamental properties of the shock experience were changed. Neither self-disclosure of preceived discomfort or a peer-companion subjected to the same experience produced changes in pain behaviour. The value of conceptualizing pain phenomena as components of complex social-behavioral transactions is discussed. (Author)",

Relationships between spouses and between parents and children contain the conditions required for effective counselling and helping. This paper presents the results of two tests of the hypothesis that such helping relationships in families act as moderators between the experienced stress and resultant well-being of family members. In the first study, 89 married husband-wife pairs indicated (1) the amount of stress they experienced in their jobs and daily living, (2) their satisfaction with the help they received from their spouses, and (3) perceptions of their satisfaction and well-being in four areas: job, life, marriage, and mental and physical well-being. In the second study 274 male and female  adolescents indicated (1) the amount of stress they experienced in their day-to-day living, (2) their satisfaction with the help they received from their mothers, fathers, and peers, and (3) perceptions of their well-being in three conceptually distinct areas (life satisfaction, various affective states, and mental and physical well-being). The results of these two studies indicate that concrete benefits derive from informal helping relationships among members of nuclear families. (Author)",

JSAS disseminates information on three complementary levels: (a)  descriptive abstracts of documents accepted by the service, (b) individual full-text copies of these documents in either paper or microfiche format on demand, and (c) complete collections of accepted documents on an annual subscription basis. Diverse materials in all content areas are actively solicited, and undergo editorial review. Abstracts of accepted materials are published in this quarterly JSAS Catalog of Selected Documents in Psychology, which serves as a vehicle for identifying and ordering only those full-text documents which are relevant to one's interests.

        "description":"The construct of motive to avoid success (Horner, 1969) accounts for differences in achievement motivation between sexes due, hypothetically, to conflicts encountered by women when competing with men. However, recent research suggests that some men also fear success. The present study investigated socio-cultural correlates differentiating persons who fear success from those who do not, using high school seniors who typically face conflicts and anxieties regarding their educational, vocational, and marital futures. The dispersion of socio-cultural characteristics was assumed to be greater for this relatively heterogenous group, thereby providing data to meet statistical assumptions which would enable generalizations to be made about a larger segment of the population. Selected  intellectual, socio-economic, aspirational and psychological variables--shown to be related to achievement motivation--were collected. Students fearing success had: (a) higher IQ scores, (b) more educated fathers, (c) greater resultant achievement motivation, and (d) more non-traditional attitudes toward women, but (e) less fear of social rejection than their counterparts. The first four findings are supportive of research so far while the last one is not. It was hypothesized that Ss showing less fear of social rejection felt free to attribute fear of success to the cue-subject whereas their counterparts sympathized with the cue-subject. (Author)",

        "description":"The Discovery Room is a mental health oriented primary school intervention for children with learning and behavioral difficulties in the classroom which has been steadily modified over a four-year period through accommodation to real-life needs of an inner city school. In the Discovery Room, a special teacher works with children singly or in pairs for two half-hour sessions a week in a special room. Improvement in academic and social functioning is fostered by strengthening the child's self-image through work with varied materials and imaginative play in the context of a close, supportive relationship between the Discovery Room teacher and the child, and positive communication with parents and classroom teacher. The Discovery Room was initiated by university staff for often  overlooked children who were &quot;turned off&quot; to school learning although they were not hard to &quot;manage&quot; in the classroom. Through utilizing some of its unanticipated consequences, the intervention has evolved in scope to include the classroom as a whole. The next phase calls for a core group of classroom teachers to be trained in the Discovery Room approach so that they can take part in constructing a classroom model. Thus the attempt will be made to move from secondary to primary intervention. (Author)",

But if we consider ingratiation as a tactic to enhance the counselor's power of social influence or to reduce the client's dependence, it becomes less unusual. A counselor operating from Strong's theory of counseling as a two phase social influence process may use ingratiation to augment his social influence power over the client so as to be able to ultimately influence the client to modify his  behavior or attitudes. In this sense ingratiation does not involve unethical behavior for the counselor is using the tactic not to benefit himself but in order to increase his attractiveness to the client in order to help the client and to meet his contractual agreement with the client.

Subjects were 64 undergraduate students with the same presenting problem of unassertiveness. They were given two different interpretations of their difficulty. One group was given a behavioristic explanation asserting that their problems were caused by an unstable, externally induced conditioning process. The other group was given a \"depth\" explanation which suggested that their problems were caused by a subtle internal personality trait with long and complex origins. Results indicated no differences in expectancy for change and in behavior change between the two groups.  Immediately following the interview, those receiving the conditioning interpretation reported more anxiety than those receiving the trait interpretation, but a week later the differences had attenuated. These results are discussed in terms of the \"Rumpelstiltskin Effect\" and the equipotentiality of different insights. (Author)",

        "description":"This report outlines the limitations and weaknesses of singlecase, time-series research designs, of which the ABAB design is one of the widely used. An alternative design, the simultaneous treatment design, proposed by Browning and Stover (1971), has several advantages over the ABAB design. The design enables an experimenter to simultaneously answer two important questions: (1) to what extent is the target behavior changing? and (2) Which of several possible treatment alternatives is most effective? Unfortunately, the simultaneous treatment design has rarely been used in research studies reported to date. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the utility of the simultaneous treatment design in modifying the classroom behavior of two young children in a Headstart program.  In each case a teacher and a teacher's aide recorded data and administered the treatment programs. Problem behaviors of both children were similar and each received the same treatment conditions simultaneously in a counterbalanced order: response-contingent reinforcement (Treatment A) and response-contingent time out (Treatment B). It was determined that Treatment B was significantly more facilitative than Treatment A for Child 1. However, the reverse was true for Child 2. Advantages and limitations of the simultaneous treatment design are briefly reviewed. (Author)",

Aditionally, it is argued that individuals differ in terms of their positions on this continuum, and that such differences are important to a general theory of bargaining. The argument is based on: (a) the demonstration of a number of simple (and internally consistent) measurement techniques which describe a subject's social motivation, and (b) some empirical results demonstrating the relationship of such motivational measures to actual bargaining behavior. The present paper discusses several general approaches to the measurement of social motives in the individual subject. As it discusses the first two approaches, data  is cited which indicates the relation of the motivational measures to actual bargaining behavior. Such a relation seems quite desirable, given the assumption of motivation's influence on bargaining behavior. The approaches have in common the underlying notion that in the dyad, subject's utility function over outcomes is determined by a weighted sum of the outcome subject receives for him/herself and the outcome received by the other. It is in terms of these weights that subjects' orientations can be described. (Author)",

Training for 73 students involved readings, lectures, modeling, and experiential learning in small groups. Pre-post measures included reported help given and received, a situation type of empathy test, and two global measures of adjustment--self-rated overall adjustment, and rated severity of three personal problems. Following the course, students evaluated the training with respect to attempted use and perceived usefulness of the training. Results indicated a significant increase for level of empathy. Also, significant changes in the direction of better  adjustment were reported for the two adjustment measures. These pre-post changes, as well as student evaluations of the program, were interpreted as supportive of the training of help-giving skills in the classroom context. (Author)",

Through better training programs, the school psychologist is beginning to perform functions as leader and policy maker in the schools. It is possible for the psychologist's services to be called upon for assistance in developing possible solutions if he/she is prepared to design plans of action and accept responsibility for implementation. As the school psychologist offers a plan for dealing with a crisis, he/she needs to take into consideration administrative issues such as community pressure, resistance to change,  personnel issues, and various financial issues. The author feels that schools can benefit from more of the expertise of school psychologists, if the crises that administrators continuously face are seen as opportunities for greater involvement in the total functioning of schools.

        "description":"This paper tests four models of the effect of the size of a subgroup of an organization on the proportion of attraction choices made by members of the subgroup that are given to other members of the subgroup. The data base consists of friendship and respect choices made by members of the Maryland State Police force. The four models are: simple linear, linear logarithmic, threshold, and logarithmic threshold. In addition, the effects of the bureaucratic functions of the subgroup on in-group choosing are tested. Though all of these models yield significantly good fits to the data used, the logarithmic threshold model provides the best fit. This model describes the process of in-group choosing (friendship and respect) as a positive linear function of the logarithm of the size of the  group, provided the group is below a critical size, somewhere around 50 to 70 members. Above the critical size, there are no consistent changes in in-group choosing with increasing size. (Author)",

The following causal factors are discussed: (1) the difficulty of pinning down abstractly stated goals in an operational manner at evaluation time; and (2) the history of the guidance movement in schools. Guidance is viewed as a program, and not merely as a set of services. The use of specific activities, with specific goals, simplifies the task of evaluation. A \"Career Visit\" form, with examples of actual student reactions, and a parent conference guide form are included. (Author/JLL)",

It was hypothesized that the son of the more available father would have better problem-solving ability and a more masculine orientation than the son of the less available father. The subjects were 30 four-five year olds and their parents. A questionnaire was given to the parents, and each child was individually tested on three problem-solving tests. The families were divided into a high father-available group (N=16) and a low father-available group (N=14). Study findings suggest that high paternal availability is positively associated with the son's problem- solving ability, while maternal availability influences this relationship and the child's development.

A sample of 7,000 students was tested at each of the two age levels. Reading, writing numeration, and word knowledge tests were administered. Findings indicate that Australian children differ little in their ability on tasks of reading comprehension from their age-mates in Britain and the United States, but are marginally inferior to students in New Zealand. In general, the writing of formal letters was poorly performed, and half of the students aged 14 years old were unable to write a minimal letter applying for employment. In  numeration, Australian 14-year-olds performed no better than 13-year-olds in the United States. Students aged 10 years could not calculate correctly when using the four operations in a formal way. If a student does not master the basic skills before age 15, when he can legally leave school, he will be disadvantaged for the remainder of his life. (Author/JLL)",

However, certain legal principles have been established which should be part of the basic knowledge of any professional in the helping services. This publication seeks to heighten the awareness of counselors as to the legal implications of what they do. The major areas of focus include: (1) the constitutional principles of due process and other student rights; (2) the  principles of confidentiality and privacy rights; (3) the guiding principles of an ethical code and (4) the counselor's dilemma in serving the often conflicting demands of students, parents and the system.

The language backgrounds of Asian Americans differ from generation to generation and from country to country. Many students are already bilingual or trilingual, factors which may aid them in understanding English. The cultural patterns and value orientations of the Asian societies which emphasize reflection and self-restraint can influence cognitive and affective variables in language learning. Asian students may be  less verbal and less willing to take risks, traits which hinder learning to read and speak a second language.

The cloze test involves selecting passages, deleting every fifth word, and asking students to fill in the blanks with an appropriate word. Scores between 44 percent and 57 percent correct indicate that the material is at instructional reading level. The informal specific skills test consists of  paragraphs selected to represent skills such as comprehending the author's intent and noting the central thought in a series of paragraphs.

Results were compared to earlier studies conducted in the same manner in 1972 in 13 schools in the United States and in 9 foreign countries, when significant differences were found between boys' and girls' interests in the United States but not in the other countries. Although first-grade boys and girls in the spring of 1976 expressed significant differences in category preferences, the results are less pronounced than in the previous  studies. Analysis of second-grade category preferences by sex in 1976 showed no significant differences between boys and girls. Fiction categories were most popular at both grade levels for both boys and girls. The second most popular categories were current (1970s) information for boys and scientific information for girls. Implications for instruction are discussed and sources of interest are noted. (MKM)",

In brief, the argument presented suggests that elaboration facilitates learning, that such facilitation signifies an important characteristic of human knowledge, that the character of knowledge is more episodic than hierarchical, that learning is the mental construction of episodes, that development liberates learning from its environmental dependence, and that neglect of these propositions in instructional planning may be detrimental to students' learning. Implications of this theory for educational practice advocate the use of references to students'  previous experience and environmental prompts, and suggest that the ordering of information or the evaluation of learning in the classroom according to a hierarchical model may be misleading.

Specific skills, such as noting details, following directions, and seeing relationships, should be taught. Students should be shown how to modify their flexible narrative reading styles to one of great deliberation, in order to understand mathematics reading material. The specialized vocabulary of mathematics and the special mathematical symbols must also be specifically taught, beginning with concrete examples when possible. Suggestions for instruction include getting the students to discuss the expository material or the verbal  problem, in order to understand their thinking processes; being careful, as an instructor, not to talk too much; being sure that students understand the technical vocabulary; and preparing short-answer, multiple-choice tests to use as pretests before instruction in a particular concept.

Reading staff hired with Title VII funds offered assistance to all teachers in the high school by working with classroom teachers in their classes for 60 minutes of class time per week. Free reading time devoted to high-interest materials was encouraged during this time. The Title VII staff instructed teachers in the use of the Wide Range Achievement Test and tested the majority of junior and senior classes of the high school to identify reading problems. Student reading guides were prepared to help bridge the gap between students' reading level and the readability level of the texts. Six-week courses were offered as options in English to students with severe  reading difficulties. The resistance to the program felt by the content-area teachers was overcome by the willingness of the reading staff to spend many extra hours preparing materials and leading workshops after school. At the end of the year average growth per student served was two years per semester and, equally important, all teachers had a core of materials to use year after year in assisting students with reading difficulties.

Six stories were constructed for each of four inference levels, and 11 questions were prepared for each story. Order of stories was counterbalanced across the three sessions in which they were administered to the children. The picture of language development which emerges from this study is that at first children learn to draw inferences from information which assumes or maps onto their prior knowledge; second, they learn to draw the necessary implications from arbitrary material; and third, they learn to draw the necessary implications  from information which contradicts their prior world knowledge. Alternatively, development consists of learning to detach oneself from what is known and to constrain one's interpretation of linguistic information to what is explicitly stated, an ability which several authors have suggested appears to be a consequence of formal schooling.

In a study which examined and described the observable process of oral reading by six bilingual children whose first and dominant language was Yiddish, the Reading Miscue Inventory (RMI) was used as an instrument for analysis. The children (seven and eight years old) read aloud stories from a group of instructional reading texts in English and from a nonoverlapping set of selected story books in Yiddish. They then retold the stories in their own words. Data were tape recorded and analyzed. The study showed the RMI to be completely useful with a language having a different alphabetical and directional system.  Results showed that silent correcting had occurred, that subjects gave significant evidence of processing print but that a gap existed between receptive and productive processing, that subjects were adept at gaining information from alternate sources, and that they felt no great need for their oral reading to sound like natural language.

The original study involved 11 teachers and 195 children enrolled in kindergarten through grade 6; a replication of the study involved 14 teachers and 280 students in kindergarten through grade 12. In both studies, teachers observed students and recorded ratings of intellectual capacity by using the Ruth Strang Informal Observation of Capacity Inventory. Data indicated that  the use of an informal inventory is justified, that teachers can use an informal inventory in order to make decisions concerning children's intellectual capacity, that these estimates of capacity are reasonably accurate, and that the Strang Inventory is appropriate for use with a heterogeneously grouped class.

An introspective questionnaire was given to 97 teachers, the majority of whom were primary-level teachers, involved in a two-day conference on reading cues to creativity. Of these teachers, only 17% reported no professional influence from reading. The majority of the other 83% were more influenced by books than by periodicals in their instructional methodology, and more young teachers reported being influenced by reading  than did older teachers. The seven materials mentioned most frequently were, in order: \"Teacher\" by Sylvia Ashton-Warner, \"Teacher\" (periodical), \"Instructor\" (periodical), \"The Reading Teacher\" (periodical), \"The Naked Children\" by Daniel Fader, \"Schools without Failure\" by William Glasser, \"Summerhill\" by A.S.

Participants in the voluntary group were retired women who were lifelong readers and who continued to enjoy reading as a hobby. Because of differences in reading interests and in time available for reading, members read independently during the week; Readarama time was used for discussions of individual reading and for the exchange of ideas and reminiscences. Each week the group leader supplied supplemental, optional reading material, choosing stories from \"70 Most Unforgettable Characters from 'Reader's Digest'\" because of their popularity with group members. Readarama points up the value of the reading group as a social outlet, an outlet for an already-established hobby, and a way for  previously active adults to maintain some level of activity and structure in their retired lives.

Empirical research is then reviewed, revealing serious problems, particularly in developmental research. These problems include inadequate theories about the nature of metaphor, inadequate control over preexisting knowledge, and hasty conclusions that children cannot understand metaphors, drawn because in certain experimental conditions children do not select metaphorical interpretations. Related research on the comprehension of proverbs and analogies is discussed and recommendations for future research are made. These depend on a redefinition of metaphor and on adequate controls of preexisting  knowledge, surface structure, and meaning. The approach suggested emphasizes the context-dependent nature of metaphors. Finally, it is argued that, even if metaphors can be transformed into comparisons, these comparisons are themselves nonliteral and, consequently, still need to be explained. (Author/AA)",

To this end, a case is made for a spreading activation process as being the essential ingredient of the comprehension process. Concepts activated during comprehension restrict the search set for candidate concepts and also constitute part of an episodic representation that can become part of long-term memory. The way in which these representations atrophy is discussed, as is the way in which their idiosyncratic components are eliminated in producing representations in semantic memory. Some observations on the comprehension and memory of text are made, and arguments are  presented to show how intrusions and omissions in recall can be handled. Existing experimental data are reanalyzed in terms of the proposed model and alternative interpretations consistent with the model are shown to be possible. (Author/AA)",

During the first year of the three-year study, subjects were fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. The Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and the SRA Achievement Series subscales were administered; sex and age variables were statistically controlled. Analysis of data revealed that self-esteem was predominant over reading comprehension both congruously and unidirectionally. Increases in self-esteem were found to be followed by increases in reading comprehension achievement, while decreases in self-esteem were followed by decreases in achievement. No pattern of predominance was revealed between self-esteem and vocabulary achievement or  between self-esteem and spelling achievement. The implications of these findings suggest that an atmosphere which is conducive to the enhancement of self-esteem should be incorporated into the environment where learning is to occur. (KS)",

Scores were trichotomized, and children from each level were randomly assigned to one of three cueing conditions (no cues, two superordinate cues, six subordinate cues). Subjects were administered a recall task of categorized words and \"new\" words (paralogs). Significant effects for classification level and cueing condition were found for total recall on trial one, and for classification level, cueing condition, and their interaction, on trial four. Recall of paralogs on trial five was a function of classification level only. This study suggests that classification skills mediate both acquisition and recall of categorized words. (Author/AA)",

Lessons in many practical skill areas were written into conversational form and were taped, so students could read along as they listened to the intonation contours. Students were paired, and each partner was given only half the dialog. Partners took turns reading the lines while listening to them on the tape recorder and then took turns reading them to each other. Partners then dictated one line at a time, helping each other with  spelling and punctuation and correcting errors. Each dialog climaxed in the students performance of the actions described. Although results were disappointing in terms of mean reading scores, almost every child made progress in some area. The slowest students improved in rote mechanical skills; some of the top students showed a dramatic gain in reading scores. The report includes tables of test results for students in fourth grade and in junior high school. (GW)",

Researchers, curriculum developers, and educational publishers can help in this movement by keeping in mind a number of factors when designing reading programs. (1) The principal is the key to the quality of the instructional program; research must be translated into appropriate materials that will create a support system for principals. (2) Reading materials must be less rigid and must have high intrinsic appeal.

Teachers' tactics in responding to pupil errors during oral reading in public school classrooms were analyzed with the assistance of the technology of the Computer Assisted Teacher Training System (CATTS) to formulate hypotheses about teacher decision making in interactive teaching. An observation schedule constructed to code teacher and pupil moves in oral reading was used to gather data from 34 teachers as they taught oral reading lessons. The observed prompting tactics, variations in success rate in prompting, and data from a stimulated recall interview of teachers suggested models of teacher information processing and decision making.

Literature by and about widows indicates four major reasons for this situation: there is no general recognition of the distinctive problems widows must face; except in a few large urban centers, widows lack access to social agencies, clubs, and therapy groups that can provide counsel or collective power and identity; the widow has been negatively or unrealistically stereotyped in literature and in the mass media; widow memoirs are few in number, are largely ignored, since they are by nature \"unliterary,\" and themselves confirm stereotypical responses to widowhood. English teachers should accept a  measure of responsibility for helping widows attain positive visibility, by helping to minimize negative connotations associated with the word \"widow\" and by including the widow in discussions of literature and in discussions of marriage and family relationships.

The degree to which instructors in the English classroom are successful in attaining this specific goal is dependent on the ability of students to organize their experiences. College students, although generally capable of using all the language skills, represent many developmental levels. Instruction can assist them in developing these basic competencies to a productive level. In the classroom, several techniques can facilitate this process: students can be allowed time for the organization of thoughts before they read a selection or write a composition, discussion can be followed by a brief period of silent thought,  and lectures can be paraphrased or annotated in the students' own language. Students in developmental language courses can benefit especially from an emphasis on the encouragement of higher-level cognitive operations. (KS)",

After developing criteria for grading the papers, members of the department marked their own papers and one other set. Eight months later, 240 of the papers were regraded by the original instructor, in order to assess self-consistency in marking. Comparison of final grades, essay grades assigned by the instructor, and essay grades assigned by the disinterested marker suggested that there was a general consistency in grading throughout the department; the papers that were regraded eight months later showed a similar consistency for individual staff members. The exit essay experiment was felt to  have been worthwhile, in part because of the cooperative effort involved in carrying it through. This led to an awareness of what the department grading standards were, of the extent to which they were being followed, and of the way in which individual grading policies compared with those of colleagues.

This paper provides a brief overview of learning theories and suggests that two specific theories, functionalism (as formulated by John Dewey) and observational learning (developed most recently by Bandura), have particular relevance for the teaching of basic language skills. For teachers, there should be no controversy between cognitive and stimulus-response hypotheses. Rather, teachers should concern themselves with understanding the methods which are most effective with each  individual student. Generally, the cognitive recognition of structures and concepts should be assumed, students should be given models for imitation, and practice in the development of skills should be encouraged.

Other studies suggest that below-average and average students can benefit from a similar approach. Specifically, the introduction of a model based on tagmemic heuristic theory in an adult business communications course was found to produce a significant improvement in prewriting organization but equivocal results in actual student composition. Too little is known about how students feel about employing a heuristic model and about what kinds of attitudinal changes must occur for the model to be successful. Employing a communication sequence such as that suggested by McGuire can perhaps shed more light on the actual processes  involved when a heuristic approach to composing is implemented. (KS)",

Other activities for use in the media center, such as discussion about books and art, guest visitations, poetry reading, written expression, and the making of books by pupils, can be used to promote oral language, listening, and reading skills. Similarly, a language arts fair, dramatic expression, and games can easily become the focus of media center programs.  While current research and literature offer little in a discussion of the role that the elementary school library can play in the development of children's language, storytelling and picture book stories, transparency stories, and discussion of books have been shown to be effective in encouraging the development of language skills.

Participants, 65 adults who ranged in age from 18 to 56, attended the four-week summer session. Each class session was equally divided between academic instruction (reading, math, and study skills) and career counseling. The stated purpose of the course was to acquaint students with the university, offering them a chance to savor academia and to assess their abilities to compete in the university environment. The bulk of personalized instruction  was derived from teacher-made dittos on studying, note taking, skimming and scanning techniques, library skills, and exam preparation. A text was used to promote literal, critical, and affective comprehension of materials. Analysis of results indicated that great strides were evidenced by all those involved--of the original 65 enrollees, 29 applied for the fall semester, and several others expressed their intentions to continue higher education at a later date.

Too many composition programs, however, are a waste of money and time which traps the composition teacher into accountability for students' success or failure. It is generally true that not all students need as much writing work at the college level as blanket requirements suggest, that not all teaching in writing courses is especially good or efficient, that not all writing courses are designed to achieve the maximum result for dollar spent, and that too little effort is given to the construction of writing courses. The institution of requirements, however, does not ensure that students'  writing skills will improve. What is more important is a general commitment on the part of teachers and administrators to real learning and improvement in composition. (KS)",

Interviews conducted with 22 members of the Texas Public Relations Association reflected four major areas of concern: the level of respect that public relations receives from management, the degree of supervision of the public relations function, the role played by public relations in decision making, and the level of professional status awarded public relations. A theory of social responsibility in public relations, based on the evidence gathered from these interviews, generally states that the level of social  responsibility in public relations rises as professionalization takes place and as the level of respect from management increases, as the degree of supervision from management decreases, and as the public relations counselor's role in decision-making processes becomes more dominant.

The review found that the following factors influence language and language learning: cognitive development, the capacity to discriminate and comprehend the speech of others, and the ability to produce speech sounds and sequences of speech sounds that conform to the patterns of adult speech. Two factors that underlie the development of skill in learning a foreign language are intellectual capacity and appropriate attitude toward the other language group, coupled with a determined motivation to learn the foreign language. However, students with low aptitude can learn a language if attitude and motivation are strong. Attitude, motivation, and orientation contribute to the rapid  acquisition of listening and speaking skills. These factors affect both the learner's perseverance in language study and the learner's reactions to contact with a foreign culture. (MB)",

The skills lab concentrates on the phonological/graphological, semantic, and logical aspects of language usage and includes the following units: coding 1 and 2, word craft 1 and 2, sentence craft 1 and 2, passage craft 1 and 2, the reader's collection and study guides, and library skills and study skills.

Anecdotal observations of what children do with language are the basis of the next section of the review, which draws implications from (rather than for) teaching. Descriptions of teaching practices are used to illustrate child/adult language acquisition in the teaching/learning situation. The descriptions are personal explorations of ways teachers have  helped facilitate child language acquisition and, in the process, have discovered new things about their own language. (AA)",

Scholar-librarians, on the other hand, use the professor's lesson plan as a means of teaching themselves, build up a huge central file of questions and answers, prepare short annotated lists of titles, and provide the opportunity for \"discipline  tutorials\" for students.

Carefully selected students for the program consist only of those with distinguished undergraduate and master's degree records and with proof or strong promise of excellence in  teaching. In a highly successful arrangement, students have been placed as teaching interns in community colleges.

The ability of these children to reproduce the syntactic features of the Linguistic Structures Repetition test gave an index of errors in the recoding of standard English. Results of the study show that repetition of standard English sentences by black nonstandard English-speaking children and by Spanish-speaking bilingual children is not merely mimicry of the surface structure of the utterance but is often a recoding into a first language or dialect. Teachers and  teacher trainees, by noting imitations of standard English structures, can pay special attention to children's recoding processes and can become familiar with the characteristics of the linguistic production of children who do not speak standard English or who have transference problems from a bilingual environment. They can thus adjust their teaching methods to help children overcome language difficulties. (JM)",

For these students, certain hypothesized psycho-cultural barriers to standard English did not appear to operate significantly in their writing. When they did operate, these barriers served to spark [students'] resistance to efforts to eradicate the black dialect and to intensify their desire to maintain their dialect for cultural group identification. The students' apparent awareness and acceptance of the instrumental benefits to be gained through their conformity to  prevailing socially and academically accepted norms of linguistic behavior seemed to act as a significant constraint for standard English performance in their classroom writing. The study urges that the students' bidialectal ability be recognized and exploited to build greater linguistic facility through writing that is personally meaningful. (Author)",

This essay presents a model for solving the problem of finding a coherent, inclusive, and manageable way of approaching language arts instruction. The model, outlined in diagram form and discussed in detail, deals with four major skills of language use--listening and reading (the impressive or ingressive process) and speaking and writing (the expressive process); with four aspects of motive for language use--autistic, communicative, analytic, and aesthetic; and with four ways in which the teacher can involve students--inducive, inductive, deductive,  and correlative. The structure can be entered into at any stage of student development; the stages are cumulative and intermingled. (JM)",

Analysis of responses to 40 food titles and leads indicated three newspaper food-editor types: transitional, traditional, and &quot;new guard.&quot; Food-page readers fell into two types: information oriented (nutritionists) and cooking oriented (chefs). Food writers were asked to predict title-ratings for their perceived editor types and for themselves. Writers generally perceived at least two types of food editors, a traditional type and a contemporary type. Writers were aware that these editor types have different news judgments and saw themselves as similar in news judgment to the contemporary editor type. Accuracy scores showed that food writers had a good concept of the news  judgments of actual editor types. Most writers agreed with the food-news judgments of at least one type of newspaper food editor and with the food-news preferences of at least one type of reader. (Author/AA)",

In response, the eight administrators who had had experience with communication-certified teachers agreed that the teachers were &quot;more able&quot; or&quot;equally able&quot; to perform their teaching duties, as compared to English-certified teachers, while most of the 31 responding teachers felt that they were trained &quot;better than&quot; or &quot;as well as&quot; English teachers.

In this research, the effect of the instructor's use of \"she,\" as the generic singular, on student language use and student attitude was investigated. The rationale was that pronoun reversal may expose to the hearer the sex bias in the language, leading to a perception of the need for change in the language. Results indicated a change in the use of pronouns, with more specific use of \"he,\" a reduction of the use of \"he\" as the generic singular, and the use of \"she\" as a generic. Most students felt a need for an inclusive pronoun in  the language. Student response to questionnaires indicated an awareness both of sexism in our society and of the role of language in maintaining sexism. Change in use of pronouns was not considered difficult by the males in the group. (Author/JM)",

Symbols have been used as instruments to measure artistic works, from film to painting, from high literature to television programs. Stereotypes are communication short-cuts which allow communication to engender images without the use of full description by the artist. Myths occur in communication as the synthesis of a cultural history conveyed in majority values and beliefs. Both high art and popular art utilize these images, but the ways that popular art uses them are affected directly by structure, social worth, and social mobility. High culture is less likely to be limited in its utilization of these images than is mass culture because high art functions with fewer social restraints. Physical  restraints on artistic output become obvious when comparing creative techniques used in various media. Content can be viewed in terms of the physical and social structure of the medium, but there is also an important structural consideration in a work of popular art itself. Most observers of popular art define the inherent structure of that art as formulaic. By more carefully examining these images in popular art, we can learn more about values in society and about the various audiences to whom a particular kind of popular art appeals. (HOD)",

Using verbal directions, one class member describes the form of a nonrepresentational line drawing. In one case, no feedback is allowed from other students, who must render the drawing according to the directions. In another case, the student who describes the drawing may be questioned. Data collected indicate that, while two-way communication, in  which questions are allowed, requires more time, a far greater degree of accuracy can be achieved.

Contemporary rhetoricians offer a broader base for rhetorical theory which includes the analysis of all symbolic forms that contribute to and convey meanings in human interactions. This paper argues that the shift in emphasis in rhetorical criticism from a speaker orientation to an assessment of the effect of symbolic forms on the sociocultural system has significant implications for the understanding of rhetorical genre. By expanding the scope of rhetoric, theorists have provided a more  comprehensive base for identifying variables affecting generic forms and effects.

Interaction varied among hosts, though a more controlled, experimental study is needed to control such variables as time of day and demographic characteristics of listeners. In general, hosts and callers supported one another; statements which disagreed or negatively reinforced  previous statements constituted less than 1% of the interaction. (AA)",

According to this philosophy, the activity of the human mind invents symbolic constructions of reality. Primary socialization is interpreted as a rhetorical process which tends to maintain prevailing reality constructions. Subsequent communicative interactions (secondary socialization) perform the rhetorical functions of reinforcing or modifying the effects of primary socialization. Language and universes of discourse are the ultimate rhetorical products, which constitute the symbolic matrix that governs human action within a society. This philosophy of rhetoric as reality construction encompasses the traditional concerns of the field, recognizes the validity of  conceptual and empirical research, and provides a perspective which may emerge as the new paradigm for research in the discipline.

The role of rhetoric in science, scientific discourse and its adaptation to rhetorical situations, and the scientific community's reliance on critical discourse are analyzed. The conceptualization of scientific communication in terms of rhetorical theory can delineate the differences between \"hard\" sciences (physics, astronomy, etc.) and \"soft sciences\" (psychology, sociology, etc.), provide a basis from which  scientific discourse may be evaluated, and, finally, remove some of the mystique which surrounds scientific activity.

        "description":"Two hundred college students participated in a comparison of film and videotape television content. After viewing a three-minute dance segment on either film or videotape, students in the experimental groups completed a set of 15 bipolar adjective scales relating to organizational and aesthetic components and made judgments of the technical quality and the quality of the content. Control groups made similar ratings of filmed television programs and of videotaped television; all groups viewed their segments on a 25-inch television monitor. Results indicated that the mode of visual recording affects subjects' organizational and aesthetic perceptions of the visual content of television segments. The type of visual mode appears to interact with the content of the segment and the sex  of the viewer to affect cognitive organization and liking for the presentation. Females appeared to find both film and videotape easier to organize cognitively than did males. The videotaped segment was rated significantly superior to the filmed version by males, while females saw essentially no differences between the two. (AA)",

The first paper develops a theoretical model which attempts to explain the causes of oral communication apprehension, in terms of family structure and levels of communication skill development. A study of high school students indicates that children from large families report much higher levels of oral communication apprehension than do children from moderately sized or small families. The second paper reports a study which indicates that interpersonal distance preferences for college males are, in part, a function of an individual's level of communication apprehension. No similar relationship was found for females. The third paper reports an exploratory study of college graduates which  indicates that high communication apprehensives are more likely to marry immediately after graduation from college and to have fewer children than are moderate or low communication apprehensives. Low communication apprehensives were found to be more likely to describe their marriages as very unhappy and, if divorced, to perceive their spouses as having most wanted the divorce. (Author/AA)",

The person tends to avoid interaction situations and does not initiate interactions. As a consequence, he or she probably has poor social relations and low self-concept, feels alienated from others, and finds it difficult to trust relations with others. The underlying cause of this condition may be due to a single significantly traumatizing event or a series of repeatedly reinforced conditions. A strong possibility exists that the event or events occurred early in the development of a child, resulting in learned habitual responses to adverse conditions even after the original stimulus has disappeared. Since the communication anxious person is regarded as  neurotic, psychotherapeutic treatment procedures involving disclosure and low-threat conditions may be appropriately used in conjunction with, or in place of, a behavior therapy technique such as systematic desensitization.

One is \"the new narcissism\"--a phenomenon characterized by prescriptions for personal fulfillment such as those reflected in popular psychologies and religions. The second trend is the scientific revolution concerned with exchanging static models of reality for process models of interaction. Using some basic tools of structuralism and communication theory, this discussion presents a prototype of a process-oriented theory of the acquisition and development of new communication behaviors. This theory revolves around three principles: the principle of obliqueness, which suggests that no single person or occurrence can teach communication; the principle of exchange, which asserts that for every  personal security that is gained some alienation results; and the principle of dying, in which the security of familiar levels of understanding is replaced by new ideas or a \"new identity.\" (KS)",

Analysis of results from two groups of 30 subjects indicated that the power-politics drama was the most accepted rhetorical vision in Peoria, Illinois. Cold war was a close second, but it appeared to polarize Peorians. Neo-isolationism was a distant third. The results were interpreted as providing empirical verification not only for the typology of foreign-policy dramas but also for Bormann's dramatistic theory of communication. The design used in the study indicates  that rhetorical messages may be tested for their persuasiveness, producing a direct relationship between message production and audience analysis without risking the credibility of a speaker.

As a communication concept, however, definition of the situation must also have a relational aspect; an interaction process depends, in part, on the relationship between the differing definitions of situation of the participants. Ninety undergraduates participated in a study which examined how the coorientation state (relationship between actors' definitions of situation) influenced communication behavior. In particular, the study examined differences between communicative behavior of dyads with low consensus on situational definition, dyads with a minimal definition of the situation, and dyads with a  detailed high definition of the situation. An analysis based on McHugh's conceptualization of things said in defining the situation indicated that trends of messages which define the situation are predictable. Implications for further research using this paradigm are discussed. (Author/AA)",

The cognitive level is observed in the complexity of an immigrant's perception of the host society; the behavioral level, in the immigrant's involvement in the host society through interpersonal and mass communication. Three causal factors are identified as major determinants of the immigrant's communication patterns: language competence, acculturation motivation, and accessibility to host communication channels. Nine propositions are offered which explain the relationship among the three causal factors, behavioral participation in host communication channels, and cognitive structure in perceiving the host society.

        "description":"This paper provides an overview of the general types of evidence used by Ford and Carter in the first presidential campaign debate of 1976. This evidence is analyzed in relation to the key debate subtopics, and some standard tests of evidence are employed regarding accuracy and reliability. The types of evidence considered are statistics, illustration, authority, and analogy (or comparison). Analysis revealed that (1) Carter used 961 more words than did Ford in the first debate; (2) Ford employed statistical evidence in 41 instances compared to 24 statistical citations made by Carter; (3) Carter used illustrative evidence 59 times compared to Ford's 28 times; (4) Carter made 10 references to authority, while Ford made 5; (5) Carter used comparison 6 times, and Ford used it only  twice. Evidence was tested and considered by operational definition, and tests of substance, consistency, sufficiency, recency, and relevancy were also applied to the evidence. It is suggested that Carter may have been more &quot;effective&quot; and &quot;accurate&quot; than Ford was in the first debate although, according to national surveys and opinion polls, Ford won the debate.

        "description":"In the 1968 political campaign, George Wallace consistently attracted auditors of diverse and highly polarized views, people who were negatively closed-minded and people who were positively closed-minded. He exploited this polarization to heighten the impact of his speaking and to rally and solidify the closed-positive auditors. For example, when members of the audience indulged in vocal heckling, Wallace handled the protests effectively, using the heckling both to point out the need for law and order and to build the emotional intensity of his message. This message attacked the federal government for intruding into public education (desegregation), union seniority, voter qualifications, reapportionment, civil rights, and property ownership. In the end, Wallace carried only five  states, a number far short of his optimistic predictions. (JM)",

Costs of electrical power, transportation of materials, and travel were considered, as were environmental requirements (i.e., weather and altitude). The first analysis examined currently existing information sources; the second postulated an ideal information supply and attempted to maximize information input from that ideal  source.

Propinquity, or proximity, is considered to be the system's trait which is essential for the continuation of the human communication system. In a structural functional analysis, six propositions, 15 derived corollaries, and two limits propositions are presented. The variables included in the propositions are: perceived propinquity, perceived bandwidth, perceived complexity of the information, perceived degree of mutual directionality of  the channel, communication skills, perceived communication rules, perceived number of choices among channels, perceived conflict, and perceived turbulence in the environment. Evidence from past research is used to support the perspective presented. (Author)",

        "description":"The issue of whether or not television should continue to air commercial announcements for over-the-counter (O-T-C) drugs has been debated in the United States. On 8 December 1976, the Federal Communications Commission denied a petition to ban such television commercials between 6 A.M. and 9 P.M. in part because it could find little scientific research which specifically addressed the question of a cause and effect relationship between O-T-C drug advertising and use of O-T-C drugs. This paper analyzes interview data from 200 residents of Carbondale, Illinois. Stepwise multiple discriminant analyses generated significant discriminant functions for two models. In both analyses, interpersonal sources of information (received and sought) best discriminated between respondents with  either internal or external locus-of-control orientations regarding health. The investigators conclude that the presumed causal link which ties television viewing of O-T-C drug commercials and O-T-C drug use in a \"hypodermic-needle-like fix\" is too sweeping and simplistic an explanation.

A number of examples of conflict in textbook selection act as illustrations of moral issues in education--the controversy in Kanawha County, West Virginia; the controversy over evolution and creation; and the accusations of sexism and racism in textbooks. Examined historically, it is the removal of moral content from education rather than its inclusion that represents a departure from tradition. Among the reasons offered for the inclusion of morality in the curriculum is the \"hidden curriculum\"--the things the schools teaches implicity, even unintentionally. Moral issues cannot be avoided in the schools. Two approaches to teaching  about morality are examined--values clarification and consideration of Kohlberg's stages of moral judgment. Objections to Kohlberg are examined and the unanswered question of the public's response to moral education is noted. The task of education is, the author notes, to find some middle ground, some way of respecting the needs of differing points of view and still teaching effectively. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"Estimates of the precise costs of school vandalism vary widely, but the seriousness of the problem is beyond dispute. It is possible to get a general idea of the nature and motivation of most vandals and, in doing so, begin to understand the problem and devise solutions for it. There are two basic approaches to vandalism prevention. Currently, as the literature indicates, most programs try to deter vandalism by taking defensive measures that make schools less vulnerable to the ravages of destructive intruders. Deterrent programs treat vandalism symptomatically, usually by emphasizing improved school security. The alternative approach is to treat vandalism diagnostically, attempting to prevent it by attacking its causes. The key to such a program is to involve people in the life  of the school to combat the sense of alienation and indifference that seems to be the cause of most vandalism, and to utilize design solutions to reduce the costs of property damage caused by nonmalicious vandalism.

However, feelings run strong in the controversy over whether principals can or ought to be instructional leaders in their schools. Lack of time, power, clear role definition, and preparation are some of the roadblocks slowing down principals that want to be instructional leaders. Some techniques for getting around the roadblocks include administrative assistants that take over the principal's administrative functions; autonomous schools where decisions regarding the instructional program are made at the building level; and sharing power with other professional personnel. Two innovative programs offer promise  that principals can be trained to perform the complex and demanding role of instructional leader. (Author/MLF)",

A special school is needed to meet the unique requirements of these transitional youth. The history and present trends of the middle school reflect dissatisfaction with the junior high school. A chapter on the middle school program distinguishes between general notions of curricular theory and specific curricular practices. The first part discusses three different curricula. The second part of the chapter takes up a discussion of some of the innovative classroom organization and teaching practices that have become almost synonymous with the middle school movement. The lack of special inservice education for middle school  teachers, principals, and counselors is attributed to lack of commitment and initiative by colleges of education and state education departments. The report concludes that the real issue in intermediate education is whether any of the progressive reforms of the middle schools and junior highs will be retained during a period of economic retrenchment in school districts.

In loco parentis, long an integral part of educational practice, is no longer an accepted role for educators to assume toward students. Directly counter to in loco parentis is the concept of due process of law for students. This review of the literature examines the key court decisions establishing such civil liberties for students as First Amendment rights, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, the right of students to examine their records, equal treatment for handicapped students, and freedom from discrimination on the basis of race or sex. In regard to student rights, the school administrator's position is not an enviable one. The  ambiguity surrounding the student rights controversy makes hard and fast answers difficult to come by. But the schools can become the setting for achieving balance between the opposing forces evident in both the student rights controversy and in the society as a whole. (Author)",

The document unfolds four major concepts--government has become the chief social institution charged with the responsibility of maintaining the stability of society, and this charge is made increasingly difficult as modern American society changes rapidly and intensely; an orderly procedure of self-taxation supports government; government, like all institutions of society, must respond to change,  and in our form of democracy the nature and direction of government response to change is conditioned by the extent of popular participation in political processes; and state and local government units are created and altered to meet specific needs of people within those units. The four parts of the document are on the challenges the state governments must meet, the financing of services, the political processes for decision-making, and the delivery of services.

        "description":"Recent legal action and research raise doubts about the advisability of measuring fiscal effort in the Illinois general grant-in-aid program by using the simple school district tax rate for operational purposes. Various logical, and perhaps legal, considerations might be sufficient to compel adjustment of the measurement of effort. Beyond these reasons, indications are that in the long run, greater state aid will go to districts that pass tax referenda and retain higher tax rates. The weight of research evidence suggests that low-income school districts will not be able to pass school tax referenda as often and therefore will not be able to take advantage of Illinois'&quot;reward for effort&quot; grant-in-aid system. An income factor is needed in the Illinois formula, more as a correction  factor in the measurement of fiscal effort, then as an adjustment to &quot;ability to pay.&quot; Introducing a new effort specification in the formula will require change in other parameters in that formula, including the guaranteed valuation level. If Illinois wishes to retain its present concept of &quot;equal expenditure for equal effort,&quot; there must be a reevaluation of how effort will be measured. (Author/JG)",

        "description":"This study examined the relationship between operating tax rates and selected socioeconomic variables for Illinois school districts. Districts were separately ranked by operating tax rates and then divided into four equal quartiles--low tax effort, low medium tax effort, high medium tax effort, and high tax effort. Discriminant analysis was used to construct a profile for each of these groups. Results of the study confirmed the general belief that differences in fiscal capacity and educational aspirations contributed to differences in local tax effort. The low tax effort group was characterized by a higher assessed valuation per ADA than the other groups. The high tax effort group was characterized by high education attainment, high percentage of professionals, high average  income, high incidence of residential value, high density, and high urbanization. The high medium group was similar in some respects to the high tax effort group. The low medium tax effort group manifested lower educational attainment and a higher concentration of low income families, although its assessed valuation was close to that of the higher tax effort groups.

These variables include the unweighted pupil count, the number of pupils eligible for Title I benefits, the property valuation per pupil, and the local tax rate for operating purposes.

Most of the publication is devoted to the first paper, &quot;The School Boards and Negotiations,&quot; by Fred S. Whitworth. Separate sections of the paper focus in turn on principles to govern negotiations, the importance of collective bargaining for schools, school board responsibilities and salary negotiations, the uniqueness of collective bargaining in education, the negotiation process, teachers' and  principals' salary schedules, and grievances coming out of negotiated contracts. The second paper, &quot;Toward an Hourly Pay Rate for Teachers,&quot; by Roy J.

The inevitable result has been an increase in the number not only of teacher strikes, but of administrator strikes as well. But usually the principals do not strike with the teachers, unless their own union is strong, as is the case in most large city school districts. During a strike, the building principal frequently is the administrator under the most pressure to keep things cool, especially if he or she is charged with keeping the school open while the teachers are out. The principal should remember that the health, safety, and welfare of the students come first. He  should try to maintain good relations with the striking teachers and should not give cause for future teacher complaints, since everyone must work together again after the strike is over.

Nearly 2,000 educational consumers, including a 5 percent random sample of parents, participated in the effort through a series of meetings conducted by building principals. Data analysis began with efforts to condense the 18 goals into two distinct domains, cognitive and affective, and to examine for differences among the various  groups and subgroups.

Researchers observed MDE members at work, attended meetings, conducted interviews, and read documentary material. Attention was focused on the MDE at a system level and on the top 30-40 persons whose actions both caused and reflected organizational behavior. Open Systems Theory was used as a conceptual framework, with emphasis on organization-environment interactions. The organizational strategies employed to acquire resources were observed through seven case studies of issues of major importance to the MDE, including higher education, special education, compensatory education, professional development of teachers, and federal Titles I, III, and V. The author concludes that  powerful environmental elements usually weakened the MDE's ability to generate educational policy. This lack of power was not seen as a people problem; MDE members were found to be generally highly qualified and committed. The author suggests that the MDE's inability to demonstrate a &quot;technical core&quot; made it increasingly vulnerable to other weakening influences, especially political ones. (Author/JG)",

In general, students of low ability received more instructional time than students of middle or high ability, especially when such instruction was provided by a reading specialist or paid aide.

        "description":"This paper describes a strategic (or situational) model of governance that focuses on organizational decision-making activity. This model differs from other organizational models in that it focuses on the issues about which the activities of an organization are focused. This situational model has several advantages. First, it provides a conceptual framework in which to view and understand decision-making over time. Second, the model provides an understanding of the types of situations with which the administrator must contend within the organization and the means of identifying each type. Third, the model suggests what the most effective decision-making structures and processes are in relation to the conditions confronted. Fourth, the model explains why decision-making structure  and processes can become ineffective and fail as conditions change. (Author)",

        "description":"Schools face frightening challenges in the decades ahead, and a fundamental question of education is how they will cope. Organization Development (OD), a process designed to help organizations meet the challenges of pervasive change, appears capable of helping in this situation. There have been several OD applications in schools, but no definitive conclusions can be reached. Little hard data on the effects of these trials exist. Also, \"experts\" disagree as to whether the emphasis should be on process, the way an organization generally faces its problems, or on content, the way it operates to achieve particular outcomes. The author argues that certain conditions are necessary for OD to succeed in schools. Both process and content approaches should be applied within a general  system theory orientation. More stress should be placed on obtaining adequate outside information. Special characteristics of the schools, such as goal ambiguity, low interdependence, and low technological investment, must be considered. There must be ways to use OD tools and techniques without total commitment to the method. The fad image must be removed from OD, and hard data on results must be produced. (Author)",

Children are reared in environments that teach three life views--that the objective of life is to work hard, sacrifice the joys of the moment, and indulge in rigorous self-discipline so that one can achieve the highest competence of which one is capable; that a primary means to happiness is to find a secure job that provides adequately for one's subsistence and self-respect; and that life is a struggle and society a jungle. All children, whatever their background, must learn three things if they are to live full and meaningful lives--discipline, the ability to use that which is oneself  effectively; control, the ability to cope with and find one's place within the environments of which one is a part; and meaning, the ability to find satisfaction through one's understanding, to select values and behave in accordance with value systems, and to promote moral concerns that are designed to help make living worthwhile. Three recommendations are offered for the achievement of these goals. (Author/IRT)",

The model was found to have high explanatory power; at the same time, areas badly in need of further research were identified.

Standardized reading, language, and arithmetic test scores; student and teacher background and attitudinal data; and educational characteristics underlying school programs were obtained over a three-year period. Findings showed a lack of either substantially or consistently positive associations between achievement and program-level emphasis on innovation. Relative to the sample of schools participating in the project, students enrolled in programs with a more moderate emphasis on innovation and individualization showed the greatest improvement. Younger students (those in grades 2 and 3) who achieved substantially more than expected during  two consecutive years were exposed to a notably greater amount of class time per day on language arts during the second grade than were the consistent underachievers. The results suggest that educational innovation per se will not necessarily produce dramatic effects on student achievement. Educational quality is not synonymous with innovation. (Author)",

        "description":"A few new topics have been introduced, but curriculum design and instructional practice in the basic disciplines is much the same now as 25 years ago. A main source of change in curriculum and instruction is in instructional materials, but they are largely neglected when discussing curriculum development and instructional strategies. Education is overwhelmingly influenced not by what goes on in the classroom, but by the inputs that are brought to the classroom by children. The first external force that has made a profound difference in the child that teachers deal with is a radical redefinition in family makeup. The second profound external force is the influence of television. It would seem that instructional materials investigations should focus on those areas where external  forces have the greatest impact on classroom practice. Two areas that should receive priority in curriculum research, therefore, are 1) the areas of instructional materials and curriculum design in parenting, and 2) instructional materials that confront the needs for a visual curriculum that develops a sophisticated, analytical user of visual media (particularly television).

A comparison of school board members in poor city districts, middle-class city districts, and suburban districts in the New York area was made to see if local board members had evolved into education advocates with city and state officials. Data were gathered from school board members and state legislators from 12 city and 12 suburban districts in the New York area. Respondents were each asked five questions about communications between school board members and political figures. Analysis of the data showed that school board members in suburban  districts had more frequent contact with legislators than board members from city districts, and that board members in the poorest districts were least likely to engage in advocacy activities.

The guiding theoretical framework is system theory. Data were gathered by compiling the work of advocates of the production model. The data are explained, analyzed, and interpreted in view of their chief assumptions and consequences and in view of the findings of recent research. The real nature of curriculum objectives and a new way of thinking of them is explained. Three propositions demonstrate the basic conceptual structure the speaker has found useful in theory building. The implications of these propositions are outlined. (Author/IRT)",

There are three keys to correcting these problems. The first key is a different relationship between leadership and followership. The second is a deeper sense of commitment gained partly through revitalized upward messages from perceivers rather than senders. The third key is accountability that can generate confidence and  restore faith in the educational process. (Author/IRT)",

Board members have experienced increased harassment in the form of union and taxpayer activism.

In the Central Area, the administration is made up of assistant (area) superintendents, instructional consultants, and principals. Although area superintendents are members of the superintendent's staff and participate in systemwide deliberation, they spend most of their time working directly with the schools. The instructional consultants link with principals, teachers, and area superintendents and can take information up and down the administrative ladder. Total staff involvement at the administrative level takes place with regular meetings between the instructional consultants and the area superintendents, between groups of principals and  the superintendents, and between individual principals and superintendents and consultants. Involvement at the school level is presented in a description of the adoption of a minimum skills program. The program is marked by active flow of information from teachers to consultants and principals and in the other direction. Communication was increased within and between schools as a result of the program. (Author/IRT)",

Stress can be benign and growth-producing or malignant and destructive, depending on three primary factors: 1) the possession of coping behaviors which are effective and for which there is feedback as to the degree of their effectiveness, 2) the predictability of the stressful situation, and 3) the duration or repetition of the stressful circumstances. There are two categories of stress escape devices that serve as effective \"counter irritants\" to teaching. One group of counter irritants consists of activities that make demands or stimulate creative endeavor in a completely different field. A second group of counter irritants consists of activities that  require only participation. An effective prescription for a balanced program of counter irritants to teaching should include systematic exploration of both demanding and relaxing activities in physical, social, intellectual, and emotional areas.

The new system measures how well he achieved the objectives and completed the tasks set by the teacher. The system is stated clearly in both the student handbook and the teacher's handbook. A supplementary report is used to assess student behavior and explain to the parent why the child is not enjoying success. This form is  required for all students who are making inadequate academic progress. In addition, standardized achievement tests are administered each year, and test results are sent home to parents along with detailed instructions on interpreting test results. (Author/JG)",

Contrary to the second misconception, private-sector experience since the enactment of the Wagner Act in 1935 has shown that it is the absence of collective bargaining that brings strikes and disorder. Collective bargaining, mediation, fact-finding, and arbitration have the potential to resolve discontent without a strike. The price of stability is equity.  Deny equity and induce instability. Teachers will go on strike only as a last resort, only if they see no reasonable and logical alternative. Unhappily, there is no national standard governing collective bargaining for public employees, and the consequences of state-by-state regulation are both illogical and inequitable. (Author/JG)",

The negative outcomes have been professional defensiveness and apathy toward systemwide efforts to make the schools more businesslike. Positive outcomes are an understanding of the professional self-discipline required in an organizational setting and a desire to enter into educational collaboration with our constituencies. The case has been made for school board accountability that capitalizes on these two gains. First, the school board is accountable for the selection and evaluation of the superintendent on the individual's demonstrated competencies. Secondly, the school board is accountable for reviewing the superintendent in efforts to collaborate with  external publics on matters of educational and instructional improvements. There are specific behaviors and acts that can be documented and discovered in the search for the school executive and in the periodic review of that individual. (Author/MLF)",

The first state to require that bargaining in the public sector be conducted in the open (fishbowl bargaining) was Florida. Surveys show that a majority of Florida school board members and school superintendents favor fishbowl bargaining. Even 35 percent of the professional negotiators favor open collective bargaining. Teachers' unions are fervently opposed to it. Only a small percentage of the public has actually attended negotiating sessions. Media coverage in large school districts has been good, but it has been sparse in medium to small  districts.

        "description":"One approach by the state of Georgia to ensure equal educational opportunity for all children has been to organize a method whereby several school systems within an identified geographical region may share services they cannot afford to provide individually. By legislative action in 1972, provisions for Cooperative Educational Service Agency (CESA) were established. The state was divided into 16 geographical regions and the administrative personnel in each region were given the option of organizing a CESA agency to serve their educational needs. The CESA concept is to share, across school district lines, services that are designed to improve the effectiveness of the educational programs of member school systems. The organizational process for the Northeast Georgia CESA area is  briefly described to illustrate several additional principles that appear to have applications to any program of change.

The propositions are that conflict should generally be viewed in neutral terms; that conflicts commonly energize higher levels of leadership; that conflict commonly leaves an organization stronger than before; and that the essential strategy for conflict management is the development of an organizational climate capable of making conflict work for the good of the organization. Characteristics of an organizational climate conducive to productive conflict  management include maintenance of an open climate; goal clarification and acceptance; role clarification and acceptance; the existence of problem-solving mechanisms; effective communication; power equalization; capacity for innovation; cohesiveness; and trust.

Losses are described in two categories, those related directly to costs of operating Florida's schools and those derived from disproportionate use of social services by undereducated citizens. In addition to the economic analysis, interviews were conducted with out-of-school youth and with teachers. Data were also examined to determine if an optimum-size  school exists that has a lower rate of school disruption than other sizes. A series of recommendations are offered, tables of data are presented, and an outline of a plan for developing and evaluating an instructional program for the socially maladjusted is included.

Eulau and Karps argue that responsiveness deals with a complex, multidimensional set of transactional relationships that can be analytically divided into four components. A high level of responsiveness in one component can go together with unresponsiveness in another. Prototype empirical indexes for the components of responsiveness are presented to investigate both the general level of school board responsiveness and the relationships between components of responsiveness. Since school boards are fundamentally different from other governmental legislative bodies, a brief consideration of their role in school governance provides background and context  for the indexes of responsiveness. To the four components of responsiveness outlined by Eulau and Karps--policy, service, public goods, and symbolic responsiveness--is added a fifth, responsiveness as public influence on legislators' attitudes and behavior. Four foci are used in examining these components--the content of communication, the source of communication, the source of response, and the content of response. Individual boards are inconsistently responsive across components, components are independent of each other, and operational measures within components are independent of each other. (Author/IRT)",

Results indicated that hyperactivity and noncompliance were reduced to normal limits. Parents' use of behavior modification techniques were equivalent to that of trained child behavior specialists. Data supported the hypothesis that hyperactivity in the preschool child and noncompliance are operationally equivalent terms, and that a treatment program based upon modification of compliance behavior is an effective means for remediating hyperactivity in preschool children.

Participants were administered, as a pretest, selected criterion-referenced tests from the Santa Clara Inventory of Developmental Tasks (Reading) and the BASE (Math) Systems to ascertain individual instructional objectives for each student.

Noted in the conference summary are a Delaware organization  fostering deaf equality, state plans and vocational rehabilitation, and the need for each state to have a state coordinator or vocational rehabilitation for the deaf. Also provided is a distillation of discussions on the following topics: mainstreaming of the deaf, career development of the deaf, programs for the multi-handicapped deaf, education of the parents of deaf persons, mental health services for the deaf, the need for training, and the need for improved state planning. A questionnaire to determine priorities of conference participants in the areas of planning and policy, organization and personnel administration, service delivery system, and program evaluation and research is included. It is reported that the highest priority rating was given to the need to establish detection,  diagnostic, vocational education and placement centers to coordinate efforts and provide orientation to the deaf persons and his/her family.

The author uses an IQ cutoff point of 132 as a measure of giftedness and compares the utility of three criteria of success: employment in a position utilizing his capacities (the criterion of L. Terman's study and the author's), eminence in one's professional position, and achievement of an international and enduring reputation for one's accomplishments. Reported is a study which followed up children identified as precocious in the popular press and showed one extreme failure and many successful or outstandingly successful adults. Testing of Terman's group as adults and a study of the females in his group are also reported to show that Ss  continued to have outstanding intellectual ability and professional success. The author suggests that the use of unrealistic criteria (such as expecting accomplishments of an Einstein or Newton) is responsible for the continuing myth that precocious children grow up to be failures as adults.

Results indicated that over half the hearing imparied Ss obtained their jobs through parents or relatives compared to 12% of the hearing Ss; none of the hearing impaired Ss obtained jobs through school cooperative programs, which were cited by 15% of the hearing Ss.

Teachers of the experimental group participated in a 10-day workshop on ways to incorporate the humane value concept into activities with EMR children. A pretest-posttest control group design was used for the two IQ measures (Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test), and a Posttest-Only Control Group Design was used for the Behavior Rating Scale. Findings indicated that the humane value workshop probably affected teacher planning and content of activities, that the humane value treatment did not affect the I.Q.  scores of the EMR pupils, and that the humane value treatment improved the Ss' behavior.

In the experiential model, Head Start staff (directors, education coordinators, health coordinators, and teachers) spent 2 days in a training program which stressed direct interaction between the trainee and the handicapped child. In the seminar oriented training model Head Start personnel gathered for 2 days of seminars which focused on the sharing of information, problems, and possible solutions. Results of participant evaluations indicated that both models were viable training approaches. Recommendations for future training included establishing objectives based on a  needs assessment of the trainees, encouraging active participation, using the small group format, utilizing a variety of activities, evaluating training effectiveness, and planning followup activities.

The language teacher must first attempt to find a viable description of \"culture\" by reading various books and journals. In order to find information about various cultures, the teacher should use reference tools such as bibliographies, syllabi, handbooks, and informal works of a more popular or anecdotal nature. Many guides are available which present various ways of teaching culture. Cross-cultural analysis is an effective method for introducing the target culture. After completing a study of the culture, the teacher must decide how to present this culture to the student,  what to present and in what sequence. The teacher must be selective as an entire culture cannot be taught even in a four-year course. Audiovisual aids are essential if the students have no access to the target culture. The teacher must realize that culture is an important aspect of language teaching. (CFM)",

All were given a free word association test, the P/S Inventory (Paradigmatic/Syntagmatic Inventory, Dinnan, 1971). The test was first administered individually to each subject in English. Four days later the same P/S Inventory was administered to the subjects in Farsi. The results revealed differences in the paradigmatic thinking patterns in the two identical tests. This study and other  research suggest that when one language is clearly dominant, differences in association behavior will be exhibited.

While bilingual education differs basically from foreign language programs in that it entails the use of two languages for all or part of the curriculum and not simply instruction in the language as such, it does include some very important elements of foreign language instruction. One of the disappointing features of some bilingual education programs in Texas is that people who do not have a strong background in Spanish are making many mistakes and the children are perpetuating these errors. Bilingual teachers must have preparation in language teaching and linguistics, and the teacher preparation program at the University of Texas is attempting to  give teachers this preparation. The expertise that the foreign language field has acquired over the years can be shared effectively with people in bilingual education. Foreign language educators should find out what services they can render the language component. They should be sympathetic and of service to the concept of bilingual education. (CFM)",

        "description":"A major problem in doing linguistic research from tape-recorded material is finding specific tape content for later, detailed analysis of data. A project on use of language in medicine being carried out at the Cornell University Medical College has developed a method of cataloguing taped material that eliminates the need for transcriptions and permits rapid locating of a specific tape segment. The project studies taped conversations between doctors and patients to observe how speakers hear and understand each other in natural conversation and to use findings to teach medical students the uses and functions of language in medicine. Contents of tapes are organized into eight categories: address, or time of utterance; speaker; main conversational division; specific speech act;  lexical content; miscellaneous linguistic and non-linguistic information; attitude displayed by the speaker, and the conceptual category - an abstract interpretation of the subject discussed. Categories are explained here with examples, and an appendix furnishes a transcript of recorded conversation and its corresponding cataloguing sample. (CHK)",

Strategies are proposed for bilingual communities to follow when confronted with mandated bilingual education. The proposed process is not a theoretical model based on studies in community organization, but rather a summary of successful strategies. The report focuses on the structure of the community and other interested parties, on the type of community organization required for effective action, and on the role of the community in setting goals for implementing and monitoring bilingual programs. Specific aspects of the planning of a bilingual program are discussed  such as needs assessment including a survey of school children, the setting of goals, and technical issues such as language type to be used, materials, accurate assessment of language proficiency, and teaching personnel.

Turkish students evaluate the two styles differently, and attribute attitudes and values to writers on the basis of their linguistic style. To define more precisely the means by which Turkish university students attribute social and political attitudes and values to individuals on the basis of the style of Turkish they use, a study was carried out in which matched pairs of paragraphs, differing only in use of traditional or reformed lexicon, were presented to students for rating of their putative authors on attitude and  semantic differential scales. Results indicate that pairs of old and new terms cannot be considered synonymous in modern Turkish. Choice of terminology communicates important messages about the political and social ideology of the speaker; and these messages will be interpreted differently on the basis of the political and social ideology of the listener.

        "description":"Since Berlin and Kay's proposal in 1969 of two universals concerning the meanings of basic color words, three kinds of information have become available to help in understanding the encoding sequence, that is, the temporal order in which the basic color categories are accorded lexical status. McDaniel (1972, 1974, forthcoming) demonstrates that the encoding sequence is best understood not as the successive encoding of foci, but as the successive differentiation of color categories. Field studies of the color systems of a Jivaroan, a Mayan, a Papuan, an Eskimo and three Austronesian languages have been critical in understanding the encoding sequence. Fuzzy set theory as developed by Zadeh (1965, 1971) provides a formalism for expressing the understanding of basic color categories.  The present study brings together work by McDaniel, the field studies, and fuzzy set formalism. If a color category is viewed as a fuzzy set, vacillation between focus and boundary is avoided when discussing universal color categories, their interrelations, and the sequence in which they are encoded in evolving color lexicons.

        "description":"This paper is an attempt to summarize as explicitly as possible certain empirical findings of classical biosystematics and modern semantic ethnography which may be considered to represent formal universals of human mental structure. The paper offers a formal treatment of the subject of taxonomy, and an application of the formalism to several problem areas in the fields of semantics, ethnography, and cognition. The structure formalized here, essentially following the notions of Linnaean biology, is a hierarchy of inclusion relations among a collection of named sets of objects. Section one introduces the formal definition of taxonomic structure and sketches the major outlines of this kind of mathematical object. Section two introduces some theoretical problems relating to taxonomy  in ethnographic and semantic contexts and show how this forumlation applies to, and clarifies, these problems. In particular, the notion of semantic contrast in the context of taxonomy is examined in some detail. Section three introduces the notion of taxonomy and examines the nature of the mapping which governs the realization of conceptual taxa by lexical items. (Author/AM)",

Considering the census data alone, a matrilineal principle or bias appears to dominate the selection of residence locations. But this apparent matrilineal tendency is an artifact of the rule which Tagtabon Samal use in making decisions about residence, a rule which makes no reference to any matrilineal principle. Nine assessments (decision criteria) for residence rules are given. In the selection of a mode of residence a person's age category is of primary  importance. In terms of residence locale, the most important phenomenon by far is the preference ranking of kin classes, operative in residence decisions throughout a person's life. (CFM)",

Students enrolled in bilingual projects were contrasted with students not enrolled in such projects. Standardized achievement tests were used to measure performance in language arts and mathematics computation in both languages. Information was  collected on student and teacher characteristics and attitudes. Results from teacher questionnaires indicate that few of the students participating in the projects could be classified as having limited English-speaking ability. Title VII Hispanic students, including Spanish monolinguals, performed better in mathematics computation than could have been expected in the absence of a program. Results on English reading and vocabulary tests are mixed but generally less favorable for Title VII students, and observed achievement gains in Spanish language arts by Title VII Hispanic students are said to not be solely attributable to participation in bilingual education programs.

        "description":"Criticism has been directed at a growing body of literature broadly referred to as ethnoscience, ethnosemantics, folk science, ethnographic semantics, and cognitive anthropology. Criticisms concern methodological and analytic aspects of ethnoscientific procedure, and the directions of ethnosemantic research from a theoretical point of view. The present paper seeks to answer these criticisms and to evaluate the theoretical strengths of ethnosemantics. The focus of ethnosemantic work shifted in the early and mid-sixties, partially as a reflection of renewed interest in theoretical linguistics in language universals, and largely due to the growing number of ethnographies being completed. A number of parallels were discovered in formal classificatory structures, the most striking  ones being in the area of lexicon. Detailed descriptions of particular lexical domains led to general semantic structures ignored by the methods of traditional cultural anthropology. One example of empirical research suggestive of the universalist-evolutionary orientation in ethnographic semantics is described, namely Berlin and Kay's work on color classification. (CLK)",

The investigation is based on a conversation recorded in an institution for Mexican immigrants by a linguist, a native American of Mexican ancestry, and program advisor of the institution. His interlocutor was a community counselor employed in the program. Two types of information were utilized. Turns containing a code switch were first examined as to their place within the structure of the total conversation. Then the switched phrase was substituted with a phrase from the other language to determine what the code switch contributed to the meaning of the whole passage. These examples of bilingual  communication indicate that language usage is closely tied to the position of Chicanos as a minority group within the English-speaking majority. Selection of alternate forms is related to a variety of social factors such as ethnic identity, age and sex, and degree of solidarity or confidentiality. (CFM)",

Part I presents general materials on the intersection of foreign language instruction and career preparation. Materials in Part II provide specific examples of programs or courses that are designed to address the issue of preparation of students of foreign languages for employment, especially in areas other than teaching. Part III presents materials describing occupations that call for skills in foreign languages. Part IV contains references to courses designed to teach foreign language skills related to specific occupations. While many of the documents may be of interest to broad audiences, Parts I and II may be of particular interest to teachers, counselors, administrators, or  program planners; Parts III and IV are of special interest to students. Within the context of this document, the term \"foreign language\" refers to languages other than English that are or might be taught in U.S. or Canadian schools and universities. Foreign language competence refers to the ability to speak, understand, read, and write with a considerable degree of proficiency in a language other than English. (Author/CLK)",

That publication was released in July, 1976 as a guide to administrators and program coordinators in the selection of instruments for assessing students' language dominance and oral proficiency (-ies). In rating each instrument, four criteria were explored: measurement validity, examinee appropriateness, technical excellence, and administrative usability. Several questions within each criteria were examined in determining the overall criteria rating. A descriptive review of the Mat-Sea-Cal is presented and the reviewer's rating is summarized in a chart. This critique  scrutinizes the evaluations rendered to the Mat-Sea-Cal by the reviewers in each of the four criteria. Discussion is offered on several points. Differences in perception between the author and the N.W.R.E.L. reviewers on the evaluation of the Mat-Sea-Cal are enumerated. (Author/CFM)",

By providing only statistical averages on a national sample, the report does a serious disservice by failing to distinguish between the effects of good programs and weak programs, and treats bilingual education as funded under Title VII of ESEA as an undifferentiated uniform whole. The report is subject to criticism on several grounds: (1) weakness of Pre-and post-test design over a five-month period; (2) inappropriate use of gain scores to assess effects of experimental treatment; (3) unreliability of teacher assessment of students' language  ability; (4) inappropriate use of the California Test of Basic Skills to assess English reading ability with limited English and monolingual Spanish speakers, possibly invalidating the results; (5) lack of adequate teacher training and curriculum during the first five years of Title VII funding; (6) distortion of information, defeating the intended purpose of the report, i.e., to provide information for policy makers; and (7) aggregation of students who have received a variety of educational treatments funded by Title VII and who demonstrate varying language ability.

        "description":"The purpose of this investigation was to design and test an information-eliciting question instrument in order to determine whether the structures in the verbal responses of young Mexican-American, bilingual children entering school would reveal the covert mental operations, concepts and oral language skills elicited. The basic objective was to make an in-depth study of such problems as the relationship between language and thought (how the bilingual child uses his thought as content for his language and how he uses his language to structure his thought), language interference (mixing and code-switching), and fluency. The study was therefore limited to 6 Ss (3 kindergartners and 3 first graders, including 3 boys and 3 girls, ages 6-7). The instrument consisted of 112 (56  parallel) questions in both English and Spanish. The results suggest that the instrument: (1) accounts for the language and thought components it elicited; (2) offers a different approach to the study of bilingualism in children entering school; and (3) reveals the match or mismatch between the language and thought processes already acquired by the Ss and those required for academic success with school-related tasks. In addition, the results dispel the view that a young bilingual child's initial ability or inability to experience academic success in school is primarily a language problem. (Author/CFM)",

This study attempts to focus on the consequences arising from collective bargaining in higher education. The Stanford Project on Academic Governance was begun in 1971 as an effort to study the impact of collective bargaining on governance and decisionmaking in higher education. The two phases of the project studied 240 institutions regarding general academic governance and over 300 institutions regarding collective bargaining in particular. In addition, seven intensive case studies were conducted in institutions that were quite diverse in their characteristics and experiences. The findings of this study are examined as they relate to administrators. The discussion is in two parts: looking at the effect  collective bargaining has on components within administrative ranks; and assessing the way management processes change when collective bargaining occurs. Specific areas discussed are the shifting power relationships; the thrust toward administrative power; the changing character of campus administrators; the replacement of generalists by specialists; the sharing of information with faculty representatives; the democratization of influence; and administration concern for long-range consequences.

In the second chapter, the logistics of the technical aspects of the process, and changes therein, are examined, especially where such changes have facilitated applications by heretofore underrepresented groups. The third chapter summarizes studies on the composition and functions of admissions committees. Selection factors, both cognitive and noncognitive, their measurement and their predictive validity are the subject of  the fourth chapter. Included is a discussion of the trend toward predicting physician performance rather than solely medical school performance. The fifth chapter reviews the research devoted to the weighting, both implicit and explicit, of selection factors. Changes in the intellectual academic, personality (especially as tested by the Myers/Briggs Type Indicator), and demographic characteristics of accepted and rejected applicants are detailed in the final chapter.

The policies proposed are designed to meet these challenges. Specific objectives and recommendations are given concerning the areas of the changing setting for higher education; the resources available; independent nonprofit institutions; the elimination of barriers to access; developing quality; lifelong learning as a change and challenge; the future of graduate education; planning for health personnel education; and financing higher  education. Areas of future concern are discussed briefly. (JMF)",

It has a revitalized National Universities Commission (NUC), an ambitious new educational policy, and six old and seven new universities. The challenge is to find effective means of Nigerian access to the appropriate and interested U.S. universities out of the baffling total and to foster linkages in pursuit of mutually held objectives. That was the task undertaken by the five-man team that visited Nigeria in 1977, at the request of the NUC, organized by the American Council on Education, and cosponsored by the NUC and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Recommendations are made for maximizing U.S. university assistance to Nigerian university  education in three areas: (1) overseas staff recruitment; (2) in-country staff development; and (3) interuniversity linkages for developmental purposes.

The Hill Foundation's effectiveness could probably be improved through longer (three to five year) commitments of larger sums of money ($10,000 to $100,000) to a limited number of colleges that: (1) would be willing to risk effort on important productivity research but would be unable to do so without external funds and supportive consultation; (2) would be devoted to rigorous project design and evaluation; and (3) would agree to the publication and dissemination of results. If, in  addition, the Foundation would enter into partnerships with colleges that recognize that the productivity question in higher education is not one of how to reduce the time and money spent per student but rather how to increase the value of student-embodied competencies to create and produce over a lifetime, the foundation might well bring about the major program and faculty changes that will assure a college's survival during the last quarter of this century.

Values and sanctions that have previously motivated unquestioned acceptance of the legitimacy of higher education are, like many other values and sanctions in our society, presently undergoing severe scrutiny and modification. Consider those former students who bought the sanctions of schooling with all the requisite obedience to authority, competition for grades and recognition, perseverance at tedious and often meaningless school work: How will these educated, analytical people respond as taxpayers to paying the salaries of professors whom they most remember as aloof and concerned primarily with tenure, research, and  publications? It may become difficult for these taxpayers to willingly support an elitist subculture. It may well be that we are in an evolutionary process that will yield a conception of life-long learning as a social good. Perhaps as we witness the demise of education in its present forms we are also seeing the process by which our culture will become democratic. (Author/MSE)",

Based on these factors, this study considers the management of the enrollment decline and the priority for the public sector. A delivery system is proposed that is based on a performance formula applied to a system of public higher education in which students share in the expense of actual instruction and all other expenses associated with delivering  instruction. A method for determining the percentage of state subsidy to the student is described, and three performance strategies for declining enrollment are detailed. It is concluded that the state subsidy must take account of overall state concerns and the desire to gather funding from federal student aid programs. State practices in student aid can be regularly adjusted according to changes in the federal government. (LBH)",

        "description":"The 1976 High School Eligibility Study is the fourth in a continuing series of studies performed to provide data to the University of California and the California State University and Colleges so they can recalibrate their admission standards for first-time freshman students under the guidelines established under the Master Plan for Higher Education (1960). The Master Plan urges the University of California to draw its first-time freshman class from the top 12 1/2 percent of the high school graduating class; the state university and colleges from the top one-third. A random sample of 1974-75 public high school graduate transcripts was evaluated in terms of each segment's admission standards. The findings indicate that 14.84 percent of the graduates would have been eligible for  admission as first-time freshman students at UC and 34.96 percent at the state university and colleges. These figures are generally consistent with the findings of the 1961 and 1966 studies and indicate that the gradually rising grade point averages in California's public high schools in recent years have not resulted in a &quot;ballooning&quot; of segmental eligibility rates. Recommendations are offered for adjusting segmental admission requirements, for developing the 1981 High School Eligibility Study, and for reviewing the 1960 Master Plan. (LBH)",

Major problem aas are identified as: technical problems of planning, political constraints, sociocultural constraints, administrative obstacles, and substructure constraints. The role of the university is discussed in relation to the following: (1) coordination of higher education planning with national economic planning; (2) survey of university resources available for development planning purposes; (3) extent of university involvement currently prevailing in the formulation and implementation of development plans; and (4) types of contribution the university could make towards development  planning. Problems preventing a closer cooperation between the universities and the government are identified, and recommendations for alleviating those problems are discussed. (LBH)",

The historical background of the council is reviewed along with its membership, committees, and institutions for which it is responsible. Its role in financing the universities is discussed in terms of government grants to the institutions. Data are provided on annual development estimates, annual recurrent estimates, annual estimates for equipment, and unit cost and university financing. It is concluded that if the council is to be effective as an intermediary between the government and the universities, it must be independent of both and must maintain its advisory role. This report also includes the study of the council by R. C.  Griffiths, the director of United Kingdom Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas. That study deals with: the council's role; cost analysis; planning student enrollment; capital planning; norms; capacity of academic buildings; control of individual buildings; government-universities-council relationships; council membership; role of chairman; delegation of powers; and non-university functions and committee structure of the council.

Complex as the industrial compensation patterns are, they are matched and may be surpassed in complexity by those of the comprehensive university. The difficulty in resolving compensation questions arises from a failure (of the \"funding agencies\" or the institution) to agree on the model of employment being used to govern the circumstances.

The recent history of the commercialization of university-developed, general-purpose statistical software is examined, and the developing opportunities in the computer courseware area are looked at. By examining one university's policy concerning university-sponsored educational material and contrasting this approach with a computer manufacturer's arrangement with its  employees, the need for broader college and university managerial attention is pointed out. A related issue that is discussed is that the potential property loss associated with use of proprietary software packages may justify the formality with which certain software producers approach their university clients. Finally, one commercial computer manufacturer's contractual approach to the royalty problem is presented. Sample agreements and releases are appended. (Author/MSE)",

Examples are cited of European experiences in which there has been obvious industrial motivation for research performed by the universities. The author notes that there are no difficulties with the level of government support going to universities for basic research if efforts at technology transfer are made, but that there is growing concern in Congress to better account for research funding. Such concern, he suggests, evidences a misunderstanding that universities can generally solve public problems without the further collaborative aid of industry, or at least have the means to determine whether the practical results of their research have been adopted  and applied by industry. Several barriers to effective cooperative efforts are described. The conclusion is drawn that in order to afford the correct property exchange from the fundamental innovator to the industrial developer at the right time, the innovating university must identify the establish rights in more intellectual property than it will exchange through the timely management of intellectual property policies. Investigators must be taught to think ahead, since the patent laws are written against those who delay protection. (Author/LBH)",

The initial decline in students' evaluations, as course enrollment increased, was not considered large enough to warrant separate norm groups based on the first experiment.

It is concluded that women have made progress in access to postsecondary  education, although they are more likely than men to be part-time students. At the advanced degree levels, they have historically received fewer degrees and rank correspondingly lower among faculty and other educational staff. More women are needed on faculties, particularly at the upper levels, and an expanded curriculum is needed in which sex role stereotyping is no longer an issue. (LBH)",

In a multiple regression analysis, 61 percent of the variation in salaries of 922 faculty was explained by professorial rank; 16 percent by other rational equity factors; 2 percent by college parity; 1 percent by college affiliation; and 1 percent by nonrational equity factors. Neither college affiliation nor college or  department parity was as important as the internal equity factors, with the rational equity factors as the most important. In total, 81 percent of the variance in salaries was accounted for by the parity-equity model. The issues in using this model to evaluate salary policies are discussed. The use of the model is recommended for studying the year-to-year changes in salaries policies but its use to determine possible discrimination in salary for an individual faculty member is problematic.

Central tendency and correlational statistics were used to analyze the independent variables using college grade-point average as the dependent variable. Data were analyzed separately for freshmen and transfer students as well as for males and females. Results include the following: older students exhibit higher relative academic achievement; there are differences in pattern and degree of predictability of these students; and these differences appear to be sex related. These findings show the need to evaluate predictive criteria for the increasing numbers of mature students. (Author/LBH)",

These students are attempting to meet obligations to family, society, and self, while engaging in educational pursuits often experienced by others before assuming family or income-producing obligations; therefore they exhibit a unique set of concerns necessitating learnings within a short period of time in order to succeed. A secondary purpose in the study was to attempt to stratify the identified concerns and to describe necessary foundational and merger learnings. Questionnaires were administered to 172 junior and senior college female students ranging in age from 23 to 54 years. Responses were tabulated regarding their concerns about  school in general, about professors, about peers, and about family or home. These concerns were then translated into developmental tasks, and it is shown that the majority of women 23 years of age and older must acquire psychological postures of goal-orientation, independence, and objectivity after their arrival on the university campus. The degree to which they achieve these developmental tasks will strongly influence success or failure in the university community. (LBH)",

The practice of setting aside specific places for less-prepared applicants (generally those who had suffered from discrimination and had received an inferior education) has resulted in denying access to other applicants with sufficient qualifications. The court cases of Marco Defunis and Allan Bakke, which challenge these admission policies and techniques, are discussed in this paper. Other cases are cited that are concerned with financial aid as well as admission criteria. The significance of litigation involving charges of  discrimination and the attention given to the concept of due process is assessed. The ultimate effect cannot be known, but there will develop a greater concern for detailed records on the part of selection committees. The difficulty in maintaining a balance between the rights guaranteed to both minority and nonminority Americans is emphasized. (LBH)",

Washington ranks 29th in combined state and local appropriations per equivalent full-time student and 6th in per capita state and local appropriations for higher education. The major reason for the difference in these rankings is the percentage of students enrolled in public higher education. At the same time, it ranks 40th in the percentage of private enrollment to total student population.  Washington also ranks above the national average in tax appropriations for higher education as a percentage of tax revenue collected, and in appropriations per $1,000 of personal income. These patterns of heavy demand and commitment to public higher education are similar to that of most Western states. (Author)",

        "description":"The relationship between advancement in academic rank and various kinds of professional associations was empirically explored. Ten percent of the active research faculty at a large university were surveyed. Using statistical analyses, academic rank was correlated separately with two types of associations: five internal affiliations one might hold in addition to a regular faculty appointment, and five external professional associations. Three career stages were established on the basis of age (under 40 years, 40 to 54 years, and over) and data reported under these headings. Findings showed that the effects of extra-faculty associations differ substantially among the three career groups. In the early career stage, internal attachments were more closely associated with rank, but  diversions from the discipline line slowed promotion. In the middle years, three distinct career lines appeared (teacher-scholar, academic administrator, and research specialist) and each option related favorably to promotion. At this stage, national participation in panels, juries, or reading committees was the strongest factor for advancement. In the later career years, outside associations carried little weight and were largely negative. Internal associations were significant at this stage, but unconventional associations and joint faculty relationships had sidetracking effects. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"Four sections of introductory psychology were involved in a study of aptitude-treatment interactions. Two sections were taught with a high-structure curriculum, and two with a low-structure curriculum. Students' preference for structure was measured with the Inventory of Beliefs (IOB). During eight weeks of instruction, observers recorded students' verbal behavior in class, and selected students were questioned outside class about their thoughts in class, using the method of stimulated recall. Two achievement tests and one course satisfaction scale were administered during the experimental period. Correlations were tested by comparing regression slopes of dependent variables on IOB scores in the high- and low-structure sections. No correlations were found with achievement,  satisfaction, verbal behavior, or thoughts in class. However, when the data were subjected to a two-factor analysis of variance (structure X IOB), a significant correlation did appear. This post-hoc analysis suggests that there may have been a significant relationship that was masked by imprecision in the regression analysis. (Author/MSE)",

The students consistently reported as benefits saving money, getting a job or going to graduate school earlier, using the fourth year to do something different (travel or work experience), and avoiding unnecessary courses.

        "description":"In the context of recent reappraisals of women's education and discussions about what it should be, and as part of the effort to clarify the purposes of collegiate education that may be unique to women, the students and faculty at Smith College, the largest undergraduate college for women, were surveyed. The questionnaire used was designed to explore the appeal to various rationales for the existence of separate women's colleges. The results of the survey are presented in summary tables, and the discussion centers on the most popular purpose for this population: &quot;to encourage women to create their own self-identities.&quot; The specific issue addressed is whether or not this purpose requires abandonment of the traditional aims of liberal arts education. The conclusion of the authors  is that it does not, although it calls for a redefinition of what constitutes the highest levels of development for women. Several other statements of purpose such as preparation for careers and encouraging achievement in women are discussed briefly. A compensatory model for women's education is questioned on both ethical and logical grounds. (Author/MSE)",

Each of the participating schools in the National Project III uses some form of teacher evaluation by students, and from these collective experiences it is possible to be explicit about the issues and problems generated by such arrangements.

The idea of professional development generates responses along a continuum. At one end there is a desire among faculty members to reaffirm their professional focus and to maintain, strengthen, and clarify their disciplinary identification. Traditional, self-generated scholarly renewal is in many instances the most appropriate form of professional development. At the other end of the continuum is a desire of teachers to change their primary professional focus from a specific discipline to the educational enterprise as a  whole--for example, to consider oneself as a teacher of physics rather than a physicist who teaches. Ideas and interests along the continuum are reflected in the wide range of professional development programs currently underway. Some examples are given of programs undertaken by National Project III Fund Associates. (Author/MSE)",

Results suggest  that the UWW students are not significantly different from the average New College entering freshman in political/social background or intellectual characteristics.

Survival is defined as the percentage of students in an entering class who return for a second or subsequent years' enrollment at the university. The results showed that black students in this group returned for their second year at a significantly higher rate than did white students. The margin of difference between black and white survival rates actually increased the longer the students were enrolled. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The idea of public library film circuits was first proposed by the Carnegie Corporation in 1947. In 1948, one of two three-year grants was given to the Missouri State Library for the development of a statewide film circuit. Film packages of four to nine films were circulated among eleven libraries. Early conflicts with the University of Missouri's film distribution system and problems with overspent grant funds were overcome. Policies were created and film packages were tailored to audiences. The project was a success at the grant's expiration in 1951. With growing enthusiasm (32 participating libraries) and state funding, the project continued as the Missouri Libraries Film Cooperative. In 1954, participating libraries took over funding the Cooperative, and by 1966, the number  of films grew to 955. Serious problems with film maintenance threatened the Cooperative until 1966, when state funds were available. Now (1975), the total collection exceeds 3,800 films. Member librarians still pay, but now according to assessed valuation of the library and the population served. Film utilization, still considered a problem, is being overcome with workshops for members. An edited interview with the former director of the Missouri State Film Demonstration Project (1948-50) provides a personal view of early film circulation in Missouri. (DAG)",

King Library reference department focused on organization of role activities, their evaluation by reference staff, and patron satisfaction. Observation, interview, and questionnaire techniques were employed to (1) obtain staff job history and academic training; (2) inventory activities from which a list of 93 role activities was compiled; (3) determine on a seven point scale using semantic differential staff's perceptions of activities with respect to importance, interest, complexity, and confidence in performance ability; and (4) determine patron satisfaction and consensus between staff and patrons regarding encounters. Patron service, instruction, and skill maintenance were seen by staff as highly important; the latter two were  considered most interesting. Confidence in performance ability varied little between activities. Clerical maintenance was viewed as least complex, and skill maintenance and instruction as most complex: staff were more interested in complex activities. According to patrons, librarians determined their needs accurately in 80 percent of the encounters and in 87 percent provided the right amount of information. The study concluded that role analysis provides insights into effective reference service factors and the importance of the librarian as teacher rather than as information source. The appendices include forms for all interviews and questionnaires. (KP)",

Training is in the areas of computer programming, data base access and on-line searching, and the use of packaged programs for data reduction and analysis. Access to several computers and data base services is a feature of the program. The format is detailed for those courses which employ computers. On-line training, with its problems and  possibilities, is discussed. Statistical analysis is a facet of four courses.

Results of the survey showed that: (1) the Library Director is seen as the primary motivating force in the establishment of search services; (2) in some cases, the choice of a vendor was dictated by the fact that the vendor had a unique data base in an area appropriate to the interests of library users; (3) there are mixed views as to whether the user or an intermediary should  access the IR systems; (4) the training programs offered by SDC and Lockheed were often not adequate; (5) the institutions readily accepted the concept of charging for on-line services, and (6) different operations of the library, such as document delivery and the increase of copying fiche materials, were affected by the use of on-line services. Recommendations were made that more attention be given to cost/ benefit analysis for this service. (Author/AP)",

The study was conducted in three phases: (1) revision of original procedures manual; (2) measurement implementation in 25 libraries with total expenditures greater than 100,000 dollars; and (3) implementation in 16 libraries with expenditures of 100,000 dollars or less. Materials availability and usage, facility and equipment usage, and staff availability data were collected. Performance results of different measures showed interlibrary loan circulation, and facility availability and usage need further definition. Title availability, in-library  circulation, staff assistance patterns, and user characteristics provided much information for decision making. The study concluded that data collection and tabulation can be performed successfully by librarians in public libraries of any size. The New Jersey State Library were to: (1) conduct further research and analyze data for norms; (2) require inclusion of measures in library annual reports; and (3) support continuing education in using the method.

Two hundred and fifty superintendants from 310 randomly-selected school districts with over 6,000 enrolled pupils responded to a postal card questionnaire. Data was also collected on size of district enrollment and current usage of in-class instructional television. Results showed that regardless of school district size, most school superintendents do not plan to use ITFS in the near future because funds are not available or because present in-class television systems are satisfactory. Among the minority of superintendents who will operationalize ITFS, most plan to do so within the next  year. (Author/KP)",

Collaterally, the study seeks to determine whether some spectrum space now allocated to commercial UHF broadcasting will continue to lie idle and may be subject to reallocation to competing services. Taking 1974 as a base year, the study examines relationships among the existing stations and such variables as the number of television households, the growth of cable television, and the competition from overlapping television markets. It projects the number of stations along various paths into the future depending upon  certain assumptions, including new services such as pay television. It concludes that the number of UHF commercial broadcasting stations will continue to rise between now and 1990. However, except for a few scattered markets, existing spectrum assignments appear adequate to accommodate this growth. The report is supplemented by a series of appendices, one of which is a model of the determination of the number of viable UHF television stattions. (WBC)",

It also discusses allocation of citizen resources among the various avenues of participation. Chapter III focuses on two methods of participation which have gained popularity: petitions to deny and citizen settlements. These two methods have resulted in policy problems which are analyzed in Chapter IV. Chapter IV also critizes some  commission policies and makes recommendations for additional or modified procedures.

The current system is capable of carrying on a dialogue about the factors influencing rainfall by presenting different cases to the student, asking for predictions, probing for relevant factors, entrapping the student when he has not identified all necessary factors, and presenting counterexamples. This system is incomplete because it lacks a goal structure to guide the tutorial sessions. The report outlines a more complete theory of the goal structure of Socratic tutors based on analysis of human tutorial dialogues. The main goals are to refine the student's causal model and predictive abilities. Sub-goals include the diagnosis  of deficiencies in the student's knowledge and the correction of these deficiencies.

A dominant theme is the role which finances play in the decision making process, and major sources of funding for national public television are described. The general situation of local public television is examined in terms of the limitations imposed by budget, the programing available from PBS, and the preferences and attitudes of station managers. The role of the board of directors and the relationship between local stations and the  community are considered. In terms of school programing, the report indicates the impact of programs produced by the Children's Television Workshop, lists other frequently aired children's programs, and describes the educational programing of different types of local stations. It notes the limitations of open circuit television for Instructional Television (ITV), and the possible effect of technological development on the type of ITV service which can be offered. (WBC)",

        "description":"The paper assesses the degree of understanding about the free enterprise system gained by participants in a one-month summer inservice teacher training institute. Developed in response to a 1973 Texas House Bill which mandated the inclusion of free enterprise education in the secondary curriculum, the institute suggests major topics, concepts, and behavioral objectives for use by teachers of economics. All 38 participants in the 1977 American Economy Institute at Texas A & M University took a 105-item test instrument as a pretest at the beginning of the program and again as a posttest at the conclusion of the program. Teacher's test results indicate that there was a significant gain in participant understanding of all areas of free enterprise except alternative economic systems.  The conclusion is that the American Economic Institute workshop succeeded in transmitting content associated with objectives and major topic areas related to the teaching of free enterprise. During a projected second phase of the investigation, a shorter version of the test will be administered to students taught by workshop participants. Presented in the appendix are a copy of the 105-item Free Enterprise Understanding test with answer key, and the shorter 50-item version of the test for use with secondary school students.

Data were collected from 4000 students representing elementary schools with traditional or experimental learning environments. The experimental environments allowed parents and students to choose among multiple program options. The Self Social Constructs Test (SSCT) was used to evaluate six psycho-social dimensions of students: self-esteem, social distance from others in the school environment, scope of peer attachment, social interest, perceived inclusion, and perceived individuation. The SSCT employed spatial symbols (circles and lines) to represent self and social situations. By selecting and/or arranging symbols,  students provided spatial maps interpretable for perceived relationships between themselves and others such as peers, parents, and teachers. Analyses of variance employing school type, grade, ethnicity, and sex as independent factors supported the following conclusions. Students in the multiple-option system perceived themselves as closer to their teachers, more attached to peers, and more included in the domain of social influence. They also retained a stronger sense of individuality. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"In this monograph research results of studies on the teaching of basic skills in elementary schools is synthesized with emphasis on the practical implications for actual practice in the classroom. Development of skills in reading and mathematics in the early grades is the focus. Four major factors in basic instruction are discussed. The importance of opportunity for study and time allowances for concentration on each subject is one of these factors. Motivation of students, positive reinforcement, and classroom atmosphere are considered important forces in the learning process. Organization and sequencing of instruction and planning of curriculum are also major factors discussed. Interaction between teacher and students and individual characteristics of all classroom participants  is the fourth primary area covered. Results of research in each of the above categories (opportunity, motivators, structure, and instructional events) are outlined and analyzed. Three tables that might be used in program analysis or selection are appended. One is taxonomy of reading comprehension, one lists bases for evaluation of readers and related materials, and the third analyzes 13 reading programs in terms of selected variables. A report of the working group on goals for basic mathematical skills and learning is also appended. A bibliography of reading materials on research in basic skills is included. (JD)",

        "description":"This report presents a model for single school staff development projects or programs within a large urban-suburban central system. Characteristics of such a system are identified as: rapid changes in the nature of the student population; active community interest; active teacher participation; the use of annual school plans and school board goals as planning tools for implementing development; a built-in staff development vehicle in each system-based program; and the need to distinguish between goals and shrinking financial resources for supporting inservice activities. In addition to examining traditional inservice activities at a single school site, this report and the models proposed emphasize a concept of continuing staff development. The report is divided into three  components. The first presents an analysis of a central system's organization and resources in terms of its impact on single school staff development programs and the impact of single school programs on the system level. The second section discusses the role of the principal, the decision-making process at different levels, teacher incentives, collaboration with agencies outside of the school, and inservice problems. In the third section, two hypothetical models are offered for initiating preservice and inservice projects at a single school site. The elementary model is based on an open-concept school organization characterized by active teacher involvement in a vertical and horizontal committee structure for staff and curriculum development purposes. The secondary model suggests ways to  teach the four basic academic skills of reading, writing, computation, and study across discipline lines. (JD)",

This paper reports a successful attempt to apply the periodic procedure to an important psychological measurement problem, the measurement of aptitude test item difficulties. The difficulties of items on a subtest of the Scholastic Aptitude Test were measured with both the periodic procedure and with an item characteristic curve theory procedure. The principal finding was a close agreement between the two methods. This close agreement was particularly striking because different samples (from the same test administration) were used by the two methods. The statistical development of the periodic procedure is  presented along with an example of its use. (Author/JKS)",

According to the author, in order to meet the criteria for effective feedback, schools and colleges must undergo several fundamental attitude changes. He proposes the following: (1) that only criterion-based, nonjudgmental feedback and individualized reporting methods which reinforce each child's self-image be used in grades K-8; (2) that each high school decide upon its own criteria for student placement in courses; (3) that clear, precise criteria for a high school diploma, based on demonstrated knowledge and skill mastery, be established; and (4) that each college and  university should develop its entrance requirements based on a student's demonstrated ability to read, write, and analyze at a specified level determined by each college's faculty.

        "description":"Debate on criteria for assessing sex fairness in occupational interest inventories has centered on four issues: (1) whether interpretational material should stress the prospect of social change or the reality of present occupational segregation by sex; (2) the appropriate form for reporting scores (raw, pooled sex norms, or separate sex norms); (3) the feasibility of developing measures which are reliable, valid and have low or no correlations with gender in item-level preferences; and (4) whether the criterion of validity should be prediction or exploration, and involve hit rates which are weighted or unweighted for current occupational frequencies. Recent developments indicate that valid, reliable measures which are uncorrelated with gender can be developed, if the criterion is  exploration of compatible occupations and hit rates are considered independently for each major category. Debate on the criteria of sex fairness may be shifting from the technical aspects of measure construction and validation to the personal judgments about the social utility of restricting occupational exploration to conform to current distributions by gender versus the social utility of encouraging exploration of non-traditional careers.

        "description":"The Discrepancy Evaluation Model (DEM), developed in 1966 by Malcolm Provus, provides information for program assessment and program improvement. Under the DEM, evaluation is defined as the comparison of an actual performance to a desired standard. The DEM embodies five stages of evaluation based upon a program's natural development: program design, installation, process, product, and cost benefit analysis. The evaluation information collected by the DEM facilitates rational decision making by career planning and placement counselors. These decisions can be divided into three classes: decisions related to program design or analysis, decisions concerning the achievement of both intermediate and final goals, and decisions about the program in operation. As an example, the DEM is  applied to a university career planning program. This particular program assists students in determining their interests and goals, implementing career and postgraduate decisions. (Author/MV)",

A researcher should employ the statistical models most capable of answering the research question. If the true research question is concerned with predicting a variety of dependent variables simultaneously, then no univariate model is capable of reflecting that research question. If a univariate technique is used in such cases, a Type VI error is being committed, i.e., there is an inconsistency between the research question and the question as reflected by the statistical model. Several multivariate statistical procedures are outlined; these include canonical correlations, discriminative analysis, path analysis,  component analysis, analysis of covariance, multiple regression analysis, and Q factor analysis.

These new approaches often emphasize individualized learning; each student's progress is individually monitored by comparison with clear statements of what students are expected to learn. The careful monitoring of individual student progress required in such a performance based system has created the need for a testing technology which differs in many respects from typical practice. These guidelines are intended to help teachers develop testing skills which meet the demands of a competency based approach to instruction. This guide includes information on fundamental concepts in testing,  construction of classroom tests and measurement of attitudes.

This report is a longitudinal impact study of enrollees from their selection in June, 1971, to a point after high school graduation in June, 1973. The analysis indicates that VEPS achieved significant success in attaining its objectives. Outcome data for the VEPS-I completers was compared to similar data for a control group of NYC youth. T-score tests on change in grade point average and school attendance over the 1970-71 to  1972-73 school years reveal statistically significant improvement. No difference could be observed in comparing graduation/dropout rates for the two groups, although the VEPS-I group could have been expected to have a higher school dropout rate. VEPS-I youth achieved a statistically significant higher employment rate upon graduation compared to the control group. (Author)",

VEPS was designed as a training and vocational exploration program for in-school Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) enrollees who were probable dropouts. The main departure from the regular NYC program was that VEPS enrollees were placed at private sector work stations and received intensive counseling. NYC programs paid one-half of enrollee wages. Information was obtained on 716 enrollees in eleven cities which were intensively monitored. Ninety and one-tenths percent of the enrollees remained in school or graduated; 53.9% completed the full year program. Academic records for enrollees who  completed the program indicate that 62.0% improved their grade point average from the previous year. Forty-eight and eight-tenths percent of the enrollees missed fewer school days during VEPS-II than the previous year. Among 179 seniors who completed VEPS, 71.5% continued their employment, 9.5% continued their education and 4.5% joined the military, 10.6% were not working after graduation, and 2.8% were married.

In general, stability coefficients obtained here were much higher than those expected on the basis of earlier research on stability in courses taught successively rather than concurrently. Even so, high inference ratings were more stable than low inference counts of discrete behaviors, and many behaviors did not occur often enough to allow  stable measurement, despite intensive observation. The data are discussed with reference to implementing different treatments in experimental studies in order to document the differential effects, and in reference to the possibility of linking teacher stability on clusters of variables with information about student outcomes.

Multilevel approaches are considered as well as traditional pupil-level and class-level analytical models. The results from a simulated model of educational effects which allowed the effects of teacher quality on the variation in the within-class slopes to vary over a range of meritocratic, random and compensatory conditions illustrated that overall between-student analyses, between-class analyses, and proposed multilevel methods  can all yield misleading estimates of the magnitude of teacher effects on mean class outcome. However, selected multilevel methods provide some indication of misspecification and can identify the direction of the bias in estimating teacher effects on mean class outcomes. (Author/MV)",

It addresses three broad issues: the producers of police services, agency cooperation and service delivery, and agency size and service delivery. Each issue is treated in a separate chapter and includes a discussion of several related questions. The 80 geographic areas studied varied in size, population density, and types of communities. The report's findings challenge several assumptions which have been the basis of many proposals for police reorganization. The findings show that policing metropolitan areas can be divided among separately organized agencies as well as among the personnel of a single police department. It is concluded that the diversity in size of agencies and the different  combinations of services they produce are not necessarily wasteful or confusing. There appears to be little duplication by small-to-medium sized police agencies. Most police departments seem to know what services they are responsible for and where to deliver them. Instances of duplication, of confusion and of noncooperation are found, but they are not found to be the common pattern. It is suggested that reorganization of metropolitan policing needs to be based on a realistic assessment of the resources and needs of each particular metropolitan area. (Author/AM)",

Eighteen first-order factors were found for whites and 18 for blacks. Five factors matched in the two samples: social status, residence, organization activity, political activity and efficacy, and main support's social status. Other important factors, unique to each sample were: for whites, self-employed and majority group membership, and for blacks, class consciousness and method  variance.

In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts could not issue injunctions against state criminal proceedings on the ground that such prosecutions would result in a deprivation of the defendant's constitutional rights. The Younger Doctrine, or &quot;Our Federalism&quot; as it has been called contains two principal operating assumptions. First, it assumes that state courts, as well as federal courts have the authority, responsibility and competence to vindicate federal civil rights; secondly, it assumes that, to the extent that state courts fail to protect federal civil rights, such lapses can be remedied  upon appellate review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Days argues that there is another doctrinal thread in the evolution of constitutional principles in the U.S. that undercuts the Younger or &quot;Our Federalism&quot; approach. The Court's approach seems to reflect its belief that only the most serious, egregious and systematic forms of civil rights violations deserve federal judicial remediation. There is a danger that state officials will not exercise their power to sue immediately upon discovering apparent civil rights violations. It is important that better state laws and procedures be developed to insure that individual civil rights are protected. It is concluded that fair and accessible state remedies are not inferior to approaches established uniformly by Federal Government action.  (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This paper compares the present official poverty measure with a relative measure of poverty. The comparison is made both conceptually and empirically. These two aspects comprise the two major parts of the paper. Within the first part, the conceptual section, various issues common to both poverty measures as well as the measures themselves are discussed. In the empirical section, both poverty standards (official and relative) are used to examine the extent and incidence of poverty. Particular emphasis is given to geographic comparisons in the incidence of poverty among families and how the incidence has varied between 1967 and 1974. In addition, attention is given to how the choice between measuring family income on a national versus state average affects the geographical  distribution of relative poverty. The paper assumes some familiarity with the Federal government's official statistical poverty measure. It is recommended that readers refer to &quot;The Measure of Poverty&quot;, a multi-paper report prepared by an Interagency Poverty Studies Task Force, for additional information on this subject.

        "description":"This paper discusses the three hypothetical market baskets of goods and services for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes annual cost estimates. This program is referred to as the standard budgets or family budget program. The family budget program provides: 1) estimates of budget levels originally constructed to represent standards of living; 2) interarea indexes of &quot;living costs&quot; based upon these budget estimates; and 3) adjustment factors to convert the budgets for other family sizes and types. Attention is given to the limitations of the family budgets as measures of income adequacy and to their use as indexes of interarea cost-of-living differences. Briefly, the general limitations of the budgets program with respect to defining poverty are: 1) as measures of  income adequacy, 2) as measures of interarea cost of living differences, and 3) as adjustment of factors for various sizes and types of families. The paper also discusses the manner of living represented by the market baskets program, price measurement problems, geographic cost of living comparisons, and equivalence scales. In addition, it includes a short section which discusses areas for future research in this program. (Author/AM)",

The 354 respondents rated the actual attainment and the desired priority of the students needs, the need for improving the program needs, and other information both general and specific to career education needs. A summary of the findings follows: According to the ten national learner outcomes, the highest priorities are basic academic skills, work habits, and work values; the most critical students needs concerned students' ability to accept responsibility, understand how self-concept influences success, value the importance of setting career goals based on self-knowledge, find jobs, consider alternatives when making career  decisions, and view career options independent of sex role stereotypes; the student needs which are being met most successfully by current programs are in the areas of career and self-awareness and basic academic skills; the most critical program needs are in the areas of infusion of career education into the general education subjects, comprehensive career guidance (including counseling, placement, and followup), and teacher inservice; and finally concerning differences in perceptions, considerable agreement was found among all groups of educators in the selection of the highest and lowest priority program needs.

In the institutional survey descriptive information was sought concerning the kinds of continuing education opportunities available, the audiences served, the number of participants, and the  subject matter areas studies. The methodology consisted of constructing and administering a questionnaire to a sample of university and college personnel, analyzing the data, and reporting the findings. The Delphi study sought the responses of policy advisors, continuing education administrators, faculty members, and clients to alternative adult and continuing education goals and strategies. The phase three task involved becoming familiar with the management information system of the state education department and evaluating its compatibility with the data collection procedures used in the two preceding phases. (Results of each phase are reported separately and a final chapter synthesizes them into ten selected policy issues in continuing education, e.g., expansion of specific types of  course offerings and future research needs.)

The SAGE training system was developed in nine steps including exploring scholarly research and conducting a nationwide survey; defining a philosophy of individual development materialized in the conceptual model; and defining a philosophy of instruction materialized in the training model. The conceputal model is predicated on an interrelationship among four concepts: life stage, life style, life space, and total life planning. The training model is based on the following concepts: evidence of learning is a  learner's performance; performance is measured in on-the-job situations; and the rate of learning is determined by the learner. SAGE, a module system of self-instructional packages, contains twenty-one broad skill areas (role statements) required of adult education guidance and counseling personnel which are each subdivided into specific skills. Each specific skill is taught in one module with each module containing the following components: Learning Objective, Rationale, Preassessment, Learning Activities, and Postassessment. This system may be adapted to many diverse adult and counselor education settings.

        "description":"Using a cross-country framework which draws on the experience of the developed nations--Western Europe, Canada, the United States, and Japan--this study examines the way countries view the problems of the transition from school to work and the role of the transition services in smoothing the passage. Focus is on the formal and public transition services provided by official agencies at various levels of government which encompass information, guidance, placement, induction, and follow-up of young workers on the job. Stressing the experience of a few countries whose size or programs command attention, the study alludes to others when they have distinctive experience or policies. Greatest emphasis is placed on the problems and services for the age group which enters work after  lower or upper secondary education. An introductory chapter outlines the objectives. Chapter 2 presents the basic discussion of the intermediary services of which the transition services are part. In chapter 3 the organizational structure of the transition services is analyzed. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with educational and occupational guidance, and chapter 6 reviews the issues and practice in guidance and counseling. Chapters 7, 8, and 9 are devoted to methods of finding jobs and official job placement efforts. Induction to work and the follow-up of young people in their early jobs are the subjects of chapter 10 while chapter 11 summarizes and discusses policy implications. The full 928-item bibliography is included. (JT)",

        "description":"Ten surveys of American men aged 25-64 were analyzed to determine the effects of family background, adolescent personality traits, cognitive test scores, and years of schooling on occupational status and earnings in maturity. Some of the findings follow: Data on brothers indicated that prior research has underestimated the effect of family background on earnings. Adolescent test scores indicated that cognitive skills have a substantial effect on occupational status and earnings independent of background. Data on adolescent behavior indicated that personality traits may exert as much impact on economic success as cognitive skills. Controlling background and adolescent test scores indicated that less than half the observed association between years of schooling and earnings is  causal. (The last third of this report covers the study's methodology. It examines the measures used regarding economic success, family background, test scores and years of schooling; describes the statistical methods; and pinpoints the reasons for differences between the nine principal samples. An appendix describing the samples used in this study is available as a separate document.) (EM)",

Women who were out of the labor force at the time of the 1971 survey were asked about their willingness to seek employment if free day care centers were available to them. Whether a woman would search for employment if given access to free day care facilities is hypothesized to be a function of (1) her family's composition, (2) her previous labor market behavior and attitudes, (3) her family's earnings, (4) her educational attainment, and (5) her geographic location and the demand for female labor in her locality. The analysis indicates that the  availability of free day care centers would draw proportionally more black than white women with children under six into the labor force. For both whites and blacks, the impact would be greatest among those women with a positive orientation toward employment outside the home. (EM)",

(The program was designed to change relationships among clients, WIN staff, and training vendors, by transferring responsibility for decision making and negotiations for training arrangements from staff to clients--nondirective counseling.) Focus in this report is on how evaluation research or feasibility testing (using the implementation of the WIN voucher system as an example) can be effected by staff noncooperation, problems of intra- and interagency coordination, and other variables (e.g., goal conflict, communication). A  sixteen-page concluding section discusses literature concerned with program evaluation and describes elements which might go into a systematic approach to program implementation analysis. Suggestions for ways in which a two-level approach to evaluation research might increase the clarity, comprehensiveness, and sophistication of research results are also included. (SH)",

Longitudinal data from the 1966 to 1973 National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS) of middle-aged men were used which provided the opportunity to observe men prior to and two years after their job separation and compare them  to a matched control group of employees. The present study suggests that while job displacements during middle-age are not common, they occur frequently enough to constitute a social problem. No occupational or educational category of men is immune to this kind of career disruption. The major long-term impact of displacement appears to have been a substantial deterioration in occupational status. In addition to economic losses, the displaced workers suffered from deteriorating health and some sense of alienation. (EM)",

It was hypothesized that a moderate amount of persistence--neither too much nor too little--would lead to the highest achievement, forming a curvilinear relationship. It was also hypothesized that persistence would be positively related to achievement in lecture-related instruction and essentially unrelated in the individualized instructional context, creating an ordinal interaction between instructional mode and persistence. Result of the experiment supported neither hypothesis; neither the curvilinear relationship nor the ordinal interaction was found. The authors examine  the reasons for their findings in detail, and bring in the complex element of motivation as a possibly relevant factor. They call for more research to examine the relationships between persistence and achievement and between persistence and instructional method. (Author/BP)",

The four-dimensional energy field that is the family system is a living open system, a dynamic whole engaged in mutual and simultaneous interaction with a four-dimensional energy field that is the environment. The family system is patterned and organized; it evolves unidirectionally and irreversibly through space-time; it is sentient and thinking. It was postulated that the family system is described and explained by the principles of helicy and resonancy, and that these principles predict the evolution of the family system. The properties and principles of the framework provide a model which is useful for the field of family study. An example of the incorporation of family  development theory into the framework was presented, as was a research example, with substantive theory and hypotheses derived from the model. (Author)",

        "description":"This study was undertaken: (1) to determine achievement in mathematics of ninth graders (general mathematics students and algebra students) in eight public schools in New Jersey as measured by an achievement test developed and tested by the author; (2) to determine attitudes toward mathematics of the students as measured by an attitude scale developed and tested by the author; (3) to provide data regarding sex-differentiated attitudes toward mathematics that could be used to isolate factors influencing attitudes toward mathematics; and (4) to correlate attitude and achievement data for the sample of students studied. Findings reveal three key components in attitudinal orientation toward mathematics: (1) attitudes toward mathematics as a subject; (2) learner's self-concept and the  sex-role stereotyping dimension; and (3) parental expectations. Parental expectations emerged as factor two for females, and as factor three for males. Both sexes evidenced the same primary factor, i.e., attitudes toward mathematics as a subject. Weak statistical trends related to differences in mathematical achievement may attest to changing teaching styles in the mathematics classroom and recognition of sex-role stereotyping. Also, ninth grade may not be the critical level to determine strong statistical sex differences in mathematics ability and attitude. (Author)",

Most of this past research views the counselor as a &quot;gatekeeper,&quot; perpetuating the social status ordering by giving students advice which is compatible with their social status. The research reported in this paper takes a different approach to counselor-student interaction by looking at the processes which predict student perceptions of the strength of counselor influence. The outcomes of this research address the earlier literature in two ways. First, the process outlined in this paper indicates that the channeling of students, if it occurs, may occur in an atmosphere in which counselors are regarded as warm and concerned about the welfare of the student. Those students who, in the  gatekeeping literature are most likely to have their aspirations lowered by counselors, are also those who, in this study are most likely to report the counselors as warm (friendly and concerned). Secondly, this study actually strengthens the impact of the channeling argument. While past studies have indicated that counselors affect students in the direction of lowering the aspirations of certain students, this study adds that counselors are most likely to have a strong impact on these students' thinking about the future.

It is argued that the former is a natural consequence of cognitive development, the entry into formal operational thought, which results in the extension from reality into the world of possibility which begins during the period of adolescense. However, when the precipitating mood and consequent affects become negatively coloured, perhaps in part, due to misunderstanding the \"normalness\" of such thoughts as well as the absence of feedback from significant others, then pathology is likely indicated. When we can make this  distinction and monitor such shifts, that is, from spontaneous curiosity and excitement to obsessive thoughts and depression, we shall have taken a large step forward in predicting suicidal attempts and remediating them.

The first experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that such attributional tendencies may derive from divergent, naive expectations regarding the source of the greatest variance in men's and women's behavior. The second experiment was conducted to test the possibility that these divergent naive expectations regarding the behavior of women and men may translate into attributional biases. The third study was conducted to explore the impact of the perceiver's naive  variance expectations on his desire for information upon which to base causal attributions. (Author/SPT)",

Significant correlations were found for all three variables as a total set and the individual comparisons of the independent variables with semester grade point average. It was noted that only 7% of the variance was accounted for by these variables, therefore, further investigation into motivational variables would be indicated. Due to the regression analysis indicating  that the Nelson-Denny Test and the SAT Math scores accounted for most of the significance in determining success, it was suggested that these variables be given greater emphasis in admissions criteria for the disadvantaged student.

        "description":"The hypothesis in the present study is that in work situations which evoke sex role stereotypes, women will respond less stereotypically than males since it is in their best interest to do so. The method comes from the Rosen et al. (1975) study of male managers. In the present study, 293 introductory psychology students were asked to role play an executive vice-president of a large retail clothing chain. They were given five in-basket decision tasks, involving either male or female employees, following the tasks designed by Rosen and his colleagues. All five in-baskets involved behavior that is considered more appropriate for one sex than the other. The situations concerned hiring for a position requiring extensive travel, promotion of a person who stated that family life comes  before work, response to an employee whose spouse has been offered a lucrative position elsewhere, response to a request for leave of absence to care for one's children, and deciding the appropriateness of a person's attendance at his/her spouse's company parties. Both male and female subjects, the majority of whom were first semester freshmen, responded to the in-basket situations in a somewhat less stereotypical manner than Rosen, Jerdee, and Prestwich's male managers. In general, females are not less discriminatory than males although there are differences between the sexes in specific areas. Despite the rhetoric about a loosening of sex role stereotypes, however, results suggest that both young males and young females may still respond in a fairly stereotypical manner to work  situations which evoke sex role stereotypes.

This report outlines and reviews the findings of research in the developing paradigms. Four paradigms into the effects of being imitated are examined briefly: (1) operant strengthening paradigm; (2) classical conditioning paradigm; (3) clinical applications of imitation effects; (4) concomitant effects paradigm. Few of the studies in these paradigms have focused on the effects on adult models of being imitated by children and subsequent effects on the adults' behaviors toward the children. The experiments assessing the effects of child imitation on adult models are described. It has generally been found that adult models are attracted to or more positive  toward children who were imitators as compared to children who were nonimitators. A methodological and conceptual discussion of the studies follows (viz., between-groups vs. within-subjects manipulations; social comparison processes). Areas of needed research are suggested. The being imitated effects research is placed into the perspective of child effects research. A child's imitation or nonimitation affects adults, whose behaviors subsequently affect the child and his/her development. (Author)",

Drawing on insights from artificial-intelligence research--specifically, research in natural language processing and continuous speech understanding--the paper attempts to present a fairly concrete picture of the kinds of hypothesis formation and inference processes that must take place during the reading process. It makes the case that many more alternative hypotheses are formed and evaluated than one might expect and that the majority of such processing happens below the level of conscious introspection. Two text passages of different levels of difficulty are considered in detail, and the applicability of such artifical-intelligence insights to the modeling of human reading are discussed.  (Author)",

Second, what are the implicit or explicit assumptions concerning the developmental processes of growth? The second section examines the general class of levels-of-processing (LOP) models, which, unlike other theories of adult cognition, have been widely adopted by developmentalists. The essential compatibility of LOP models and developmental interests follows from a shared concern with three main issues: the importance of involuntary memory, the activity of the subject and the goal of  that activity, and &quot;headfitting&quot; (the compatibility between what is known and what can be known). Developmental data are often particularly apt demonstrations of the main tenets of the LOP frameworks, and LOP models provide a language and a viewpoint through which the issues of interest to developmentalists can be reinterpreted.

The ability to select the main elements of texts improved over the entire age range studied and was not affected by experience studying and recalling the passage. Retrieval cue selection was also sensitive to age, with a dramatic shift in flexibility occurring between the high school and college populations. Prior to experience recalling the text, college students selected mainly the most important elements to serve as retrieval cues. After experience recalling, however, they selected units of intermediate importance. Realizing they would remember the main ideas without further effort, they  concentrated on the intermediate level material which caused them much more trouble on their previous recall attempt. This shift in retrieval cue selection represents a fine degree of sensitivity to the relative improtance of text segments and to the function of retrieval cues in recall, a sensitivity not displayed by even the oldest high school subjects.

Students served as their own controls and received both treatments, with each treatment being repeated twice. Before and after each treatment condition, students were tested on recognition of isolated words and on oral reading in context. Results indicated that decontextualized practice produced significantly greater isolated word recognition and that performance following contextualized practice  exceeded that of a no-instruction control. However, the instructional treatments did not differentially affect oral reading in context as measured by rate or accuracy. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the selection of reading objectives and reading measures by remedial reading teachers. (Author)",

According to the survey, the typical daily newspaper in the United States uses slightly less than 45% of its space for nonadvertising content, reflecting little change since a 1957 survey. Larger newspapers tend to have larger newsholes in terms of actual column inches, although the percentage of the newspaper devoted to news is smaller than that for smaller-circulation newspapers; more newsholes are allocated to local news than to news from other places. Methods of determining the allocation of space have changed little in 18 years, but newspapers with greater news potential are more likely to have a standardized (fixed minimum)  newshole. Most managing editors report satisfaction with present newshole policies. (Tables of findings are included.) (JM)",

In the first section, separate chapters discuss the rationale for game-playing; the teacher's role in simulations and ways in which classroom interaction changes when games are used; a step-by-step process for designing a game; ways in which the limitations imposed by game rules free players to engage in new, positive kinds of behavior; concerns about the abuse and overuse of games; and possibilities for designing new games. The second section of the book offers descriptions of eight teacher-made games, along with specific instructions for playing them. Appendixes provide an annotated bibliography of publications on games and  simulations, descriptions of recommended commercial games for the English classroom, and a list of academic games development centers.

Thus, the M-M-C strategy combines behavioral and cognitive learning theories to facilitate writing development. Modular learning and programmed instruction are also presented as strategies to be used within the M-M-C sequence. (RL)",

The speaker presented to each group a different combination of the independent variables, and, after the subjects were tested for their comprehension of the speech, they rated the speaker's credibility. Analysis of the effects of the three independent variables led to the following conclusions: Eye contact seems to enhance both listener comprehension and speaker credibility, though inconsistencies between eye contact and vocal inflection may lower the speaker's believability; the  speaker's posture has little effect on either credibility or comprehension; varied or limited vocal inflection has no significant effect upon the speaker's credibility, except for the likability factor of credibility; and differences in vocal inflection do not affect listener comprehension.

Students who will work in OBMod systems need to learn communication skills for handling grievances, while those students entering MBO systems need skills for private, one-to-one conferences.

The bulk of the discussion focuses on the research of Harmon Zeigler and his colleagues, particularly on the study described in \"Governing American Schools,\" by Zeigler, Jennings, and Peak. Zeigler contends that although school districts are political units, the linkages between citizens and educational policy-makers are much weaker than suggested by the democratic model of American education. Rather, the policy-making process is dominated by professional administrators, especially scoool superintendents, instead of by elected school board members. The implication of this is that the traditional view of the schools as a  service organization, rather than a political system, will be increasingly challenged, and the schools of the future will be faced by essentially political demands they are not presently equipped to handle.

This particular publication presents procedural guidelines, instructional materials, and relevant background information and theoretical data for use by participants in the PETC-III program. These materials are designed to correspond to the instructional strategies outlined in the previous volume and are numbered accordingly. The PETC-III program is one of eight instructional systems that together comprise the Providing Organizational Development Skills (PODS)  program, which is intended to provide educators with the knowledge, skills, and sensitivities to organize and manage educational systems in more relevant, humane, effective, and efficient ways. The eight component systems of PODS are most effective when taken sequentially; PETC-III is intended to be the last step in that sequence. The training design of PETC-III calls for five separate 3-4 day workshop sessions totaling 17 days, to be held during a period of 6-8 months. (JG)",

The purpose of this report is to alert college housing officials to who their new students are likely to be and what the students' impact on housing will be.

        "description":"The costs of owning and operating physical facilities are consuming an increasing share of the budgets of colleges and universities. In the past, academic and operating units of colleges have viewed their space as a free commodity and often used it extravagantly. Space costing is a method of cost accounting the space and operating and maintenance expenses to the individual unit or program of an institution. With this method a central administration would assign the costs of &quot;rent,&quot; operation, and maintenance to each unit's total budget. The manager of each section, department, or college can then determine how best to spend his or her budget and make decisions about the size of the department's territory and staff, its hours of operation, and frequency of maintenance. The report  discusses the issues of whether fiscal responsibility should also include managerial control of the physical environment and shows how space costing would affect three areas of an institution's financial and resource distribution: the utilization of space on campus, the cost and funding of plant operating and maintenance, and the recovery of overhead costs for individual research projects.

Specifically what commuting students say they need most are the following: study areas, meeting and eating places, lounge space, places to sleep (especially at examination time), parking spaces, transportation between buildings and to public transit lines, lockers, recreational areas with equipment, child care centers, and information and message centers.

In contrast to that approach, this report examines citizen participation from the local perspective in order to provide a feel for what citizen involvement in decision making is really like at the local level. Seven federally sponsored city or county-based public agencies were selected for observation, including 1) a Neighborhood Health Services Center, 2) a Community Action Agency, 3) a Legal Services Center, 4) a Model City Agency, 5) a Tenant's Council in a public housing project, 6) an Urban Renewal Project Area Committee, and 7) a community Mental Health Center. These local agencies represent programs  sponsored by the same four major federal agencies examined in the related report. Rather than presenting separate case histories of each local agency, the report analyzes the seven agencies according to common categories of interest, including representation, aspects of participation, decision making, relationships with other agencies, aspects of minority community development, and federal relationships.

This study attempted to determine whether there has been an increasing trend toward nonpublic school enrollment in Seattle and what reasons parents give for transferring their children from the public schools. An analysis of available data on enrollment trends in Seattle public and nonpublic schools and on transfers from public to nonpublic schools for the years 1970-76 was made. In addition, survey questionnaires were sent to the parents of all Seattle students who transferred to nonpublic schools between July 1975 and April 1977. Findings of the study were inconclusive regarding net out-migration of students to  nonpublic schools, but showed that while public school enrollment has dropped, nonpublic school enrollment has increased. Transfer rates were highest from the Garfield and Roosevelt school attendance areas, and the rate of transfers by white students was higher than the percentage of white students in the public schools. About half of the responding parents indicated that dissatisfaction with the Seattle Public Schools was the reason for their child's transfer to a nonpublic school. (JG)",

        "description":"Nonpublic schools are a surprisingly salient channel for philanthropy in elementary and secondary education. As a result of philanthropy in nonpublic schools, the nation's total collectivity of schools is probably more efficient fiscally, more effective educationally, and more humane in its impact on students and parents than an exclusively public arrangement would be. There is obvious danger, however, that the nonpublic schools and the philanthropy they represent will experience severe attrition in the future. Because of rapid cost increases in education, nonpublic schools are predicted to become more exclusively nonsectarian, less subsidized, and increasingly limited to the patronage of an economic elite, unless some shift occurs in the framework of public policy. Strategies  discussed for changing the framework of school finance include (1) public aid, (2) a liberal interpretation of \"charitable donations,\" (3) tax credits or deductions for fees, (4) educational vouchers, (5) encouragement of public \"alternative\" schools, and (6) levying all future taxation increases for public schools exclusively on public school patrons.

        "description":"Elderly and handicapped persons currently receive special transportation assistance through a variety of programs at federal, state, and local levels of government. The different agencies administering these programs tend to work independently of one another, often duplicating transportation facilities and incurring unnecessary costs. User-side subsidies offer a means for reducing the costs of current transportation programs for the elderly and handicapped by placing the subsidy funds directly in the hands of the users and encouraging them to select the providers of their choice. This paper describes the application of the user-side subsidy approach in selected urban areas and discusses some of the obstacles to more widespread use of this technique. It is concluded that by  earmarking funds for certain provider types and for certain types of transportation expenditures legislators have created serious barriers to the provision of efficient transportation services for the elderly and handicapped. Even with these legislative constraints, however, agencies administering transportation programs could reduce transportation costs significantly through greater use of the user-side subsidy technique.

        "description":"Special transportation assistance is currently provided for elderly and handicapped persons in the United States through a variety of programs at the federal, state, and local levels of government. The programs are concerned with improving the mobility of the client groups served, thereby making various activities and locations in urban areas more accessible to them. Relatively little attention has been devoted to assessing the benefits of these mobility and accessibility improvements, however, and legislators and administrators have had virtually no empirical information with which to evaluate and revise the programs. This paper suggests that the benefits of mobility and accessibility improvements for the elderly and handicapped can be expressed largely in terms of the impacts  they have on travel behavior. The paper then discusses the special conceptual and practical problems associated with assessing these impacts. Recent data from an experimental transportation program in Danville, Illinois, are used to illustrate the discussion. (Author)",

In preparing this document, the state Task Force on Student Responsibility and Discipline attempted to present a practical, reasoned approach to the complex issue of student conduct and to provide clear direction for schools as they deal on a daily basis with the difficult problem of student discipline. The task force outlines a four-level student misconduct/disciplinary response structure intended to serve as a basis for discipline policies in Pennsylvania schools. The four levels classify student misbehavior ranging from minor misconduct, such as tardiness, through acts which result in violence to another person or to property,  or which pose a direct threat to the safety of others. The suggested procedures and disciplinary options are geared to match the seriousness of each incident of misbehavior. The task force emphasizes that these guidelines should be tailored to characteristics and needs of each individual school. It also includes an examination of some major disciplinary issues, such as the use of suspension, and makes appropriate recommendations. (Author/DS)",

A headlong rush toward building designs that conserve energy at the expense of the quality of buildings as judged by occupants would be a very shortsighted approach. There must be a continual awareness and sensitivity of the consequences on people when selecting among alternative \"technical\" options designed as a result of energy conservation needs. We need an increasing understanding of such factors as thermal comfort and illumination needs in buildings, as decisions likely to influence these requirements are made by designers. Another area of concern which should not be overlooked is the interaction of people with their  environments. Approaches to energy conservation problems are often defeated by building occupants. Tight seals around doors and windows are useless if doors and windows are kept open, and building occupants have no choice but to turn all of the lights on or off if these are the only control options available to them. Building managers, operators, and occupants have an important, though not well understood, role to play in any energy conservation program. (Author)",

The author emphasizes that an in-school suspension program must rest on a solid philosophical foundation which allows for defining and dealing with the root problems of misbehavior, not merely with the symptoms of discipline problems. Teachers and administrators must be willing to acknowledge that sometimes they contribute to student misbehavior. When instituting such a program, school personnel should give considerable attention to the process by which students are assigned to the program, how long they should stay, and to the process for follow up once they leave. Special attention should be  paid to academic difficulties, since frequently such difficulties underlie student discipline problems. Program personnel (counselors, teachers, aids) should be carefully selected, and the program should be evaluated at regular intervals throughout the school year. (Author/DS)",

Community schools in Canada use all the community resources possible to provide community-oriented programs, including the K-12 program, basic education, and high school completion programs. They involve all citizens in democratically deciding on how to extend services for the overall benefit of the community. Community education programs vary according to the needs of individual communities; urban programs are quite different from programs serving rural areas, such as the Northwest Territories. The obstacles that sometimes hinder the development of community schools include  lack of financial support, lack of understanding of community education goals, and lack of commitment to community education by other community service organizations. This summary of the state of community education in Canada is based on a national survey of community school programs. (Author/DS)",

Criteria for financing public education are discussed and a method is proposed to analyze suggested reform plans. Data from the state of Massachusetts are then used to estimate a demand for education equation and to estimate the effects of changes in public school expenditures on private school enrollment. In the final section, the estimated equation is used in combination with the standard tools of welfare economics to simulate the effects of variants of three reform plans: full state funding of public schools, power-equalizing, and the modified percentage-equalization state  aid plan that is currently the law in Massachusetts. The principal finding of the study is that popular variants of the two reform plans are likely to reduce the economic welfare of most all communities in the state. Evidence also suggests that private school enrollment is not likely to be significantly altered by changes in public school expenditure. (Author/MLF)",

The subjects were Icelandic monolinguals and Icelandic-English bilinguals. The phonetic parameter under investigation was duration. The experiment was designed to test which of the following three hypotheses accurately predict the perceptual responses of bilinguals: (1) the null hypothesis (predicting no interference between the two languages); (2) the awareness hypothesis (predicting more accurate perception in bilinguals); and (3) the confusion hypothesis (predicting less accurate perception in bilinguals). A listening test was administered which consisted of stimuli based on the minimal pair &quot;is&quot; [i:s] and &quot;iss&quot; [is:]. Findings include the following: (1)  vowel length is a more salient clue than consonant length in the perception of the quantity opposition; (2) significant support is found for the third hypothesis which predicts confusion in the perception of the bilinguals; and (3) there is a significant difference in the perception of the quantity system of Icelandic between monolingual and bilingual native speakers of the language.

        "description":"Sociolinguistically oriented studies of the Chicano speech community cluster around two subject areas: (1) conversational code-switching, and (2) language loyalty and maintenance. Research representative of each of these areas is reviewed. It is felt that the large body of findings regarding the language use of the Chicanos have failed to take the form of a Chicano sociolinguistics because: (1) most studies of Chicano language usage have been done independently of each other, and (2) most studies show a lack of commitment between the researcher and the language community. The present study outlines what are considered to be vital elements for a Chicano sociolinguistic research program. Chicano sociolinguists need to take the linguistic needs of the Chicano community itself as a  foundation for the development of a research program and strategy. The principal goal of a Chicano sociolinguistics research program should be to explore the consequences of involving the users of language in the scholarly process, not only as objects of research and planning, but as participants in those aspects of activities that are normally considered to lie within the province of the trained professional.

It is shown that the data from some bilingual English speakers at Pan American University are comparable to the data noted by others for both second and first language acquisition of interrogative word questions. In particular, interrogative-word fronting always seems to be acquired before subject-auxiliary inversion. Learners never produce interrogative-word questions like &quot;Is she doing what?&quot; Utterances like &quot;What she is doing?&quot; are common, however. Previous description of these facts is found to be insufficient in light of additional relevant cross-dialectal, cross-linguistic, and possibly universal facts about verb and interrogative word placement. Further, these facts are  shown to have implications for the description of the rules of wh-fronting and inversion. (Author/CFM)",

Fifteen students were chosen from the ESL (English as a second language) center at Southern Illinois University to record a tape while reading passages in English. The tape and a questionnaire were administered to 70 raters. Half of them were students who had neither linguistic nor teaching experience (the naive group) while the other half were instructors or teaching assistants in ESL (the experienced group). Each sample was rated by the judges on each of six scales: the first four scales consisted of four pairs of bipolar adjectival descriptors, an overall proficiency scale, and a multiple choice questionnaire about the language background of the  speaker. There was a very substantial agreement among the raters, regardless of whether they were naive or experienced. Both groups were very reliable on the whole in judging proficiency level, although the experienced were somewhat more reliable. The experienced raters were much better at identifying correctly the source language backgrounds than the naive group. (CFM)",

The global/specific dimension distinguishes instruments which tend toward generic screening of gross language behavior from those which tend toward a refined classification of specific language indicators. Within the global and specific modalities, oral and aural performance subclasses are designated. The third dimension consists of four major  strategies: rating, home interview, indirect, and parallel instruments. Specific examples of instruments are given to clarify how the classification matrix operates. Criteria for evaluating and selecting tests include examinee factors relating to developmental and cultural appropriateness, administrative and logistic factors, and psychometric considerations.

        "author":["Hoar, Nancy"],
        "description":"The ability to produce and recognize paraphrases is necessary for a child's linguistic development. The purpose of this paper is to explain how three basic sentence types interact with age in determining the strategy a child uses in producing paraphrases. Three paraphrase strategies considered are lexical substitution, syntactic rearrangement, and a lexical-syntactic combination. Forty-eight children (grades one, three, five, and seven) produced paraphrases for eighteen sentences comprised of three sentence types: one core noun, two core nouns, and three core nouns. One-core-noun sentences elicited attempts at lexical substitution with greater frequency then attempts at syntactic rearrangement or a combination strategy, but the rate of success was essentially the same for all  three sentence types. Two-core-noun sentences elicited attempts at syntactic rearrangement, but a syntactic strategy was more successful with one-core-noun sentences at all grade levels. A combination lexical-syntactic strategy was also more successful with one-core-noun sentences, but at all grade levels it was attempted most often with three-core-noun sentences. These strategy attempts and success rates not only show that sentence type does influence paraphrase strategy; they also support the concept of a dynamic language acquisition process. (Author/CLK)",

Instead, educators continued a fruitless search for qualities and behaviors that defined the perfect teacher. In the meantime, we have lost our perspective about the function of faculty and the real purpose of higher education, and similarly, about the purpose of faculty evaluation. Evaluation is not an end in itself; it is the means to improving instruction, to providing a better education for our students. It must be recognized that higher education is accountable first to the students for high quality  instruction. There is a variety of sources of evaluative data, each source having certain limitations. In the UCLA School of Dentistry an ongoing, systematic, and comprehensive program of teaching and curricular evaluation has been established that uses the criterion-referenced system of instruction and measurement, supplemented informally by other, more traditional measures. An instructional development program for faculty is an integral part of the evaluation system, making available the kind of help that will enable them to maximize attainment of their contracted responsibility. Unless colleges and universities today make similarly serious commitments to improving instruction and evaluating teaching by providing substantial financial and personnel support, higher education may never  recover its former importance and respect in society.

Whatever evaluative information has been offered to attest to the results of programs has usually been based on unreliable, inferential, subjective, and unsystematically collected data. Faculty development has become an end in itself, and if the current messy state continues it is destined to fulfill the prediction of many and become just another fad. What most so-called faculty development experts and theorists seem to forget is that higher education is a system. If the school as a system does not achieve its objective--if the students are not learning  adequately--the school must be redesigned until it does. Two comprehensive efforts at professional development serve as examples of such redesign: the Center for Professional Development, established in the office of the chancellor of the California State University and Colleges and encompassing a variety of programs on six campuses; and an institutional change project at the UCLA School of Dentistry. The implementation was different in the two situations, but each project treated the school as an entity within which functions can be reorganized. (Author/MSE)",

Student evaluations are neither reliable nor valid measures of a teacher's instructional effectiveness. Some of the items included in such questionnaires address only symptoms of instructional problems and not underlying causes, and others ignore the fact that learning and not teacher characteristics is the most important objective. Similarly, almost anything that a faculty member does outside the classroom is now called faculty development, but in this melange, most development programs have little potential for contributing significantly to instructional improvement. Two projects have  been developed using a rigorous and systematic approach to this problem: the Center for Professional Development with pilot programs on six campuses of the California State University and Colleges; and a comprehensive program at the UCLA School of Dentistry. In the multicampus project, a variety of efforts were undertaken on different campuses: narrowly-focused faculty workshops, development of self-appraisal instruments, course and curricular materials development, institutional research projects, and a program for administrators only. It is felt that little change occurred or was initiated in this project. At UCLA, however, a nonfragmented, comprehensive faculty development and instructional improvement program addressing institutional goals is felt to be a success. The key is that the  school as an organization, including both faculty and administration, accepted responsibility for the consequences of its educational programs. (MSE)",

But by and large these cries went unheard in the cacaphony of academic inertia. In the mid-70's a crisis in higher education has spawned major efforts at planned change throughout the country, and in California a fund was established for educational innovation, supported by state and private monies. In that state single-campus and multicampus projects have been willingly undertaken, and thousands of faculty and administrators have participated in related activities. There is increasing evidence that innovations instituted by faculty members with the  assistance of this fund are stimulating other faculty to try out new teaching techniques. Centralization of the fund's administration in the office of the chancellor has contributed both efficiency and focus to the programs. However, several problems must be addressed for maximum impact in the future: assurance of special funding; the task of extending, refining, and institutionalizing innovation; and maintaining enthusiasm for innovation and the commitment to evaluation. An example of the California system's commitment to broad-based change and instructional improvement is the Center for Professional Development, established with system and federal funds to coordinate, guide, evaluate, and test alternative types of faculty development programs in the system.

Most have forgotten that higher education is a system and must be approached as such. For far too long evaluation has been presented as polar--either strictly quantitative or strictly impressionistic. In fact, neither methodology is adequate by itself. Quantitative evaluation  pays no attention to the merit of established program goals and gives no consideration to the configuration of people, events, processes, and practices that characterize the environment in which a program operates; evaluations yielded tend to be voluminous but dull, insensitive, technical reports. The other approach concentrates solely on program processes, eschewing judgments about the program's worth. Holistic evaluation, a hybrid of the two approaches, is an eclectic approach that includes process and product, description and quantification and goals and attitudes. This comprehensive approach is particularly well suited to the myriad of programs for professional development. (MSE)",

In it is described the interdependent relationships between schools of public health and departments of preventive and community medicine, two organizations that can productively collaborate in promoting the health of individuals and the community they live in. Also included are discussions of: the content and objectives of  undergraduate training; orienting the medical student toward disease prevention and health maintenance; methods of teaching and concepts of epidemiology and demography needed to understand the disease patterns in population groups; and resources in the medical school and the community that can be used in teaching preventive medicine. The monograph is addressed to students and teachers and intended for use as a reference source. (Author/MSE)",

(2) What will be its role in providing new career opportunities for its potential clients? (3) Is the lack of financial aid a problem related to maintenance of quality education at black graduate schools? (4) What is unique and vital about black graduate schools?

(8) How can we justify increasing manpower production in black graduate schools? (9) What projected estimates for graduate education at predominantly black colleges and universities can be made based on current trends? Recommendations are made that cover international education, research, medical and health manpower needs, alumni, continuing education seminars for federal personnel, national committee and advisory board appointments, cooperative arrangements, and projected development through 1980.

        "description":"American higher education developed under conditions vastly different from those of the Continent and Britain. Nine colleges were established in the colonial period before the Revolutionary War. Although some of them were related to state governments in their early history, they were even then importantly independent in comparison to continental institutions. The university came late to America, long after Bologna and Paris and Oxford had experienced centuries of development, decline, and renewal. Both American public and private universities married the German model of specialized research and advanced training to the older English-American model of liberal education by augmenting undergraduate colleges with graduate and professional schools. Along with the private college, the  private university, and the state university, other types of institutions emerged, such as the separate teachers' colleges, public comprehensive colleges, technological colleges, art schools, and the two-year college. Complex and contradictory trends have evolved in academic government in recent years, and no simple picture can be drawn that typifies the whole country. The organizational evolution of the American system of higher education as a whole is simultaneously unilinear and multilinear. The unilinear evolution is toward ever larger systems, and the multilinear toward greater diversity within systems. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The Japanese university system has been evolving gradually from more traditional patterns to more modern ones in terms of increased efficiency and participation, as well as from an elite to a mass enrollment system. However, the basic patterns of control and decisionmaking have changed little. The universities have been able to resist intrusions by the Ministry of Education, but many needed reforms have not taken place. Frustrated in its attempts to introduce structural reforms in existing universities, the Ministry of Education has turned more to the use of incentives to accomplish its aims, and it has established some new institutions on its own initiative. In the long run, these are likely to have considerable influence on the shape of Japanese higher education.  (Author)",

        "description":"The traditional European university is now extinct. The conditions in higher education that have succeeded it are highly unstable and therefore transitory, and its eventual replacement is now dimly perceptible on the horizon. The European university is of course an abstraction, meant to approximate the attributes of higher education in Germany, France, Italy, Scandinavia, and the Low Countries. The system in each of these countries is largely controlled by public authorities, and in every crucial area the future of the universities depends on actions that will or will not be taken by the state. In the not too distant past they were professors' universities with respect to their internal affairs, and elite in their relationship to society. All of them have passed through  fundamentally similar transformations since World War II, and now the questions of access to higher education (recruitment and selection) are vital to the universities' individual and collective futures.

        "description":"We need conceptual assistance in thinking about access to higher education, systematic categories that will help us analyze and compare the national academic structures that condition problems of access and solutions thereto. An approach that centers on basic structure directs attention to the heavy historical momentum of massive systems of higher education and encourages a long-run view of innovations, releasing us from the need to write the latest chapter on current events. Even small advances in the system ordinarily require time spans of five to ten years, or even a quarter of a century, instead of the one- and two-year periods within which political and administrative thinking is so often cast. A structural view that is informed by a sense of historical development also  points to country-by-country variation in solutions to current problems. Questions of access must be located in the broad matrices of different national structures. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The stubborn memorandum of organizational forms and types of control stems naturally from the traditionalizing of their practices, the vesting of group interest in their continuation, and the justifying of ideologies. The momentum is increased when the forms and types acquire niches in the larger organizational ecology that protects them against competition and invidious comparison. Contrary to the popular view that old organizations are rigid and new ones flexible, there stands the likelihood that long-lived organizations, surviving war, depression, and political attack, have devised adaptive mechanisms as well as protective niches. One primary adaptive feature of colleges and universities may be their cellular construction. The operating level of chairs, institutes,  departments, divisions, and schools consists not of units linked in an integrated process of production or service, but of free-standing units, partly self-governing, that can be individually added or dropped, augmented or diminished. In the turbulent last quarter of the twentieth century, viability in national higher education systems hinges on balance of power and on differentiation--even disorder--among organizational types. In all nations, the task in reform is to balance the trends toward centralization and diversification. (Author/MSE)",

Through interviews and selected working papers, a team of investigators inquired into centers of administrative decisionmaking at several levels and in all subject areas of the university. In effect, the study traced the evaluative circuitry of the institution and compared it where feasible with that of other universities and external research agencies. Among matters addressed are: academic evaluative procedures (promotion and tenure, proposal selection, program reviews) as they relate to the conduct of research; ethical considerations; collegial organization; and institutes, centers, and  extra-collegial laboratories as research agencies of the university.
