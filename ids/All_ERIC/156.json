        "description":"A cooperative Automation Study Project is proposed between The Institute for the Study of Technology in Education (TIE) and the Material Handling Institute (MHI). The project would develop instructional materials to support study about automation, integrate a support equipment system with the materials, and utilize a portion of the resources of industry and the talents of interested individuals in the development of instructional materials reflective of contemporary technology. There are four aspects of the project under consideration: (1) the curriculum program, (2) the organization of TIE, (3) the missions of TIE, and (4) the outputs of the project. Technology is defined here as the integrator and director of knowledge as applied to solving practical problems. On the ninth  grade level, the six parts of technology are materials, processes, machines, energy, information, and man. On the next level, the student studies in the areas of communications, construction, manufacturing, or service. At Grade 12 level, work will be concentrated in research and development and job staging. (Author/GEB)",

A three-part questionnaire was prepared to gather data on manpower needs, educational programs, and prospective educational consumers. Manpower needs and existing educational programs were examined with personnel in health care agencies. Data on prospective educational consumers were obtained by interviewing students in the public and parochial high schools in the district. The largest number of employees for all classifications were in the 26 to 35 and 46 and older age groups. Younger persons tended to be employed in the nursing, dental, and pharmacy offices, while older employees were found in the  rehabilitation service classification. There was also a substantial number of employees in the dental and office occupations. Recommendations for program revision were made as a result of the survey. (Author/GB)",

The precise measures of inputs and outputs which are required for ideal implementation of this multiple linear regression model are not feasible.

As the student achieves in both academic classes and in an industrial training position, three options will be developed for his consideration: (1) The individual will return to school as a full-time student, either quitting his job or working only part time, (2) The student will retain his job and participate in General Education Development (GED) classes for a diploma, and (3) The student will eventually return to complete his high school training, but for the present will continue his  employment. The program postulates that through intensive, supportive, and adaptive personal counseling, use of relevant curriculum, and economic satisfaction derived from paid on-the-job training, the student will be recycled into mainstream education. In Phase II implementation, the pilot program will become operational. (Author/GEB)",

        "description":"To followup an earlier study of the relative importance of age, education, and marital status as variables influencing female participation in the labor force, this research attempts to measure the relative importance of similar factors in determining whether or not a woman works or wishes to work. Particular emphasis was given to such determinants as age, child status, education of married women, residence, and education of husband. One important finding of the study was that the presence or absence of a young child remains, in the aggregate, the most important single attribute affecting a wife's participation in the labor force until the age of 44. It was concluded that the general improvement in the level of education is likely to induce more and more wives to remain in the  labor force after they are married, and to return to it when their major child-raising responsibilities in the home are passed. Still other factors that are expected to influence the participation of women in labor force are the use of effective birth control methods and the general continuing rise in the husband's income.

Response to this apparent need resulted in the initiation of perhaps the first 2-year Animal Science Technology Program in the nation. This two-volume report is the result of an extensive evaluation of the program's development and content. Major sections of this volume are: (1) Introduction, (2) Development of the Animal Science Technology Program at Delhi, (3) Facilities, Equipment and Special Instructional Materials, (4) The Curriculum, (5) Economic-Cost Considerations, (6) Importance of the Study, and (7) Summary, Conclusions, Implications and Recommendations. Included in the appendixes are sample evaluation  instruments and statistical data on the followup study. A major finding of the report is that both employers and employees reflected favorably upon the skills and abilities gained in the primary areas of training. Volume II of this report, which contains the curriculum course outlines, is available as VT 013 805. (Author/JS)",

The experiment itself involved the sending of newsletters on better breakfasts to 60 families in an experimental group by the Ohio Cooperative Extention Service, while no letters were sent to a control group. Questions about these newsletters were asked by interviewers, and the effectiveness of the letters evaluated. Descriptive and experimental statistics were used to analyze and to interpret the data collected.

When highest and lowest yield groups were compared, it was found that the latter had: (1) a higher educational level, (2) a larger average size of farm, (3) more average acres of cropland, (4) a larger cotton allotment, (5) planted a larger acreage of cotton, and (6) harvested more average acres of cotton mechanically. With regard to adoption of 12 recommended cotton production practices studied, farmers in the highest yield  group had the highest total average practice diffusion rating. Some other factors influencing cotton practice adoption included: (1) the net returns received per acre, (2) the adequacy of machinery and equipment, (3) the amount of technical knowledge of the operator, (4) the relative cost of the practices and benefits received, and (5) the seriousness of land preparation, planting and harvesting problems peculiar to cotton.

Educational work accomplished by the institute since 1965 followed the general purpose of providing leadership education for those in labor and social policy fields. Related to this are identification of the target group, approaches and methods, the need for financing to provide materials and teaching fellowship, and the institutes internship courses. Institute research has concentrated on the general area of social relations and social organization. The research has included symposia on migration, wages, and inflation; a comparative study of workers' participation in management; a research project on  strategic factors in industrial relations; research in the field of social participation in transitional societies; and the establishment of International Industrial Relations Associations. In addition to books, the institute also publishes the ILLS Bulletin. Future directions of the institute in education and research work concern future trends in industrial relations, in social policy, transnational labor relations, social participation and organization building in transitional societies, and the promotion of labor studies.

The purpose of the project was to provide data needed to establish a basis for proposing minimal staffing patterns for nursing homes. In an adaptation of the methodology used in a study conducted by the Milwaukee, Wisconsin Health Department in 1962-63, nurse observers collected data by observing the nursing care of 195 sample patients in 14 nursing homes located in the Denver Metropolitan area during the period November 5, 1965 to April 17, 1966. The data were obtained on the number of specific nursing activities completed in 24 areas of nursing care; the time required for the categorical levels of nursing personnel to perform these activities for patients with  minimal, moderate, or maximum nursing needs, ambulatory and nonambulatory; the distribution of personnel by shift; and the characteristics of the patients residing in the homes. These data will be invaluable in judging proposals for establishing guidelines for staffing of nursing homes. (Author/DB)",

In Rhodesia, full-time short literacy courses were held in June and July 1970, as a means of improving the technical efficiency of savings clubs and as a possible starting point for a broad program of adult education, starting with agricultural development (see ED 044 596). The agricultural &quot;package program&quot; was organized as part of the literacy follow-up program, the participants being those who were members of savings clubs, but not necessarily those who had attended the literacy course, and who could grow one or one-half acre  of maize. The four major steps of the crop production were: (1) land preparation, (2) planting, (3) post-planting operations, and (4) grain storage. Though still in its early phases, the advantages of a &quot;package&quot; type program are that members of the project receive specific advice, and they have access to the loan financing necessary to purchase recommended agricultural inputs, which are available locally at a cost less than that of other suppliers. The long-term aim is for the savings clubs to develop into full credit unions that can finance agricultural development by loans to members. (DB)",

Much effort has been invested to devise schemes of optimal instruction with respect to suitable criteria. Yet, what is needed is a theory which prescribes how learning can be improved, i.e., a theory of instruction. The present study is motivated by the absence of adequate formalization of individual and item differences. The results of the study demonstrate unequivocally that the One-Element Model (OEM) with the heterogeneity provision is still a fairly accurate model. More significant is the observation that individual differences have a first order effect on the predictive power of simple stochastic models. In addition, the hypothesis was confirmed that the heterogeneity  assumption increases the predictive power of simple learning models and has a sizable effect on their learning properties. Finally, in the context of computer-assisted instruction in elementary mathematics, results demonstrated that asymptotic performance data can be accounted for successfully by probablistic automation models with few parameters.

To opt for controlling inflation means a delay in dealing with an already serious poverty problem. Suggestions for dealing with the inflation-unemployment dilemma are classified into 2 groups: (1) those which seek to remove the causes; and (2) those which focus on the symptoms. This paper specifically addresses itself to the question of whether, in dealing with the symptoms via public employment programs, the dilemma is worsened. A simple derivation of the inflation-unemployment trade-off (known as the Phillips Curve) is presented. It is then used to analyze the potential effects of public employment on the  trade-off. It is concluded that income guarantees do have inflationary costs; however, the authors do feel that, whenever possible, job vacancies should be filled via public employment programs. (TL)",

The potential costs, benefits, and operating economics are discussed. Needed educational reorganization is dealt with on several levels: (1) the Information System for Vocational Decisions (ISVD) which is basically an inquiry system, will function optimally only in a school climate where inquiry is the major pedagogy; (2) an ISVD program will require that books, films and computer console arrangements be effectively coordinated; and (3) an ISVD program ideally will be available to people other than students in places other than schools. Counselor attitudinal changes  needed for effective implementation of a computerized guidance program, as well as the resultant demands on counselor training, conclude the paper. (TL)",

The counselor's knowledge and skill are used in the IRA classroom to achieve affective behaviors related to objectivity, openness, self-directedness, curiosity, and respect for others. In this series of 5 brief papers, the IRA group work approach is explicated in various of its aspects: (1) the counselor and teacher's re-defined role; (2) students' new behaviors in a student-centered classroom; and (3) the advantages and disadvantages of this new learning  strategy.

Motivation to avoid failure is hypothesized to be positively related to frequency of cheating and negatively to advance preparation for an examination. Preliminary studies to determine whether satisfactory self-report measures of cheating could be devised are described. The method, which utilized 44 male and 68 female undergraduates, is described and included administration of a  group thematic apperceptive measure of Need for Achievement, the Test Anxiety Questionnaire, and a questionnaire on cheating. Information on age, sex, religion, draft status and grade-point-average was requested, and an index of previous cheating frequency obtained.

Two related concepts are discussed: (1) pupil control ideology, conceptualized along a continuum ranging from \"custodialism\" to \"humanism;\" and (2) organizational climate, also arrayed along a continuum from open to closed. It is hypothesized that schools with open climates, and teachers and principals serving in relatively open schools, will be significantly more humanistic in pupil control ideology than schools with closed climates, or teachers and principals serving in closed climates. Two measurement instruments, the Pupil Control Ideology form (PCI) and the Organizational  Climate Description Questionnaire (OCDQ) are briefly described. These were used to collect data on 45 elementary schools in 30 school districts. Results indicate that public elementary schools with open climates are significantly more humanistic in pupil control ideology than those with closed climates.

Thirty-six matched family triads, half with sons hospitalized for a schizophrenic reaction and half with sons hospitalized for medical reasons, comprised the sample. All families were administered the S-D and the Shipley-Hartford Vocabulary Test. Data analyses were conducted. Results support the assumption that, for schizogenic families, members of the same family are similar where cognitive organization is concerned. Their cognitive structure is idiosyncratic and not shared by others. It is suggested that children raised  in normal families learn generalized, socially shared ways of construing other people and the world around them.

One deals with the amount of interaction between blacks and whites on the school grounds; the other concerns their attitudes toward each other. Interaction was measured, through observation during the 3rd, 8th and 13th weeks of the semester. Low frequencies of interaction were obtained throughout the semester. The conclusion of the authors is that the merger resulted in mutual exposure of the races, but not in integration in any real sense. Measures of racial attitudes suggest improvement in this area, as well as in the area of tolerance. A brief discussion of the findings concludes that the most salient task for school systems  engaged in racial mergers is to plan programs that result in integration in more than an administrative sense.

Specifically, it is hypothesized that censorship of a speech which advocates a particular position arouses reactance in a person who could have heard the talk, producing a tendency for him to change his attitude on the issue toward greater agreement with the censored position. Thirty-six subjects were assigned to one of 3 conditions: (1) no censor; (2) censor own position; and (3) censor opposing position. Results offer  support for the hypothesis.

        "description":"This paper is an analysis of some of the literature concerning group mediated risk taking. Jhangiani explores Brown's V-theory, which states that members of a society try to realize its cultural ideals in their behavior; Nordhoy's theory of cultural values, which states that \"In the group, the impact of values which are commonly accepted in the culture to which the subjects belong will be reinforced;\" and Marquis' and Reitz' theory of risk, that 2 independent forces (expected value maximization and uncertainty reduction) affect group outcomes in risk situations. He critizes Brown on the fact that the theory is not stated in a fashion designed to facilitate the derivation and testing of strong hypotheses, Nordhoy on the grounds that he never defines \"cultural values\", and Marquis  and Reitz on the charge that they have not specified the behavioral analogues of the 2 independent variables. Yet, in the final analysis, he believes the Marquis and Reitz attempt has an adequate behavioral base and just might turn out to be the sleeper on the subject. (Author/TA)",

        "description":"Most students, perhaps over 90 percent, can master what teachers have to teach them, and it is the task of instruction to find the means which will enable students to master the subject under consideration. A basic task is to determine what is meant by mastery of the subject and to search for methods and materials which will enable the largest proportion of students to attain such mastery. That is, the basic task in education is to find strategies which will take individual differences into consideration but in such a way as to promote the fullest development of the individual. The thesis of this paper is that, to promote mastery learning, 5 variables must be dealt with effectively: (1) aptitude for kinds of learning, viewed as the amount of time required by the learner to attain  mastery of the task; (2) quality of instruction, viewed in terms of its approaching the optimum for a given learner; (3) ability to understand instruction, i.e., to understand the nature of the task and the procedures to follow; (4) perseverance, the amount of time one is willing to spend in learning; and (5) time allowed for learning, the key to mastery.

        "description":"Test anxiety is of particular significance in education in light of its debilitative effect on test scores and the implications and longranged effects of test results on the individual lives of the school children. This research is concerned with test anxiety of children under different test conditions. Subjects were 4th and 6th grade students who ranked math as most difficult and spelling as easiest among school subjects. They were given the Test Anxiety Scale for Children (TASC) under 3 conditions, in conjunction with the math test (difficult), with the spelling test (easy), and with no test. Administration was arranged to control for ordering effects. It was found that a significant difference between the means of the TASC under easy and difficult test conditions occurred. It  was also determined that in repeated use of the TASC a significant ordering effect occurs, that is, the repeated TASC score becomes increasingly socially desirable. However, the significant difference between easy and difficult test conditions occurred in spite of this tendency. The significance of these findings indicate the possible use of the TASC to determine specific test anxiety under differing conditions. (Author)",

Over 12,000 students at 20 colleges in the New York area were questioned. Students using marijuana or other illegal drugs at the time of the survey perceived their parents (1) as using more drugs; and (2) as being more tolerant to their own experimentation than students who had used drugs in the past or had never used them. The data show the existence of a relationship between students' behavior and their perceptions of their parents' attitudes and practices. It is evident that parallel data from the parents is needed to establish whether the children's  perceptions (1) are accurate; or (2) are distorted to provide a rationalization for their behavior.

Little is known about consequences of such instructional uniformity on learning, emotional growth and interpersonal relations. Three basic experiments were conducted. The first study varied the amount of information available to 12 groups each consisting of 5 3rd-grade girls who were performing identical tasks; significantly more comparison behavior was found in the condition of greater cognitive unclarity. The second study assigned 30 groups of 5 girls each to 3 conditions which differed in degree of similarity among activities to be performed by the pupils; expectations were confirmed that comparison behavior is a  function of task-similarity. The 3rd study explored comparison behavior among 10 boys' groups and 10 girls' groups and interpreted differences found in terms of differential confidence and competence. All 3 studies demonstrated the occurrence of large amounts of comparison behavior and suggest a pattern of association among this behavior and achievement-related behavior in elementary school children.

Results indicate that while there may be a tendency for PP groups (except for Wheel Women) to show an improvement on time and messages, this improvement failed to reach a level of statistical significance. Ratings of their own performance did indicate that PP groups had higher morale at a borderline level of significance. Other results confirm previous reports of the superiority  of All-Channel and Circle nets on time and morale, wheels on use of fewer messages to solve problems. Interaction effects for sex and net were significant showing women superior on All-Channel and Circle nets, men on Wheels on time and messages.

Idiosyncrasy credit represents status and allows for behavior which may exceed the \"limits\" set by the common expectancies of a group. The specific purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between idiosyncrasy credit and task competency, external status, recent idiosyncratic behavior, duration of group affiliation, appearance and grooming, speaking ability, and selected personality and demographic variables. The data obtained in this study indicated that there was a strong positive relationship between idiosyncrasy credit and (1) task competency and (2) status  external to the group. Such findings concur with Hollander's (1958) theory of idiosyncrasy credit. The relationships between idiosyncrasy credit and (1) idiosyncratic behavior and (2) appearance and grooming were somewhat inconsistent, and it was therefore concluded that such variables may fluctuate according to the situation. A positive relationship between idiosyncrasy credit and speaking ability was found; yet, speaking ability was highly correlated with the items which comprised task competency. (Author/TA)",

A prediction of special interest was that there would be a concept rule x saliency interaction. A 2 x 2 x 3 design combined concept rule (conjunctive, inclusive disjunctive), saliency (\"high\" and \"low\" determined by mean performance of \"SS\" in preliminary research), and stimulus variety (intradimensional shift, interdimensional shift, and no shift). Sixty college students completed a warm-up problem, a training problem, a shift problem (or no shift in the case of controls), and a transfer-to-new-stimuli problem. Dependent measures were analyzed. Focusing measures represented a technique for separating aptitude and attentional  factors in concept learning. Results suggest that (1) traditional expectations of the conjunctive rule, which indicate that the most direct test yields the greatest information, do not apply to 2-dimension concept attainment tasks; and (2) greatest focusing on a transfer task can be achieved with small shift paradigms (change in solution only). Methodological implications include application of regression analyses to focus strategy research. (Author/TA)",

The study types used were (1) normative, (2) career, and (3) shadow. Data for the first two studies were gathered from questionnaires completed by over 1,200 assistant principals, while shadow study data stem from observations of assistant principals at work. From the shadow studies, researchers discovered that it is essentially the assistant principal who makes the school go. The normative study revealed that some disharmony exists between the way an assistant principal understands the range and character of his duties and the way a principal sees them. The career study disclosed that most assistant  principals, male and female, derived much less satisfaction from their tenures as assistant principals than from their years spent in other assignments. Researchers concluded that a reexamination of the entire process of administrative selection needs to take place, that educational training programs should be established, and that a more systematic procedure should be developed to deal with the selection and career progression of those in educational leadership roles.

The Essex County Educational Evaluation Council monitored instruction to determine its quality; determined the extent to which each of the program components met its stated objectives; assessed the attitudes of parents, teachers, and students toward the program; and determined the degree of success of the program's organization, leadership, budget implementations, and other administrative facets.

Approximately 4 papers were presented in each of the areas of: Institutional Planning and Theory Models; Campus Climates; Institutional  Innovations; Faculty and the Institution; Methodology and Assessment in Evaluation of Output; Institutional Budget and Cost Analysis; and Synthetic Output by Simulation. Because of space limitations in the Proceedings, some of the 32 papers were condensed from the original and many of the tables, charts and graphs were omitted.

The importance of the development of an inquiry-conceptual process of reflective reasoning in order to equip the gifted student for social understanding is stressed. Program themes and structure for each of the grade levels are discussed and subject matter skills and teaching strategies are looked at. The monograph concludes with a summation of the projected design of the new social science  framework for California as taken from the findings of the California Statewide Social Sciences Study Committee.

An experimental group of 30 institutionalized children were given the supplementary lessons at a rate of three per week. The lessons, based on the brainstorming technique, were felt to encourage ideational fluency, familiarity with the principles of change, improved observational ability, increased sensitivity, and originality through improvisation. Significant improvement was noted for all but the factor of figural elaboration. It was concluded that enhancement of creative performance was feasible in institutionalized educable mentally handicapped students. The value of  the brainstorming technique (in which the pupils' ideas were allowed to flow freely) as a specific teaching tool was stressed as having future educational program implications. The verbal functioning was found to be improved and the improvement was felt to be a reflection of a transition from convergent to divergent modes of thinking. The 30 lesson plans used in the experiment are included in the appendix. (CD)",

James Lent discusses the principles of behavior modification and the habilitation of deaf blind children while Pat Aycock utilized case histories to consider shaping behavior of multiply handicapped crib patients. The effectiveness of using light as a motivator and reinforcer is mentioned by Mrs. Aycock. Dr. Thomas looks at certain behavior that can be altered by medical intervention. Dr. Dayan discusses some of the administrative roadblocks encountered when trying to initiate a program for deaf blind children. Throughout the proceedings, the need to call upon diverse resources to bring efficiency to the education of the children is stressed.  Jack English summarizes the participant's presentations and draws lines through points brought up by more than one speaker, such as the problem of hesitancy among professionals and others to attempt to work with the children.

Although pertaining primarily to the gifted and talented program on the elementary and junior high levels, the manual could be adapted to the senior high program also. Discussion of the philosophy and objectives of the Itinerant Resource Teacher Program for Gifted Children indicates that the itinerant teacher acts as a resource person to the regular teacher as well as to the children, thus supplementing rather than supplanting the regular teacher. A section in question and answer format explains the concept of the itinerant resource teacher, and a description is given of ways to implement the program in a school setting.  Several sample schedules are presented to illustrate how the program might be implemented in a school system. Also covered are additional professional responsibilities of the resource teacher and some factors to consider in the process of evaluating both the students' progress and the program. (KW)",

The report indicates that GT pupil selections were in accordance with public school laws; that the number of GT Teacher Allotments for 1969-70 (240) increased by only one over the  previous year; that the gifted curriculum did not appear recognizably different from the general curriculum; and that, despite rapid growth of the GT program in recent years, an estimated 81.3% of pupils eligible for GT programs are not placed in such.

The historical background of past and existing education for the retarded deaf is presented. A study was begun in early 1970 which concerned services for and incidence of deaf retardates among the state's estimated 29,000 institutionalized retarded. Based on samples of educable and trainable persons aged 6 to 30 in two state schools, what was felt to be a minimum percent of .07 was determined to be the number who had hearing losses. No existing programs within schools for the retarded or for the deaf were adequately serving these people.

The behavior modification procedures and individualized programing used in the classes are discussed. Research conducted with a 13-year old girl who showed a decline in reading performance is reported. In order to eliminate her bizarre answers to oral comprehension questions, the teacher and an aide implemented a series of different reaction patterns involving the amount of attention paid to right and wrong answers. Results showed that the longer the amount of attention paid, the more the frequency of the response increased (i.e., lots of attention  paid to right answers, short attention to wrong resulted in a low proportion of errors and vice versa). A combination of long attention and praise for correct answers and short attention for incorrect ones produced the lowest percent of error. Caution in dispensing attention is suggested. (RJ)",

Evidence was found that the second year's program was more effective in modifying conduct and in increasing academic achievement. Research was also done in resource rooms, showing this arrangement to have advantages suggesting greater  cost-efficiency than the special class, and in fact resource rooms using behavior modification techniques were found to be the most cost effective, currently available method for the treatment of behavior problem children in public schools.

Of the 20 families who attended the first group meeting, only six attended more than two sessions although 10 others offered what were considered to be good reasons for discontinuance. Individual case studies are cited which reveal the immediacy of the changes in most instances, and tables and graphs report this information. Projects that were only marginally significant or not amenable to  statistical evaluation are also included. Conclusions were that parents can be trained in precise behavioral management and can become independent and creative in its use.

The test scores were also employed to generate step-wise regression equations predicting the reading and the total scores of the Wide Range Achievement Test. Experimental and control groups were set up, with the experimental group receiving remedial activity to enhance sensory integration for 25 to 40 minutes per day, 5 days a week, for a period of not less than 5 months. Post-testing of the remaining 128 children occurred 1 year later, and the subjects were divided into groups with generalized dysfunction or  auditory-language deficits. Results showed that academic gains may have been related to enhanced sensory integration. The experimental group showed an increased ability to blend sounds and auditorily to remember and reproduce a sequence of numbers. Indications were that the learning disabled child may be helped by a program designed to enhance sensory integration, especially through brain stem mechanisms. (RJ)",

        "description":"A programing language called ELASTIC (Expandible Language for Aiding Student Instruction in Computing) has been developed which incorporates many of the basic features and concepts of a typical assembly language. ELASTIC was designed for use in a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) undergraduate course in computer programing and was written in a version of FORTRAN. It has a modular design and is suitable for a batch-process time-shared computer facility. A prototype (CAI) course to teach ELASTIC was developed. A formative evaluation of the course resulted in the addition of facilities for processing student responses, removal or clarification of ambiguous statements, and expansion of curriculum dealing with programing techniques and procedures. The revised instructional program  underwent a summative evaluation in which the CAI course was compared with a lecture course and the batch-processing mode was compated with the use of a teletype. Among the results of this evaluation were that CAI groups completed the course instruction twice as fast as the lecture groups and that members of the CAI/teletype group ran a far greater number of jobs through the computer than did students in any other group. Supplementary information about the instructional program and about ELASTIC is appended. (JY)",

The course offers tutorial help in the areas of exponentiation, logarithms, and dimensional analysis, and drill in a number of basic mathematical skills. An attempt was made to allow the student to control his own course of study when using the program. To validate this approach, an experiment was conducted which separated students into five groups, each with different degrees of control over the course flow. An evaluation of course effectiveness and student attitudes was undertaken at the same time. It was concluded that the program is an effective instructional experience for the students who participated and that student attitudes concerning the program are generally  favorable. In the area of student control, the results suggest that if students are to be given the option of deciding whether or not to enter a particular instructional segment, they should also be given control options within the instructional segment. If this is not the case, there is a tendency for students who need the instruction to avoid entering the instructional segment. Increased student control failed to improve student attitudes concerning the program. (JY)",

Three classes of computer tutor are described: rigid, generative, and knowledgeable. These classes are distinguished by an increase of the interactions among tutor and student and a decrease of the control of the tutor over the tutorial environment. Full partnership between tutor and student could be achieved with the help of programs that understand natural language. \"Review in CAI: The Problem and an Implemented Solution\" discusses review of material, which is made necessary by human memory loss. The computer tutor that  incorporates review is built around performance programs that know what the student is to learn, generator programs that generate problems the student must learn to solve, and extensive diagnostic programs that guide the tutor in his interaction with the student. Borrowing compiler-writing techniques, a multi-level system for review has been implemented that avoids extra coding and repetition of material in identical form. (Author/JK)",

The state of epistemic curiosity was conceptualized as a transitory emotional or motivational condition of the student, the arousal level of which was expected to vary across time, both with the nature of the specific learning task and the student's personality characteristics. A high curiosity state level has been found to overcome a high anxiety level and thus to improve the conditions for learning. In order to assess the reliability and validity of the SCS two empirical studies were conducted with undergraduate students. The results of these studies, along with other supporting evidence indicated that the SCS was  potentially a valid measure of state curiosity. (JY)",

Results from the analysis of the final concept test data revealed that students performed equally well regardless of terminal device. Apparently the information load in the computer-managed instruction (CMI) system is sufficiently low to allow acceptable performance without the necessity for some form of memory support. The difference in error rate is interpreted to reveal a diminished effect of memory support on reducing errors. This effect of memory support has been found in cathode ray tubes using computer-assisted instruction (CAI) learning materials. The failure to  find this effect in this study is probably due to the difference in CMI and CAI, i.e., CMI does not present instructional material that may require some form of memory aid for effective learning. The CRT group completed the units earlier than did the teletype group. (Author/JK)",

We cannot assume that one method of teaching is correct for every teacher, for every subject, and even for one teacher at all times. This is especially true in use of audiovisual media. Various types of materials and various ways of presenting them are necessary. Following rigid rules of presentation can inhibit the valuable spontaneous reaction of the child. The student should have a chance to interpret the experiences these media bring him. Because many films used in schools are largely lectures, they do not allow the student to do this. These pictures lean heavily on the narrator's words for meaning. Such films limit the child's chance for interpretation by imposing other people's meanings on the  images. But many excellent new films, relying on techniques of the silent filmmakers of the 1920's, have little narration.

Concerning orientation, the best way to get a student to master the lesson is to ask questions shortly after the material has been presented.

These types of transformation allow measurement and isolation of  variables which can be used according to the objectives of the materials.

The nationwide implementation of telecommunications technology has caused dramatic changes in the use of television in the past 15 years since the 1970's. These changes were initiated when cable television was expanded into the large cities and sets were connected to neighborhood centers which had a channel capacity of up to 200 and large cassette libraries. Two-way instructional television began in 1973 with the use of a simple touch-tone pad connected to a computer at the other end. Then, in 1974, with the implementation of six pilot programs which used large capacity cable television systems in conjunction with the touch-tone pad, coupled with rapid expansion of video cassette players and governmental interest, a system was developed which  allowed television sets to be used as computer terminals. By 1980, the telecommunications system was well-developed, and made preschool, supplementary, and continuing education available. Now, in 1985, communication satellites are being used to interconnect three overlapping cable television systems (national, regional, and local), and to provide low cost, 24-hour service to all areas.

Support systems are grouped under the headings of technical support, pedagogical and logistical support, and administrative support and are further illustrated by examples under each heading: Technical support includes system-level software, language-level software, and research and development; pedagogical and logistical support is divided into curriculum material support, scheduling, and critical size; and administrative support covers teacher training, public relations, and economics. Within each example, three levels of complexity are given to alert educators to the fact that they are dealing  with a variety of constraints and to recommend that they take this into account in their planning and ultimate evaluation. The author draws on his experience with Project Solo, a program concerned with the use of interactive computing within conventional Secondary Schools, to point out that systems of inadequate complexity can interact on a total effort in a negative, but often hidden manner.

Two hypotheses were formulated. 1) People for whom the occupational role of the main character has a high prestige value will learn more factual information from the film and also change further in attitudes in the direction suggested by the film. 2) People who identify with the main character on the basis of shared institutional affiliation will also learn more and change in attitude toward the direction of the film. The procedure was to show audiences the film \"Keys of the Kingdom,\" in which the hero was a Catholic priest. Before seeing the film, audiences filled out a rank-order scale of occupational prestige and an  attitude scale measuring religious tolerance. After seeing the film, audiences filled out these two scales again as well as an information test based on the film. Results showed that the differences found were in the direction predicted by the hypotheses, but very few of them were statistically significant. (Author/JK)",

Fourteen versions of a film designed to teach the assembly of part of an anti-aircraft gun were prepared and shown to different groups of trainees. The study examined the following factors: 1) number of words of narration used to describe the action, 2) inclusion of a sequence explaining how the gun worked, 3) audience participation, in which trainees tried to assemble the gun at the same time the procedure was shown on screen, and 4) succinct treatment (the use of a concise but complete film presentation taken from an existing training film). The results showed that about 100 words per minute of film produced the most effective learning. Too few or too many words impeded instruction.  The sequence explaining how the gun worked did not improve performance in assembling it. Audience participation worked if the film went slowly enough to allow trainees to watch it and do the task too. Succinct treatment was ineffective. Simply using the technical names of parts in the film did not teach those names to the trainees. (Author/JK)",

In the first study, 148 subjects were divided into four response mode conditions: reading (R), covert, modified multiple choice, and constructed response (CR). All subjects were given a pretest, several administrations of two anxiety scales, the CAI administered material, and a posttest. Results showed that high trait and high state anxiety were associated; the CR group had significantly higher anxiety scores on technical materials; and the CR and R groups performed at the same level on technical materials, perhaps because the CR group was made more hostile by the length  of time required to learn the materials. For the second study, 128 students were divided into four groups: reading-short, reading-long, constructed response-short, and constructed response-long. Procedures were the same, with the addition of a hostility measure. The findings of this study were similar to those of the first study: High trait and state anxiety were associated, and the CR groups had higher levels of anxiety and hostility and poorer performance on technical materials than the R groups.

Results of analyses of the data suggest several points: Compared to children in the same age group ten years ago, children are spending more time watching television; differences in viewing time today seem less marked across comparisons between socio-economic status and ability groups; students have become more skeptical about the medium's content and have become more overtly hostile to commercials; television viewing is usually accompanied by other activities rather than being the center of attention. It was also found that the importance of television declines in the adolescent years when children  develop new social relationships and increasingly turn to music; the programs viewed by children are primarily programs produced for adult or family audiences, not specifically for children; cartoons, re-runs, and old movies are among the most popular with young children; and parental control of viewing appears to be a relatively weak factor, especially with children over six years of age.

The problems revealed by this investigation prompted the Subcommittee to contract with Dr. Kenneth Christiansen, Director of Television for the University of Florida, for consultation. Dr. Christiansen''s three major conclusions were that there was a need for coordination and planning, for a new base of funding, and for a state educational television authority. These recommendations were incorporated into a senate bill. The bill failed to pass the 1969 legislature. The Subcommittee subsequently revised the bill to include provision for more participation in  the field of public broadcasting, for cooperation with a proposed state telecommunications network, and for an advisory council composed of the managers of the state's educational television stations. In addition, closed circuit television was excluded from the scope of the bill, measures were recommended to guarantee that all material produced for instructional assistance by the educational television system would be made available to private schools, and sources of funding for the program were clarified.

Ninth graders were divided into two groups: One group received the standard course of English-language instruction; a second group had English-language instruction supplemented by a television program which presented the spoken language in natural context and in every day situations. The ninth graders who had the television experience showed a better understanding of English-language films and audio tapes, as well as better achievement in active speech. The contribution of  television to understanding from audio tapes proved to be particularly great in pupils whose IQ was less than 110.

Languages divide reality into different categories, and, in learning a second language, there may be interference from the native language in understanding the new categories. Linguistic anthropologists have been mapping out categories of cultural phenomena and performing an analysis of the semantic component, using such devices as the paradigm, the taxonomy, and distributional analysis to discover the system of knowledge built up around a people's view of the world. In language  instruction, lexical categories should receive systematic treatment and should be brought under the student's control on his route to native-like fluency in a foreign language. (VM)",

In Puerto Rico there is contact with an English-speaking country, but a lack of well-trained teachers and good facilities exists. There is also a difference in attitude toward learning English.

It deals in simple, kernel sentences and employs the theory that the semantic content of a sentence is the set of relationships between conceptual objects (represented by the words in it), which the sentence and its structure imply. The data base of the program is an arbitrary list of simple kernel sentences. The lexicon is a list of pairs; the first element is the word itself, and the second element is its definition--the first element a relation and the second a list of all things which are in the given relation to the word being defined. The structure of the question is also a simple kernel sentence. Through a hierarchical set of functions, the program is capable of taking a  kernel-sentence question and, based on its knowledge, providing a one-word answer (true, false, or don't know) accompanied by a copy of the internal semantic structure of the sentence, if any, from which the answer was deduced. The program's capabilities are not infinite, but further details could easily be added. Tables showing the data base, function truth tables, flow charts, and questions and answers are included along with a list of references. (VM)",

Two conclusions of the arguments presented here are: (1) \"do so\" always refers to at least the basic action of the verb (the conceptual elements which are always present or implied when it is used); and (2) the use of \"do so\" is based on the speaker's conception of the referent verb as an activity \"brought about,\" at least in part, by the sentence subject.

Writing topics should come from the students themselves. Teaching the procedure for using an outline is very important.

Too often English as a second language is taught in a vacuum and is generally taken to mean the choral repetition of rather colorless sentences which have little relationship to specific learning needs of Navaho children but which are somehow believed to reflect the \"structure\" of the language. Teacher training must be improved so that teachers may develop sufficient understanding of the English language and of language instruction methodology.

        "description":"The ability to anticipate elements in sequence is the foundation of all language skills. Because of its naturally high redundancy, it is almost always possible in the normal use of language to partially predict what will come next in a sequence of elements. The central feature of language processing is expectancy for successive elements. A very important question in second language instruction is determining how to teach students the skill of anticipating elements in sequence. This can best be done with materials in which meaningfulness is an element, syntactic structure is given a subordinate position, and the situational interaction of the people using the language is given prominence.

        "description":"To cope with the bilingual education problems in a community such as Rock Point on the Navajo Reservation in New Mexico, a program has been developed to teach English as a foreign language within a bilingual setting. The goal is coordinate bilingualism in which each language has a separate but equal status, and the program is a \"transitional\" one in which Navajo is used as a means to enable children to go to school in English. The program involves team-teaching in two languages with the English-language teacher and the Navajo-language teacher conducting activities at opposite ends of the classroom simultaneously, each working with a relatively small group at a time. In the structure recommended for this program, the Navajo-language teachers are in charge and, in the lower grades  especially, they teach content. The English-language teacher is teaching a foreign language, and teaching content is second to teaching English. The English teacher's goal is to make it possible for Navajo children to cope successfully with education in English. (VM)",

It discusses three main kinds of investigations--studies of the comprehension of individual words and suprasegmentals, studies of information gain, and studies of the comprehension of syntactic processes--as well as testing techniques and the specific syntactic and morphological processes considered. Results of particular studies are given. The second part of the paper covers the necessity of treating language as a structure rather than as individual words when testing comprehension, and it recommends a conceptual-category  approach which considers the relationship between formal linguistic processes and cognitive relations by showing how well language is comprehended in specific language-use situations.

The sociolinguists' work shows that the use of nonstandard phonological and grammatical features varies according to one's socioeconomic status, ethnic background, speech context, age, and sex. Using the sociolinguists' data for several phonological and grammatical variables in Negro speech, it is possible to make statistical generalizations concerning particular types of speakers. With such generalizations in mind it is possible, by analyzing the literary representation of the Negro nonstandard dialect appearing in three books, to determine the accuracy of these representations. The books considered here are Shane Stevens'&quot;Go  Down Dead&quot; (1966), Warren Miller's &quot;The Cool World&quot; (1959), and Claude Brown's &quot;Manchild in the Promised Land&quot; (1965).

(1) A significantly higher number of 1970 seniors were undecided about their immediate or long-range plans after graduation. (2) There was a substantial decline in the proportion of seniors planning to continue their education immediately after graduation; many desired a 1- to 3-year transitional period before making a professional commitment. (3) Their graduate school plans differed substantially from those who graduated 4 or 5 years earlier; fewer planned academic careers, while more were interested in attending medical or law school. (4) Many found it much harder to find the kind of  job desired, and some actively sought positions that made few intellectual demands on them. The report also offers some recommendations that include: (1) increased time off before starting college; (2) more opportunity for field work related to the student's interests; (3) increased term-time and more attention to providing students with summer employment; and (4) more interaction between students and professionals in fields other than higher education.

Public and governmental acknowledgement of the Periphery's size and significance should lead to a re-evaluation of educational priorities, to innovation within Core institutions, and to a new understanding of the variety of alternative possibilities for individual learning and for public policy.

The educational system must distribute its benefits in certain ways, to certain people and for certain purposes. These factors all relate to problems of access, quality and goals. The American educational system is sequential, offers schooling up to a level that everyone must complete, and is selective beyond that level. No society has been able to expand its educational enterprise to include participation of the lower class in proportion to their numbers until the system is first saturated by the upper and middle classes. Thus, as the group of last entry approaches the target level of education, the target moves. This type of growth at the  top results in more people spending more of their lives in the educational system, but not in fundamental changes in the system. Universalizing higher education makes it not a choice but a necessity. We should consider moving toward a national policy that provides for each individual a litigious claim to 15 years of education at public expense. But there should be no requirement that the years be spent consecutively in formal core or peripheral institutions, nor any but the most general restrictions as to content. (JS)",

There are 3 basic alternatives which appear more desirable than the present system: create a genuine meritocracy that would ensure that credentials reflect abilities of all persons, at all times, and in all places; abandon the use of credentials and evaluate actual job performance; or combine the first 2 alternatives so that  persons could be judged according to a wide range of accomplishments and attributes.

The schools' client population can be sorted into 3 main groups: the makers and the non-makers (both of whom see the schools as vehicles for attaining adequate success) and the post-makers. The post-makers take material well-being for granted and reject the traditional image of the schools as a means for achieving economic success and happiness. There are different types of disaffection: that of the non-makers who fail to make it through the schools and that of the post-makers who are dissatisfied with the schools' purposes. Schools are dominated by the makers who are likely to view non-makers as ignorant failures and post-makers as unrealistic or dangerous. The 2 latter groups, in turn, view makers as  sell-outs. Disaffection and conflict in the schools is likely to continue and the post-maker group is likely to grow. Policy prescriptions are more in the nature of \"don't\" than \"do's.\" It is clearly important, however, to maintain a truly pluralistic school system and, in seeking new purposes for schools, to keep in mind that it is more important that post-makers find a purpose in life than that schools find a new reason for being. \"But there ought to be a connection.\" (JS)",

Measures were: parents' reports of current (1968) income; parents' estimates of 1969 income; and predictions of 1969 income made by application of least squares regression parameters to parents' estimate of income. Two types of accuracy were considered: that of prediction assessed by the correlation between current or estimated income and the actual 1969 income. Analysis indicated that the best single predictor was estimated income, followed closely by current income. The accuracy of each income measure was also investigated by assessing median discrepancies between parents' contribution associated with each  income measure and the contribution associated with actual 1969 income. Current and estimated income result with about equal frequency in substantial undercalculations of parents' contribution. But use of current rather than estimated income would result in substantial overcalculations for approximately 31,000 CSS families. Needs analysis procedures relying on current or estimated income, therefore, place low income families at a disadvantage by overstating their future year income. (JS)",

It is recommended that the expected contribution from low income families be reduced by about $200; that contributions from middle income families remain generally the same; and that the expected contribution from high income families be  substantially increased.

The form is designed to collect information about a family's income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Post-secondary institutions using the PCS instruct aid candidates to forward the completed form to the CSS for analysis. Following evaluation of the PCS, the CSS estimates the family's financial need according to standards established by member colleges and universities. A statement and report are then sent to the institution or scholarship agency designated by the candidate. As a result of processing PCSs, the CSS gathers a large body of data about student financial aid candidates. Annual summary statistics, a by-product of the  processing system, are prepared so that the CSS staff can evaluate and refine the needs analysis system. The summary statistics also provide insight into demographic and economic changes in the national CSS population, and enable college personnel to compare characteristics of their financial aid candidates with those of the national population.

Among the major questions considered are: what are the policies by which accountable support can effectively advance scientific inquiry in the common interest; and how can inaccurate conceptions of both necessary freedom for scientific research and the accountability of funds be prevented from stifling the fruits of research? The discussion covers: The Role of Basic Research and the Scientist in Mid-Twentieth Century America; The Heritage  Available in 1939; World War II, The OSRD Creates the Interrelated System; The Government-University Alliance, 1945-1950; Maturation of the System, 1950-1957; After Sputnik; Profile of the Government's Present Role in Science; Principles for the Project System; and The Role of the Institutions of Higher Learning in the Operation of the Project System.

Information was obtained on their SCAT scores, GPA, major, division, age, classification, and parental education, and they were administered Pace's College and University Environmental Scale (CUES). Their responses showed perceptions of the college environment along 7 dimensions: practicality, community, scholarship, awareness, propriety, campus morale, and teacher quality and faculty-student relationship. Employing  the psychometric process of scoring, the findings showed a marked difference between the residents of quiet and conventional halls. The quiet hall resident was usually an older student, generally an upper classman, who perceives his environment as characterized by intellectuality, scholastic discipline, consideration for others, and propriety.

Based on other research on this topic the hypothesis was that there would be no significant difference in academic performance among the groups. A questionnaire was sent to 247 students on probation asking them about their employment in terms of location and weekly hours worked. Two hundred and thirty-eight responded, of whom 161 were not employed, 33 were employed on-campus, and 44 were employed off-campus. A one-way analysis of variance was applied  utilizing Duncan's New Multiple Range Test. The cumulative GPA prior to the fall semester was compared to the 1970-71 fall semester GPA, and the differences between these for each of the three groups were noted. No demonstrable differences in GPA's among the three groups were found when the students worked 20 hours or less a week. This, however, was not true for those who worked more than 20 hours. They received a significantly lower GPA. (AF)",

Low-tuition benefits primarily the middle-class student, and society benefits most from the lower grade-levels of education. Low tuition has some serious consequences: (1) it causes a rationing problem; (2) it disregards student motivation; (3) it raises dangers to the autonomy of the academy; (4) it threatens the existence of several private institutions; and (5) it results  in a series of inequities for youth not continuing their education.

Today's student is seriously concerned about his education and how it will prepare him for the future; he is no longer just a spectator at a lecture, and knows that education is not restricted to the classroom. The College Union, which early advocated education outside the classroom, is currently becoming one of the most important teaching stations in the university, and it is essential that the Union stay abreast of changing student needs. Yet, at this time of need for new Union buildings or renovations of old ones, higher education is facing a financial crisis and money is short everywhere. In planning for a new or  renovated Union the following principles should be considered: (1) the need of a good planning team that includes student, faculty, and administrative representatives; (2) a study of the campus environment; (3) the development of a program; and (4) the design of a facility that fits the environment and is designed for function, change, flexibility, education, and economy of operation.

Criterion groups contained 1,031 men in 16 major fields and 780 men planning to enter 10 career fields. SVIB Occupational and Basic Scales were compared, using both univariate and discriminant function predictive methods. For each of the four predictor-criterion conditions a moderately high level of prediction was possible. The Basic Scales, as a predictor set, performed as well as the Occupational Scales. To indicate the interest similarities of scholars who entered different career fields, criterion groups were plotted in the reduced discriminant space. The  results support the use of the Basic Scales in research and counseling and exemplify the utility of the discriminant function method for the validation of interest measures. (Author)",

The educational and career plans they had as 11th graders in high school were compared with the plans they indicated on a 1-page questionnaire administered about 2 1/2 years later. In analyzing the stability of their plans several student characteristics were considered: sex, measured academic ability, parental income, geographic region of residence, and high school average. The plans of the blacks were also compared with those of nonblack subjects with similar characteristics. (AF)",

The elements of the systems approach to the learning process include: (1) the development of a rationale for the existence of a course; (2) the specification of short- and long-range objectives for learning activities; (3) the pre-evaluation of the learner; (4) the use of a variety of instructional strategies for the learning activities; and (5) the postevaluation of learning activities.

A self-description inventory was administered at the beginning of a 6-month training program, again near the end of the program, and then on a third occasion several years after departure from the training program. A total of 347 individuals were examined as both entering and graduating students. In addition, a total of 757 individuals were examined as both graduating students and again years later after departing from the Officer Candidate School. It was found that several scales that measured change during training also differentiated between graduating and  nongraduating students, thus indicating that the effects of selection and training were, to a substantial degree, similar. Significant differences were also found between the scores of graduating students who remained in the Army and those who departed. The significance of these findings from the point of view of a better understanding of the training process and of the implication for Officer Candidate School policy was discussed. (Author)",

It discusses: (1) women as students: their test scores, grades, and academic motivation; (2) women's career aspirations, with research pointing out that high ability women show abundant aspiration when not faced with the instruction to be \"realistic\"; (3) the relationship between parent's socio-economic status (SES) and their aspirations for their children, with those from low SES having much higher educational aspirations for their sons than for their daughters; and (4) the changing attitudes of women undergraduates toward their future role. The largest reservoir of academically well qualified young people who are not now attending college are those from the lower  socioeconomic levels. The most disadvantaged of all by both SES and sex are Spanish American women. The most lopsided sex distribution is in the universities, because women have tended to go to former teacher colleges to become schoolteachers; and in the community colleges, which draw their student population from the lower socioeconomic levels. To rectify this situation improved career counseling and a change of university practices that discriminate against women is in order. (AF)",

Most studies on teaching methods conclude that there are no significant differences between the various teaching methods and student achievement. The problem with these studies is that they have concentrated on teaching and have ignored learning and the learner. There are many omissions in the research, such as what courses and subject matter areas promote critical thinking and a spirit of inquiry; and how students can be helped to become independent learners. Some studies in the past few years have begun to probe the underlying complexities of teaching-learning. One of the best examples of the new approach for both conceptualizing the issues and investigating them is the  Instructional Gestalt. Many of the recently introduced approaches to instruction can be grouped into three categories: (1) personalized, individualized to process instruction (P-I-P); (2) experiential learning; and (3) acceleration programs. Results of this recent research points out that the role of the instructor must be altered and broadened. There can be a dramatic decrease in dispensing content and lecturing in the classroom without any decrease in the quality of learning. (AF)",

It summarizes research that has been done on academic reform and the resistance to it and speculates what this research implies for future practice. Academic or curricular change is first of all organizational change and colleges and universities are organized and run in such a way as to prevent interference, meddling, and rapid change. Like other organizations, they change as the result of pressure for change, and they adapt their operations to retain equilibrium. The major variables that determine this process of adjustment are: (1) individual, and refer to the advocates interested in change; (2) environmental, and refer to the resources available for change; and (3) structural, and refer to the openess of  institutions to change. There are two alternative paths for reform: (1) change the structure from within; and (2) leave the institution and establish a competitive institution that embodies one's views. The most effective reformers ride the crest of reform, and the 1970's seem propitious for effecting curricular change. (AF)",

The Ph.D. degree was defined in the questionnaire in terms of 30 abilities or skills and the recipients were requested to estimate the extent to which they had attained each of these skills while in graduate school and how  useful it had been subsequently. Analyses were also made relating these judgments and type of present employment, graduate school major, and preparation received for college teaching. Special attention was given to the subsequent careers and reactions of persons who participated in the Ford Fund College Teaching internship program in the mid-fifties. Comparisons were also made between the responses given by Ph.D.s in a study conducted in 1949 and those given in a 1965 study. (Author/AF)",

Following the description is a consideration of possible alternatives within the contract system and of variations to tenure adopted by other campuses. At Hampshire, academic freedom is valued but not linked to the procedural concept of life tenure. Terms of an initial contract are 3, 4, or 5 years; longer options are generally granted to senior faculty members. Faculty are reappointed for not less than 3 nor more than 7 years. The experimental nature of the College combined with the policy of requiring candidates to write a proposal specifying expectations of their performance over the contract period  play important roles in faculty commitment. In its examination of reappointment procedures, the College is focusing attention on finding ways to assure due process while using as many evaluative sources of a faculty member's performance as possible. The 2 major questions involve length of contract and uncertainty about trust among trustees, administrators, faculty and students in a college lacking a traditional governance structure. (JS)",

Chapter 2 reviews the history of PhD-producing schools and its effect on geographic distributions of population. The problem of a state-by-state versus a national point of view with respect to education and employment of high level personnel is described in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 seeks to explain the dynamics of migration by analysis of a large number of state characteristics related to migration. Chapter 5 explores follow-up data  collected and maintained by the National Science Foundation for its National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel. Geographic migration, employment, and principal work activities actually experienced are compared with expectations at the time of PhD graduation.

        "description":"Among many diverse pressures on higher education, there are 5 major stresses which together have produced a crisis in university management: the growing student population, rising costs, a rapidly changing demand for programs, student demands for relevance, and an increasingly repressive public environment. Although some academicians fear the application of business management methods to academic administration, their fears are attributable to a limited view of management process. One of the features of management is systems analysis which rests on 3 elements: a model or simulation of the organization's behavior; a continuous planning cycle (typically incorporating program budgeting); and a coordinated &quot;management information system. &quot;A carefully developed automated information  system is needed to process data flowing into this system. The management system's character must be precisely tailored to 2 parameters: the existing institutional profile (size, traditions, strengths, anticipated growth, organizational structure) and the future institutional profile (goals and objectives). The University of Houston is an example of an institution that is undertaking a major drive toward implementation of management systems. (JS)",

Responses to questionnaires mailed to graduate students who received the NDEA Fellowships starting in the 1960-61 and 1961-62 academic year and to a group of \"comparable\" graduate students form the basis of this report. The results indicate that the Program has been fulfilling its sponsors' objectives. A sizeable majority of responding NDEA Fellows completed the doctorate and entered full-time employment as college or university  teachers. Moreover, these NDEA Fellows required less time than did other graduate students to complete the doctorate. Even those without the doctorate had contributed to Program objectives in that nearly half were employed in academic institutions.

Such institutions would provide a solution to many of the problems facing higher education today--problems of accessibility, effectiveness, homogeneity, rigidity, credentials, and social isolation--and become catalysts for social change. The HSI is based on the belief that traditional professional training fails to foster an interest in human service, to relate courses to practical work, or to involve students in academic decision making  regarding their own careers. The work-study program of the HSI would offer an intensive field experience complementary to academic studies, make a BA available in 2 years, and provide a broad curriculum. The paper discusses the HSI's program, objectives, prospective students and faculty, evaluation and certification procedures, and relationship with traditional graduate schools. (JS)",

Many colleges require that students who score below a pre-determined level on college placement or reading exams be placed in developmental or remedial classes. Computers are often used to find students with reading difficulties and place them in appropriate classes. The range in reading ability in junior colleges is often ten or more levels. This spread in abilities and interests of students makes it necessary to have multi-level instruction in class. Each student is assigned a starting level and proceeds at his own rate through a reading-skill sequence. Because reading is an  individualized matter, a uniform measure cannot be used to evaluate performance. Students should try to evaluate their own reading performance through the educational objectives set up for them. Special classes for deaf, illiterate, or adult students are usually restricted. The four standardized tests most often selected by junior college reading instructors are the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Iowa Silent Reading Test, California Reading Test, and Co-operative Reading Test.

The programs aim to enhance minority students' opportunities to succeed in college, provide equal opportunity for them in employment, promotion, and assignment, and increase understanding and sensitivity among various ethnic groups in the college community. Programs to assist minority students involve recruitment, orientation, counseling, financial aid, curriculum, instruction, work experience, student personnel policies and practices, co-curricular activities, research, and funding. Part I discusses the programs' histories, compositions,  activities, and evaluations. Programs to assist minority staff members involve recruitment and selection, certification, employment, in-service training, and fair employment practices. Policy, procedures, and positions are discussed. Community services include on- and off-campus classes and workshops, speakers, cooperative activities, public information, and community advisory committees. They are provided for the community as a whole or for a specialized segment, depending on the program. Five local colleges cooperate in the resolution of common problems such as funding and research. Part II will be on evaluation and plans for expansion; Part III, on continuing efforts to implement a sound program for ethnic minorities. (CA)",

Branch campuses are found to prepare students for transfer to 4-year colleges; junior colleges and technical institutes prepare students in both transfer and terminal programs; and vocational-technical centers strongly emphasize immediate job preparation. Ninety schools were surveyed for program emphasis, educational costs, student body and faculty characteristics, articulation with other schools, and the role of the institution in an educational system. A total of 7,673 students enrolled in 1969 were surveyed for demographic characteristics, previous and current educational experiences, and occupational goals. A total of 1,455 (1967) graduates  were surveyed for personal characteristics, high school experience, other post-secondary schools attended, 2-year college experience, post-junior college education, employment and financial status, and goals and aspirations. Student and graduate groups were compared whenever a data base was present. Finally, 2,015 faculty were surveyed for demographic and occupational characteristics, and attitudes toward school services and policy. The results indicate differences in the above areas according to type of school. A detailed discussion of research methodology and results, and the questionnaires used in the study are included.

        "description":"This topical paper discusses a proposal for a student volunteer agency operating with or under the auspices of a college, but as an alternative to a comprehensive community college education. Because of conflicting expectations and inadequate resources, the idea of a year off is seen as an option to obligatory college attendance. Volunteers can be: students already enrolled in human service paraprofessional programs, other junior college students, junior college drop-outs, or young people who never enrolled in college. The size of the community would determine the size of the agency. The staff would come from a variety of backgrounds and would handle registration, placement, counseling, training and evaluation of volunteers, and would act as public relations men with the  community. Such a proposal would allow youth to try satisfying, interesting work under some supervision and to feel a part of, and relate their education to, their community. The community would gain the advantage of students working on solutions to social problems and filling shortages in service personnel. The advantages to the community college and faculty are many: the scope of on-campus student personnel services could be reduced to those directly related to students; the volunteer work could be the experience requirement for human services programs; and the agency could be the specific arm of the junior college community service commitment without consuming budget and staff.

Four groups of students were studied: aid recipients and non-recipients who earned less than $100.00 from part-time work during the 1967-68 academic year, and aid recipients and non-recipients who earned $100.00 or more in the same period. The study attempts to determine: (1) the personal, academic, and socio-economic characteristics of aid recipients compared with non-recipients; (2) the employment patterns of community college students; (3) whether financial aids make a difference in student achievement and persistence; and (4) if scholarships, grants, loans,  and/or employment are given to the most needy or the most capable students, or to those with a combination of need and ability. Community college educators view financial aids as necessary. In the opinion of recipients, aids have a definite value in enabling them to attend college. This study showed that aid recipients, despite a socio-economic handicap, are as successful academically as non-recipients with more money and cultural advantages. (CA)",

Their identification, however, hinges on an appropriate definition of community. Prior to presenting methods for identifying community needs, the problems surrounding the defining of \"community\" are explored. The community constructs of Hendrix, Treloff, Sumption, Hallenbeck and Verner, and Blackwell (portrayed in model form) serve as keys to community definition. Three methods (community advisory committee, community coordinating council, and community study) of sampling community input are then described. It was not intended to present these three methods as alternatives to be selected by any college as it seeks to measure its community.  Rather, they were presented as three procedures by which different kinds of information and service could be made available to the community college with the recommendation that each be applied as circumstances permitted. Use of the community survey technique remained the single most effective method of broadening the college mission to help provide a more comprehensive base for developing a community's human resources.

In this paper, campus characteristics are synonymous with campus environment. Concern is with environmental effects on human behavior, and not the environmental components themselves. The Press-Need Concepts (Murray 1938) were an initial attempt to explain personality in terms of environment. Other work elaborated on the Press-Need Concepts as analytical tools for assessing personal satisfaction or frustration. Several testing instruments to evaluate the applicability of the Press-Need Concepts in 4-year educational institutions were developed (Activities Index, College Characteristics Index, High School  Characteristics Index). Development of these instruments allowed the researcher to apply the Press-Need Concepts to groups rather than to individuals. Later Pace developed a briefer, yet valid instrument (College and University Environmental Scales) to supplement the earlier tests. Results from using these instruments in a junior college setting were unsatisfactory and led to the construction of an alternative 2-part instrument (Junior College Environmental Scales). This work, done by Hendrix, was later extended by the author of this paper in the development of his own instruments (Faculty Environmental Preference Scales and Faculty Environmental Scales). (AL)",

        "description":"The historical development of the University of California Archives is traced. In 1929 the U.S. Bureau of the Budget foresaw the need to develop a method to rapidly separate valuable from routine documents and to establish guidelines for the evaluation of records. Records management -- a system to store, service, analyze, and weed documents -- has grown out of this need. The three-way character of records management is paraphrased as follows: (1) Engineers to control the paper; (2) Archivists to appraise, select records and to plan, equip and administer the records storage facility; and (3) historian to identify, organize, and interpret the records.

Definitions of a rigorous nature for the fundamental quantities involved must be established. These must have general applicability and must be related to other known and measurable quantities.

To become a professional librarian in Ghana today requires the completion of a diploma course which is open only to university graduates judged to have the requisite qualities of mind, personality and temperament to make satisfactory librarians. The course consists of two parts: (1) one academic session, ending with five written examination papers and (2) the completion of a written bibliography or thesis and practical experience in an approved library.

The data which was supplied falls under four headings: (1) use of the library-indicated by the number of  registered readers and volumes borrowed, (2) stock - the library's total holdings in volumes and the number of serial titles currently received, (3) expenditure - annual recurrent expenditure (in some cases no distinction was made between capital and recurrent spending) and (4) staff - number of personnel.

Although each had its particular mission and problems, there is agreement that some problems are common to the two groups and that, in at least some instances, the one community can assist the other to the benefit of both. There was a review of progress made in attacking some of the issues identified at the first Conference, and a report on services recently established or about to be established. Moving beyond specific problems, there was an effort to consider and appraise proposed new organizations, management devices and services that might enable the Federal and non-Federal communities to  provide improved services to their users. The special needs of the predominatly black institutions were presented in detail and means of bringing about improvements were set forth. A series of discussion groups provided the opportunity for exchange of views on topics of current interest to both groups. The all-embracing Conference Resolution directed the sponsors to attempt to carry out the recommendations and considerations presented by the speakers, discussion leaders and other participants.

In brief, the agreement states that borrowing libraries will not ordinarily request books and journals in current or recurring demand, bulky or fragile material, rare material in the original, photocopies of the extremely long articles, materials for class reserve or other group use, reference material in the original, or multiple copies of one article. The most significant addition to the agreement was the incorporation of a section that provides for an Evaluation Committee. The Committee is  the mechanism through which the Group will make self-evaluations and recommendations for action as bureaucratic restraints grow from within. The primary purpose of the Committee is to monitor ILL policies not to administer them. An account of the Committee's efforts to collect data on ILL policies of the signatories of the Group's ILL Agreement, and its recommendations for a uniform policy is presented. (Author/NH)",

If the user must arrange for access to this material outside the library, he will be seriously disadvantaged. When a library assumes responsibility for digital data record resources, the selection of access techniques becomes the central question. The use of interactive techniques in which the user is in direct communication with the data file, combined with full-text displays is described. The model Library Program, discussed in Section III, deals with procedures that assist the user who seeks information in a mixed regime  of machine access techniques and conventional library operations. The program's objective is to examine system configurations from the viewpoint of cost-benefits relationships and to study interrelationships among factors such as data-base size, content and cost, user population, equipment utilization, hardware considerations, and networking through use of electrical communications.

This study of Chapel Hill, a university-dominated town of 20,000 suggests that public access to the University of North Carolina Library helped delay the establishment of a public library until 1958. A children's library was formed in 1929; children had not been served at the university. The Chapel Hill Public Library occupies a new building and receives sympathetic support, but government monies do not cover the true cost of operations. Durham, N.C., an industrial city of 93,000, opened a public library in 1898 and replaced it with the present Carnegie library in 1923. A site for a new building is reserved, but a bond issue to  support it failed in 1968, despite substantial evidence of need. Certain knowledgeable persons attributed some of the indifference to the availability of the Duke University Library collection. Economic and sociological factors may also contribute. (Author)",

During Phase I the study team reviewed on-going NAL operations, prepared flow charts of existing processes, analyzed files, forms and workload statistics, examined the Library's collections, measured performance, and discussed existing and proposed information services with a small subset of prospective users. The study revealed that NAL is effectively serving the Library user in spite of its current limited budgetary and manpower resources. There is a definite and clear need for a long range plan of improvement for the Library to enable it to keep pace with mounting departmental and national demands for increased access to  agricultural information.

An obvious need for quality programs was indicated. A pilot program to improve the quality of care received by children in day care homes is described. The home visitor method for training family day care workers, modeled after an existing DARCEE program for mothers, was selected as particularly suitable for the Appalachian region. To develop the training program, the preparation of family day care workers was analyzed with regard to: (1) meeting the basic needs of children; (2) substituting for the mother in meeting the child's emotional needs; (3) general management of the family day care situation; (4) adapting to children's development and  heterogeneity of ages; and (5) serving as effective educational change agents. Criteria for the selection of family day care workers and plans to utilize their educational potential are discussed. Evaluation involves ongoing assessment of the day care home visiting program, development of instrumentation for future research, and continued development of family day care programs. Appendixes present sample menus, and suggestions for behavior management and play. (NH)",

Middle-class children in a university laboratory nursery setting were pretested, matched for age and randomly assigned to an instruction or a comparison control group. The instruction group was trained in two clusters of four children per teacher on labeling-classification, discrimination-memory, and seriation tasks. Each cluster consisted of a younger boy, a younger girl, an older boy and an older girl. Each session consisted of 20-30 minutes of organized activity and there were 12 sessions over a 3-week period for each training condition. The control group children had an  equivalent amount of separate small group activity with a preschool teacher. The results of posttesting and transfer tasks support the contention that the developmental status of the curriculum target population will determine to a great extent the success or failure of an educational intervention effort. Age-related maturational components are important considerations in any curriculum attempt to modify the course of cognitive development.

The study was conducted by observation, motion photography, and analysis of the performance of subjects in 18 to 25 movement tasks in each of six school semesters. Movement performance recorded on film was analyzed according to the Movement Task Analysis Form developed for each task. To establish a suitable context for determining movement development, the factors of age, sex, intelligence,  maturity, teacher's estimate of achievement, and reading readiness were studied in relation to the subject's motor scores. Movement task scores were summarized for each age group. The study concluded that normal preschool children will perform a variety of movement tasks which are similar and which develop according to a predictable timetable; although motor performance and movement development vary with age, sex, and among individuals. Seven characteristics significant in the movement development of young children were identified. (Author/AJ)",

The scale was developed for this study and comprised two categories of characteristics, Personal-Social, and Educational-Biographical-Working Relationships. Raters selected were child development specialists, Head Start program directors, and two groups of paraprofessionals, one trained and the other untrained. A major hypothesis was that subjects would differ significantly in their ratings of characteristics of paraprofessionals, and this hypothesis was verified. Statistical analysis identified nine factors to be considered in characterizing paraprofessionals: general personal qualities;  demographic facts; education; temperament; maturity; work effectiveness; frustrating situations; positive work attitudes; and feelings of security. Any future use of the MRSP scale should add a statistically derived third characteristics category: Reaction to Stress, and scale items should be rewritten to be more easily understood by paraprofessionals.

To achieve high quality programs, there must be eye-to-eye contact and intensive interaction with each child, and  there must be time for reflection on each day's activities. The educator's primary responsibility is the quality of day-to-day encounters of individual adults with individual children.

Until the result of such research is available, studies of methods and processes have little practical or theoretical use. Preschool goals generally agreed upon by American educators are the promotion of the child's emotional and social development, and the improvement of mental processes and skills. Current strategies for further defining these goals include: (1) &quot;bag of virtues&quot; approach, which advocates that the child acquire self confidence, spontaneity, curiosity, self-discipline, and specific aptitudes and skills; (2) the class comparison strategy, which assumes a middle class superiority in attitudes, goals, and general life style; (3) the industrial psychology  strategy, which says that in order to make it in the system, children must meet certain standards of language and skills, even though they are not termed &quot;deprived&quot; in terms of their own culture. In contrast, the cognitive-developmental approach, which is exemplified by Piagetian stage theory, is favored and is used in this paper to arrive at a strategy for the definition of education objectives. The child and his development, the use of longitudinal data, and some recent research demonstrating relationships between Piagetian stages of cognition and ego stages are also discussed. (NH)",

Among these features are the family as a learning system, a systems perspective, a psycho-social theory of classroom learning, the philosophic position, criteria and specifications, the operational stage, evaluating and measuring learning systems, an educational research superstructure, and the educational research testing system. Eight figures specify designs and  relationships important in conceptualizing and operationalizing this approach. (WY)",

        "description":"As a plausible explanation of Negro academic underachievement, culture conflict has been ignored by educators and social scientists to a degree not indicated by the wide range of evidence which points to its importance as a contributing factor. Reasons suggested for this theoretical imbalance can be summarized by saying that it has been controversial to use a cultural-difference model in dealing with American Negroes, and it is likely to remain so in the future. This poses a dilemma for those who want to help Negro children achieve satisfactorily in school. If cultural differences between Negroes and whites account at least in part for their different school performance, it is unlikely that efforts to raise the level of Negro academic achievement will be successful as long as  cultural factors are ignored. For awhile, however, most social scientists will probably prefer to stay within the bounds of environmentalism in their search for the causes of Negro academic underachievement. The social penalties for failing with an environmental-difference model are still less severe than those which accompany success with a genetic-difference or cultural-difference model. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"A survey of the evidence shows that some degrees of malnutrition is relatively widespread among poor children. However, the effects of inadequate nutrition on growth and mental development depend to a large extent on the severity, the timing (pre and postnatal), and the duration of the nutritional deprivation. The data are inadequate on the true prevalence of malnutrition among children in this country, but there is even less information about its onset or about its severity and quality. The absence of such knowledge reflects not the absence of the problem, but the lack of attention devoted to it. There is strong indication that nutritional factors at a number of different levels contribute significantly to depressed intellectual level and learning failure. Moreover, an adequate  state of nutrition is necessary for good attention and for appropriate and sensitive responsiveness to the environment. Further, women who were malnourished as children are more likely to have disturbed pregnancies and children of low birth weight and increased risk of neurointegrative abnormality. It must be recognized, however, that improvement of nutrition alone cannot fully solve the problem of intellectual deficit and school failure. Rather, an overall effort to improve the condition of disadvantaged children is required. (Author/NH)",

The bilingual program's major components are instructional materials, staff development, and parent-school-community involvement. Ninety children participated in the program in 1970-71, with two classes of 15 pupils each in each of the three age groups. Evaluation was based on criterion-referenced tests given to experimental pupils at the beginning and end of the school year; and norm-referenced tests, given to experimental classes and comparison groups of the same age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background who attended day care centers without planned instructional programs. Test  findings revealed that children in the laboratory program met the criterion on the curriculum-referenced tests on all but a few of the 25 units. Experimental pupils scored higher than comparison pupils on tests of Spanish and English comprehension, general concepts, and nonverbal intelligence. (Author/AJ)",

The essence of this mathematical concept consists of the analysis of sequences of infant responses in interaction with its environment. Categories can be defined which reflect the joint occurrence of an infant's behavior (or condition) along with some associative event(s) in the infant's immediate environment. Each of these categories of infant-environment interaction can be used as a definition of state for the purposes of studying the sequential unfolding among categories. An example utilizing child vocalization data collected by Lewis is given. When applied to mother-infant interaction, a particular mother-infant pair may yield data which give a poor fit in  terms of matching statistics with the Markov model. Therefore, three alternative procedures are suggested. (Author/WY)",

Group III was a control group receiving only classroom instruction in reading skills. Two attitude measures were administered to all pupils along with an experimenter-developed and a criterion-referenced achievement test. The experimental design was a 3x3x2 randomized block design with three treatments, three levels of previous achievement, and two sexes.

It was believed that video tape could be used as an improved means of home-school communication. Nineteen 5-year-old subjects in groups of six were videotaped for 12-minute segments in actual classroom situations. At a scheduled parent-teacher conference, both parents of each child (separated by a screen to eliminate partner influence) viewed the tape and recorded 5 specific items of their child's behavior on the form provided. Student behavior categories were: (1) intent on ongoing work, (2) remark which is task oriented, (3) non-task oriented remark, (4) daydreaming, and (5) fidgeting. Using the tape method, parents were able to see  their child's problems and potentials directly and without initial elaboration by the teacher at the parent conference. Parents initiated the comments and the teacher became a participant in the evaluation rather than the judge. Parents compared their tabulations after viewing the tape, often revealing inconsistent expectations between parents. Fathers were usually responsive to more items in a given segment of time than the mothers. Study findings suggest that use of video tape might help identify a child's learning pattern or consistent school life pattern. (Author/AJ)",

A total of 104 5-minute samples were tape recorded for 15 kindergarten teachers. Transcripts were later checked by an independent listner. These scrits formed the data base for all teacher language analyses. In he first analysis, the words were listed according to parts of speech, and correlations between this language corpus and 2 major listings of children's vocabulary (Thorndike-Lorge and Rinsland) were found to be significant. Over 60 percent of the language used by teachers is within the expected level of familiarity. The 40 percent balance of unfamiliar words may be considered the  word load to which these children were exposed in the process of vocabulary acquisition. A Flanders-type analysis of the nature of the communications conveyed by the teachers' language with reference to teacher style across ethnic and socioeconomic (SES) groups revealed that Caucasian teachers of both high SES black children and low SES white children use more verbal reinforcement than was noted with Caucasian teachers with high SES white children or black teachers with low SES black children. In general, Caucasian teachers of high SES Caucasian children give fewer verbal supports, whereas black teachers of low SES black children are the warmest and most supportive. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"Based on a June 1970 survey of 259 black homemakers (women between 18 and 65 having children in the household) in 2 villages and 1 town of an East Texas county (75% rural, disproportionately high rate of low-income families relative to Texas as a whole, 25% black, and pervaded by traditional southern culture), this paper presents 4 general conclusions: blacks perceive a high degree of racial prejudice among their white counterparts; blacks tend to be relatively positive about the possibility for racial integration in general but tend to be divided on the desirability of it; substantial differences in orientation toward race relations exist among blacks relative to size of place of residence; and many blacks still do not desire school integration, even though they perceive it to  be possible and, in fact, it has taken place. In the document, a narrative and tabular description of respondents (age, education, size of family, income) and a statement of the observations, indicators, and data operations lead into the analysis and findings concerning the 4 primary data comparisons (perception of prejudice, desire for integration, perception of possibility for integration, and relation between possibility and desire for integration) by town and village residence. A 17-point summary of major findings, a 4-pronged discussion of the study's relevance, 22 references, and 4 appendices (instruments, distribution of responses, description of the study county, and cross-classification of specified responses) close out the paper.

Development problems are not usually aligned geographically with the boundaries of a city, county, or state, but multicounty units of observation are considered useful for descriptive, analytical, and policy implication purposes. Therefore, in the study, 489 multicounty trading areas, including all counties in the 48 contiguous states, were aggregated into 5 urban-orientation groups. The level of development of an area was found to be correlated with urban orientation; however, the sparsely settled rural areas of the Great Plains, on average, have attained a slightly higher level of  economic development than the more densely settled rural areas of the Southeast. Population and employment growth rates are independent of urban orientation or the level of economic development. Economic development policies need to differ for rural areas compared with urban areas and for areas with a higher level of development compared to those with lower levels of development.

Data were collected by questionnaires or interviews with international practitioners, American professors having experience in training international practitioners, and graduate students currently preparing for careers outside the United States. The central focus is on internationalizing a body of knowledge as a facilitating condition in international training: the developing of a set of minimum concpets and general principles that have  international (cross cultural) validity for equipping professionals from one society to work in any other. After providing information on the design and execution of the study, as well as narrative descriptions and data on its findings, the report presents 16 recommendations on intercultural transferability of data and training, professional communication and international flow of data, recruitment policies and procedures for American universities, training in research methodology and theory construction in the United States, social theory emphasis during training in the United States, and special programs to internationalize rural sociology and rural sociologists.

How can the centers affect the children's preschool experiences so as to promote elementary school adjustment? What kinds of adaptations in curriculum materials, teaching styles, nursery school designs, and other nursery school procedures would be necessary to realize the foregoing goals? In recognition of the increasing value of bilingual skills and of the fact that foreign language  study is now required in California's elementary schools, can the centers develop the child's mother-tongue so as to preserve this head start? Although many relevant data could not be obtained because of time limitation, recommendations are reported in the areas of general facilities, composition of the nursery school group, age grouping, qualifying American children for enrollment, other admission procedures, health requirements, special activities, and professional resources. In general, it is concluded that mixing immigrant children with their English-speaking contemporaries (on a 50-50 basis in groups of no more than 20) seems the most fruitful approach to helping the &quot;family school&quot; children with (1) learning English, (2) elementary school readiness, and (3) problems of  acculturation.

The low socioeconomic status of large numbers of noncorporate-farm families and rural ethnic minority groups is a characteristic of prime importance, particularly in view of the relationship between economic status and school achievement for rural as well as urban children. In addition, the educational and occupational aspirations of rural students appear to be negatively affected by their low economic status and possibly further depressed by factors related to geographic isolation. Many rural young people who will not be able to make a satisfactory living by farming do not aspire to higher-skilled urban occupations or to the educational  level which would prepare them for such work. Possibly related to socioeconomic status are other attitudes found among rural children which may further hinder their progress: low self-esteem, feelings of helplessness in the face of seemingly unconquerable environmental handicaps, and impoverished confidence in the value of education as an answer to their problems.

Comparisons between the mean scores of the disadvantaged sample and the norm group, and within the group of disadvantaged children, were made on the basis of both the total test scores and the scores on individual subtests. The disadvantaged group was compared to the norm group on overall group performance as well as by grade and sex. Comparisons were made within the disadvantaged group by grade and sex. Findings suggested that disadvantaged children are significantly less proficient in motor skills than are unselected children. An inconsistent pattern of grade differences indicated that the motor development of the  disadvantaged group is uneven by comparison with the norm group. Significant sex differences between the 2 groups were also noted. Evidence to support related studies which suggest a slower rate of growth in learning patterns of disadvantaged children and a \"cumulative deficit\" in the acquisition of learning skills by disadvantaged children was also suggested.

Project SPREAD proposed to establish in Colorado the capability to diffuse improved practices by creating diffusion units. Later a diffusion unit would be activated in Utah, Wyoming, and Washington based on the test of Colorado's preliminary activities. The procedures entailed creating an organization in the Colorado State Department of Education, analyzing the past diffusion efforts of the state department, studying the structural changes needed in the  state department to form a diffusion unit, developing a formative evaluation plan, developing a model for the diffusion organization, and writing a first version of a guidebook for improving small rural schools. Each procedure is described in this report, along with the findings and recommendations; in part, these are that state educational agencies are in a unique pivotal position to provide the diffusion linkage between small rural schools and all other agencies; small rural schools can be an easily managed laboratory site; everyone involved in a cooperative improvement effort requires training; and all diffusion procedures and strategies need to be tested in an operational setting over a long period of time, until all can be made to work reliably.

Chapter III discusses techniques in the delivery of services to the rural disabled; one such technique is utilization of existing agents and agencies within the rural setting: state agricultural extension services, state employment agencies, community action programs, Veterans' Administration, and public health departments.

Purposes of the study were (1) to describe the kinds and amounts of library services accessible to students in Indian schools; (2) to indicate any deficiencies by comparing these services with American Library Association standards; and (3) to present suggestions by Indian school superintendents, principals, teachers, or librarians for the improvement of Indian school library services. A 4-page questionnaire was sent to the principal or librarian at each of the 115 Indian day schools, boarding schools, hospital schools, or trailer schools. It was concluded that Indian schools generally did not meet the majority of the American Library Association's  minimum standards. The best showings were in annual per-pupil library funding, seating, and professional periodicals subscribed to; the poorest showings were in numbers of librarians, clerical help, and book and magazine collections. No correlation was found between the size or grade level of the school and the kinds and amounts of library services provided. (JH)",

Implications were drawn for theory, past and future research, methodology, and social policy, particularly in the educational realm (e.g., teachers must not assume that language usage patterns indicate other aspects of the student's attitudes and values).

As stated, the adequacy of a family's dietary intake is influenced by a wide range of factors, which may be classified under 2 major categories: (1) the family's food-purchasing power and (2) the efficiency with which the food resources are utilized. Thus, data on these factors were obtained from more than 1000 repeated interviews of rural homemakers and were subjected to multivariate analysis. Some of the main conclusions were that low-income families were most deficient in vitamin A  and calcium, and were least deficient in phosphorus and protein; CD families had no better diets than non-CD families; the FS provided some improvement in diets of families experiencing temporary fund shortages (e.g., more than 2 weeks since payday); when families had received some income within the past 2 weeks, the impact of FS was not significant; families receiving income at least once every 2 weeks had significantly more adequate diets than those who were similar in other respects but received income less often; FS families substituted a large proportion of their increase in food-purchasing power for expenditures other than food; and families did not use their increased purchasing power to obtain foods that would provide the nutrients most deficient in the family's diet.

It was found that (1) oral reading errors that decreased as grade level increases were repetition, no response, and inversion; (2) errors that increased as grade level increases were partial mispronunciation and gross mispronunciation; (3) errors that persisted throughout the grades were substitution, omission, and insertion; and (4) errors that appear in the same proportionate frequency whether pupil read passages of  difficulty below or above their own level were substitution, insertion, and no response.

        "description":"Three language models (Staats, Lenneberg, and Piaget) are reviewed, and implications for reading are suggested. Staats' behaviorist stance maintains that imitation, mediation, generalization, and discrimination are key concepts in language learning behavior. Critics contest the importance of these concepts and claim that behaviorists cannot fully account for language development. The biological theory presented by Lenneberg contends that language is a manifestation of innate species-specific propensities, that language develops in a fixed sequence, and that the crucial period for language development is between ages 2 and 4. Each of these claims is challenged by critics. Piaget maintains that language development comes only after a certain level of cognitive development is  reached by the child. An enriched environment conducive to teaching the child to think is essential to language development. Critics of this theory suggest the need for more research concerning the relationship of language to cognition. Some contradictory implications of these models for reading are listed, and references are included. (AL)",

        "description":"In 1964, the author proposed a multisensory approach to reading, and reading was seen as a language skill related to the development of verbal symbolic behavior. A closer focus was permitted on the child's learning process, which consists of preverbal learning (perceptually automatized and subconsciously acquired) and conceptual learning (which is only accomplished when the child can bend his perceptually processed alphabets to his expressive verbal needs). Further research has indicated that an early development of either auditory or visual perceptual processes leads to early and accurate use of speech or reading, respectively. Research also has shown that as the child develops he appears to use one modality in preference to others in learning, but modality dominance tends to be  overcome by most children around the age of 9. In 1969, perceptual process development was clearly defined by Chalfant and Schefflin, and since then a perceptual test battery which seeks to determine the level of development of necessary preverbal skills has been developed. Although the battery is still in an experimental form, sufficient research has been done with it to offer some direct observations. It was concluded that most research studies suggest that slower developing individual modalities is a natural process which should not be confused with other handicaps and that educational programs should be developed to suit the modality preference of the individual child.

On the positive side, IPI sets up a series of steps that allow the teacher to know where the child is and in what direction he is going. It enables the teacher to know his subject matter well, and enables the child to move at his own rate. However, there are negative aspects of the program. (1) There is the possibility of rote prescription on the part of the teacher. (2) The individual rate of learning, as emphasized by IPI, is only one of the factors that account for learning differences. (Some others include motivation, cultural environment, genetic endowment.) (3) Although IPI places the emphasis on student self-learning, effective  learning seems to be a result of effective teaching.

There is great disagreement over definitions of reading disabilities, yet an effective program is based on a clear understanding of what the reading disability is. Administrators and educators often do not have the knowledge and understanding of reading disabilities and therefore will not lead or approve the development of treatment programs. Organization of a program is based on an appropriate structure; early identification of children with reading problems; the availability of space, staff, and materials; and trained  teachers with eclectic approaches. Organization is often the most difficulty problem in setting up a program.

Smith (1963) found that by applying criteria of comprehensiveness and quality to 114 schools, seven had good programs. In California (Graham, 1969), 82 percent of the reading programs were remedial. In New Mexico (Bowren, 1970), the programs were remedial and isolated from the rest of the school. In general, trends indicate that (1) the English teachers handle reading classes, (2) programs are in the experimental stage, (3) most are short-term  reading and study classes taught in conjunction with content classes (usually English), and (4) only a few offer separate reading classes and free or sustained reading. Problems were listed which limit developmental programs, and it was concluded that teaching of reading and study skills in content classes, widening of scope to include developmental reading, improving program direction, and providing trained personnel will all help make a secondary developmental reading program feasible and effective.

Four principles underlying a quality literature instruction program help determine whether good literature is being used or abused: (1) wide exposure to many levels, qualities, and types of literature; (2) quality exposure as dictated by the curriculum, department, or teacher; (3) the opportunity for free pursuit of reading materials; and (4) the appropriate use of skills instruction. The fourth principle is crucial. The teaching of reading skills is merely a part of guiding students toward analysis and interpretation of literature. The teacher must examine literature for the literary content as well  as for the reading processes involved. The teacher can then construct guides which will help the students experience the literature in an appropriate intellectual-emotional manner.

In order to help individual children who are experiencing learning difficulty and who may have vision deficiencies, the teacher should (1) understand the process of visual learning (which is affected by maturation, development, and many other factors); (2) know the limitations of the vision screening program used; and (3) know the child's visual abilities. Knowledge of symptoms,  information gleaned from various tests, use of a full screening program, and referral for a complete vision evaluation--all these can help the teacher to know a child's visual abilities. In addition, early detection and early removal of visual deficiencies is important. The child must not only see clearly, but he must also be able to use the visual signals and have ample experiences in developing visual skills related to important perceptual abilities.

        "description":"In November of 1965, the Provincial Executive of the Manitoba Teachers' Society established a commission made up of principals, teachers, and university professors to study reading in the Manitoba schools, including (1) reading teaching, (2) reading ability of elementary and secondary school pupils, (3) results of research elsewhere, (4) instruction of teaching reading methods at educational institutions in the Province, and (5) public hearings at which members of the educational or lay public may submit their studies and opinions. An extensive questionnaire was developed and sent to all teachers in grades 1, 2, 3, and 6 in the Province. A sample of approximately half the students in grades 1, 2, 3, and 6, a total of 30,973, was administered the Stanford Achievement Test in  Reading (SRAT) and the Otis-Lennon Mental Ability Test. The results showed Manitoba children to be below the SRAT norm group. Intercorrelations of the variables, regression analysis, and analysis of variance were among the analyses performed. The commission suggested careful study of the following: (1) crucial variables affecting reading, (2) early detection of learning problems, (3) careful selection of reading materials, and (4) educational philosophy. A bibliography, tables, and appendixes (including the study questionnaire) are included. (BM)",

Personnel of the program include a reading consultant, reading specialists, reading clinicians, and teacher aides. An inservice training program is provided for all freshman English teachers. The entire freshman class is  enrolled in the reading program, and it may be elected by students in any other class. Tests and observational data indicate that the program is effective, particularly for boys and for students of lower IQ's. This effectiveness is largely attributed to the program's flexibility.

Students are admitted to the program only if they are reading at least two grade levels below their actual grade level as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. Reading classes of about 25 students each participate in essentially traditional learning activities such as class exercises, homework, lessons on specific reading skills, phonics, and directed and free reading. Materials used include commercial reading materials, workbooks, charts, reading pacers, controlled readers, and filmstrips. A circulating library is integral to the program and useful in motivating the students--for every four books the student reads, he is permitted to keep one for  his personal library. Evaluation of the 1970 summer program indicates that 81.1 percent of the students showed growth on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, with the median growth of students being 9 months. Increased success of the program over the last 2 years is attributed to highly motivated students, the employment of skilled reading coordinators, and experienced reading teachers.

All of the children are from schools that have a high enrollment of disadvantaged children, and include approximately 75 percent Negro students. The program goal is to improve the children's reading achievement through preventive means, rather than later remediation. This is accomplished by tutorial emphasis on sight reading, comprehension, and word analysis, each of which is broken into coded step-by-step lessons. About half of the tutorial personnel are recruited from the inner city, and half, from the suburbs. The tutors receive 30 hours of training in the first  2 months as well as continuous on-the-job training. Tutors must adhere closely to the prescribed tutorial kits provided for the basal series used. An extensive evaluation of the project has shown that the tutorial reading program produces a significant improvement in reading achievement.

These essays were rated on length, vocabulary level, originality, emotional content, and overall communication, and the ratings of the i.t.a. and TO groups in both grades were compared. It was found that the first-grade i.t.a. essays were longer, on a more advanced vocabulary level, and more original than the TO group, but that there were no significant differences in the other ratings. In the second-grade group the differences between the i.t.a. and TO groups  were not significant.

A group of 42 retarded readers enrolled in reading and writing classes of the academic skills lab in Mercer County Community College, Trenton, New Jersey, was randomly divided into two groups. A preliminary administration of the Gates-MacGinitie vocabulary and comprehension tests was given to assure that there was no significant difference in reading levels of the two groups. An experimenter-devised trial test was given to 17 eighth-grade students in which the context groups scored 61.5 percent and the isolated word group, 50.8, which  was a significant difference. On the 12-item experimenter-devised test for the junior college subjects, the context group responded correctly to 47.6 percent of the items and the isolated word group to 49.2 percent, with means of 4.26 and 4.40, respectively.

        "description":"In order to apply appropriate modes of instruction based on readers' learning characteristics, including modality preferences, the diagnostician must evaluate the reading abilities of the individual pupil on tests of word recognition, psycholinguistic abilities, and learning modes. The Dolch Basic Word Test is a tool for evaluating word recognition skills. This test should be augmented with a learning modalities test such as that developed by Mills which uses the visual, phonic or auditory, kinesthetic, and combination methods. Other learning modalities tests are the Gates Associative Tests and the Van-Wagenen \"Word Learning\" Test. Psycholinguistic tests such as the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities and the Detroit Tests of Learning Aptitude are useful in diagnosing  auditory and visual memory. Data collected from these evaluations may be used in determining the specific strengths and weaknesses of the individual pupil and in choosing appropriate teaching approaches and activities in teaching reading.

Illiteracy lowers his chances of employment, limits his knowledge in politics and current events, and limits his success in school. As all of these things affect the nonreading individual, so does his lack of productivity and lack of personal fulfillment affect our society as a whole. The solution to the reading problem in achieving the goal of national functional literacy requires total community involvement--by parents, schools, businesses, radio, television, libraries, and publishing companies. By communities becoming more involved in the individual, the individual, in turn, increases his involvement in the community, thus creating a better society for all.  (AI)",

The purpose of the study was to evaluate three goals: (1) the improvement of reading skills, (2) the reduction of attrition rates, and (3) an increased grade-point ratio. This report contains an evaluation of reading gain for the 90 subjects, based on the results of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Forms A and B. The results showed that the experimental group made higher gains in vocabulary, reading rate, and total  reading than the control group. The failure of the experimental group to make gains in the area of comprehension is interpreted somewhat favorably in light of the fact that significant gains were made in rate without a loss of comprehension. It was concluded that a reading improvement program is beneficial to students with limited verbal skills. Tables and references are included. (AI)",

Thirty-six freshmen and sophomore education majors worked for 10 weeks with nine pairs of L-level (first-grade) children from the Wisconsin University laboratory school on SRA materials, Dolch phrases, and creative writing. Half used typewriters and the rest, pencils in front of a television camera. Pretests and post-tests were given, including the Gates-MacGinitie Primary Reading Test A, Dolch 220-word basic reading list, and the SRA reading series tests. Post-tests included the number of words written; Stanford Achievement Test, Form X, Primary Battery; and Hildreth Letter per Minute Test. The typing group showed more growth in the Gates-MacGinitie and the Dolch tests, but there were no  significant differences in reading ability of the two groups at the end of the 10 weeks. It was concluded that (1) the use of the typewriters did not increase experience and speed or reduce reading learning and (2) the children enjoyed the machines and the attention of a college student. It was recommended that future studies might investigate whether a difference does exist if all the students are boys or have perceptual motor or handwriting difficulties.

The Sullivan Remedial Reading Program was used for the programed reading groups. Students were pretested and post-tested on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests to compare reading achievement. Data indicated (1) that the traditional reading group with rewards did significantly better than the programed reading group with rewards and (2) that groups with rewards did significantly better than groups without rewards. An interaction effect was found which suggested some  reward intrinsic to programed reading. Post-test deterioration of traditional reading students not receiving intermediate rewards was observed.

The procedure can be adapted for use in testing and instructional programs in either an on-line or off-line mode. It requires specification of the objectives of interest in behavioral terms and grouping them into sets that share a common content. Addition, multiplication, and fractions are examples of possible groupings. To implement the procedure, one of the sets of objectives resulting from the grouping process is selected, and item forms representative of the behaviors implied by each objective in the set are specified. Then an item generator is developed that facilitates the construction of items representative of all item forms so identified. Given an on-line computer  capability, the authors describe how it is possible to use the proposed item generator for assisting measurement and instruction in an individualized mathematics program.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate procedures for validating a learning hierarchy from test data. An initial hierarchy for the computational skills of adding rational numbers with like denominators was constructed using Gagne's task analysis. A test designed to assess mastery at each of the 11 levels in this hierarchy was administered to a large sample of elementary school children. The pass-fail relationships from this test data were analyzed with seven learning hierarchy validation procedures, and seven hierarchical orderings of the 11 subtasks were determined. Fourth grade subjects, randomly assigned to seven treatment groups determined by the seven hierarchical orderings, worked 30 minutes a day on programmed materials until they were completed. Achievement  tests measured acquisition of the terminal task. On the following day a transfer test on subtraction of rational numbers was administered. Two weeks later an alternate form of the achievement test was administered as a retention test. Results of the study indicate that sequence seems to have little effect upon immediate achievement and transfer. However, longer term retention seems quite susceptible to sequence manipulation. In general, the authors report that optimal instructional sequences can be devised using learning hierarchies validated from test data. (Author/JG)",

AMI refers to the integral development and display of two or more simultaneously projected visual images either with or in combination with 2 x 2-inch slides, motion film, and/or overhead transparencies. Coupled with the imagery component is the corresponding sound or audio track, which is usually prepared on audiotape and is played concurrently with the pictorial material. While many media combinations are possible for the development of this type of learning endeavor, discussion is limited to the creation of an environmental three-screen slide and sound presentation. Theoretical and  procedural concerns of the technique are characterized under the following topics: (1) a brief description of functional capabilities, (2) a short account of the four structural elements that complement functions, and (3) an explanation of how to plan, produce, and present an AMI program, with each phase offering 10-12 suggestions.

Subjects were 120 students in the pre-methods course on number systems during the Winter and Spring 1971 terms at the Ogontz Campus, Pennsylvania State University. All subjects were given a series of tests prior to beginning the course, and were retested with the same tests at the end of the course. Students scoring below criterion on the pre-test diagnostic test were randomly assigned to an experimental group for remedial treatment or to a control group. Post-testing revealed an increase in diagnostic scores, some improvement in self-evaluation, and an improvement in attitude scores. However, no significant differences in  test score gains were found between the experimental and the control groups. Because students in the experimental group attended the remedial clinic in very irregular patterns, the investigator concludes that test gains were not related to the experimental treatment. It was found possible to diagnose arithmetic deficiencies and to prescribe appropriate remedial treatment, although carrying through the remediation program posed several problems. Appended are facsimiles of test materials utilized. (JG)",

        "description":"The paradigm outlined in this paper is designed to aid in writing scenarios of alternative futures. Specifically the author outlines major conditions and processes in social life which should provide a scheme to be used in constructing or in criticizing scenarios developed by other methods. This scheme should provide assistance in several ways: 1) it should make forgetting or ignoring major actors in the social system less likely; 2) make the steps in the movement from one time to another more explicit; 3) increase the probability of explicit recognition of alternative developments; and, 4) assist in making the scenarios more plausible and more likely confirmed by future developments. The paradigm itself consists of four major parts: 1) the bases and varieties of the social  units; 2) the fundamental social process among and within the social units; 3) the basic conditions of the units; and, 4) the interrelations of processes and conditions and variations in the outcome of different processes.

The first approach is a more traditional approach to the subject area presented with the idea of simply giving the teacher something to build on. The second approach follows &quot;History as Culture Change: An Overview&quot; developed by the Anthropology Curriculum Study Project. In addition, the authors tried to supplement the Association's material by keying readings and materials from approach one to approach two. Structurally, the anthropology courses are organized into units and broken down into content, references, bibliography, audio-visual materials, and activities.

Intended for use at the 9th grade level, it may be used as a directed study with a unit on Religion or Japan. Some skill in formulating a hypothesis and using evidence, as well as some knowledge in Buddhism and Confucianism are required. An instructors' section sets forth pre- and post-test questions and answers; major ideas of the lessons; behavioral objectives; and sources of student readings provided. The student section includes the test questions, and three lessons which are based on five student readings. Students are asked to formulate hypotheses on  the basis of the readings, and then to find evidence to support or revise their hypotheses. Major ideas from the three lessons are: 1) Shintoism was based in part on the creation of Japan and the divinity of the emperor; 2) Shintoism before the influence of Confuciansim and Buddhism was a simple nature worship of any manifestation of power or beauty, with an &quot;eighty myriads&quot; of deities; and 3) Shintoism has undergone changes since 1945, for example it is now supported locally rather than by the state, and practitioners are now free to formulate their own beliefs.

The summarized generalizations are: 1) The technological advances made by man have brought about rapid changes making it possible for man to live a \"better\" life; 2) Technological changes have also created problems, will bring about many new ones, and intensify them in the future; overpopulation, congested highways and pollution are among them; 2) In the future,  change will occur at an even more rapid pace; and 4) Change will require planning on the part of the people, government, industry, scientists, experts, and a progressive education system to minimize the problems. Accordingly, the specific behavioral objectives include: 1) identification of the advantages and disadvantages of technological advances; 2) identification of the changes that may take place by the year 2000; 3) identification of specific tasks to be done by our society in preparation for the future. Discussion, independent reading, and resource utilization are all a part of the inductive and deductive approach indicated in this packet. (SBE)",

The paramount purpose of the guides is to help implement a program of integrating economics into the curriculum at all grade levels. The overall objective is to insure that every high school graduate has acquired a critical way of thinking about economic matters and problems through the use of scientific methods. The major economic point to be learned in the seventh grade, The Eastern Hemisphere, is that every society must have some organized approach to economic decision-making. Western Europe as a decentralized system, the  Soviet Union as a centralized system, and Sub-Saharan Africa are studied. The major theme in the eighth grade is the United States today and how it has changed over the years and includes study of big business, organized labor, government role, competition, industrialization and urbanization, and international trade and investment. In the ninth grade, three major emphases appear: the characteristics, growth, and problems of growth in the State of Washington. The teaching guide for each grade includes: ideas and concepts, technique suggestions, and a bibliography of materials. (SBE)",

Research strategy should focus on the family or small community to trace environmental constraints and opportunities influencing desired and achieved fertility, and possibly isolating the additional contribution family planning programs make to the decline of fertility. In disagreement with Davis, the author finds that fertility and child mortality rates are related; parents frame their family goals on numbers of surviving children. Once these goals have been reached, they exercise birth control. In developing countries, improvements in child nutrition and local health facilities might reduce infant and  child mortality, and therefore birth rates, within a decade. Modification of education, employment, and welfare policies might also move parents toward smaller surviving family size goals. (Author/AWW)",

This unit should make progress toward teaching children the following: 1) concepts: consumer, producer, capital goods, durable goods, productive resources or factors of production, natural resources and man's use of the physical environment, barter, money and banking, pricing and the cost of production, profits and economic good, demand, competition, economic model, individual proprietorship, partnership, corporation, cooperative, private enterprise system, taxes, division of labor and specialization; 2) generalizations evolving out of this conceptual approach to community  study; and, 3) inquiry skills as described in SO 001 726. Attitudinal objectives are: 1) skepticism concerning single-factor causation in the social sciences; and, 2) curiosity about social data. Educational media are listed, student activity sheets and textual materials developed by the Center are also included. Other documents in this series of curriculum guides are ED 051 027 through ED 051 033, ED 052 080 through ED 052 082, and SO 001 278. (VLW)",

The system has some aspects of both a command and market economy. Although the unit is focused upon the economic system, the Trobriand culture is presented as a total culture and the interdependence is made clear.

        "description":"This essay undertakes to develop a perspective from which education as a research area can be more clearly perceived and more meaningfully comprehended. It attempts to do so by locating the study of education within the larger context of the study of man and of society. In the study of man and society, three major sectors of research are identifiable: 1) man as an individual; 2) social groupings in which man acts; and, 3) particular areas of activity in which men in groups and societies engage. A principle which can be used to identify an area of study in education is the concept of dependent and independent variables. In education, the dependent variables are many and include the learning process, the teacher-pupil relationship, the classroom, the school, a system of schools or  the total system of education within a society; it is as complex as a total society, and as amenable to study from the full array of social disciplines. Consequently, many approaches are appropriate and necessary, if understanding is to be systematically and comprehensively extended. This view could lead to the establishment of centers for the study of education which would draw researchers from all of the social sciences. (Author/AWW)",

Teaching strategies suggested include a wide variety of learning activities, from precinct and campaign work to research projects. Among the cognitive objectives listed are understandings of: successful campaign techniques; the qualities of a successful politician; the role played by issues in an election; the role of party conventions; and, the role of bargaining among politicians, and \"appreciation of the orderly and peaceful  manner in which power changes hands in a democratic society.\" Psychomotor objectives are: participation as worker in a political campaign; increased reading about politics in newspapers and magazines; and, increased participation in school politics. It is strongly suggested that this, and any other unit on politics, be coordinated with some form of local or national election so that students will be able to participate directly in the political process.

This Law of 1961 was Brazil's first general education law and was widely publicized as decentralizing the administration of and the responsibility for Brazilian education, and providing for the needed degree of flexibility for the varied regional conditions within the country. It is with such reforms and trends in Brazilian education, following implementation of the Law of 1961, that the present study is principally concerned. Part I describes the background of the national scene in which the Law of 1961 was to function. Part II discusses the system of education as it existed in 1961. Part III presents the  provisions of the law, its implementation, beginning in 1962, at all levels of Brazilian education; and the implications for future educational development in Brazil.

Since this section of the regulations has raised a number of questions, this pamphlet attempts to clarify by answering the following: 1) What is meant by American Culture? 2) How may the American Culture courses be made interdisciplinary? 3) Are there suggested ways of organizing American Culture courses? and, 4) What changes in the typical course sequence are indicated by the new regulations?

It attempts to reflect, for the teacher and student, the direction in which great masses of Black Americans are currently moving. The initial chapter, Some Historical Considerations, attempts to compare the Black Revolution today with certain aspects of the American Revolution. Chapter two, Black Power, discusses various interpretations of this concept. Chapters three and four are concerned with the economic and political implications of Black Power. Chapter five, Brothers, discusses the legacy of Malcolm X and closes with statements concerning other alternatives open to Black  America. Expression, chapter six, contains several poems and a discussion of the national controversy over the proper name for Americans of African descent, Negro vs. Afro-American vs. Black. The collection is designed to clarify the specific teaching episode prepared for grade 9 during the 1968-69 school year by the Task Force and will serve as a beginning in contemporary race relations.

        "description":"The summary final report of the Anthropology Curriculum Project is intended to provide an account of accomplishments and findings. The purpose of the Project was to develop and field test systematic content in anthropology for elementary social studies, with progressive development centered on mastery of the fundamental concepts and their application. Procedures included: 1) identification of major concepts and propositions in the discipline of anthropology; 2) determination of a sequence; 3) development of material for pupil and teacher use; 4) training of teachers; and, 5) evaluation of units based on observation and pupil and teacher feedback. The formal evaluation of the project utilized a pre- and post-test treatment design with the experimental variable teacher training in  anthropology. Summaries of seven studies are appended here, and reviewed in ED 045 512. The project staff interprets the results to indicate the following: 1) the subject matter is interesting; 2) students are stimulated by a technical, cognitive approach to teaching; 3) anthropology may be presented as a scientific discipline; 4) the single discipline approach is suitable; 5) the materials are adapted to use by teachers without training in anthropology; and, 6) the materials provide a framework for encouraging growth in anthropological understanding.

        "author":["Tompson, Richard S."],
        "description":"The aim of this study was to examine English secondary education and its emergence in modern form in the 18th century. Three hundred thirty-four grammar schools (more than 50% of those in the 18th century) in 15 counties comprised the sample. County records, educational essays, and other sources were consulted for a general survey of, among other things, changes in curriculum and charity provisions. The study concludes with a new perspective on 18th century grammar schools: 1) they frequently engaged in curriculum changes, adding English grammar, math, modern languages, and technical subjects to the Greek and Latin curriculum; 2) grammar school charity resources failed to expand sufficiently in the 18th century; and, 3) the relatively fluid state of the grammar schools was itself  changed and hardened, circa 1800. This delayed further reform of the schools for at least a generation and tended to mask the positive efforts of the 18th century. Appended are primary source locations and a selected list of titles of secondary sources; full bibliographic listings are included in the author's 1967 doctoral thesis, University of Michigan, based on this study.

It is not in itself a social report, but a step toward the development of a social report and a comprehensive set of social indicators. These could not only satisfy curiosity about how we are doing, they could also improve public policy making by: 1) providing more visability to social problems and, 2) making possible better evaluation of public programs. The report deals with such areas as: health and illness; social mobility; the condition of the physical environment; including pollution and housing; income and poverty; public  order and safety; learning, science, and art; and participation and alienation. An appendix discusses how we can do better social reporting in the future by pointing out how current statistics are deficient for this purpose, and indicating the specific ways in which social indicators can be used to determine public policy.

Specifically, the program was designed to alert teachers to the importance of instruction for creative problem solving, provide them with a sound rationale, and equip them with a repertoire of appropriate teaching strategies and skills. A concise instructional sequence was developed by means of a sequential training instruction feedback revision cycle. Teacher Education students in a junior year participation program were the experimental subjects. It involved direct  presentation of content, demonstration of process, analysis of progress, modeling, and micro-teaching. It dealt with establishing classroom climate, thinking activities based on the Structure-of-Intellect model, brainstorming, attending to the problem, examining the problem from various vantage points, and included techniques for peer and leader evaluation of micro-teaching experiences.

The objectives were to determine: 1) the usefulness of the curriculum for graduate study or employment; 2) which courses were most useful specifically for graduate study, social work, or business; and, 3) whether the curriculum would emphasize preparation of the student for graduate study or for varied employment. A 150 item questionnaire requesting information on present activities, future goals, and an evaluation of the courses and educational experience was sent to all 74 psychology majors ever graduated from Wisconsin State University-La  Crosse, and 58 present undergraduates. Twenty-seven general questions were included asking how to improve the curriculum, student-faculty relations, and balance in the Department, and inviting opinions regarding student participation in curriculum decisions, a psychology club, and other areas. It was found that the largest group of graduates goes into social work, not psychology; students desired more practical experience, field placement, and more job-related courses with only 21% having persued graduate study; and, student participation, independent study, the club were strongly favored. Tables indicate the usefulness of the individual courses with respect to graduate study, social work, and business. (Author/SBE)",

During the initial stages of the project, local teachers worked on identifying concepts and determining their applicability at various grade levels. Later, they developed curriculum units which  were then tried out in various grades. In-service teacher education has been an important part of the project. In addition to teachers presently associated with the project, curriculum development will involve other teachers within the system, students, parents, business people, and the community at large. Complete elements of the teaching guide will be implemented and evaluated by teachers from the project staff. Later, the materials will be tested by a group of representative teachers not associated with the project. A list of personnel associated with the project is included in the brochure. (JLB)",

Various aspects of implementation are examined, including functions performed, requirements for advancement, training, compensation, recruitment and selection, evaluation, and credentials and certification. Because this is a relatively new development in education, some potential problems are considered, with suggested strategies for dealing with them. Finally, the various benefits resulting from a career ladder and paraprofessional program are discussed as they apply to the student, the paraprofessional, the professional, the institution, and  the community. The second paper describes in more detail the Career Opportunities Program of the U.S. Office of Education. The operation of the program is discussed and trends for the future are considered, including the use of differentiated staffs in team teaching and informal classrooms, the role of state agencies, revisions in teacher certification, the increased use of local funds, the effect of career lattices on school salary structure, and modifications in teacher training programs.

A series of workshops used reading, films, discussion, and microteaching to develop the following concepts and skills: generation of warranted uncertainty, generation of alternative responses to a given problem, ability to ask questions, use of nonverbal techniques to promote warranted uncertainty in others, ability to distinguish between fact and inference, and strategies for teaching these concepts and skills to children. Evaluation of the institute by participants was very favorable. Several  research projects being carried out in cooperation with the Uncertainty Studies Project involve the development of an observation instrument to measure the use of warranted uncertainty techniques by teachers, an analysis of the effectiveness of different teaching styles using warranted uncertainty techniques, and a determination of the correlates and predictors of elementary school students' ability to generate warranted uncertainty.

Members of the teacher group have two roles open to them: demonstration teacher and observer. Three roles--clinic leader, resource specialist, and coordinator--are filled by the supervisor group. In a typical sequence the demonstration teacher prepares a lesson plan and shows it to the entire group during the 10-minute Planning Session,  while decisions are made as to what type of data observers will collect. Then the demonstration teacher teaches a 25-minute lesson. The 10-minute Critique Preparation Session allows the demonstration teacher to prepare his own lesson critique, while the others assemble their data. During the 40-minute Critique Session, the clinic leader and coordinator guide participants in an objective evaluation of the lesson, using data collected by the observers. During the 20-minute Clinic Review Session, it is the responsibility of the resource specialist to evaluate the clinic itself and to assist in planning future ones. (RT)",

        "description":"The data in this study of the role and status of teacher aides were taken from six consolidated city school districts, 14 suburban central schools, and 36 rural central school districts in New York State. Questionnaires were received from 133 principals, 650 supervising teachers, and 407 teacher aides. The data did not disclose large differences according to the type of district. Teacher aides were assigned equally to experienced and inexperienced teachers, and slightly less than 75 percent served more than one teacher. Preparation was generally by inservice training, and there was little study of the larger aspects of education, although more than half the aides did some actual teaching. Most aides were middle-aged married mothers who were high school graduates, often with some  higher education. Nearly 95 percent of the aides were paid, but most received no fringe benefits. Recruitment was usually through school personnel offices or by word-of-mouth. Aides often felt isolated and would welcome greater opportunities. The study includes detailed data, together with a full examination of teacher-aide activities. It concludes with an examination of some of the issues and conflicts, including the problems of what the real role of the teacher aide should be, whether more formal training should be provided, and development of the teacher-aide program during the next decade.

He suggests two general questions for teachers to ask themselves: 1) What possible relevance does this content or material have to the present lives of my students? 2) How do my students feel about this content or material? He cites several programs that are working to emphasize the affective element. These include the Affective Education Project in the Philadelphia public schools and a program  called Development and Research in Confluent Education (DRICE) at the University of California at Santa Barbara.

It also points out current educational problems to which this science of change should be applied. The initial step of a managed change in a client system is the examination of the present state of affairs and an analysis of possible \"driving\" and \"restraining\" forces. The establishment of a relationship of mutual respect between change agent and client system is an important next step. After a successful relationship has been established, the third step involves collecting information to clarify and diagnose the client system's problems, examining alternative routes and goals, establishing goals and intentions of action, and transforming intentions into actual  change efforts. Concluding steps involve stabilizing the change and withdrawal of the change agent. An example of such planned change is the performance contract with Behavioral Research Laboratories to run Banneker Elementary School in Gary, Indiana. This change is analyzed in terms of the steps outlined above. (RT)",

Successful implementation of the VIP depends on the selection and training of a competent Staff Development Counselor. After training, the Staff Development Counselor will assist the teachers in using the VIP self-appraisal instrument and in identifying their inservice needs. He will also be responsible for the technical aspects of videotaping. Another important ingredient for success is the school administrator who must provide the time and materials necessary for teacher to learn new teaching behaviors. The relationship between the teacher and the Staff Development Counselor should be one of  mutual respect and trust. The training sequence will include an initial videotape to identify behaviors to be changed; selection and use of training materials, such as the Far West Laboratory minicourses; microteaching to practice the new behaviors; and finally, classroom teaching using the new behaviors.

It is limited to those costs related to the staffs assigned to instructional, supportive and non-teaching functions within the various teacher education programs. Results indicate that costs for present teacher education programs at the undergraduate level are approximately 25 percent above those of undergraduate liberal arts, and graduate programs are 8 percent above graduate liberal arts. The extra costs are due to two factors: 1) the cost of non credit-producing activities related to the supervision and maintenance of a licensed professional training program, and 2) the high costs of off-campus supervised student teaching and  field experiences. Of the entire teacher education instructional budget, 30.7 percent was allocated to undergraduate courses, 23.8 percent to graduate courses, 21.0 percent to non-teaching duties, 5.6 percent to secretarial costs, and 18.9 percent to fringe benefits.

Aides are becoming increasingly popular in both countries. Their effect on schools is generally to allow a redistribution of teacher time, to increase teachers' job satisfaction, and to increase teacher effectiveness slightly. They also tend to stimulate cooperativeness. Training programs for aides are becoming common in the U.S., but they do not generally make formal provision for teacher associations to participate in planning. This section concludes with a brief statement of the case for including teacher aides in professional associations in some form of affiliate membership. The second section discusses the implementation of the policy,  based on a theory of change processes. It concludes that although a membership policy of affiliation for aides would involve substantial opinion change and careful and committed leadership by a change agent, few practical difficulties would be likely to arise.

The Abbreviated Treatment consisted of 6-week summer workshop and several short followup workshops; the Elaborated Treatment included the same workshops plus individual classroom visits by project staff. The workshops covered teaching procedures, activities, materials, and classroom management, with particular emphasis on planning and determining  objectives. Teachers in all three groups are pre- and posttested, using tests for attitude, vocabulary and concepts developed specifically for the project. Children were tested for IQ, perceptual motor coordination, and auditory discrimination, using standardized tests. Results indicated no significant differences between teachers in any of the three groups. However, children in the Distal Comparison Group did significantly better on all tests than those in either of the treatment groups.

Traveling through rural Pennsylvania, it offers local teachers a course in special education that will enable them to recognize and help children in regular classrooms who have handicaps that often go undetected. Teachers can schedule their own instructional time after school or during their free periods. Upon completion of the course, they receive three academic credits from the Pennsylvania State University. The course averages 30 hours per student, with 100-150 teachers enrolled at each stop and about seven stops made per  year. The cost of a year's operation is approximately $250,000. The project, called Computer-Assisted Remedial Education (CARE), is operated by Penn State under a USOE grant which runs til mid-1973. The success of the program has led to plans for more such vans, for instance, one which would visit hospitals to update the skills of health workers. (RT)",

It is based on the assumption that teachers can be educated in liberal arts, develop reasonable in-depth knowledge of a teaching field, and prepare for beginning work as a teacher during four years of college. The program calls for the selection by a recruitment committee of 120 students with a high potential for elementary teaching and who are representative of minority groups. Financial support of $75.00 a month is available for each student. The program involves four related components: 1) general education, 2) specialized education in one or more  recognized academic disciplines or teaching fields, 3) professional education in the requisite knowledge and skills of teaching, and 4) laboratory and field experiences. Each of these components is described in some detail. The first step in the implementation of the program will be curriculum building which should be undertaken by the college teachers who will do the teaching. It is recommended that this new program be organized as a pilot project and be carried on over a period of 5 years to test the various phases, make indicated changes, and evaluate the program as a whole.

It finds that the general stereotype of the teacher as being intellectually inferior to individuals in other fields is not supported by the available evidence. Rather than finding results generalizable to preservice and inservice teachers, the studies indicated that the psychological characteristics of men and women who enter and complete teacher training are quite different. Also, there are differences between elementary and secondary school teachers and between teachers and administrators with respect to personality characteristics, and there are personality differences among  those who enter the various schools that provide teacher training. The prime motivations for entering teaching were found to be a desire for upward mobility and simply lack of interest in any other field.

Otherwise the student who must learn English as a second language develops insecurity instead of security. When the acceptable norm in a class has been based on the work of the typical middle-class Anglo, the culturally different student has had failure predetermined for him. Language maturity needs to be assessed in these children in terms of auditory discrimination of all the necessary phonemes, and the habitual use of the correct syntax of grammar. Interaction with the teacher on an individual basis is also crucial for the child. If the child understands sound patterns in English, the beginning instruction should be in English; if he  understands Spanish, the instruction should be in Spanish. The second language should be introduced systematically but gradually, to develop genuine bilingualism in the student. The bilingual-bicultural program encompasses all the domains of the learning process. The student should acquire the concepts and skills of two languages, and should attain a positive self-image through the understanding of the value of his own culture. A multicultural program increases the appreciation of the contributions of other cultures, and fosters the democratic ideals. (MBM)",

Data were collected from 100 randomly selected students in the Child Development I course at Stout State University. Instrumentation included the Inventory of Attitudes on Child Guidance and the DV-Child Development Inventory. Results of a three-phase study supported the hypothesis that student performance in the course can be predicted from the DV-Child Development Inventory. Data analysis supported the hypothesis that a cognitively oriented course would have a significant influence on changing students attitudes, but the  hypothesis that observing children while studying child development would significantly influence students' child guidance attitudes was not supported. No significant attitude changes occurred in the areas of understanding the child, reflecting and accepting the child's feelings, redirecting undesirable behavior, encouraging independence and initiative, and encouraging verbalization. There was a significant change in student attitudes in the area of encouraging creativity by those students who had an observation experience. (MBM)",

It investigated 21 hypotheses as measured by the Minnesota Importance Questionnaire using a sample of 94 students. The variables on the questionnaire were recast in the form of null hypotheses for statistical testing, and a chi-squared was used on each hypothesis. The conclusions showed that both male and female subjects considered ability utilization, achievement, creativity, social service, responsibility, and advancement the most important vocational needs. Males and females differed significantly in their reaction to activity, advancement, authority, co-worker, independence, moral values, recognition, responsibility,  security, social service, and social status variables. They did not differ significantly on vocational needs, ability utilization, achievement, company policies and practices, compensation, creativity, supervision and human relations, technical supervision, variety, and working conditions. It is recommended that this study be used by vocational guidance counselors, higher education instructional staff, and prospective teachers, and that further research be carried out on the variables affecting responsiveness together with a follow-up investigation.

The investigator trained the study instructors--12 juniors with at least a 3.0 grade point average--in twelve 1-hour sessions. Soon after a session each study instructor spent an hour assisting the student assigned to him. The preparation program for the study instructor included training in elementary principles of learning, note taking, theme writing, term paper writing, student-professor relationships, time scheduling, studying for tests, and SQ3R reading skills. The evaluation of the program's assistance to students was observed by statistical analysis of grade point gains for experimental and control  groups, experimental and control males, experimental and control females, and experimental females and males. The only significant difference favored the female control group over the female experimental group. Other results of the study indicated that neither the experimental nor control group was able to significantly improve the second semester grade point average.

Corps members introduced English as a second language, and science and algebra taught in Spanish. School officials and teachers believed that the interns were well prepared for teaching and communicated well with the children. Some believed that the individual instruction and classes taught in Spanish were especially beneficial. The interns assigned to two high schools did not get along well with the faculty, and some were reassigned to elementary schools while others resigned. At one elementary school two full-time regular teaching positions were filled by Corps members,  contrary to the requirements of the legislation. As a result of the program the university developed a similar teacher internship sequence in the regular teacher education program to meet the needs of Spanish-speaking children, and a center for studies in rural and migrant education. The report recommends that the Office of Education should monitor the program more closely to ensure that Corps members are correctly used and to help create a cooperative attitude in the participating schools.

All prospective teachers will be  divided into inquiry groups of approximately 15 members with a staff member as leader, to act as advisor and as individual and group counselor. The program will help the prospective teacher to develop values, feeling, and personal qualities through involvement in open and honest relationships with himself and others.

There is also some evidence that  different teaching methods work well for differing types of students.

Areas covered were  elementary school counseling, projects in curriculum and educational psychology, individualized teaching, studies in learning disorders, sociological analysis in the schools, educational program evaluation, group processes, and counseling practicum. Evaluation showed that there was a high level of cooperative planning between schools and college, that school administrators were minimally involved in curriculum development, and that several important adaptations were made in college administrative policies.

There was a systematic search of the literature, and questionnaires and interviews were used to collect information about the current practices of 67 school districts, 95 businesses, and 19 government agencies in all regions of the United States. Contrasts and comparisons were made from the data obtained and results indicated that school districts vary considerably in their practices, many of them are not implementing recent research findings, and in general they are not using practices which industry considers routine.  There seems to be agreement that teacher selection and evaluation procedures should permit improved learning conditions for children and facilitate administrative decisions, should be cooperatively planned by teachers and administrators, should be understood by all personnel involved, and should be checked periodically for sources of errors. Six major interrelated trends emerged and the incorporation in a personnel system is considered not only possible but desirable. These trends include a systems analysis approach, management by objectives, external evaluation, and concurrent analysis of the results of product and process in a specific situation to obtain feedback for correction of individual problems.

A country such as India, divided by some 16 languages has formidable problems of communication, and if one adds the problem of illiteracy, the plight of a professional Indian writer seeking a wide readership becomes readily apparent. In technique and structure, the Indian novel in English is not different from any other novel. It seems to be in search for the exact kind of linguistic expression that suits the Indian temper and pace of thinking and Indian rhythm of talking. In sum, the Indian novel in English is at a crossroads, and although undecided in some ways, it  is clearly distinguished by its resolute will to go on, &quot;to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.&quot; (CK)",

        "description":"In the last decade, curriculum specialists in the Language Arts have expanded the field to include listening. A compelling reason for increasing the listening training of first grade and preschool children lies in their \"listening readiness.\" They are required to listen for information in order to learn, follow directions, participate in discussion and planning, etc. The relationship between listening test scores and various abilities and characteristics of the listener have often been investigated. Some factors in the listener found to be influencing comprehension are recognition of correct English usage, size of the listener's vocabulary, ability to make inferences, and ability to structuralize speech. Factors in the speech, such as difficulty and organization of content, and  environmental factors, such as closeness of speaker, play an important part in determining listening effectiveness. Four different approaches to teaching listening are noted in this paper: direct, indirect, integrated, and eclectic. The field of listening has catapulted into language arts prominence in the last 15 years. Irrefutable findings are few, and those reported here represent only a start in a promising art. (CK)",

The information includes a survey of 81 schools and detailed study of curriculum guides and other information from 38 schools. Concentration of the study was upon the courses employed, course lengths, courses for the slow and advanced, independent study, methods of restricting or guiding course choice, course titles and descriptions intended to attract students, use of required courses, use of prerequisites, skill requirements embodied in courses, individualizing instruction, student created courses and course content, methods of beginning the program, grade-levels involved, credits and  reporting pupil progress, scheduling and registering, the total-school elective system, and the program in the junior high school and ninth grade. Additional information is included on an independent study program in one of the schools, a unique humanities program, a modular curriculum, and course titles in all of the schools. It is concluded that the multiple elective program in English is worthwhile because of its ability to satisfy problems in English instruction and its use of sound educational theory. It is a worthy program both in its limited and extensive forms for engaging student interest in English. (Author/CK)",

Research during an eight-month period consisted of seeking, examining, assessing, and procuring materials in four large European areas. The status of children's drama as a theatre art throughout Europe may be attributed to the following factors: cultural tradition, subsidy, artistic quality, plays, philosophy, and creative and educational drama. The present position of children's drama in the United States appears to be due fundamentally to a lack of theatre tradition and a lack of philosophy that aims to provide theatre arts education for children and youth. The materials from abroad have potential use  in the children's drama field in the United States. The complete final report contains 14 references and three appendixes.

Fifteen freshman English sections were included in the experiment. These were divided into three groups of five sections each: the minimal writing group, the average writing group, and the maximum writing group. To determine the writing ability of the students as the project began and to determine the change in ability at the end, two tests were used: Form 1A of the Cooperative English Tests and Form X-35 of the Iowa  Tests of Educational Development: Test 3, Correctness and Appropriateness of Expression. Ten essays per student were also evaluated. A comparison of the pre-test and post-test scores on the Iowa Test revealed no constant pattern of change within any of the three groups. A comparison of the scores on the Cooperative English Test revealed that the difference between the pre-test and post-test means was significantly larger beyond the 1/10% level for all three groups. The overall conclusion is that writing practice increases writing ability. (Author/CK)",

Six hypotheses related to the objectives of this study were tested. All students taking E-101 during the fall of 1966 and the fall of 1967 constituted the population for this study. Data for this investigation consisted of American College Testing Program (ACT) scores, grades received in English courses, and certain other information obtained from each student's cumulative folder. Most instructors see progress made on the part of the remedial students. Ninety percent  of the Stout State University freshmen who were assigned to the remedial non-credit English 101 and completed it and who then took English 102A, satisfactorily completed it. Less than 10% failed the standard English course. The student who completes E 102A tends to complete E 102B with a satisfactory grade. (CK)",

Two sections of English I were randomly selected from the regular class schedule. Class A was taught using the usual syllabus and texts. Class B was taught using the same syllabus and texts with one exception. In Class A, the rhetoric text used was \"Modern English Handbook\" (MEH), whereas in Class B the rhetoric text used was \"Programmed College Composition\" (PCC). Both classes were conducted in the same manner except for the approach used in teaching writing. The PCC demanded that the student write more than did the MEH. Since the PCC text required many written assignments, more time was required of the instructor in reading written  assignments and analyzing them in class. The PCC also required more time for class participation on the part of the instructor as he had to independently work out the exercises. The PCC text required more time on the part of the instructor and the student, and thus did not prove to be a work saver. (CK)",

The data on the records of nearly all the students who took Speech 1 in the first semester of 1967-68 formed the basis of this study. The focus of this project was upon the interrelationship of various variables and the grades earned in Speech 1. Two-way contingency tables and chi-square analyses were used to determine the nature of the interdependence of the variables in reference to grades earned in Speech 1.

The experimental group received six units of audio-tutorial instruction in listening skills, while the control group received no such instruction. Faculty-student contacts were made in small groups of five to seven students. When pre-test and post-test scores of the experimental and control groups were compared, the experimental group made significantly greater gain in listening scores. The test used was Ella E. Erway's audio-tutorial \"Listening: A  Programmed Approach\" (McGraw-Hill, 1969). It was concluded that the units of tutorial instruction account for the \"t\" value of 6.706, signifying greater gain for the experimental group.

Two hypotheses were tested: (1) Musical talent can be predicted by means of a selected set of variables postulated to represent \"non-musical\" measures of intellectual and psychomotor, personality, and sociocultural indicators; (2) There will be no statistically significant loss of predictive efficiency when regression weights assigned to the set of predictors from one community sample are applied to data from other communities. The criterion of being musical was based upon a student's belonging to none, one, or more of eight  classifications of observed musical behavior. The sample population for this study was drawn from students in the Human Talent Research Program population who had just completed 12th grade in 1963. Statistically the results of the present investigation were modest. In describing differences among persons in a given sample on the basis of observed musical behavior, predictor models accounted for variances ranging from one-sixth to one-eighth. No results were obtained that supported the hypothesis that such models would retain their predictive efficiency when applied across samples. (CK)",

At the extremes, the full program as one mode was compared to a spontaneous, unstructured art learning situation as another mode. The sample consisted of 30 kindergarten classes in the Grand Rapids Public School System. They were selected from high, medium, and low socioeconomic school districts. The data were analyzed by means of complex analysis of variance with  mode of instruction, socioeconomic status, and length of instruction as the major variables (main effects). Data (art productions) were evaluated by trained art personnel by means of standardized criteria. Statistical reliability among evaluators was computed and found to be high. This study found that mode of instruction and SES were significant. The interaction between SES and mode was also significant. The experimental program had less effect for low SES than high SES children. The length of instruction was not significant. The full experimental mode of instruction was most successful in developing superior art productions. (Author/DB)",

The sample included 501 tenth through twelfth grade students in the arts and 479 tenth through twelfth grade students who were classified as non-art. An item analysis was conducted on the art sample, in a double cross-validation design, to develop scoring keys for the Biographical Inventory (BI) and climate items to predict performance in the arts. The cross validities obtained demonstrated that the BI could successfully  predict performance in the arts, both across and within art areas. Scoring keys constructed on the exploratory climate data for the art sample were shown to be related to artistic performance, although the cross validities were lower than those for the BI data. A total sample item analysis conducted on the BI items provided the keys for scoring the art sample and two non-art samples.

Divergent and convergent measures shared little variance, and the latter were strongly correlated with IQ and achievement. Moreover, convergent items requiring production of the correct association were strongly related to items requiring only recognition. It was argued that in children Remote Associates performance depends on evaluative abilities rather than the size of the associative repertoire. (Author)",

Bias must be determined by research on each instrument. A commitment to such research is in order. If bias is found, reasonable courses of action include test revision, alteration in interpretation, and discontinuance of testing. (Author/AG)",

This study investigated the PM performance of Negro children taught algebra via a discovery method of instruction. It was administered to 16 5th-6th grade experimental students and 19 5th and 6th grade control students. Mean score for the experimental students was 36.2. A t-test of the difference in mean scores for the 2 groups was significant, suggesting that, given encouragement and training in complex problem solving, Negro children can develop the same abstract reasoning skills measured by the PM as Caucasian children.

Differences between performance at the four levels of each course were also investigated and comparisons made among CEEB test scores, course grades, and CEEB standard score norms. Results indicated that students enrolled in the first four courses of a foreign language have learned significantly different amounts of the same material as measured by the Placement Tests. However, if results are inspected at the same course level by looking at the standard scores, it appears that the level of performance is about the same for each language. An accurate check on this was not possible as different tests were  used for each language. In general, students enrolled in lower level courses fell below the national norm average while those in upper levels were above. Relationships between test scores and course grades indicated that test scores can be used to identify successful performance almost as well as grades. Therefore, cut-off scores were established using the average reading and listening test standard scores for placement into and proficiency in the various courses studied. (Author/AG)",

The mean and standard deviation of freshman classes on an ability test, along with the mean and standard deviation of the freshman year grades obtained by classes over a five year period was available for several hundred colleges. Difference scores on the mean and standard deviations were also calculated. Correlational analyses and analyses of colleges that changed most produced the following results: 1) within any given year colleges whose incoming students were bright tended to award higher grades, but there was considerable room for variance from this trend, 2) the average ability levels of colleges change very little, even over five year periods, 3) when  the average ability of students increases (or decreases) about the same level of grades are awarded. This is interpreted as suggesting that faculties as a whole have preferred distribution of grades which they use whether their current classes of students are brighter or duller than previous classes.

        "description":"Two forms of a mathematics achievement test were developed for use in the evaluation of an experimental instructional program at the seventh grade level. Subjects were drawn primarily from minority groups at three urban junior high schools; all were of approximately normal scholastic aptitude, but one year or more behind their peers in mathematics achievement. Eligible students were assigned to experimental or regular mathematics classes and tested at the beginning and end of the school year. After the posttesting teachers were asked to rate all items on the two test forms for the extent to which their instruction would be likely to facilitate the ability of their students to answer each correctly. The findings imply that both groups of teachers tended to direct instruction at  skills which were relatively well-developed at entry rather than at areas in which students were initially weak. Possible reasons why this might occur are examined and potentially important implications of these findings for instructional practice and evaluation methodology are discussed, especially with regard to instructional programs for educationally deprived students. In particular, the importance of mapping student entry skills before designing instructional programs is stressed, along with the role of evaluation in providing such initial feedback information.

The second set of experiments examined the correlations between memory checking and other measures of personality and cognition. No important relationships between memory checking and other individual differences were found. The third set of experiments related memory checking to the clinical meaning of repression.

        "description":"In this brief discussion of the evaluation of compensatory education, the author analyzes why it has been difficult to discover whether compensatory education has succeeded; in addition, why the causes of success or failure are difficult to assess. In particular, the author points out that the political and economic circumstances of programs make evaluation difficult, and that problems of evaluative research in general, research design, and the static approach to assessment have posed formidable obstacles. Despite the many problems in the design, implementation, and evaluation of compensatory education programs and the equivocal status of much of the evaluation effort, educators are nonetheless constantly called upon to make judgements and policy decisions based upon the  experiences so far. The author presents some insights drawn from these research evaluation experiences. (Author/JW)",

Faced with public school problems, the city decided to attempt to bus some of its inner city children to schools of the surrounding suburbs. In the process of convincing the suburban towns to participate in a cooperative education program, the project leaders were forced to focus carefully on the desired results of busing urban children to the suburbs. Extensive records of the academic and social development of 260 children bused to 5 suburban towns were kept between 1966-1968, and compared to control groups of children remaining in the Hartford ghettos. The results of the testing and other data persuaded ten other towns and white middle class areas of Hartford City itself to participate in the  project and accept target area children. (Author/DM)",

The population studied consists of all of the school districts in Mississippi, and the unit of analysis was the local school district. Three types of variables were conceptualized and measures developed: school, community, and desegregation. Desegregation was the focus of the study and therefore the dependent variable. However, no effort was made to determine cause and effect. The measures of the variables were drawn from both primary and secondary sources and were gathered on the 147 districts. Primary data were obtained from district superintendents by use of a questionnaire which contained 47  items. There was a 95 percent response rate. Secondary data were gathered mainly from publications by the State Department of Education, records of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and Publications of the U.S. Census Bureau. Field theory provided the theoretical framework through which the desegregation process was viewed in the school and the community. However, its use was limited in that the complexity of the subject and the lack of related studies make it difficult to utilize a general theory at the basic level of analysis demanded by the data at this stage in the research of the desegregation process.

High school dropouts are more likely than high school graduates to be discouraged from seeking work when unemployment is high, and they are slower to seek work when employment is rising.

        "description":"The failure of State governments to use their unique place in the Federal structure for the relief of urban areas is illustrated by the school lunch program in New Jersey. The cities have a higher share of needy students and yet do not receive a greater share of program funds than the suburbs. The lunch gap--i.e., the number of low income students less the number of subsidized lunches served per day--is borne primarily by the cities--with the exception of the Atlantic City area. However, the State has several options in the allocation of school lunch program resources. But the State administration of fiscal controls is designed neither to produce the most meals for the needy nor to resolve the financial difficulties of urban school meal programs. In developing new policies for  using the State controls more effectively, the &quot;efficiency&quot; objective to maximize the number of meals served to needy children for a given amount of Federal and State program funds must be balanced against the &quot;equality&quot; objective to compensate poor urban districts in accordance with their more pressing needs. The State government is in a strategic position to deal with the problems that fall particularly hard on the cities, by supplying needed fiscal resources, delivering needed services, and restructuring the organizational framework through which localities do business.

        "description":"A number of criticisms of the National School Lunch Program are substantiated by a structural analysis within the general context of national child nutrition needs. The National School Lunch Program has been criticized principally on the ground of inadequate coverage of child nutrition needs, particularly for poor children. For the year 1968, access to the school lunch program was available in 71,983 out of approximately 119,000 schools. However, only approximately 18.5 out of approximately 55.8 million children, aged five to 18, participated in the program. Thus, the program actually reached only about 33 percent of the nation's school age children. Only 2,409,680 out of 8,579,392 poor school-age children were served. The program does not favor the requirements of the needy.  However, for the 1968 level of government appropriations to the school meal programs, more unmet child nutrition needs could be filled by, at the least, guaranteeing a free meal to all poverty children and raising prices for non-poverty children in schools that currently have a meal program.

A few were exemplary programs, but some of the programs also had weaknesses. By and large, the programs were essentially good, but had room for improvement. The report itself is in three sections. There is a short but important introduction in Part One comprised of evaluation considerations and finances. Each program is described and evaluated in detail in Part Two.

In addition, there persisted an uneasiness that the numbers of children and youth of poverty areas included in camping programs were not proportionate to the need. Local and national studies were undertaken to survey the camping scene and to report findings of camping opportunity projects. This guide to community planning, organizing and coordinating of camping opportunities for disadvantaged youth is based on data from many such sources, principally the National Camping Survey for Disadvantaged Youth completed in January 1969 under the direction of the Center for Research in Outdoor Recreation of Indiana University. This  unpublished survey involved the Battelle Memorial Institute, the American Camping Association, Inc., and the National Recreation and Park Association in a detailed study of eight selected camps. Generalizations are drawn from the experiences of these camps and others. By following the general plan of action outlined herein for youth coordinators, any local officials may tap their community resources to provide year-round camping opportunities for young people disadvantaged by poverty. In communities where there are no youth coordinators, leadership may be provided by an existing community organization or a special committee appointed by the Mayor. Appended in the manual are lists of Federal, state, and university officials who might be able to provide some assistance.  (Author/JW)",

The guiding hypothesis is that the styles and modes of information exchange and communication developed by a family provide behavior norms and perspectives that become internalized by its school-going members. During the first year, a complex family interview technique was developed and used; during the second year it was cross-validated. Also, the second year population was tested with the Missouri Childrens' Picture Series Scale and the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic  Ability: additional steps were designed to find out more about the variables associated with &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; achievement. In brief, more differentiated, smaller, knowledgeable, and stable families, in terms of more conforming and less aggressive children, stable eating arrangements, even mother's wish to work around the house without being interrupted, are associated with higher level cognitive and communicational ratings.

        "description":"The Spanish-speaking school pupulation in the Northeast has grown significantly in size, but not in success in recent years. The Coleman Report revealed widespread and sustained inequality of educational opportunity for Puerto Ricans. However, the limited amount of other research on Puerto Rican students indicates that the problem lies in the schools rather than in the students. That is, the deficiencies that Puerto Rican children show in verbal ability and academic achievement might not exist if initial instruction and testing were in Spanish, the children's native language. This study sought to demonstrate this using a population of 217 first-grade Spanish-speaking children in Connecticut. The Interamerican Test of General Ability, Level I, was administered by the same male  bilingual examiner first in Spanish and then in English. The Puerto Rican first graders scored significantly lower on the English forms than all ethnic groups, including Puerto Rican, in Coleman's study on the subtest of verbal ability; however, on the nonverbal ability subtest, the Puerto Rican first graders in this study scored significantly higher than all ethnic groups in the Coleman study. The subjects of the study scored significantly higher on the Spanish form than on the English form. (Author/JM)",

The 1960 Census of Population provides the most recent data used except in Chapter VII where data for 1965 were available. The distribution of the Negro population since 1870 by regions and by urban and rural areas is covered in Chapter I; Chapter II deals with the net migration of the Negro and white populations by urban and rural areas since the 1910 census. The changing employment patterns of Negroes by major occupational groups since 1920 are considered in Chapter III. Changes in eleven major occupational groups are examined by regions in Chapter IV for the periods 1940 to 1950, and 1950 to 1960. The index developed in  Chapter IV is used in Chapter V to examine the gains or losses of Negro employment in detailed occupations at the national level during the two periods covered. Chapter VI deals with changes in the educational level of Negroes and whites. Changes in the marital status of the Negro population and family composition are covered in Chapter VII. The numerous demographic changes over the years are described and analyzed in detail using data in the form of charts and graphs. (Author/JW)",

However, the project was never renewed and only lasted a year. The core of the program itself consisted of courses for the adults and a variety of educational activities for all members of the families. In this evaluation report, various aspects of the program are described and analyzed: the problem areas, the staff, the budget, etc. Some of the conclusions of the report are: (1) public assistance families are  interested in and will participate successfully in an educational skills program leading to gainful employment and can thereby become fully self-sustaining; (2) parents will surmount formidable obstacles to participate in an education program which they are convinced has value for them; and, (3) self-awareness, confidence, appearance, and family relationships are improved.

This study investigated the relationship of the self-concept of Puerto Rican pupils with achievement, IQ, ethnic group mixture, and teacher ethnicity. The subject population comprised 333 Spanish-speaking students in 29 bilingual and control classes, grades one to three, in three Connecticut cities. The subjects were selected so as to be representative of Spanish-speaking majority classes taught by Spanish-speaking as well as Anglo teachers in schools with varying but significant numbers of Spanish-speaking students. Self-concept was measured via teacher  reports on a standard instrument. The children were also tested for academic achievement and nonverbal intelligence. The results of a correlational analysis indicated that self-concept was significantly related to achievement in English and Spanish, as well as to teacher ratings of aural ability in both languages, although self-concept was not significantly related to IQ. However, the relationship between self-concept and academic achievement is demonstrated to be complex and circular. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Cooperative education, the combination of periods of on-campus classroom instruction with periods of off-campus experience, is particularly well suited to the needs of minority students in higher education. At a traditional four-year college, minority students are inclined to confine their associations to their own members, both on campus and at home. Such students, therefore, never become a part of a nonminority world. Colleges offering cooperative study lead minority students into off-campus assignments which involve them in new situations and new environments essential to their development as professional personnel. Cooperative education offers the minority student a chance for gainful employment--perhaps his first chance. This helps remove the fear that he will be unable to  find employment after graduation. Through cooperative jobs, many youths are introduced to work experience and job responsibilities for the first time. Coop employers furthermore tend to show greater patience and understanding with student employees. Through cooperative education, the minority student has the opportunity to find employment in large corporations, in government offices, and in scientific and technological firms--places where most minority students would never consider seeking employment.

        "description":"Psychologists and a few sociologists have provided the academic respectability for the political rationale that the American body politic's civil rights indigestion needs a resurrected, separate but equal diet. Today, it is intellectually respectable to question the genetic equality of whites and blacks, to assert the cognitive incapacities of blacks and Chicanos, and to worry about the demise of democracy as the result of too much equality. This has its intellectual roots in the racist theories of Count Arthur Joseph de Gobineau, who wrote \"The Inequality of the Human Races\" in 1853. The putative relationship of the variables of racial genes and intellect as outlined by Dr. Arthur Jensen in 1969 is but a sophisticated rehearsal of a historically tired theme. Although there are a  few white scholars concerned with the application of theories of cognition and pedagogy to the improvement of culturally divergent people, there are psychologists--mostly black--who are part of the solution rather than the problem. Black children can learn and achieve, even in slum environments, at the same rate as their advantaged white peers, provided multiple instructional strategies are employed to maximize the responsiveness of divergent cognitive styles.

A Parental Response Inventory was first developed. This is a structured inventory consisting of 12 prepared situations and a choice of four alternatives for each situation. Six of the situations involve behavior of a positive nature, six of a negative nature. This and other measures to assess verbal response patterns of mothers and the self esteem of children yielded the following results. A significant relationship exists between maternal descriptiveness in negative situations and the self-esteem of the child. Significant differences are observed between the inner city  black sample and suburban white sample. Measures to assess non-verbal parental behavior and its effects on the self esteem of the child indicate a significant relationship between maternal empathy, genuineness, and positive regard toward the child and his level of self esteem. Thus, another aspect of socio-cultural significance related to child-rearing has been identified and measured.

The primary subjects were the 10,981 pupils who ranged from kindergarten through grade 8 in September 1967, at the start of complete desegregation. Since no laboratory desegregation experiment was possible, a number of quasi-experimental strategies were used. While teachers and some parents were surveyed by questionnaire, much of the community information was collected via unobtrusive measures such as systematic observation, and analysis of archival records and voting patterns. The results show that traveling to new schools by bus had no adverse effects upon the  pupils, black or white. Bussed black pupils from formerly segregated schools showed greater group mean gains than their non-bussed transferred former classmates. Individual predictions among bussed black pupils were less reliable, however. Desegregation has had a profound influence upon community life. Black parents have taken an increasingly active part in school related activities. (Author/JW)",

The report is composed of four parts: (1) Introduction, (2) Policies and Programs in the United States, (3) Policies and Programs in Japan, and (4) Conclusions. The problem of labor shortage, as seen from somewhat different perspective in the two countries, has led to a reexamination of educational and training systems for both the needs of the individual and those of the economy. The most striking difference between the two cultures is the status of youth: where in Japan he is sought after as an intern for the future,  in the United States he competes on the basis of what he is worth in the short-run. Both countries are concerned with problems of underemployment, monotonous work, and job satisfaction. The study shows four main policy developments now emerging in the two countries: (1) a strengthening of the relation between employment and general economic policies, (2) positive efforts to promote mobility and the potential of workers, (3) training of individuals who otherwise would not contribute to the economy, and (4) closer collaboration between government and private groups to provide training.

Women lost more time because of acute illness, but men were more likely to be absent because of chronic conditions such as heart trouble. Labor turnover rates show that absentee rates of women have been dropping as a higher proportion of older workers enter the labor force. The separation rates for men and women factory workers in 1968 were 5.2 and 4.4 percent respectively. Occupational mobility was greater for men than for women; only 7 percent of the women but 10 percent of the men held a job in a different occupation in January 1966 than in January 1965. The average worklife of women tripled from 1900 to 1960 and increased by nearly  one-third from 1950-60. The expected worklife of women was found to be dependent upon marital status and number of children. A woman who gets married at age 20 has a worklife expectancy ranging from 25 years if she has one child to 17 years if she has four or more children. (BC)",

The approach involved technical conferences and discussions with Maintenance Officers and Aviation 3M Data Analysis Officers as well as a number of occupational analysis interviews with enlisted personnel assigned to Aviation 3M Data Analysis billets at 33 east and west coast commands, staffs, and offices. Based upon these preliminary visits, two questionnaires were developed. The first was a Command Questionnaire, designed to elicit information  regarding problems experienced by the command. The individual Questionnaire was administered only to qualified Aviation 3M Data Analysts and was designed to obtain information concerning the type of work performed, school background, and similar information.

Data included scores on the Specialty Knowledge Test and the Promotion Fitness Examination, points credited for time in grade, time in service, decorations, and Airman Performance Report mean overall evaluation. Average promotion board scores were computed by dividing each airman's raw board score by the number of members on the promotion board and multiplying the quotient by 10. Two weighted factor scores, one including and one excluding the average board score, were developed. The hypothesis tested was that inclusion of the board score component in the weighted factors composite score did not have an effect on the ranking of  the airmen. Rankings of individuals on the weighted factors composite were found to be essentially unaffected by inclusion of the promotion board score. It was concluded that using a board score factor merely inserted a non-visible component which would obscure explanations for nonpromotions. (Author/BC)",

The weighted factors composite score, excluding a promotion board component, gave airmen the same relative rank within selected Air Force Specialties as did the promotion board evaluations under the present operational system. Overlaps between the two ranks imply promotion of the same individuals by both systems. However, inconsistencies and unexplainable discrepancies in the ranking by promotion board scores were found in some few instances. It was concluded that, within the specialties analyzed, practically all the individuals promoted by the board system  would also have been promoted under the weighted factors system. If it can be assumed that the sample was representative of the Air Force-wide population of promotion-eligible airmen in grades E-3 through E-6, then it can be further assumed that the weighted factors system provides a valid airman promotion system in which the selection criteria are visible and equitable.

The NVII was administered experimentally to incoming students at seven &quot;A&quot; schools varying widely in curriculum. Scores were obtained on two different types of scales, empirically derived occupational scales and homogeneous (area) scales. A reenlistment criterion was later obtained for each man by searching enlisted Navy personnel records. Mean NVII occupational key and area scale scores were computed for reenlistees and nonreenlistees in each school. An intercorrelation matrix was computed for each school, and multiple-regression analyses were completed  on occupational keys and area scales using retention as the criterion variable. The area scales were analyzed for their ability to differentiate men in different ratings. Analysis of the data indicated that both the occupational keys and the area scales aided in identifying &quot;A&quot; school students most likely to remain in the Navy. Although the differences were not substantial, the occupational keys were somewhat more effective than the area scales in predicting reenlistment. (Author)",

        "description":"Large numbers of people are still employed in production, marketing, and processing of flue-cured tobacco in eight agricultural subregions in five southeastern states. Mechanization and new technology which is being introduced could result in substantial economic and social problems unless new economic opportunities are developed. However, mechanization has been slowed down by government tobacco programs, which limit acreage and production, and by the uncertain demand for future tobacco products. In 1967, about 295 million man-hours of labor were needed to produce the flue-cured tobacco crop, but if current technological methods were adopted this could be reduced by one-half. A mechanical harvesting system requires a $52,000 outlay for a 40-acre tract. Mechanization would affect  84,000 commercial tobacco farms with over 350,000 residents. In 1966 about 4.1 million residents resided in the area under study. As mechanization releases farm workers from their jobs, growth in nonfarm employment will be necessary to prevent an economic recession and considerable outmigration from the area. (BC)",

        "description":"The specific problem of this research was to ascertain and establish the essential major goals for university level treatment media courses for the professional preparation of occupational therapists and to determine basic units of instruction to contribute to the fulfillment of such goals. Course outlines and a syllabus were researched to determine the prevailing goals for treatment media courses. A list of fundamental activities which was formulated from textbooks used to support and supplement instruction, became part of the Interview Schedule used to gather data in selected facilities throughout the nation. This instrument was pretested in a pilot study. The data gathered by observing 445 patients and interviewing 143 therapists provided guidelines for formulating a list of  proposed goals and basic units of instruction. A panel of consultants then reviewed this list to determine that they were realistic and attainable for occupational therapy students. Finally a Commission evaluated each goal and basic unit of instruction as to its essentiality for organizing and structuring course materials in treatment media. This report is a summary of a dissertation which is available as ED 038 517. (Author/BC)",

In any effort to change the curriculum, the employing agency has to redesign certain task descriptions and job slots for the entry health worker and also must provide for worker upward mobility. Administrative support from the medical society and its specialty boards as well as from educational administrators is also necessary. Moreover, without active faculty participation, the  curriculum change is doomed.

The data show that about 30 percent of those in school both years revised their educational goals. Revision of occupational aspirations was found to be strongly associated with discontinuation of formal schooling. Examination of net changes in labor force participation and unemployment rates between the first and third surveys showed that very little of the increase in participation and decrease in unemployment was attributable to labor market conditions. An exception was a rise in unemployment among  students, apparently due to a depressed labor market in 1968. In general, leaving school and aging had the expected positive effects on participation.

Two studies are reported which investigate the relationship between the Machiavellian personality and two variables in the persuasive process: source credibility and message type. The first experiment tested several contradictions in the relationship between Machiavellian personality type and the perception of credibility. Results indicated that individual personality differences did result in differential perceptions of source credibility. The second experiment tested interaction between message type (Factual-Emotional) and credibility in inducing attitude change in subjects with high and low  Machiavellian traits. Results indicated that standard persuasion theories are most useful in predicting behavior of those with low Machiavellian traits, particularly with respect to source credibility. For those of high Machiavellian traits, however, a redefinition of the effects of source credibility is perhaps needed. (Author/RN)",

This operates in revolutionary rhetoric when the revolutionist creates a spiritual dynamism for his movement through appeals that suggest the sanction of supra-rational forces. The author applies this concept to the persuasive literature of an American Revolutionary propagandist, Francis Hopkinson. He reveals a close interaction of aggressive rhetoric and unifying rhetoric, operating to generate an American identity, which included a shared vision of both the national character and the destiny of America. He points to such words as &quot;liberty,&quot;&quot;genius,&quot; and &quot;commerce,&quot; as unifying symbols or the ultimate terms of that period. He suggests that in order to  grasp the full significance of American Revolutionary rhetoric, scholars focus their attention on the myth-making function. He concludes that the rhetoric of the Revolution was more than manipulated; it expressed ideas with personal significance to both rhetors and auditors--ideas with perhaps lasting impact on the future development of American public address.

        "description":"The validity and reliability of small group research published between 1970 and 1971 is examined in this paper. In response to the small group research position which gives precedence to theory over method, the author counters that placing measurement in a secondary position increases the danger of accepting claims of experiments which contain excessive error. A representative sampling of eight studies published in \"Speech Monographs\" between January 1970 and December 1971 were critically examined. The author found (1) that there is considerable agreement about what should be measured, but considerable disagreement about how to measure; (2) that neglect of task stimuli seriously comprised the internal validity of a number of studies; and (3) that accuracy and completeness of  reliability was not a crucial factor in manuscript publication. The author argues for more stringent methodological standards in the publication of research and discusses suggestions for appropriate utilizations of tasks and complete and accurate assessment of reliability.

Faculty organization is examined in relation to each components' (individual faculty members, departments, colleges, and other assorted units) accessibility to and utilization of feedback data assessing their performance and effectiveness. Recommendations for checking the possible inhibiting effects of departmental autonomy upon department program evaluation are advanced. Suggestions for a nation-wide effort (coordinated by national organizations) to establish goal consensus and accountability criteria among institutions according to field, are made. Through organizations such as the Speech Communication  Association and Association of Departments and Administrators in Speech Communication, the general public and decision-makers in institutions of higher learning can be educated about the value of increasing the communication skills and sophistication of individuals, groups, and organizations.

Cattell takes the authoritarian view that leaders are born, not made, and proposes the application of eugenic measures to develop the leaders that society needs, also stressing the importance of research to help to identify leaders. Lewin assumes the more democratic view that leadership qualities can be learned and that everyone is potentially a leader in the framework of group decision. The author holds that both Cattell and Lewin hold optimistic views of the future and the nature of man and that they are equally scientific and humanitarian. Lewinians might avail themselves more widely of the precision of Cattell's methods, whereas Cattell could profitably employ  the Lewinian principle of active experimentation with change. The possibilities for synthesis of the two approaches suggest interesting prospects for future research, training, and action. (Author/RN)",

Using college students as subjects, the authors used attitude ratings on values to attempt to induce in them feelings of self-dissatisfaction about specific values and attitudes and then measure attitude change. Their findings include indications that subjects could learn relaxation of muscle tension to low levels quite easily with biofeedback methods; further, biofeedback enabled subjects to maintain a lower arousal state, making them less susceptible to overreaction because of dissonance. A further study was designed to test  whether it was possible through biofeedback training to control the internal states of dissonance and thereby control attitude change. Overall results indicated that such feedback training in control of muscle activity helped the subject to maintain a state of calm during a &quot;dissonance&quot; experience; therefore, he was not prone to change his behavior.

The \"knowledge\" upon which linguistic judgements are based involves the premise of innate mechanisms. The assumption that speakers and listeners are able to acquire linguistic competence because they are biologically equipped to do so gives rise to an empirical question--whether or not the acquisition of communicative behavior reflects innate mechanisms. To clarify the issue, the authors discuss some of their own research designed to determine developmental sequences in speech-using behaviors. They view their study as support for further extended and refined research in  the area of speech-using behavior. Serious study of communicative behavior requires certainty as to whether Baconian or Chomskyan methodology best explains communicative competence. (Author/LG)",

Pitt's role in this rhetoric of repression is scrutinized. The author's discussion is guided by the following questions: (1) What was the climate of repression in which Pitt's rhetoric of repression found favor? (2) What were the characteristics of Pitt's rhetoric of repression, especially as manifest in the debate on  the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act of 1794? (3) Was Pitt's rhetoric of repression justified?

The specific question of whether listeners in a densely packed audience respond more favorably to a persuasive speech than listeners in a less crowded environment was investigated. One hundred and sixty-one volunteers from Northwestern University participated in the experiment. Randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions of varying audience densities and a control group, participants were subject to a 15 minute, live speech advocating an anti-vivisection position. Following the speech, treatment subjects filled out the Molnar Vivisection attitude scale on which they had been pretested earlier and also responded to the  Zuckerman-Lubin Multiple Affect Adjective Check List which measures situational anxiety. The results of the experiment supported the theory. Anxiety increased linearly with crowding and more immediate attitude change was evidenced under the more crowded conditions. (Author/LG)",

Analyses of the kinds of sentences used in different events show that those events involving the achievement of China or the failure of the U.S. were reported in \"Jen Min Jih Pao\" with a higher percentage of judgment and exhortation sentences; the Des Moines \"Register's\" approach is exemplified by the  large number of report sentences and few inference or judgment sentences.

On the methodological level he emphasizes expansion of research procedures to include systematic observation of unstructured interactions and settings and reliance on data supplied by the intuitions of communicators. The pedagogical implications suggest a move toward interdepartmental study, greater student participation and involvement, the beginning of communication training at an earlier  educational level (elementary), and the recognition that the primary objective should involve cognitive changes rather than behavioral changes.

        "description":"This study investigated several questions generated by cueing system research. The cueing system is perceived as a means of directing our categorizing behaviors in the processing and recall of information. Experiments involved a comparison of categorical cueing systems on a given task in relation to two control areas: (1) subjects using a free recall format and (2) subjects given eighteen random words. The experimenter sought to determine if there is any difference in the viability of various cueing systems and if a random set of cues facilitate idea generation as well as a more fully developed system. He used a four level, one-dimensional analysis of variance: Wilson's and Arnold's attributes and relationships; Kant's categories of understanding; a randomized word list on the  problem area; and control groups operating under the auspices of free recall.

However, there has been little examination of the target audiences themselves so that their responses might be employed as a criterion for evaluating informational efforts. Discussed in this paper is a set of interrelated studies describing research efforts aimed at determining the structure of student reactions to drug abuse messages. Initial comparisons of alternative messages based on such audience perceptions are also presented. A veriety of physiological and paper-and-pencil measures of three basic component aspects of perceiver response arousal, information  acquisition, and evaluation were used to examine the range of relevant target audience responses.

This is an outgrowth of the FCC ruling that broadcasters provide free time for anti-cigarette statements. The courts have been faced with controversies on the extent to which broadcasters must accept counterads, which might undercut the advertising base of the industry, versus the &quot;right of reply&quot; of citizens groups to diverse topics. The author raises three issues that are involved: the extent to which editorial advertising can logically be extended, the price of counteradvertising and the proportion of counterads to a  given commercial, and the effect of counterads as a prior restraint that would force stations to reject some advertising.

The IMC is an organizational solution for integrating traditional library services with the variety of multimedia devices and materials necessary to contemporary educational practice. The concept grew from the desire for more effective teaching in an increasingly complex educational system and the need for better use of the many audiovisual devices and other communications instruments developed for modern teaching and learning. Frequently, the literature does not differentiate clearly between libraries and IMCs. In earlier documents, discussions of library design often included useful information on multimedia accommodations. These  discussions are reported in the first section of this review. The second section focuses on those documents attempting to define the IMC and its new roles in relation to educational practice and facilities. (Author)",

The speeches contain recurrent theses, but each address is unique in its emphasis and development. Howe's basic theme is the urgent necessity to provide true equality of educational opportunity for all children. Individually and collectively, the speeches furnish new insights into critical issues and invoke increased concern and an effort to approach more nearly our great aspirations for American education. In discussions of school desegregation, the education of disadvantaged children, and the plight of the ghettoes, Howe emphasizes justice and the welfare of the nation. On such subjects as early childhood education, individualized instruction, work  experience for adolescents, the education of teachers, the limitations of scholastic aptitude tests, educational technology, and the values of humanistic education, Howe expresses continuing concern for the fullest development of the individual and the opening of doors for all children. He is sharply critical of unimaginative and insensitive school programs that set frustrating limits on the aspirations and achievements of human beings. (Author/JF)",

The five papers in this compendium summarize some of the findings that have emerged from these two projects. The first paper describes the evolution of the differentiated staffing project in a school district, from a district-level view of events. The author analyzes the tacit and sometimes explicit assumptions about organizations, people, and change that guided the attempts by project administrators to  innovate. The next two papers discuss the implementation process as viewed at the \"grass-roots\" level in two of the district's project schools. The fourth paper characterizes the adjustment problems that confronted teachers and paraprofessionals as they worked out their role relationships during the year of differentiated staffing implementation. The fifth paper brings together the studies of four elementary schools that have succeeded in altering their forms of staff organization.

To be effective, administrative procedures must be (1) clear and detailed, (2) set forth in written personnel policies, (3) validated by sound administrative and evaluative practices, (4) ratified in negotiated agreements, and (5) fully consistent with just constitutional requirements.

It suggests that the recent court decisions striking down State systems of school finance (because of intrastate inequality) may not be the panacea for minority group schoolchildren that it had originally been envisioned. Because minority group children are increasingly concentrated in urban areas, the decisions will tend to benefit minority group children to the extent they benefit the cities in which they live. The outcome depends on  whether cities as a whole will benefit from the decisions. (Author)",

Hollister, a mental health authority, tells how to use traditional subject matter fields to achieve not only cognitive objectives, but also objectives in the affective domain, thereby more fully developing the humane characteristics of children. Professor Harry S. Broudy, an educational philosopher, points out the factors that must be included in a unified theory of education and takes the position that the lack of such a theory of education has in the past prevented  development of a humanistic curriculum. In the last presentation, Professor Ronald Lippitt, an authority on the process of planned change, discusses a model for bringing about change in the curriculum. He analyzes six phases of the change process and illustrates these changes in detail by describing the steps that a curriculum change agent might take in developing new programs of education.

        "description":"This report contains conference addresses that (1) deal with social and psychological forces influencing curriculum change and (2) discuss actual changes now taking place in a number of subject fields. Insights into the forces acting on the curriculum are presented by the authors of Part I. Arthur W. Foshay challenges educators to recognize the legislative, social, economic, and scientific forces working on curriculum and the school. William A. Bricker points to the contributions of the Skinnerian concept of reinforcement and shaping to our understanding of the process of learning. Donald Snygg contrasts the shaping concept with the concept of the cognitive field theory of learning in which learning is seen as an active process of search and discovery. Dwayne Huebner examines the  relationship between the psychology of learning as presented by two theorists representing contrasting schools of thought and the implications of learning theories for curriculum building. William M. Alexander draws on these ideas to make predictions for the schools of the future. Part II contains papers issuing from seminars in the subject areas of art, music, vocational education, social sciences, and health and physical education. (Author/JF)",

The experiences reported herein provide evidence that the learnings to be acquired through student activities should no longer be considered supplemental to the formal program of studies, but should rather be viewed as complementary and essential to the full implementation of the goals of the school. Sixteen activity-oriented programs launched by enterprising teachers, students, and/or administrators are described that demonstrate a new commitment to the importance of involving teachers and students in the decisionmaking process.

One school each in Duval County, Florida; San Antonio, Texas; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Oakland, California was selected as an implementation site for either the teacher model of the teacher/parent model. Contracts were drafted for each site for payment of incentives to teachers and/or parents. This report evaluates the success of the project in general and at each of the sites in an attempt to synthesize the results into some generalizations about the impact of the Project as a change agent separate from its impact on results. General conclusions drawn by the evaluators indicate that the change process impact of the project is largely a function of (1) local environment, (2) pay scales, (3)  school site administration and management styles, and (4) geographic characteristics. Differences in models -- i.e., \"parent/teacher\" vis-a-vis \"teacher\" did not seem to have as much effect as did the above factors. An analysis of hypotheses for each site is also included.

        "description":"This report presents a 2-year, longitudinal evaluation of the effects of a major training program on two State Educational agencies and four local educational agencies. The program was designed to improve the process of organizational planning in educational systems. The evaluation procedure involved interviewing top administrators who underwent training four times over a 2-year period. Questionnaires were administered to these and to 40 additional key personnel. Additionally, an analysis was conducted of documents and samples that were produced through the training program and of the extent to which they were implemented. Assessed were 429 measures, including 133 measures of written documents produced through the training program and 296 produced through  interviews/questionnaires. The achievement of the training program as evidenced by written documents proved to be only modestly successful. An assessment of the 296 interview/questionnaire measures found that in 36 cases the program in organizational planning had produced negative effects, in 222 cases it had produced no effects, and 38 cases positive effects. The findings indicated that as a result of the training program, top administrators and key decisionmakers at both the State educational agency level and at the local educational agency level did not, in general, change either their beliefs about organizational planning or their perceptions of how planning might be pursued by the organization.

Related dilemmas include achieving a reasonable balance between long- and short-term research, determining appropriate means to insure that educational practice reflects important R&amp;D findings, developing a true collegial relationship between education researchers in the field and members of the NIE staff, gaining credibility among the variety of constitutencies that NIE serves, finding ways to capitalize on dismal evaluation experiences, and  making realistic assessments of educational goals.

A questionnaire, sent to a random sample of the students, probed for student characteristics; students present use of nonacademic space; and the use they would make of nonacademic space were it to be made available at Auraria. The study results indicated that the Auraria student body, present and projected, is quite sharply different from the student body of the traditional, nonurban-residential college, and that the students recognize their different nature and different needs in some respects, but in others are inclined to blur their distinctive urban, commuting  student needs into a conventional generalized picture of the &quot;college student.&quot; It was concluded that planners have, therefore, a reasonably solid base of knowledge of the characteristics of these students, but a less solid base of knowledge of their needs in nonacademic areas. Therefore, they must proceed incrementally with the provision of nonacademic services and facilities, providing first those that are most urgently needed by reason of both logic and stated student preference, and proceeding in cautious phases to others lower in the clear-need, known-need hierarchy.

Serious problems are developing along with the use of carpeting. The selection and maintenance of carpet are important problem areas. To help meet the need for more information regarding the maintenance of carpet, data were collected from 75 school attendance centers in seven States. Approximately 56 acres or 2,433,000 square feet of carpeting were included in the study. Data were collected from school centers located in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New York, Tennessee, and Texas. Information regarding the use of carpet in schools was based on data that were collected on the spot in the 75 buildings and on the results of interviews  with administrators, teachers, and maintenance workers to discover what methods worked.

Evaluators can rate buildings against certain criteria in each of ten categories on the scale of ten points.

When the wheel graph has been marked for each category, the dots are connected and the resulting geometric shape is the building's rating. (Author)",

The MIS as a type of &quot;guidance system&quot; for change is made up of three specific information loops and a control mechanism, which acts on the information. It was found that the most respected school district studied had no operative MIS, although a number of the important components were present but were continually breaking down. Through a series of propositions, the author points out the character of the  organizational forces that exclude the existence of a functioning MIS and therefore greatly reduce the possibility of systematic change in the high school.

Described is how literature can develop and clarify the student's concepts as he becomes aware of various points of view, and teach him to see relationships, make generalizations, and develop convergent thinking and understanding. Examples of how to teach children to read for ideas are given. Examined is how the study of literature develops both the communication skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing) and higher intellectual  skills such as divergent and evaluative thinking.

Most of the statistical and descriptive data are drawn from a health training model developed by the Communicable Disease Center, U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, with emphasis on selection of data relevant to child health and child development. Information is given on the hypothetical community's general characteristics, education, medical personnel, major medical facilities, clinic operation, health department operation, services for the economically disadvantaged, and non-governmental agencies. The hypothetical community was developed to serve as a frame of reference for a  workshop on the identification and treatment of developmental disorders among preschool children. It is intended to provide an adequate base on which to plan a model preschool screening and treatment system. (KW)",

The dimensions are seen to vary in importance at each of the three developmental stages of the project's funding period. A program planning format suggested for replication activities is presented, and two case studies apply the format to the replication activities of specific projects. Fourteen principles are  given to guide project staff in the implementation of replication strategy, among which are early involvement with key community people and political awareness.

Approximately 800 children were identified of whom 52% were reported to be hearing impaired, 19% multiply handicapped, 13% visually handicapped, and 12% physically handicapped. Twenty-five percent of the children identified were 6- and 7-years-old, 54% 5- to 10-years-old, and 16% 3- to 6-years-old. Over half of the children were reported not to be receiving any special educational services, and more than half of those children were 5- to 9-years-old.

Research on the language skills of the blind included a rejection of sensory compensation, while research on language in the retarded was seen to focus on linguistic variables and reading ability. Included among the research on language development of the deaf was research which was reported to suggest the value of early sign language training for cognitive development and the author's research on written language comprehension by the deaf. Research on concept formation in the blind found deficiencies in concept formation among the blind, while concept problems in the retarded were found to be in the  areas of language control and verbalization rather than perception. Research on concept development in the deaf showed conflicting findings on whether a concept deficiency exists once verbal aspects are removed. Little research on arithmetic skills in the blind was reported, but one finding of skill development in the retarded showed better computation skills than normal children of the same mental age. The author's research found that the mathematical performance of deaf children was usually slightly higher than that of normal hearing children. (DB)",

Schools were selected on the basis of the following criteria: school population of 600 to 900 students; existing psychological services and speech and hearing services; availability of space; and willingness of teachers and principals to implement the project model. Teachers selected to participate in the study were trained over a period of 30 weeks. Data from questionnaires were found to show an overall acceptance of the experimental design by principals, regular education teachers, and special education teachers, and to  indicate that personnel in the experimental schools perceived their roles much differently than controls. It was reported that handicapped children in the experimental schools received more services than their controls, and that more handicapped pupils were served under the new design. Pre- and post-test data indicated that experimental groups scored significantly better than the control population on comprehension tests, although there were no significant differences between groups on vocabulary test scores.

Training guidelines concern the areas of discipline, dressing skills, feeding, personal hygiene, play activities, and toilet training. Suggestions such as the following are offered: teach by showing what you want the child to do and allow him to practice the task; prepare the child in the mechanics of feeding by allowing him to play in sand with a spoon or shovel; and select toys on the basis of their  appropriateness for the child's mental age. Developmental abilities for each mental age level are discussed in terms of motor characteristics, speech skills, personal-social characteristics, eating skills, and play activities. (GW)",

Provided were results of 128 employer interviews conducted to identify the skills and visual abilities required for jobs in a variety of fields.

        "description":"Reported were studies measuring residual auditory capacities of deaf persons and investigating hearing aids which transpose speech to lower frequencies where deaf persons may have better hearing. Studies on temporal and frequency discrimination indicated that the duration of a signal may have a differential effect on its detectability by sensorineural hearing-impaired persons compared to normal, but that temporal effects on frequency discrimination and perception of temporal order seem normal, and therefore provide scant explanation of low speech discrimination abilities. Problems involved in doing research with long-term hearing impaired Ss were identified. Studies of speech pattern perception yielded the following conclusions: sensorineural hearing-impaired listeners have  better residual reception for low-frequency speech patterns than the middle- and high-frequency patterns; and the superiority of low-frequency pattern reception holds over a rather wide range of degrees and types of sensorineural impairment. Data was reported concerning the hypothesis that acoustic transposition of phonemic differences could make them indistinguishable at least until discrimination could be retrained. Also presented were data showing that speech discrimination performance is higher for transposer amplification than for conventional amplification. Theoretical aspects of frequency transposition were discussed. (GW)",

Some 186 sixth grade students were divided equally along black and white racial lines into two groups and shown a filmstrip on drug abuse. Three identical filmstrips were assembled, using either a black, white, or integrated cast and narrated by either a distinctly black or white voice. Information retention was measured by a multiple choice test while subjective attitudes were measured by a semantic differential scale. Seven statistical hypotheses were generated and analyzed by a 3x2x2 multivariate analysis. Little significant difference was found in the effect of aural or visual  cues on retention. However, the visual subjective attitudes showed that whites perceived information from all black casts to be less \"expert\" than information from all white or integrated casts. The author concluded that the effectiveness of a communication is at least partially determined by the ethnic characteristics of the source or receiver. (MC)",

Learning systems have 3 characteristics: a productivity index (PI); rules; and roles. The PI is simply a measurement device for administrative evaluation. The rules insure an orderly progression through the learning sequences. And the roles are the designations the learner assumes as the system advances. Primarily the learner becomes not only the tutor and tutee, but also an evaluator and innovator.

Although it appears that learner control can be helpful in mainline computer-assisted instruction (CAI), the characteristics of its role have not yet been well defined. The research in general has been inconclusive, and further research should focus on individual differences in learner control. Few studies found the expected conclusion that learner control improves student attitudes; however, one study found that learner-control students have lower scores on a state anxiety scale. Future research will hopefully  determine the conditions under which learner control would reduce student anxiety. Since learner control is not as simple an instructional treatment as was first imagined; well controlled laboratory tests, rather than extensive instructional sequences seem appropriate for the study of conditions under which learner control is appropriate in CAI.

The survey sought to answer a variety of questions pertaining to the overall status of ITV in the U.S. so that national policy makers could get some idea of the national programing practices. Five areas were investigated: 1) administrative and operational environment; 2) production; 3) classroom use; 4) program assessment and evaluation; 5) content design, accountability and performance. The survey broke down the responses to reveal data on broadcasters, schools, universities, fixed service facilities, and cable television. No statistical analysis is presented, only raw percentages.

Sixty-four university students enrolled in an audiovisual education course were divided into 4 groups. Each group was presented either with all the objectives, a partial list of objectives, or no objectives at all prior to the viewing of the film. After seeing the film the groups were tested. The results unequivocally supported the facilitating role of pre-instructional presentation of objectives on the post-instructional learner attainment objectives. The explanation of this phenomenon was that the presentation of objectives enabled the learner to focus his  attention on relevant material. (MC)",

One consideration in this complex issue is the adequacy of the depth cues which can be derived from imagery based on two- rather than three-dimensional sources. Although motion parallax is a relatively minor cue, it is the essential difference between imagery derived from two- and three-dimensional sources. This study was designed to investigate the role of motion parallax in the perception of apparent depth on a dynamic television display. Subjects were tested on their ability to perceive dimensionality as a function of altitude. The results showed that motion parallax provides a useful cue to depth only at very close ranges. It was concluded  that for training problems which require simulation of television navigation and/or targeting imagery there is little or no advantage in the more expensive three-dimensional image storage devices for altitudes above 750 feet.

One group (prior knowledge) read a programed instruction (PI) text of PERT before going through a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) task. Another group (no prior knowledge) did the task before reading the text. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not show that knowledge of PERT helped performance. However, a group-by-sex ANOVA on  proportion correct showed females performing better than males.

A mathematical aptitude test containing both easy and difficult items was administered to 80 subjects.

A ten-item multiple choice test was used to measure retention. The classes were divided into color and black-and-white television groups. The study found that there was little evidence that color was a different instructional medium from black and white.

The data analysis revealed very great differences among teachers in their use of both film and television. This finding proved that simply providing access to ETV did not necessarily mean utilization would follow. The teachers' previous habits towards ETV were the deciding factor on the utilization, be it black-and-white or color. The research also showed that though a large number of color sets were  available a sizeable proportion of teachers and students did not feel color television added that much to the programing.

No matter what the system of instruction and regardless of the native tongue, this method is applicable, although the phonological differences will of course vary from language to language. Once the  contrastive approach is adopted, the student will more easily be able to master sounds foreign to his ear and will also have a better understanding of patterns in his own language. (RS)",

The traditional view establishes a criterion that is grammatical--the presence or absence of inflection is crucial in categorization. Suzuki (Akira's) arguments for classification appeal to the overall regularity or simplicity of the language; his fundamental assumption is that the grammatical forms of Japanese reflect in a direct way its semantic aspects. Both approaches are illustrated with examples. (VM)",

Such an experiment raises the possibility that the objectives of intelligibility and communicative comprehension may be more important than grammatical correctness.

The function of the position is examined from the local, state, and national levels. The present role of the supervisor at the statewide level is examined from the point of view of (1) chief functions, (2) liaison activities, (3) teacher education, (4) curriculum (5) materials and research, and (6) other services. Reasons for continuing support for the position are presented. Successful supervisory practices and policies and several \"deficient\" aspects of the position are examined. Major achievements of the supervisors during the past 15 years are also noted. The study concludes with several tables of statistical data. (RL)",

The interaction between major city-based universities and their urban communities has become a matter of great national significance. On the one hand, the increasing intensity of our urban problems and the growing public awareness of and concern about these problems have given them the highest national domestic priority. Almost  simultaneously, the major universities of the country have come to be viewed as powerful resources for solving all sorts of national problems and for achieving national priorities. These two developments converge in what can be called the university-urban interface. (Author/HS)",

This new data tends to strongly reinforce the crucial point made in the previous study that indicated that college and university administrators have advocated one system, then another, without adequate empirical follow-up of the effects of various systems. The result, in some cases, has been the failure of calendars to meet the demands of their proponents. The latest data indicates that semester calendars are giving way to modified semester calendars and the 4-1-4 calendars.

In answer to the item, 7% of the respondents to the 1968 survey stated that they strongly agreed that most college teaching was bad. Another 40% moderately agreed, 6% indicated they had no opinion on the item, 23% moderately disagreed, and 25% strongly disagreed. In the 1970 survey, 8% of the respondents stated strong agreement with the negative judgments of college teaching; 33% indicated moderate agreement; 35% moderate disagreement; and 24% strong disagreement. It  was evident upon examination of the data that faculty under forty are more likely to be unhappy with the present state of college teaching than faculty fifty or older, but rank and field of the professors seem to reveal no basis for comparison.

In order that allocative decisions might be made on rational grounds, it is necessary to identify and assess the implications of current and alternative resource allocations. The findings reported in this monograph provide intra-institutionally comparable expenditure data for each of the 5 public colleges in Alberta, and by so doing, provide a quantitative analysis of current resource allocation. In addition, the study details the specific data elements required and the collection and analysis procedures to be followed in conducting an expenditure analysis on an annual basis.  The findings reported in this study should prove useful to administrators, faculty, and students in each public college as information for reviewing resource allocations and for relating expenditures to output measures and indicators. The methodology used in conducting the analysis should prove useful to administrators throughout the system of postsecondary education in their efforts to make the best possible use of the human and physical resources that are allocated to the educational enterprise.

Among the findings of the study were: (1) The black colleges fell  slightly short of the 5% minimum level for library support that is generally considered acceptable. (2) Regarding faculty salaries, the data revealed that professors at the white colleges received 9.8% greater compensation than did professors at the black colleges. (3) Staffing needs in student services have received particular attention at the black colleges, especially in the areas of admissions, student orientation, counseling assistance, and placement.

Large changes were recorded between 1969 and 1971 on all scales of CUES except scholarship.

The study was conducted under the auspices of the Central State Colleges and Universities (CSCU) Cooperative Research Program. Six areas were identified as descriptive of the campus environment: (1) academic environment; (2) facilities and services; (3) cultural climate; (4) communications; (5) community relationships; and (6) ethical and moral values. The inventory that was developed consisted of 150 items, 25 within each of the six areas. Each item describes a condition, practice or circumstance considered by the CSCU committee to be a desirable characteristic of a college or university  campus. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with each statement using the following options: strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree, and uncertain or do not have adequate information to respond. The results of the study are presented in this document. (Author/HS)",

In addition, a generalized network of major activities relating to the development and implementation of a college information system is provided for the purpose of presenting a conceptual activity plan. The third section describes the work in progress at Freed-Hardeman College where unit record (punch-card) equipment is still being used for data input preparation and  for processing many applications that have not been converted to computer processing. Personnel of the college have demonstrated quite effectively that a small college has obtained the advantages of a low-cost, unit record system and the minimal cost of purchased computer time. The compatibility of its card processing system has been effectively coupled with the use of a computer on a part-time basis. The disadvantages of such an arrangement have been kept to a minimum through an adequately trained staff maintaining a high level of communication with the computer center. (Author/HS)",

The report contains data on the minority group status of full-time credit course students only. With few exceptions, the proportion of minority students has increased in all types of state university institutions. Progress can be seen in two dimensions: in minority students as a percent of total enrollment for each year, and in the net gain in this percent from 1969 to 1971. Some indication of the effort to encourage minority student enrollment can be found in the tables on institutionally determined financial aid that list the number and amounts awarded by each college to each  minority group. University-owned or university-supported housing statistics show similar gains in the number of minority students served. These gains in enrollments and services over a 4-year period attest to the commitment of the State University of New York to equal educational opportunity. (Author/HS)",

The Institutional Goals Inventory was given to 400 LACC faculty, day and evening students, and community people, and 92 percent were returned. Inventory statements covered 20 goal areas designed to determine present thinking as to what the institutional goals are and what they should be. Respondents were asked to respond to each of 90 statements in two ways (how important the goal is and how important it should be) on a 5-point importance scale. Ten additional statements about controversial educational issues were to be answered on a &quot;should be&quot; basis only. Data are given for the &quot;is&quot; and &quot;should be&quot; responses, for the discrepancies between the two, and for the responses from the 68 participating  community colleges. Among the results were that: (1) vocational preparation was the top-ranking &quot;should be&quot; goal area for both LACC and the 68 colleges; (2) in 19 goal areas, LACC means were above those of the 68 colleges for both the &quot;should be&quot; ratings and the discrepancies; (3) no goal area showed a negative discrepancy given by any LACC subgroups; and (4) eight individual goal statements were ranked in the top five on both the &quot;should be&quot; scale and the discrepancy scale by one or more of the LACC subgroups and the total group.

        "description":"A pilot study is reported in the development of a cost/benefit analysis model for vocational education programs in community colleges and its application to three programs at the College of Alameda. This model can be used to compare and assess the effectiveness of occupational education programs at the same college or different colleges at the same time or at different times. The model is based on the idea that program costs generate measurable return on investment in terms of income derived from placements of students who have completed the program. It is a generic model that is flexible enough to allow users to develop specific models to suit the particular needs of a particular college or district. The model includes a selection of costs to be assessed and analyzed in terms of  program costs and benefits to be derived. The mosel was applied to the business equipment technology, dental assisting, and diesel mechanics programs at the College of Alameda. Institutional direct and indirect costs were selected for analysis because the model's use was determined to be primarily for the allocations and reallocation of institutional resources. Benefits used were increased earnings to the student who completed the program and was placed in the field for which he was trained. Results indicated that the increased income on entering the field was quite small. Further followup studies should be conducted to determine the extent of salary increases, and students and faculty should be better informed of the starting salaries for various fields. (KM)",

Two career fields, dental assistant and auto mechanic, were chosen for study. A questionnaire based upon the actual job performance was completed by six groups connected with the auto mechanics and dental assistant programs at the Des Moines Area Community College--students, ex-students, advisory board, employers, potential employers, and instructors. The questionnaires were divided into sets of items based on job performance objectives, and means were determined for each group on each set of items. The means were tested with an analysis of variance procedure. Where significant differences were found, paired \"t\" tests were used to  determine which groups were responding differently. The analysis showed significant differences for: auto mechanics--fuel system, starting system, electrical, suspension and alignment, engine, and power train; dental assistant--x-ray procedures, office procedures, and chairside procedures. The differences found indicated the areas for curricular revisions and objective-by-objective analysis. (Author/KM)",

The impact on business was measured in terms of increased cash flows in the local economy. Both an inclusive and a conservative estimate were made for each type of expenditures in the local area by college-related individuals. The total estimated impact in terms of increased cash flows was $4,039,431 inclusive and $2,229,868 conservative. A local multiplier of 1.45 was applied to these figures to arrive at full estimate impact figures of $5,857,175 inclusive and $3,233,309 conservative. After the negative impact of taxes was accounted for, the operation of the  college contributed 2 to 4.5 million dollars annually to the cash flow of the local economy. The impact of the college on local government was shown by the estimated $220,350 inclusive and $93,936 conservative taxes paid by college-related persons. The taxes used to support the college is a negative economic impact, but the net impact including increased expenditures was definitely positive. The study also revealed that the revenue picture was relatively positive, in that less than 30% of the operating budget comes from local taxes, and almost 50% comes from non-local sources. Appendixes to the report provide: The Multiplier; College Revenues; Omissions from ACE Format; Population Figures of Sponsoring School Districts; Economic Impact Studies and Computer Simulation; Summary of Funds and  Major Capital Expenditures through July 1, 1972; and Instrument.

In terms of mobility, about 80% of the CCC transfer students went to seven Illinois institutions, and 7 of every 10 students attended public institutions. In relation to student characteristics, the transfer rate of CCC men students is higher than that of women; two of three students in the study were male. The women transfers attended predominantly local teacher training institutions. The curriculum chosen by the students was liberal arts (67%) and business (12%). Only 17% of the students had attained the associate  degree prior to transfer; however, 6 of every 10 of the students remained at CCC more than two years following the date of first enrollment. A total of 84% transferred to senior institutions during the same year in which they terminated at CCC. In terms of ability, the transfer population showed more similarity to senior college students than to those in community college. Of the nongraduates, over one-half earned 45 or more hours at CCC prior to transfer, and two-thirds earned all of their college credits. Senior college performance of this group showed a 20% attrition for the first year and 18% for the remaining four years of the study. The graduation rate over the five years was 60%, one-half of the students completing the requirements within two and one-half years after transfer. The  study data are provided in 19 tables.

To obtain information regarding these policies, an eight-page questionnaire was administered to all 47 faculty members. The three parts of the questionnaire were: I. Evaluation Tools and Approaches; II. Overall Approach to Grading; and III. Other Factors in Evaluation. Each of the parts was analyzed for both general and technical education faculty members, and differences were noted. In addition, all technical education faculty (n=14) completed an additional one-page form relating to the grading practices used in the clinical experience. The study results include the following: (1) the final examination and final course grade, written quizzes and unit tests were the most frequently used in  both general and technical education courses; (2) the most frequently used method of reporting evaluation to students in general education courses was the letter grade, whereas in technical education it was in terms of points; (3) the practice of pass/no pass and satisfactory/unsatisfactory was used infrequently; (4) in general education courses, the most frequent practice of determining letter grades was use of the normal curve and adjusting grades to fit performance; (5) in approximately 60% of general education courses and 70% of technical education courses, the evaluation score is translated into a letter grade either all, most, or some of the time; (6) generally, students did not &quot;contract&quot; for final grades in either type of course; (7) within the technical education courses,  clinical laboratory factors are more important than any others.

Citations amongst 140 heavily cited, widely circulating journals were used to define the interrelationships between the journals, and by inference between the research areas they represent. All education journals of wide circulation which contained 100 or more references per year were used in the study. All of the maps and measures emphasize the dominant influence psychology has as the primary source of knowledge for education research. Elementary education and guidance are in the mainstream of education literature while higher and general education are not. Science education and special education are compact, self contained subfields having few  connections with other education literature. Two-step citation maps linked each journal with the two journals it cites most frequently. The citation chains formed subfields maps showing the interrelationships between different graphic clusters of journals. A cluster analysis, using all of the citations from each journal, confirmed the subfield clusters generated by the graphic methodology. Hierarchies were constructed illustrating dependency relationships between the individual journals and between clusters of journals. Procedures were developed which isolated general and subfield core journals, and journals peripheral to education. (Author)",

The objectives of the study are to: (1) present an historical summary of the changes in the library policies and procedures regarding fines and overdue materials, along with the reasoning that led to those changes; (2) assess the effects of the new policies and procedures on library operations, including costs, circulation of materials, and relationships with patrons; and (3) evaluate suggested changes in those policies and procedures, including the possible reinstatement of the former policy on fines, and to develop recommendations for future action.  After discussing the various purposes for which libraries have instituted fines, and the arguments that have been offered for abolishing them, the major portion of the report deals with the actual effects of operating under a no-fines policy, in six categories: use of the library, the library's collection, the library's clientele, fairness to patrons, the library's image and role, and the costs of library operation.

American theological education is defined here as the efforts of American Protestant theological schools, particularly the member schools of the American Association of Theological Schools (AATS), to prepare students for ministry. An assumption of this study is that the role of the library is crucial to the success of theological education. The study is not limited to, but is primarily concerned with, three interrelated dynamics: the philosophy, teaching method, and libraries of theological education. A basic assumption of the analysis is that these three dynamics exert a reciprocal influence upon each other. The purpose of the study is to trace the historical development of the  theological library as it responded to and, in turn, stimulated the philosophy and teaching method of theological education, and from the observation of these reciprocal influences to understand and project the library's potential in contemporary theological education.

More and more, non-print methods of communication (for example: films; filmstrips, slides) are being used as effective disseminators of information in and about state government. Such information, as with traditional print material, is of importance to the citizens of the state and thus must be accessible to the public. The Commission, however, recognizes that these public documents cannot be distributed in the same manner as conventional printed materials. Costs of duplication, reproduction, and storage present problems which require special consideration. Suggestions for deposit and disposition of these non-print documents have been included in the Proposals for Action (Chapter 4) recommendation  No. 5 which outlines the clearinghouse/depository system. The problem of publication and distribution of the documents of local governments is not dealt with in this report. The Commission recognizes the importance of these documents and urges that further study be given to the problem. The Commission is also concerned about the extent of information duplication in the publications of state agencies. However, time and the complexities involved in determining whether or not such duplication actually exists precluded pursuing this problem. (See also LI 004 144 and LI 004 150) (Author/NH)",

The implementation of the data base into the generalized search system, ABACUS, is described. One hundred and fifty-eight users received SDI service at present, 99 from governmental and educational institutions, 23 from industry, and 36 from abroad. Retrospective searches have also been made. Two methods of matching users to documents have been employed - the controlled vocabulary of the Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors, and the free text words of titles. Some users' assessments of the relevance of the output have been gathered, and examples are given of query formulation into profiles and the resulting printout of references. A number of the profiles for  the ERIC data base have also been run on data bases such as ISI, INSPEC and COMPENDEX. The practice of writing profiles which contain term types which are appropriate to only one of several data bases, against which they are searched, is discussed. A frequency list of words in the titles has been compiled in order to use a weighting procedure for sorting the printout. A training program for acquainting the user with this new service is needed.

Second, solid waste disposal problems can be alleviated. Industry has long been concerned with reclaiming its own waste products, and is now beginning to respond to the need for dealing with municipal waste disposal problems. Cities are faced with expensive programs; dumps are ugly and unsanitary; land for dumping is in short supply. Large-scale recycling of industrial and municipal wastes is a hopeful approach both to the resource and the solid waste disposal dilemma. Since recycling is currently an important research and development area, a bibliography on this subject should be useful to special librarians in the metals and  materials field. Included is a selection of research reports, articles, and books, as well as industry and government brochures on the topic. (Author)",

The results of this survey indicate that: (1) Recruitment practices emphasize the tried and true methods of visits to library schools, advertising in trade journals, contacting colleagues, and waiting for unsolicited applications; (2) While everyone likes the idea of staff development, few are providing concentrated organizational support; and (3) Most research  libraries are actively recruiting minority staff and examining their employment patterns.

Of those surveyed, 55 organizations (40 in U. S., 15 in other countries) provided completed camera-ready forms describing 81 commercially available, machine-readable data bases that contain bibliographic information about published literature. The following types of data were requested for each data base: Name, frequency of issue, and time span covered by the data base; Name of organizations and individuals who can provide information on the data base; Subject matter and scope of data on the tape; Source of information in the data base (journal articles, reports, patents, monographs, etc.); Method(s) used for  indexing or other types of subject analysis; Special data elements; Tape specifications (density, tracks, labels, etc.); Availability of programs for retrospective searching and selective dissemination of information (SDI); Type and cost of search services offered; and Availability and charges for data bases. The information provided represents the status of these data bases as of November 1972. Libraries and other information centers will find this document helpful in selecting data bases for providing SDI; retrospective search services, and other bibliographic reference services to their users.

        "description":"A Study of the relationship between the primary and secondary journal literature of a social science discipline is described in this working paper. Criminology was chosen as the subject area for study, because it forms a fairly clearly identifiable area of the social sciences, is fairly self-contained, and because it has some distinctive bibliographical services devoted to it which are relatively easy to locate. Criminology is closely related to some other social sciences, for example, psychology and sociology, so that comparative studies of other social science secondary services can be made. The term &quot;secondary literature&quot; encompasses a wide variety of publications, including review literature of many types. In this particular study a more limited, although still broad,  definition of secondary literature is adopted; it includes conventional abstracting and indexing services, but also primary journals which contain some secondary material, and various types of recurring bibliography. The method of study and analysis described could be applied to a study of the relationship between the primary and secondary literatures of other subjects; for the present, criminology provides a manageable test bed for the techniques proposed. Three aspects of bibliographical control in the field of criminology are dealt with and data is being collected on five parameters of abstracting services. (Author/NH)",

The objective of the project is to carry out research necessary for the effective design of information systems in the social sciences, whether by the creation of new systems or the modification of existing systems. Analysis of citations in monographs is necessary as a check on the lists of &quot;core&quot; journals provided by analysis of citations in journals, and as a means of identifying particular titles, authors and categories of monograph likely to be in heavy demand or of special importance. The study described in this working paper is designed to identify the main characteristics of citations in social science monographs and other non-serial literature. This paper  describes the objectives, methods and preliminary analyses associated with the study. The citation data is taken from social science monograph sources drawn at random from the British, American, French and German book outputs in 1951, 1961, and 1971. This study of citations in monographs complements the data already collected from social science journal sources; comparative analyses are made on the two data files. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"The Maryland Refutation Proof Procedure System (MRPPS) is an interactive experimental system intended for studying deductive search methods. Although the work is oriented towards question-answering, MRPPS provides a general problem solving capability. There are three major components within MRPPS. These are: (1) an inference system, (2) a search strategy and (3) a base clause selection strategy. The &quot;inference system&quot; is based on the resolution principle and performs the logical deductions specified. The user may select from a wide variety of refinements of resolution. The &quot;search strategy&quot; directs the deductions to be made by selecting from clauses already generated those that have a best merit. The &quot;base clause selection strategy&quot; determines which facts and general axioms to  select from the data base. Such a clause may be selected regardless of whether or not it has the best merit. Heuristic techniques are applied within each of the three major components. This technical report describes the current implementation of MRPPS. It describes each of the components and how they are integrated into what has been termed the &quot;Q&quot; algorithm.

The great surge of intellectual energy directed to black history has caused the reprinting of a high percentage of the older books which had been out of print and unobtainable. The range of reading levels being satisfied is wide, with many recent books written for junior high and young adult readers. At the risk of oversimplifying and limiting a truly complicated historical process, a possible approach to local selection is to think in terms of two parallel lines of thought and development which run throughout. One line holds that black Americans are an integral part of the whole society and that the vital process has been and continues to be the further integration  of blacks with that society. The other line holds that the black man in America has never been and can never be an integral, fully functioning member of American society and that the answer is to withdraw to some given extent and by some process. A balanced collection will contain books representing both points of view. This bibliography is being provided only as a partial guide to and through a difficult and often controversial area of publication. (Author)",

Chapter 2 discusses indexing terminology and some fundamental relationships between indexing and document retrieval. Chapter 3 sketches a brief history of automated indexes describing frequently encountered methods of construction and display. Chapter 4 introduces the Double-KWIC Coordinate Indexing scheme and discusses its advantages and disadvantages relative to several other KWIC indexing schemes. Chapter 5 discusses refinements in the prototype indexing scheme which led to the production of  KWOC-DKWIC hybrid indexes. Chapter 6 considers the problems of vocabulary control in a natural language environment. Several methods of automated vocabulary normalization are described. Chapter 7 examines the role played by the index analyst in creating a Double-KWIC Coordinate Index and resolves the plaguing problem of main term selection by an automatic selection algorithm which can only be applied successfully with KWIC-DKWIC hybrid indexes. The final chapter examines the parametric controls of the KWIC-DKWIC indexing scheme and discusses some relationships among these parameters and the indexes produced. (Author/NH)",

Results of these three sets of surveys were then compared to discover differences in attitudes of  persons in the areas relating to their library services. Some nine months later, a similar survey was conducted again in the MNA to determine if differences had arisen over time. A much smaller survey was conducted on the library premises.

Eight academic research libraries were selected for investigation and three instruments developed to gather data toward these ends. A personal interview format was used to interview top administrative officials at each library; a questionnaire was mailed to all other professional library staff members; and a questionnaire was mailed to a sample of faculty users of the library at each institution. Top administrators foresaw decentralization of academic libraries, increased automation and involvement in networks, greater demand for public services, and changing relationships between the library and the faculty and  administration. In response to these and financial pressures they predicted needs for subject specialists, systems specialists, management expertise (in old and new personnel), and greater use of nonprofessionals. Faculty users were asked to describe their use patterns and evaluate their library systems. Professional library staff members were questioned as to their backgrounds, work relationships, attitudes toward their jobs, and perceptions of future trends in research libraries. Based on the data collected a predictive model is proposed and discussed in terms of existing organizational models of the academic library. (Author)",

        "author":["Bergan, John R."],
        "description":"In the 1960s there developed a growing interest in and supportive evidence for programs to alter intellectual competence, particularly in young children. The abilities concept, which is used to classify people by abilities, is not well suited to teaching intellectual competencies or assessing changes in competence. A new concept, intellectual skill, is needed to serve as a basis for specifying behaviors which underlie task mastery. An intellectual skill may be defined as a behavioral capability that functions to facilitate the performance of a culturally relevant task. Three criteria for distinguishing intellectual skills from other behavioral phenomena are: (1) a definition of skill behavior in performance terms; (2) demonstration of transfer effects; and (3) use of tasks that  are culturally relevant. The intellectual skills concept can be applied to curriculum design and psychological services. The writer used the latter application in a consultation process model. The consultation approach offers several advantages: (1) it provides data showing the functional relationship between the teaching of skills and the accomplishment of a criterion task; (2) it can validate the applicability of research findings and serve as a means of generating hypotheses for controlled laboratory research; (3) the time series design is efficient and practical; (4) it offers immediacy of application; and (5) it demands that the problem be identified in performance terms.

        "description":"A research study was conducted to: (1) compare mother and father interactions with their newborn infant; (2) examine the effects of maternal drugs on mother-father infant interaction; (3) explore the impact of variations in length of labor on parent interaction; and (4) examine sex of parent and sex of newborn interactions to determine the nature of parental responsiveness to newborns of different sexes. Ss were 19 Caucasian couples and their firstborn infants. Infants were normal and full term--9 males and 10 females. Amount and type of medication was recorded and rated according to effects on the infant. All observations took place in the mother's hospital room between 6 and 48 hours after delivery. An observer brought in the baby and asked to whom it should be given. During  the 10-minute observation session, one male and one female observer recorded occurrences of parental or infant behavior. Results showed the father was twice as likely as the mother to hold the infant and equaled here in the extent to which he looked at, touched, and vocalized. Analysis of variance revealed that both mothers and fathers touched male babies significantly more than females. Product-moment correlations computed for mothers and fathers between the parental behaviors and medication level revealed that the amount of maternal medication altered the subsequent social interactions between the baby and his parents. Follow-up studies of the social interactions experienced by high- and low-drug babies may yield evidence of the impact of maternal medication on infants' intellectual  development. (KM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to investigate the impact certain cognitive styles or structures have in mediating the influence of aggressive television on young boys. Ss were 143 white middle class boys: 36 were 5 1/2-year-old kindergarteners; 30 were 6 1/2-year-old first graders; 36 were 7 1/2-year-old second graders; and 41 were 8 1/2-year-old third graders. One-third of the Ss at each age level were exposed to an experimental condition of a 6-minute aggressive TV film; one-third were exposed to an experimental condition of a 6-minute nonaggressive film; and one-third were assigned to a no-film control group. Following exposure, an aggression measure was obtained in the guise of a guessing game played with an experimenter acting as a confederate. Each S was given the option of exposing  the confederate to a noxious noise whenever he made an incorrect guess. Analyses of variance revealed that: (1) the statistically reliable differences in aggression between the experimental film conditions were attributable to differences among the 6 1/2- and 7 1/2-year-old Ss; (2) younger children were significantly more aggressive than the older; and (3) the level of cognitive functioning was more differentiated, organized, elaborated and articulated as a function of maturity. Results support the premise that the effect of TV exposure depends not only on the content but also on the child's cognitive style and way of responding to the environment in general. (KM)",

        "description":"Current research indicates the possible influence of IE development on cognitive development. Efforts are being made to identify behaviors by which parents or teachers can increase development of internal control expectancies in preschool children. Studies correlating children's IE scores with various mother behaviors or mother-child interaction patterns are being conducted. The theoretical rationale is that if development of internal control expectancies increases information seeking, information processing, and information using in early childhood, it should then contribute to intellectual development. Correlations of IE to cognitive development in early childhood that have been found include: (1) clear developmental trends in internal control scores; (2) clear socioeconomic  differences; (3) expected cultural differences; and (4) mixed evidence about relation to intelligence and achievement test scores. Research this year has been focused on relating IE to several specific cognitive development variables under laboratory conditions. Findings showed: (1) fairly good evidence of relation to ability-type laboratory tasks (discrimination and mirror tracing learning tasks) and cognitive style and strategy variables; (2) the intelligence-type tests used seem not valid enough to test any relation of IE to intelligence; and (3) persistence and alertness--attentiveness seem not generalized enough dispositions to relate to any variable, IE or other. Incidental findings concerning performances and intercorrelations may be significant for future research. (KM)",

Total N was 575 second graders. The SDRCI was administered first, individually, and the NSLCSC and GKS were group-administered to the entire class. The Text Anxiety Scale for Children and Wide Range Achievement Test were administered to provide construct validity data. IE tests were correlated with one another and with TASC and  WRAT scores. Three series of ANOVs were conducted to analyze differences in scores on each IE test among groups. Intercorrelations among tests were very low. This, and the differences in group means, suggest that the IE tests reflect different variables. NSLCSC items seem to reflect expectancy of competence. Response choice on such tests as the GKS may reflect reinforcement history--the extent to which the child has been taught to verbalize responsibility-taking attitudes. But differences are clear and significant enough to assure that the varying educational experiences have systematic effects on IE variables. (KM)",

Group meetings and field trips are held periodically. The specialized component of the program, for handicapped children, operates in basically the same way as the basic component outlined above, except that home visits are made initially two or three  times a week and then once a week. Parents choose to place their children in this program and control the amount and kind of material presented. The evaluation of the first year focuses on accomplishment of instructional objectives (motor coordination, social adjustment, and cognitive tasks) and of teaching objectives (success of the community coordinators in interaction with participating families). Evaluation of the latter set of objectives was based in part on a beginning- and end-of-year response by parents to a survey questionnaire. An evaluation of the management component and the program implementation is also included. A preliminary cost analysis is given. (KM)",

Transcripts of interviews with paraprofessional Head Start staff members from different racial, ethnic, cultural, and regional backgrounds are used as case examples to illustrate some of the elements of adult development and adult learning. Comments dealing with motivation, expectation, perception, and self-actualization are emphasized because they recur frequently. A discussion of developmental tasks and how adults learn and a bibliography are also included. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"Three kindergartens and one prekindergarten, totaling 213 children, participated in a Behavior Modification program during the 1971-72 school year. A research assistant in each location worked directly with the teacher in measuring and evaluating teaching methods and in developing alternative procedures as needed to teach the same skills or behaviors. Overall program evaluation was based upon a modified BRL Checklist given to the four Behavior Modification classes and to two control classes. Experimental analyses were provided for each intervention utliized in the Behavior Modification classes. Results show that teachers can use their time more effectively and efficiently when certain techniques are added to their own methods. In over 25 studies, comparisons between the teacher's  usual method and the same procedure combined with specific behavioral techniques suggest that children can be taught more and in a short period of time with these techniques. Academic areas covered included time and position concepts, past tense, left and right discrimination, and colors, in addition to several studies that focus on general classroom management. Data for all groups on the BRL Checklist indicated that only the Behavior Modification kindergartens produced statistically significant changes over the school year. The entire cost of special material and incentives averaged less than $.86 per child for the year. (Author/KM)",

C., family day care program and 10 children in the UNC-G Demonstration Center for Infant-Toddler Care, a group day care center. Results, which disproved many assumptions cited as advantages of family day care, showed that: (1) mobility is greater in family day care than in center care; (2) all siblings can rarely be accommodated in the same family day care home; (3) family day care is nearby for low-income families but not for middle-income families; (4) a large percentage of infants in family day care show losses in mental development quotients, motor development quotients, and social development quotients; (5) family day care mothers are not  usually women with preschoolers of their own at home; and (6) family day care homes do not usually have males in the household. Questions raised in the study about family day care are discussed, and further research is recommended.

The mothers used a more restricted vocabulary to their daughters, used pronouns differentially, spoke in distinct clausal units similar to written sentences, spoke in a higher median fundamental frequency, restricted their verb tense usage and talked mostly about the child.

Some of these abnormalities diminish in adulthood, but in any case they interfere with effective social communication and are therefore implicated in the development of aggression. The coo vocalization, used by the rhesus when there is a stimulus change, is emitted less frequently by infant and adult isolates than by socially reared monkeys; and, in addition, the coo is not used in appropriate contexts by isolates.  Isolate-reared monkeys are defective in both sending and receiving facial expressions. Isolates use the fear grimace and the stare and open-mouth threats, which appear important in aggressive behavior, more frequently after puberty than do socially reared monkeys. Isolates are also defective in looking, the most frequently used mode of communication among rhesus monkeys. Isolates apparently do not develop a clear idea of self versus not self, and as they reach adulthood they direct more and more hostility toward the self. The failure to know the self may interfere with peaceful social communication more than anything else, and apparently the monkey can come to know himself only through interaction with others. Mature social isolates are incapable of using social objects to decrease their  arousal and are thus intolerably excited by social stimulation, which, in turn, accentuates their abnormalities in communication.

        "description":"Corporal punishment and its implications are discussed in this speech in Dallas, where corporal punishment is officially sanctioned as a method of school discipline, and in many other parts of the country, the prevailing opinion is that corporal punishment is necessary, effective and harmless. But the effectiveness of such punishment is dubious and the potential psychological harm is incalculable. Physical abuse is considered by many to be an acceptable form of school discipline because it is an accepted child-rearing practice. Teachers and parents are reluctant to change this behavior because violence is condoned and rewarded by this society, it is felt, and people are frequently tempted to respond to conflict and frustration with physical force. School policy that condones the  bully tactics of corporal punishment is in effect teaching students by example that this is an acceptable way of handling problems. Through corporal punishment parents and teachers relieve their own frustrations and avoid effort to understand the reasons for the child's misbehavior. Corporal punishment is frequently used for transgression of arbitrary, meaningless rules. Teachers using corporal punishment should examine their motives and consider what sort of model they should be providing students. Corporal punishment undermines a child's self-respect and respect for others. A resolution passed at the National Conference on Corporal Punishment recommends abolishing this sort of punishment.

        "description":"This pilot study addressed tension and anxiety states that may accompany reading readiness training in the kindergarten. Seventy-two children (36 boys and 36 girls) were randomly selected from three urban elementary schools. Six kindergarten classes were included, representing: (1) 2 classes conducting systematic reading programs; (2) 2 classes with regular but informal reading readiness training; and (3) 2 classes with essentially no reading or reading readiness programs in effect. Data gathering included naturalistic observations with time sampling throughout ten weeks and structured interviews in the classroom involving human figure drawings, questionnaires and behavior ratings. Frequency data for the naturalistic observations were analyzed using a factorial design of analysis  of variance with schools, classes, and sex of child as factors. Similar analyses were done on weighted scores for human figure drawings and on the rating data for the interview behaviors. Results were mixed, suggesting that relationships between reading readiness training and tension states in the children are masked by the larger questions of teacher effects and more complex developmental factors.

Three dependent variables were studied: (1) performance on measures of specific educational objectives, (2) scores on measures of achievement-related attitudes, and (3) scores on measures of non-academic classroom behavior dimensions. Classroom teachers administered the School Sentiment Index during the first and final weeks of their programs and completed the Teacher Ratings of Student Achievement and the Devereaux Rating Scale at the end of the programs. Six bilingual field workers assigned to 5  classrooms each administered the achievement test during the second and final weeks of each program. The study's design required analysis techniques to reveal differences (1) between pretest and posttest scores for pupils in migrant education classrooms and (2) among the scores of pupils grouped according to the moderator variables of sex, age, and bilingual language performance. The findings indicated that the migrant education programs effected changes in pupil performance on specified educational objectives but did not promote more positive attitudes toward self or school.

Data were collected to illustrate (1) population size, distribution, and composition for West Virginia and its rural and urban subunits and (2) the changing fertility pattern which occurred during this period. Whenever possible, comparisons between West Virginia population trends and those for the United States and the rest of the South Atlantic Division were made. The 1940, 1950, 1960, and 1970 U. S. Censuses of Population, U. S. Department of Commerce, were used for the data collection. Selected data were pursued and organized into tables and occasionally into graphs to illustrate structural shifts with respect to age, sex, residence, schooling, occupation, industry, and fertility. Since West  Virginia has had a relatively small nonwhite population in recent decades, racial comparisons were excluded from this paper. It was noted that West Virginia generally appears to be converging with the Division and Nation in many respects, although its discordant figures concerning urbanization, education, and mining still stand out as &quot;glaring&quot; contrasts.

A principal objective of the research project was to ascertain the nature and extent of influence of school factors on educational and occupational aspirations and expectations of farm boys and girls. The study focused on factors over which the school has some control. The findings indicated that roughly 98% desired to graduate from high school and 70% aspired to go to college, that over 1/4 expected to begin their education at the junior college level, that  over 2/3 of the college-bound boys and girls had definite expectations as to what major field of study they would follow at college, that only 7.8% of the sample expressed satisfaction with their high school's present curriculum in vocational training courses, and that only 5.8% of the boys and 6.6% of the girls indicated their high school counselor to be among the most helpful sources occupational information. It was concluded that with regard to a student's occupational and educational aspirations and expectations, school experiences are likely to be among the more significant and influential ones that an individual encounters.

At first, the design team sought to develop an all-purpose model complete with specifications of particular objectives, but the team soon recognized this goal to be unrealistic, since different school districts and schools within the districts provide different mixes of bicultural/bilingual needs. As a result, the team came up with a spectrum of bilingual education patterns leading to various possible approaches for the implementation of an individualized mathematics program. These various possible approaches are described in this final report. Discussed in detail are the 3 key phases needed in building a new bilingual/bicultural program,  including (1) the planning phase, (2) the development phase, and (3) the implementation phase. This report also discusses the necessary elements needed to implement a mathematics program with a major emphasis on local needs and the major subsystems dealing with the learner, instructional, and support components of the program. The steps for utilizing the model are highlighted, and key recommendations are given for determining need and securing support, establishing curriculum development capability, implementing the program, and evaluating and revising the program design.

The data on IBM cards for 2,326 juniors and seniors in 24 high schools in 8 widely separated Illinois counties--Carroll, Mercer, Marshall, Moultrie, Calhoun, Franklin, Alexander, and Pulaski--were analyzed. The analysis was limited to test scores on abstract reasoning, verbal reasoning, the total of these 2, natural science reading, social science reading, writing, and functional and conventional errors in writing. There were statistically significant differences in the means of  scores on all tests between those who planned to go to college and those who did not plan to go. The differences favored those who planned to attend college. An implication which arose from the findings was that the high schools are providing training in preparation for college and that action should be taken to provide job training for the non-college-bound students; for the 1962-63 sample of 2,326 juniors and seniors, 60% did not plan to go to college. The 3rd part of the study will include occupational data, personality tests, and other information on about 3,000 juniors and seniors in all schools in these 8 counties. (FF)",

Interviews were conducted with area residents--community, governmental, agricultural, and labor leaders; farm operators; crew leaders; private labor recruiters; and farm worker household heads. The findings indicated that the Texas Employment Commission (TEC) tends to be used primarily as a last resort by farm workers interviewed because of the low probability of jobs being available. Employers are more likely to use the TEC placement  facilities, mainly to satisfy peak seasonal labor requirements, than were workers. Most of the household heads migrated out of the Valley and, on the average, were employed 30 weeks, were unemployed 13 weeks, and were not in the labor force 9 weeks in 1968. Annual earnings of household heads was $1,695, while family income averaged $3,350, reflecting earnings of several wage earners. Some recommendations were to improve the scheduling of work for migrants, to eliminate or control commuters, to improve agricultural employment practices, and to encourage permanent migration or resettlement.

The petition was filed on behalf of 16 organizations and 398 specifically named individuals, and it accused the RMS of exploiting migrant farm workers. The methodology of the review included an initial analysis of the alleged problem, the accumulation of background information, field visits, and the organization and analysis of the information gathered. The overall findings and conclusions of the review in the initial major section are divided into 2 parts, dealing with the role of the RMS and the role of worker advocacy. The findings are discussed by topic under 3 sections: (1) economic and legal  condition of the farm worker, including discrimination, certification of foreign workers, social security, wages, child labor, and labor law enforcement; (2) services to workers, including referral control, job order specifications, employment services to workers, conflict of interest, farm labor contractors, statistics and staffing, and day haul; and (3) working conditions, including housing, safety and pesticides, field sanitation and drinking water, and transportation. Green card commuters and illegal aliens are discussed in the 2 appendixes. (HBC)",

        "description":"The objective of this paper was to investigate the utility of the Ginzberg developmental model for explaining differences in the types or occupational status of the role models of Negro and white rural youth at two stages of adolescence. Data were obtained from 484 youth residing in East Texas in their sophomore and senior years in high school. In the patterns that did not differ over time, the findings indicated that Negro boys selected more teachers and glamour figures as role models than did the white boys, that white boys chose more relatives, and that white boys had a more diverse selection pattern than did their Negro age cohorts. In patterns that did differ over time for Negro and white girls, it was found that whereas the white girls had a slightly more diverse selection  pattern than did the Negro girls in 1966, the opposite was true in 1968. Additional conclusions were that more white boys than Negro boys chose occupational role models who were owners or managers of a farm or ranch, but the difference decreased over time; that more white girls than Negro girls selected housewives as role models; and that, although occupational role models in professional or related areas were equally popular among both Negro and white respondents in 1966, more Negro girls than white girls chose this type of role model in 1968.

A questionnaire was grouped-administered to 111 metropolitan males, 170 metropolitan females, 98 nonmetropolitan males, and 99 nonmetropolitan females. The results of the study indicated that sex does and place of residence does not make an important difference in the types of role models selected by Negro youth or in the occupational status of the role models. Important secondary findings were: (1) parents are not the most popular role models chosen by these Negro respondents: glamour figures are the most popular role models of metropolitan boys, nonmetropolitan girls, and nonmetropolitan boys; teachers are the most popular role  models of metropolitan girls; and (2) family members, especially immediate family members, are frequently selected as role models by these Negro high school sophomores. Suggestions for future research include investigating why the person was chosen as a role model, why the occupation was chosen, and the effectiveness of the high school counselor and of various career information materials or programs. The bivariate relationship between role model choices and job market knowledge might also be explored. A related document is ED 048 971. (Author/HBC)",

The process of incorporating ethnic curriculum content generates the process of further development and refinement of ethnic curriculum content. Thus, the development of social work curriculum in relation to social work practice in the barrio should be perceived as a process in which Chicano concerns and aspirations are institutionalized within the schools of social work. Chicano students and faculty and the Chicano community are the major sources for helping to develop such a curriculum. In attempting to show and clarify the  opportunities for constructive change which are needed, 3 factors are discussed: (1) the present conditions of Chicano curriculum development, (2) the anticipated directions which future Chicano curriculum development will take, and (3) the methods and processes which are required to facilitate these anticipated directionalities.

The sociology of development is defined as a subfield of sociology which is devoted to a study of the theory, design, and implementation of action programs which are proposed for the purpose of deliberately and fundamentally altering social structures in the interest of achieving more efficient forms of social organization, as judged on the basis of values and goals considered worthy. The divergent strategies of rural development are  described in terms of the self-help approach and the centralized planning approach. It is noted that development sociology offers an opportunity for sociology in general to become free of its provincialism and that a coherent sociology of development represents a new era of applied sociology.

In order to meet domestic and export needs, production and productivity must be increased; land tenure systems must be changed to cope with employment and income distribution problems; institutions must be modernized in order to support production, productivity, and commercialization; and technology must be introduced rapidly for better competition in both national and international markets. The rural sociologist can contribute in many different areas to Latin America's economic development. Three areas of activity in which the rural sociologist can contribute to Latin America's economic development are (1) technological change, (2)  institutional development, and (3) extension services. The rural sociologist plays an important role in the various mechanisms used to (1) induce technological change; (2) develop institutions which will transfer, generate, and disseminate knowledge on agriculture; and (3) formulate alternative strategies by which extension services can work with commercial and subsistence agriculture.

The first section of the paper deals with the forces that have caused changes in agrarian reform policies as they affected rural development in these countries. Specifically discussed are the Agrarian Reform Law of 1958 in Iraq and Syria; the 1967 June War in Jordan and Lebanon; the 1952 revolution and Agrarian Reform Law in Egypt; the Cuban system of collective farming in Algeria; and the Five-Year Plan in Morocco and Tunisia. The evaluation section of the paper emphasizes the importance of accurate and extensive data on rural life, sufficient financial resources, skilled personnel, and coordinated efforts in  the planning for development as being essential elements for sound agrarian reform. The summary indicates that the agrarian reform programs in the Arab countries have been successful in decreasing inequalities of wealth and narrowing traditional differences between the landlord and the peasant. However, with the migration of peasants to urban centers, the need exists for more economic development, social uplift, political stability, and effective governmental organization. (HBC)",

It is pointed out that the Chicano migrant child, whose home base is in the Rio Grande Valley, lives in either a barrio or, in summer, a migrant camp and has little contact with the Anglo culture until he enters school; that the only contacts his parents have with the Anglo community are with the farmer, grocer, gas station attendant, and clergyman; that upon entering school, the migrant child finds himself in an educational environment which is totally foreign to him; and that after being unable to learn because of his inability to understand English, the Chicano migrant child usually does not return  to school. Suggestions to correct the problem and to provide the child with an equal learning opportunity include (1) that teachers of Spanish-speaking children must understand the migrant child, his culture, and his problems; (2) that English must be taught as a second language; (3) that until the child speaks English, he should be taught in Spanish; and (4) that the teacher must show the child that someone cares and wants him to learn, thus engendering in the child a desire to learn.

The type of curriculum and other training needed for producing community development professionals is outlined. Also, the type of interdisciplinary management system required for coordinating the research, teaching, and extension functions is explored. The creation of an interdisciplinary structure, in the form of a center or institute, to support interdisciplinary programs is suggested. The major objectives of the proposed interdisciplinary center or institute for community development include providing: (1) a unit for coordinating, planning, and programming community development extension, research,  and teaching programs; (2) sufficient resources of personnel and programs to attract outside funding; (3) a unit for planning long-range policy, staffing patterns, etc.; (4) a unit which can provide a coherent and coordinated liaison with the other states and with the Regional Centers for Rural Development; (5) a unit for developing cooperative and coordinated programming with Federal, state, regional, and local agencies; and (6) a unit for planning and sponsoring training for graduate students, extension agents, and other agency personnel working in community development research and extension.

The model was intended to provide those responsible for determining the nature and direction of educational change in Appalachia with data vital to the eventual development of an educational system relevant to the region's rural areas. The model utilized in the study was based on the concept of scale, which is primarily concerned with the range and intensity of human interdependence and the relationship of these factors to the ability of a group or an individual to control their environment. Having utilized scale as a means of analyzing the relationships between the problems of  regional development, the traditional subculture, and the educational system of rural Appalachia, the model was then employed as a means of determining the educational objectives which the rural schools must adopt as a set of guidelines if they are to develop a program which will satisfy the need for adequate human resources in the region. It was then possible to conclude the study by developing the broad outlines of an educational program for rural Appalachian schools aimed at achieving the objectives which were derived from the concept of scale.

        "description":"The principal objective of this research was to analyze the question of the kinds or types of teachers who have the most influence on students' aspirations and achievements. The study included a sample of students from 4 high schools in which Indian and non-Indian students were enrolled. A questionnaire was administered to and analyzed for 451 respondents. Students indicated that English more than non-English teachers had had a strong influence on their educational aspirations and expectations. Of all students who identified English teachers as persons with whom they had discussed their educational plans, 47% were Indian and 40% were non-Indian. The author concluded from this analysis that English teachers are more likely than other teachers to have discussed educational plans  with students. It was further concluded that those Indian students who contacted English teachers appeared to be least academically oriented, or conversely, were more likely candidates for drop-out status. It was suggested that future research on this question should be undertaken with designs which separate the effects of teachers' characteristics from the effects of student-teacher interaction and the content of the subjects taught.

More specifically, the objective was to replicate selected residential projections in a study of Texas rural youth and to extend the analysis to subsequent place of residence attainments. Data for this analysis were obtained from a panel of senior boys and girls in 20 Louisiana rural high schools in 1968 who were followed up personally or by mail in 1972. Statistically significant chi-square differences at the .01 level by race and sex were found for residential aspirations and expectations. These were due primarily to substantially greater proportions of Blacks desiring and expecting to live in  large cities. Boys were more likely to desire and expect farm residence. Comparisons for strength of aspirations, certainty of expectations, and residential attainments were not statistically significant, except for female racial differences in certainty. It was apparent, however, that the racial differences were greater than the sexual differences. Black females were the most certain of their expectations while white females were the least certain. In general, these findings replicated those of the Texas study. (Author/HBC)",

The two cognitive objectives were designated as factual-conceptual and inferential, each being further classified into the background category and the category pertaining to the model. The 48-item multiple-choice test used in pre- and post-measurements was at the middle-elementary reading level and subjected to jury validation. Regular non-science teachers conducted the experiment 30-45 minutes  daily for a seven-week tenure after completion of a 12-hour training period. Statistical analyses showed the presence of satisfactory results. Further research was recommended for the determination of predictive indices for mental abilities and cognitive achievement, the development of various teacher training modes, study of implementation in schools with varying social-economic-ethnic patterns, and study of the feasibility of presenting other science conceptual schemes in elementary schools.

Data analyses demonstrated  that larger schools, larger communities, the early selection of careers in scientific fields, and some types of employment held by the householder favored better achievements on science tests.

Many schools placed equal emphasis during science methods courses upon ways to teach science and upon the acquisition of scientific knowledge. Such courses were taken generally by prospective elementary school teachers during their junior or senior years. Most  frequently the college of education controlled such courses but in some colleges it was controlled by division of science. Most science methods educators in colleges had participated in new science curriculum workshops or training sessions. These new curriculum projects had had a definite impact on the nature of the course in general and specifically on instructional procedures emphasizing the processes of science. (PS)",

Participants in the study were 31 elementary and middle school teachers attending an environmental education workshop conducted at the University of South Dakota, Summer, 1971. Six concepts were selected from each major area: (1) Environmental Management, (2) Management Techniques, (3) Economics, (4) Environmental Ecology, (5) Natural Resources, (6) The Socio-Cultural Environment, and (7) Man and the Family.  Within each category the concepts were ranked by the teachers from the one they considered most important for their students to the one least important. Analyses of data indicated there was some question as to whether the national panel (who originally ordered and weighted the concepts) and the teachers were in agreement as to which concepts were most important. Also, the teachers did not agree among themselves as to which concepts were most important. The questionnaire used to gather the data is appended. (BL)",

Toward this end graduate as well as undergraduate students were asked to make judgments of the perceived similarity of expressions that mark or label concepts in the subject matter of physics. An apriori model of the structure of subject matter knowledge was used to generate task materials as well as interpret the judgment data. Evidence presented in the report lends suppport to the notion that mastery of a domain of knowledge can be indexed by procedures which might also reveal the state of a student's knowledge early in this educational experience. The adequacy of this approach to educational assessment (essentially through the medium of construct validity) should  be tested by further research. Especially important, is research which reveals the role knowledge structure such as those identified in this report can play in problem solving behavior. (Author)",

After the completion of all subunits in a unit, an achievement test is given to assess the student's grasp of the material in the complete unit. Only pass/fail grades were given on the achievement test. Final letter grades were given on the basis of the number of units covered by each student. The course is aimed at enabling students to  learn at their own pace. The 15 units included in the course were Fundamentals, Equilibrium Diagrams, Equilibrium Analysis, Components Superposition Cantilever Beams, Vector Algebra, Friction, Engineering Frames, Non-Coplaner Systems, Equivalent Systems, Trusses, Properties of Surfaces, Energy Methods, Hydrostatics, Beam Diagrams, and Slide Rule.

Subproblems investigated were to determine: (1) if skill developed during this instructional sequence would transfer to the student teaching experience; and (2) possible relationships of selected personality factors to the development of questioning skills. The study extended over three quarters. Student teachers were given the Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test, Gamma Test, Form Em, to measure intelligence; the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Form E, to measure personality type; and the Educational Set Scale by Siegel and Siegel, to measure educational set. The 42 individuals involved in  the study appeared representative of the population of pre-service secondary school science teachers enrolled at The Ohio State University. Questioning appeared to be a skill that could be developed, through instruction and practice, by these individuals. The development of questioning skill did not appear to be limited by intelligence, sex, personality type, or educational set, insofar as this sample was concerned. (Author)",

        "description":"This catalog of 343 songs for high school vocalists is the result of a survey of American and British solo literature. It was motivated by a desire to bring fine songs to the attention of high school teachers to supplement a repertory often limited to familiar but over-used songs, current and standard show tunes, and operatic arias that are both vocally and musically taxing. Chosen first for musical quality, and second, for being within the technical capacity of young musicians, the list was compiled after examining approximately 2,000 songs selected from catalogs of 19 publishers. Other information given for each song is: 1) editor and/or arranger; 2) publisher; 3) key in which the song is written (with additional keys listed); 4) range and tessitura; 5) whether the song is best  suited for men or women; 6) degree of difficulty (for both vocalist and accompanist); and, 7) evaluation of music and text. Two lines of each song are shown. (Author/OPH)",

This second progress report presents a resume of the activities of the team and reflects upon the processes involved in curriculum building and instructional planning: 1) clarifying the nature of students involved, 2) finding effective materials, 3) determining appropriate teaching methods, and 4) choosing the evaluation instruments needed. It is emphasized that learning levels and processes of students be considered in developing materials; any materials should be available throughout Canada at little or no cost; students should be involved; field experiences offer the best learning base and audiovisual materials must be provided when direct experience is not  feasible. Materials being developed are in sections, built upon one another, yet usable individually. Section I, The City and Region, and Section II, The City As a Structural Unit, are intended to provide the conceptual base and skills necessary for the systematic study of factors affecting the growth of a city, which will be presented in Section III. A teacher's guide, audiovisual materials, and student resource booklets are described. Refinement of the first two sections and solidification of Section II will receive the greatest amount of attention this coming year. (JMB)",

The initial proposal and early planning is reported in ED 055 010. The primary difficulties, after the formation of the team, entailed acquiring release time, arranging a compatible schedule, coping with the demands of extra curricular assignments, finding workspace, and obtaining secretarial assistance and personnel willing to gather and annotate material. Valuable assistance was given by the professors and students in the University of Saskatchewan College of Education. A major factor contributing to the support received was the effort made on the part of the developers to present their project plans  before groups of teachers and planners and to develop a set of transparencies for use by other Project Canada West teams. Two primary focuses emerged from the materials gathered: the physical aspect (the city itself, its structure, its form, its rigidity), and the human aspect (showing how man--who is changing, developing, and fluid--responds to the urban environment. Discussion of how best to utilize and evaluate the materials led the team to submit a proposal to the Board requesting that a special social studies class be offered in which the material could be used and student responses be measured. The proposal was approved and year III will be devoted to in-class curriculum development. (JMB)",

This progress report stresses that the nature of the development process has been based on 1) need, 2) structure, 3) content, 4) materials development, and 5) evaluation. Described first is the Canurgo Simulation game, which can be developed at three levels and which involves students taking on the roles (up to 30) of various community figures. The urban area is composed of the city proper and three politically independent suburbs with a varying tax base and socio-economic level. A Sourcebook in Canadian Urban Government is arranged by sections to deal progressively with a  topic and can also be utilized as an auxiliary part of the game. Partial listing of contents is provided. The Young Politicians Handbook, designed in cartoon format, is a serious approach to preparation for holding public office and is suitable for slow and average learners. Providing for a discussion approach, it requires teacher preparation in leading seminars. Field testing for the two publications is planned for 1973. Appended is an evaluation sheet used in a January, 1972, workshop which studied curriculum materials being developed by the Project Canada West teams. (JMB)",

Emphasis throughout the reviews is on the inventories developed regarding the children's understanding about their environment, occupations, media influences, local government, cultures, transportation, resources, geographic concepts, etc. Teacher attitudes reflect appreciation for extensive board and community support, reaffirm the need for release time for curriculum development, support the view that teachers rather than a non-teaching  specialist, should develop curriculum, and indicate satisfaction with the progress of the program. An interim list of inventories is appended, indicating the topic, grade level questioned, and the teachers involved. A sample topic: &quot;What Do Children Think They Learn From Television, Radio, and Newspapers?&quot; The collection of inventories completed represents an adequate basis for a teacher's resource book on primary urban studies. It is felt that counsel from a publisher would be appropriate at this time. (JMB)",

The dimensions chosen for analysis are defined by several relevant models in past research. The independent variables include two personal characteristics (age and sex); five structural variables (residence, SES, organizational participation, religion, and exposure to the mass media of communications); and four social psychological variables (identification with community, individualism, familism, and fatalism). The dependent variable is individual modernity. An area in eastern Kentucky, a traditional society in the process of modernization, is chosen as a source for data. A research model is designed, analyzed, and revised. The authors  suggest that the variables shown in the revised model may provide a good empirical base for theoretical formation. (Author/SHM)",

Main concerns of the study related to applicability of the filmstrip to instructional programs, assessment of accuracy of information contained, effectiveness of content, effectiveness of explanation of difficult concepts, assessment of value of content of pictures, comparison with commercially produced filmstrips, and comments concerning materials. A normative survey was conducted using a questionnaire instrument sent to 1200 randomly selected teachers who had previously received one of three filmstrips from the institute. Findings show that of the total responses received, consisting of a seventy-four per cent return of the  questionnaires, over two-thirds of the respondents rated the materials as good or outstanding in regard to curricular acceptability; determined the information to be accurate; evaluated classroom use effectiveness of filmstrips as good or outstanding; determined that the films presented difficult concepts effectively; rated the visual content highly; evaluated industry's attitude as unobtrusive; and considered the filmstrips comparable to commercial materials. The study concludes that since the overall attitude toward the filmstrips were highly favorable, industry should continue to sponsor such educational materials. (SJM)",

It also marks the first time they encounter to any appreciable extent an organizational context. As such, an analysis of children's transition into school is a unique opportunity to examine both the processes of individual's adjustment and adaptation to new social context and their first extensive encounter with an organization. This report discusses the research literature related to this topic and develops a theoretical framework for examining the processes of adjustment and adaptation as they are influenced by the role requirements placed upon children by the school setting, the structural properties of the school, the  characteristics (personalities) of the children themselves, and the web of social relationships the children are involved in both in and out of school. A research design and schedule based on the framework is described; and six research instruments developed for carrying out the study are reproduced in the appendices to the report. (Author/KBW)",

The study investigates the elementary school teacher to discover what he perceives to be his role in civil training, to ascertain his feelings as to the possibility of change, to discover what kinds of risks he will take, and to determine what specific classroom activities he will or will not do. A literature review highlights relevant research on civic training and political socialization of the young--the role of the school, the teacher, the curriculum. An analysis of the data gathered is given  in the concluding chapter. The author cites educational needs for the development of an elementary political science curriculum, a less conservative plan geared toward better helping the student to deal with problems of modern society.

        "description":"Proliferation of factual data, an educational problem for some time, is a greater dilemma today due to the knowledge explosion. Facts are accumulating at an alarming rate. All too often teachers require students to learn irrelevant data (statement of facts) rather than learning to select, process, handle, interpret, employ, and organize data, and to develop skills. General education should have the relevant goal of teaching skills, capacities, and insights which are applicable to solving problems and to the transfer of learning in general. Reasons given for substituting the learning of raw data in place of skills in most courses are that students shift from subject to subject leaving little time to learn more than definitions and factual data; that simple assertions of data are  predictable, allowing for objective examination by teachers, for students to prepare for examinations, and for an average coverage of subject. The quantitative increase in facts, subjects, ideas, and in publications requires an increase in the human capacity to absorb and process, and less on information, data-like statements, and \"knowledge\" in the most common sense of that term (more properly put, a distinction between knowledge of items and knowledge of skills).

The five chapters of this document include information on school goals which student participation may affect; distinctions between kinds of student involvement and attitudes of teachers and students about the actual and desired amount of  involvement; the analysis of student participation relationships by focusing on student experiences in extra-curricular activities; student involvement in non-academic decisions; and student participation in academic decisions.

Although the author feels that the introduction of behavioral objectives is a significant development of the various social studies projects, it is meaningless unless it is related to content. Clearly stated goals which involve the ultimate perception of concepts, generalizations, and models are dependent ultimately upon the selection and use of content. An example is given in which entering college students were asked how much content about Latin American was offered in their social studies classrooms -- the answer being very little. However, these same students are expected to understand minority problems in the United States. True  understanding would necessarily reflect content on the political, social, and cultural aspects of Latin America. (SJM)",

        "description":"The goal of civic education, as discussed in this paper, is responsible political activism. Although the word activism tends to conjure a negative image of a revolutionary student body for some, the term is used here to express active participation in the decision making process, respect for others' opinions, and upholding one's beliefs. In this view, education should approve of and encourage student activism. Schools, often in an effort to keep the peace, preserve the status quo regardless of the issue and opt for passivity of students. Activism then, can be explained, not by school activities but, rather, by out of school experiences. When a credibility gap exists between schools and students, activism may be a reaction not only to education, which often ignores social problems  and ills of today, but also to schools which do not reflect participatory democracy. If civic education is to effect responsible student activism positively, it needs to provide curricular content reflecting the reality of political and social life and, further, to furnish a model of active and mindful civic behavior worthy of emulation, encouraging and providing a climate for student participation within school walls.

This experiment determined if, in a supermarket situation, consumer preferences (as measured in sales figures and augmented by questionnaire data) could be altered by the addition of nutritional information to the labels of sixteen items which had moderate sales in a sample of two matched supermarkets. Two labeling methods were compared--that of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), listing percentages of specific nutrients contained in one portion of a labeled item, with the FE (Food Equivalent), consisting of a diagrammatic comparison between nutrients in one portion of a well-known reference food. Analysis showed that the FE label was significantly more effective in promoting the sale  of the more nutritious item, and that the addition of labels effected a change in consumer preference. Further, it seems safe to generalize that customers are open to some sort of educational process at the point of contact, if that contact is made in a certain manner, illustrating the need for planning in a methodological approach. The problems of adapting content and identifying certain steps can be dealt with and, moreover, an instructional model can be designed for use in such non-classroom instruction. (Author/SJM)",

Educational implications of Piaget's work in cognitive stage development and the author's work in moral stage development are based upon the cognitive developmental transition of John Dewey, who suggested that it is the social role of schools to develop active thought toward concern for social justice. Two previously neglected themes of Dewey which are elaborated in this work on moral stages, and which may correct certain basic gaps in the new social studies, concern education as supplier of the conditions for development through the cognitive and moral stages, and ethical principles as defining the aims of social education. The most  important findings in cognitive development are the verifications of Piaget's description of adolescence as the period of development of abstract, reflective thought. Although social inquiry or analytic thinking cannot be taught, its development can be stimulated and extended. Moral stages lie at the core of political and social value decisions. A moral development approach, non-indoctrinative in its objectives and methods, that is concerned about moral action as well as moral reasoning, needs to be formed. (Author/SJM)",

The objectives of the study were to obtain a broad range of information and relevant data pertaining to the status of psychology and to determine the needs of teachers for materials and audiovisual instructional aides which they would like to have available for use in their classrooms. A questionnaire designed and distributed to 347 Florida secondary schools, of which 217 (62.5%) returned the questionnaires, revealed that psychology as a separate course of study was taught in 140 schools; that 12,519 students were enrolled in specific psychology courses of at least one semester; 19,779 students enrolled in separate psychology courses  ranging in length from six weeks to one year; the average teacher of psychology had 22.7 hours of college background in psychology and felt this was adequate; psychology courses were offered primarily as electives and offered to 11th and 12th graders; and psychological subject matter was taught in other courses. A major conclusion showed that an overwhelming number of teachers desired assistance in improving the quality of their courses, needing new and various kinds of materials and information to help them teach their courses.

Examples of types of research that have been completed or are underway by the faculty and staff of the program, and related problems,  are discussed. Problems of implementation research focus on getting individuals and institutions to adopt social innovations.

One hundred and six selected, prominent, community leaders responded to a questionnaire assessing the likelihood, desirability and relative importance of twenty eight potential community problems. In addition, the leaders were asked to select at least three of the issues in order to identify what needs to be done about them, what things should be avoided, whether such steps are likely in the next five year period, and which segments or organizations of the community might hold views similar to and  at odds with their position, and what measures the community or university could take regarding each issue. Results included indicate that the city's leaders are intensely interested in the future of Pittsburgh, and are modestly optimistic; that many leaders do not expect much in the way of positive change, and that there is an overwhelming consensus with reference to the areas of desired change although the study concludes that a good number of responses fall outside the general agreement. Pittsburgh leaders are highly receptive to change and reveal data which can be put to practical use. (SJM)",

        "description":"The purpose of the study, part of the research and curriculum development of the Anthropology Curriculum Project, was to compare the facilitative effects of pre- and post-organizers on the learning of structured anthropology materials at the sixth-grade level. Organizers were defined, in this thesis, as written material that serves the function of facilitating the incorporation and retention of subject matter. Ausubel's theory that organizers facilitate learning when presented to students in advance of materials to be learned was the basis for this study. The question posed in the study was whether there are significant differences in learning between groups using materials with pre-organizers and those using materials with post-organizers. A textbook, &quot;Cultural Change in Mexico  and the United States,&quot; was written with identical learning passages in two formats: one contained organizers at the beginning of the text and each chapter (pre-organizers), the other immediately after each chapter and at the end of the text (post-organizers). The twelve sixth grade classes which served as the experimental population were randomly assigned to two groups for separate treatments. Mean class scores were used as the unit of statistical analysis. The study did not produce evidence supporting the research hypothesis that either pre- or post-organizers facilitate learning of structured anthropology materials at the sixth grade level.

The investigation was an outgrowth of interest in Ausubel's theory of meaningful, verbal reception learning. It was hypothesized in this study that there are no statistical differences among the adjusted mean scores of groups using materials with pre-organizers, post-organizers, and no-organizers. A student textbook, &quot;The Changing World Today: Case Studies of Modernization in Japan, Kenya, and India,&quot; was written in three formats. In one format the organizer preceded the learning passage  (pre-organizer), in another the organizer followed the learning passage (post-organizer), and in the third format only the learning passage (no-organizer) was presented. Twenty third grade classes served as the experimental population from which the classes were randomly assigned to three groups. The study was unable to produce evidence supporting the hypothesis that either pre- or post-organizers facilitate learning of structured anthropology materials at the third grade level.

The procedure used in developing this taxonomy involved the specification and selection of a data bank of teacher behaviors, the organization of these behaviors into a meaningful structure, a deductive process of modifying the structure to better correspond to the assumed criteria, and empirical evidence concerning the differentiation among the categories in the established structure. The initial taxonomical structure was based on six functions to be performed dealing with teacher behaviors without reference to student outcomes. The second taxonomical structure was divided into six teacher behaviors identified as student outcome or teacher outcome in both the cognitive and/or affective domains.  The second structure, supported to some degree of empirical evidence, provides a framework for development of evaluation techniques and provides guidelines for individualizing teacher preparation programs and utilization of teachers in the field.

        "description":"The primary purposes of this project were to secure information concerning (a) administrative, supervisory, and other conditions which would be detrimental to girls' participation on boys' interschool athletic teams in noncontract schools, and (b) experiences and opinions of persons directly involved in the program. The participation of 100 schools from March 1, 1969 through June 30, 1970 was completely voluntary and with the approval of the state education department. The ten sports involved in this integrated athletic project were bowling, cross country, fencing, golf, tennis, gymnastics, riflery, skiing, soccer, and track. The evaluation of the project was compiled through questions and comments from principals, directors of health, physical education, and recreation, women  physical educators, women supervisors, coaches, visiting coaches, boy teammates, boys from visiting teams, girl participants, parents, and physicians. A review of this information by an evaluation committee showed no basic problems arising within the project. There was no evidence of physical, psychological or social harm to the male or female participants. The types of problems cited dealt with administrative arrangements and supervision. Because of these results, the participation of girls on boys' interschool athletic teams in noncontract schools was approved by the Board of Regents on March 16, 1971. All correspondence relating to the experiment was included in the 17-page appendixes. (BRB)",

The results of these methods gave teachers information on the way in which children learn most effectively. The classroom was a vehicle for teachers to learn from children. Therefore, the classroom was an experimental laboratory which facilitated the learning of both teachers and students. Also stressed was the use of filmed lessons, microteaching, and simulation in teacher education programs. The study of these methods led from simple, practical experience to the more complex arrangement of planning and organizing school situations. This end result was accomplished through intensive university study with teaching demonstrations, discussions, classroom simulation, and the  study of learning and behavior development in children. It is hoped that confidence and direction would, therefore, be provided to the future teacher before he undertook a full-time teaching schedule. (BRB)",

After a brief introduction, general objectives and planning procedures of the workshop were presented. Participation selection was based on a questionnaire designed to investigate backgrounds, interests, and attitudes toward individualized instruction. An assessment of this questionnaire resulted in the following areas of study covered in the workshop: overview of individualized instruction; curriculum adjustment for individualized instruction; skills training; objectives and organization of individualized instruction; systems of individualized instruction with emphasis on individually  guided education, motivation, grouping, scheduling, assessment, and reporting for individualized instruction. The report presented the daily schedules of the workshop. The resulting success of the workshop was reported in two tables of data on the cognitive mastery level in each content area. The results showed an effective change in cognitive behavior in most of the participants. A post-workshop attitudinal questionnaire revealed that the participants' view of the workshop was highly beneficial. Suggestions for future workshops were made and the participant biographical and attitudinal questionnaires were included. The materials used in the workshop were also presented along with correspondence to the participants. (BRB)",

Two data-gathering instruments were developed: a 10-item open-ended questionnaire and a partially structured interview guide. The responses of the questionnaire were classified according to qualitative and quantitative data. The subcategories of quantitative data were problems perceived by beginning teachers, problems perceived as most urgent, sources of help, college program as related to identified problems, teachers' organizations in relation to identified problems, and sources of on-the-job satisfaction. The three subcategories of qualitative data were problem sense, adequacy, and commitment. Results show that the problems perceived by beginning teachers include (a)  instruction, (b) control and attention, (c) use of materials, (d) use of time, (e) interpersonal relationships, and (f) use of space. The study also shows that (a) the administrator is the greatest source of help, (b) teachers' organizations are generally ineffective, (c) teacher-pupil interaction gives the most job satisfaction, and (d) teacher-administrator relationship is an urgent problem. The results also indicate difficulty among teachers in coping with identified problems. Also reported is a lack of self-adequacy. However, two-thirds of the teachers saw a commitment to a larger human need as related to identified problems. Ten tables of statistical results are presented.) (BRB)",

The report specifies that 150 participants served as auxiliary personnel in 32 Richmond schools and that the educational phase of the program was conducted jointly at Virginia Union and Virginia Commonwealth Universities. The program and curricula of the Career Opportunities Program (COP) are described briefly, with participant requirements for selection given. The involvement of COP with other programs for disadvantaged children is also discussed. Evaluation techniques are described particularly opinionnaires and checklists. The evaluation focused on (a) assessment of  self-concept and attitudes of COP and non-COP participants toward various characteristics in the teaching process, (b) assessment of the self-concept of children in classrooms with COP and non-COP aides, and (c) comparison of ratings of university and public school staff concerning performance and personal characteristics of the COP and non-COP participants. Reported results show that (a) a gain in interpersonal adequacy for both groups was achieved; (b) COP participants' ratings on classroom organization and planning sessions with the teacher were significant as were non-COP ratings on student relationship; and (c) attitudes of COP aides, as measured by a semantic differential scale, increased significantly toward the COP.",

The models include specifications for a national organization to serve rural teachers' needs, the design of an individualized in-service program, and a voucher system. Section 2 offers the viewpoints of other conference attendants on implementing the models. Their considerations encompass power factors and the reluctant learner. In section 3, currently operating rural in-service teacher education programs are described. The programs have two characteristics in common. They serve large numbers of remotely  based teachers (often in a wide geographic area) and the programs are brought to the teachers at the local sites. The publication also includes an introductory paper on today's schools, appendices with background information on rural America, a bibliography, and a summary of the proposal to the U.S. Office of Education which initiated this project.

After a brief introduction, the two main learning theories of Gestalt-field psychology and stimulus-response association were investigated. The importance of the individual in modifying his own behavior was stressed in Gestalt-field psychology. The importance of conditioning the individual was focused upon in stimulus-response association. Of classical and instrumental conditioning, the latter was emphasized because of its modification of response through either positive or negative reinforcement. The application of punishment as a negative reinforcement to achieve extinction of patterned behavior was viewed in an unfavorable light. Instead, positive reinforcement schedules were stressed. Some  principles to guide the teacher in the execution of these theories were presented. Classroom control was discussed in terms of setting both course of study and classroom goals. The influence of the teacher as a model of behavior was also stressed. It is recommended that total control or domination be avoided. A two-page bibliography was included. (BRB)",

Elementary school teachers and administrators were asked to use their own judgment in deciding what duties would be most pertinent for the students and how much time they should ask students to spend on chores not directly related to classroom instruction. Students were required to maintain unstructured logs for their off-campus experience. During the third semester, a structured trial log was designed based on the data of the unstructured logs. Results of the program revealed that elementary school teachers can be relied upon to provide a variety of pertinent pre-student teaching  experiences; students were not used merely to perform undesirable tasks; and it was not necessary for the teacher training institution to dictate time allotments.

The courses studied were computer programming, electrical science, electrical networks, electronic engineering, and engineering communications. The courses were analyzed in terms of purpose, content, and objectives. Definitive problems for each course were decided upon by professors responsible for each course. These problems represented the most complex types of questions a student would be able to solve after completion of the course. Therefore, these problems became the educational objectives for electrical engineering students. Each course was then described in terms of these difinitive problems. The student was evaluated in terms of his own performance, independently of the  performance of other students. It was concluded that specified educational objectives served as guidelines for teachers in the selection, revision, and presentation of course materials. These objectives also acted as guidelines for the students in the assessment of goals. The major objectives of this engineering education system have paved the way for treating curriculum design as a system engineering problem. (BRB)",

Protocols were gathered on teachers in grades one through three, including information from  questionnaires on teacher attitudes and background and scores on verbal facility tests. The results were presented statistically in five tables. Three inclusions were apparent: (a) Teaching experience and graduate education did not contribute to student achievement; (b) Different teachers and classroom composition had no effect on the achievement level of Mexican American students; (c) Differences in teachers and classrooms did effect the achievement of white students, regardless of socioeconomic status.

The criteria in the selection of participants were bilingual ability and bicultural experience. The nine objectives of the program were presented, focusing on the cooperation of university faculty members, student teachers, public school personnel, and pupils. The development of the program at Cholla High School, Tucson, Arizona was explained, with stress on the concepts of team teaching and open schools. Budgetary  considerations and subjective evaluation procedures were discussed. It was concluded that the Professional Semester Program produced students with attributes of experienced teachers.

The purpose of the sessions was twofold: (a) the positive modification of teaching behavior in the larger educational community and (b) the extension of its service to all segments of the educational community. Each session concentrated on a particular skill and the participants became involved in actual  teaching-learning situations. The topics of these sessions were nonverbal communication in the classroom, interaction analysis in the classroom, inquiry, computer test analysis, analysis of teaching by video tape, intergroup approach to education in a multi-ethnic society, conservation and outdoor education, technical skills in teaching, and the affective domain in the classroom. Nine elementary and secondary student teaching supervisors conducted the sessions. (The report contains description of each of the topics along with specific objectives.

The second phase is designed to intensify the student's examination of the teacher's task and to allow him to focus specifically on teaching children and to develop the necessary skills, abilities, and attitudes. The professional education courses are blocked into four sequential blocks. Block one occurs in freshman or sophomore years and provides initial experiences in working with children while taking course work in child psychology. Blocks two and  three combine the professional methods courses. Block four involves the student in student teaching for a semester during which time he is supported by the faculty through continuing seminar work. This assistance is taken to the student, while in a live classroom situation, through the establishment of student teaching centers. (Appendixes include related program material.) (Author/MJM)",

Previous research on basic teaching skills examined alternative teaching acts, such as explaining, questioning, reinforcing, without examining how teachers choose between one or another act. This paper argues that the basic teaching skill is decision making. This decision making process is examined using decision theory. Viewed from the decision theory perspective, a teacher has a choice of alternative acts. The choice may depend upon the teacher's subjective estimation of a student's understanding of the material and the usefulness of various alternatives in increasing that understanding. Research on teaching skills is reviewed, showing the application of current methodology to the study of teachers  decision making. This conceptualization of the teacher as a decision maker incorporates previous research on basic teaching skills. Skills such as questioning and explaining represent the teacher's repertoire of alternative acts, while the skills of listening and hypothesis generation influence the quality of information from which the teacher estimates the student's understanding and the utility of alternative acts. One implication is that teacher training should include a decision making component that integrates the other basic skills.

Progress in standardized social studies achievement tests dates from the early 1930's, at which time a Commission on the Social Studies attempted to apply new test techniques to the social studies. The key issues were the stating of precise objectives and the manner in which test items would be selected. Current tests are found to be of limited value because of a lack of clarity concerning the content of social studies tests. If standardized achievement tests in the social sciences are to continue to be used, the most sophisticated systems available should be used to derive test items and achievement tests  based on these instructional objectives. The development of such achievement tests could contribute to a wider acceptance of new instructional materials, and the diagnostic values of these tests could be of considerable aid to teachers and other professionals concerned with the social science programs.

The producer of employment tests must put more effort into job analysis activities, criterion development activities, and criterion related validity studies. Another general concern for the test publisher is about certain characteristics of the test or its administration that are irrelevant to the specific abilities being measured but which depress scores for members of one group. Another  consideration is that of differential validity studies. There is more than one reasonable definition of test fairness, and these definitions are in conflict; thus, competing values must be weighed. The test maker cannot resolve the problem of competing values, but he can provide the test user with information that will make explicit the value implications of various uses of tests. Two figures illustrate Thorndike's alternate definition of culture fairness. (DB)",

        "description":"Ability tests in use today and the educational programs of the schools are examined from a Black perspective. It is stated that it is incumbent upon educators to develop appropriate learning experiences in the classroom which relate to the Black child's background experiences. The following issues are raised: (1) I.Q. tests (predictor variables) are biased in favor of white children and against Black children, (2) educational programs (criterion variables) are biased against Black children, (3) the structural similarity and content of items in educational program and ability tests are near isomorphic or point to point, (4) statistical prediction is based on the relationship observed between predictor variables (ability tests) and criterion variables (scholastic performance).  Correlational statistics involves the relationship between two variables only--the better the match between the two variables, the higher the correlation and the better the predictive power is likely to be; when the match between the two variables is poor, the correlation and predictive power are also poor. It is stated to be a well-known fact that ability tests, i.e., predictor variables, are biased in favor of native-born white American children. It is contended that the school system has served as a biased criterion and is related to the biased predictor. Using test bias as moderators for both predictor and criterion variables, the fallacies of previous studies involving Black children are pointed out. (DB)",

        "description":"Increased student demand for foundations courses, coupled with a lack of qualified staff, made it necessary to provide workable alternatives to traditional instruction. Substantial adjustments could not be made until the efficacy of the new methods could be documented. The study compared cognitive and attitudinal outcomes of two types of classes, a traditional one of 38 students (the control group), which met three times weekly for periods of 50 minutes each, and an experimental group of 90 students, which met twice weekly for 50 minutes at 7:00 p.m., and once weekly for 50 minutes in groups of about 15. The nature of the cognitive comparison was an objective test based on a text common to both groups. The test was administered prior to and after instruction, and results were  analyzed by the analysis of covariance technique. Attitudinal comparisons were made in general evaluation of the course, method of instruction, course content, interest, instruction, time schedule and development of concepts and ideas. Analysis of covariance results revealed that no significant difference existed between the two groups on cognitive goals. Tests for significant differences between proportions were conducted for comparisons on attitudinal components. A significant difference in favor of the experimental group was found in the method of instruction, whereas a significant difference in favor of the control group was found in the time convenience category.

        "description":"Limitations in past research in educational television and guidelines for conducting more fruitful future research are identified. The current practice of utilizing few, if any, common criterion measures of effectiveness presents difficulties in the attempt to generalize from current research on ETV. An important initial effort in attempting to improve research in ETV would be to isolate those factors in the learning situation that might produce changes in the behavior of pupils viewing television. It would seem appropriate that an attempt be made to measure the question-asking behavior of both the studio teacher and the classroom teacher involved in the establishment of learning experiences for a particular group of pupils. Based on an evaluation of the literature and the  author's research, the following recommendations for future research are proposed: (1) Teachers selected for participation in studies utilizing ETV should volunteer and/or have a favorable attitude toward the use of ETV; (2) Eliminate comparison studies, e.g., TV science versus non-TV science instruction; (3) Increase emphasis on developmental (formative) research that can aid in the design and implementation of the particular TV series--selection of evaluative instruments that measure each specific program objective, increased emphasis on measure of verbal and non-verbal behavior of studio and classroom teachers, and increased emphasis on measures of verbal and non-verbal behavior of students receiving TV instruction.

The methodology to be used in accomplishing these objectives is an educational management system, known as the accountability model, which has six basic components: (1) identification of common goals, (2) establishment of performance objectives, (3) assessment of needs, (4) analysis of delivery systems, (5) evaluation, and (6) recommendation for improvement. Procedural issues concern: who will conduct the program, who will be included in the program, which fourth and seventh graders will be given the assessment battery, how long it will take to administer the battery (word relationships, reading, mechanics of written English, mathematics, and composite achievement), steps being taken to assure some degree of standardization in administeration, who will administer the  battery, when it will be administered, etc. (DB)",

S. is analyzed in relation to their demographic and socioeconomic background. This is the second report on the Goodenough-Harris Drawing Test, administered in the Health Examination Survey of 1963-65, and deals with the results in relation to factors of race, region, size of place of residence, grade in school, education of parent, and family income. For this survey, a probability sample of 7,417 children was selected to represent the 24 million noninstitutionalized children in the U.S. While white children scored higher than Negro children on this test, the racial differential is lower than on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the Wide Range Achievement  Test, and is reduced to a negligible amount when the effects of differences in parent's education and family income are controlled. The performance of children on this test does not differ appreciably among the four regions of the Nation, except in the South, where children of both races fall below those in other regions. Size of place of residence is not consistently related to test scores. There is a slight but consistent association between drawing test scores of white and Negro children and rate of population change in the 1950's. Children over the modal age for school grade do more poorly than those below, while those at the modal age yield consistently average scores. Father's education and family income both show a relationship to children's scores. Included are descriptions of the  drawing test, the survey design, and reliability estimates. Comparisons are made with previous research using this type of instrument. (Author/DB)",

The class was divided into four treatment groups (2 x 2 factorial design) and different feedback of results was mailed to each group for the four objective class tests written before final exam. Two FORTRAN computer programs were used to determine class standing, current grades and predicted final course grades. The predicted final exam and course grades were obtained by applying a linear least-squares line of best fit to the test data and extrapolating to future tests and to  the final exam. The class standing was obtained by using a FORTRAN sorting program. Analysis of variance was performed on the final exam grades, and no significant differences were found in final exam performance or in satisfaction with feedback received (Chi-squared test), although results slightly favored the feedback groups. The computer program was found to adequately predict the final exam grades, i.e., the linear regression was significant. (Author/DB)",

This paper shows that the numerically accurate solution is likely to be an unreasonable estimate of the regression coefficients for this problem. This is true because the accuracy of the data and appropriateness of the model may affect the solution more than the computational method. An easily computed index is derived that can be used to indicate such computational instability. The basic conclusion is that a concern about highly accurate computational methods must be tempered with a concern for whether the data are accurate enough to make the results of such computation meaningful.

The BHW was administered to 621 children ranging in grade level from preschoolers less than 4 1/2 years old to third graders. Socioeconomic level and sex were balanced at each grade level. Grade level proved the most consistent and powerful factor related to cognitive style. Results were generally consistent with previous research, indicating, for example, a decrease in use of color as a grouping category with increased grade level. Sex and socioeconomic level interacted  significantly with grade level in their effects related to cognitive style, but neither produced consistent effects on cognitive style independent of grade level. Item analysis indicated a need to revise approximately 25% of the items. The BHW appears capable of assessing aspects of cognitive style among non-verbal populations. Plans and recommendations include: (1) revision of the BHW; (2) assessment of verbally impaired populations; (3) direct comparison of BHW scores to other cognitive style assessment procedures; (4) studying the relationship of BHW scores to intelligence, achievement and personality variables; and (5) evaluating the relationships between individual cognitive style and teaching-learning environments.

The data are displayed in an achievement idiograph, which shows individual grade placement based on the pretest, expectancy score, and posttest placement. Data can be used at the individual student level by classroom teachers or aggregated by classroom, school, or district to serve the needs of other decision-makers.

Teachers in five diverse colleges were assigned randomly to a feedback (treatment), no-feedback (control), or posttest group. The feedback and no-feedback groups used a student rating from in one of their classes at midsemester and responded to a self-evaluation form. The feedback group received a summary of student responses. Both groups administered the form again at the end of the semester, as did the posttest group. If student feedback improved instruction, end-of-semester ratings of the feedback group should have been better than the other groups. But multivariate analysis of variance results indicated no significant differences among the groups.  Regression analyses indicated that student feedback did effect changes in teachers who had rated themselves more favorably than their students had rated them. In the second study, teacher self-ratings were compared to student ratings to investigate the extent to which instructors learn something from students about their teaching. Teachers generally evaluated their teaching somewhat differently from the way their students evaluated it. Comparisons across items between student and faculty responses indicate that instructors are aware of many of their strengths and weaknesses but see themselves more favorably in absolute terms.

        "description":"Since the Korean War and the integration of all ethnic groups in the Army, the Fort Benning Dependents' Schools have served the educational needs of the sons and daughters of culturally different families living on the post. A letter from the Department of the Army on April 22, 1970 expressed the desires of the department to make greater efforts to implement multi-ethnic education and the training of teachers to provide it in all of the dependent school systems. The Assistant Superintendent found personnel in the schools with great interest and a desire to work with him on a multi-ethnic curriculum guide. A committee was formed comprising two teachers from each school. The principals were also invited to attend the committee meetings and to invite community members. It was  decided to include in the guide ethnic groups that are most frequently represented in the schools. Each school would select an ethnic group to study. The guide would help in the teaching of culturally different students by providing cultural and historical information about minority groups in an effort to begin to give the teacher a starting base that could be used in assimilating the material into the curriculum. By doing this, the guide would break down stereotypes and help teachers, students, and parents to learn to appreciate culturally and ethnically different people.

        "description":"The universe of Japanese immigrants selected for this study consisted of a diverse group such as the kika nisei (returned second generation), the yobiyose (sponsored immigrant), and the gijutsu imin (technical immigrant). Each group possessed different characteristics. This present paper is limited in scope to the yobiyose and gijutsu imin because it is extremely difficult to determine objectively the exact status of the kika nisei with respect to immigration. In contrast to the pre-war Japanese immigrants composed mainly of farmers and fishermen, the post-war immigrants consisted of those with a diverse range of occupations such as craftsman, technicians, musicians, clerks, scientists, engineers, artists, and architects, to mention only a few. Differences in the occupational  skills possessed by the various immigrant groups resulted in different adjustment processes during their initial settling-in period in Canada. Some immigrants were able to secure immediate employment and others were not. Consequently, the characteristics which the immigrants brought with them from Japan became an important factor for both employment and integration in the new host society. (Author/JM)",

This paper seeks to ascertain the relationship between these two target-group sectors and to identify the overlap of academically disadvantaged pupils with the other five prevalent target groups: (1) potential dropouts; (2) emotionally or mentally handicapped students; (3) migrant pupils; (4) neglected and delinquent pupils; and, (5) physically handicapped pupils. The paper proposes to use a data bank from the national 1970 Evaluative Survey of Compensatory Education to entertain the following four questions concerning the overlap between academic and economic disadvantagement: (1) in what variables do children targeted as  academically disadvantaged differ from the overall population in the eyes of their teachers? (2) in what variables do children targeted as socioeconomically disadvantaged differ from the overall population in the eyes of their teachers? (3) what is the overlap of these two categories? Are academic disadvantagement and socioeconomic disadvantagement highly related variables? and, (4) in relationship to the target groups--academically disadvantaged pupils, socioeconomically disadvantaged--what variables interact differently for crosstabulation built upon these three categories and on the estimated national population?

This paper focuses primarily on an identification of some of the major issues and questions which are of concern to investigators in the field. The major concern of this review is with undernutrition, or malnutrition produced essentially by an insufficiency of protein and calories in the child's diet, commonly referred to as \"protein-calorie malnutrition,\" which is regarded by many as the most serious nutritional problem on a world wide basis. Some consideration is also given to recent research on specific nutritional deficiencies and intellectual development. Several groups of studies are reviewed: (1) studies of protein-calorie  malnutrition severe enough to markedly curtail physical growth, and to require hospitalization in the first several years of life; (2) studies of children having experience of more moderate, chronic malnutrition, judged usually on the basis of restricted physical growth; (3) studies of current efforts to evaluate the effects of various types of experimental intervention aimed at preventing or remedying the adverse consequences of malnutrition; and, (4) studies of relationships between intellectual functioning and specific deficiencies in such nutrients as iron or vitamins.

The focus was on parental perceptions of educationally relevant variables in hopes of improving the planning and implementation of educational programs by school and community groups to better meet the needs of Puerto Rican people. Ninety-two Spanish-speaking families having children in the primary grades of Bridgeport public schools were interviewed for this study. Names and addresses of these families' children were obtained from five schools in various areas of Bridgeport in proportion to the concentration of such students in each school. Fifty percent of the sample were Model Cities Neighborhood residents.  The Zirkel-Greene Home Interview Schedule was the instrument used for this study, this instrument being available in English and Spanish forms. Basically, it includes items that deal with factors of parental perception and family background that relate to the education of Spanish-speaking pupils. Since the interviews were conducted for the most part during the afternoons, mothers responded in about 87 percent of the interviews. Fathers participated in about 16 percent of the interviews. An adult other than a parent participated in about 9 percent of the interviews. (Author/JM)",

An important aspect of a social environment are the jobs available for the consideration of an individual. The present study is an exploratory study directed at the examination of job perceptions among a group of white and black adolescents and the hardcore unemployed. This study had two main goals: (a) instrument development, and (b) the gathering of data on subjective culture. To reach these goals it was desirable that as many disparate samples as possible should be used. It was possible to obtain four geographically and demographically distinct samples: (1) white female college students; (2) black working-class and lower-class high school boys from the Chicago Heights area; (3)  white high school boys, working-class and lower-class, and some Spanish-speaking adults from Chicago Heights; and, (4) black adult subjects classified as \"hardcore unemployed,\" from St. Louis, Missouri. The purpose of using these samples was to be able to generalize to that situation in which black males with vocational problems try to become integrated in a highly heterogeneous white establishment. White females were used because the investigators felt that they are the best examples of carriers of white middle-class culture, and thus would provide an \"extreme-groups\" comparison to the black sample.

This was done for two reasons. (1) They were involved in a larger project whose ultimate aim is to train both blacks and whites so that interracial interactions in employment settings lead to improved job tenure for black employees. The authors felt that to undertake such an enterprise without first-hand experience of some of the problems would be intellectually dishonest at least, and maladaptive, at worst. (2) Information was needed concerning interracial interactions in the community which only local black persons could obtain. This paper describes both their experiences as employers and  summarizes information obtained from other employers and employees. First described and commented upon are some of the bureaucratic problems encountered. Then reported on are their views of the \"stimulus,\" describing some aspects of the behavior of their two employees as it appeared to them in their employer roles. They add their reflections on these descriptions, on the information obtained by their assistants in their collection of critical incidents, and on their perception of their own responses. One of the black assistants commented upon the employers' reactions. His observations are included. (Author/JM)",

This paper uses an information content analysis of critical incident data. The critical incident methodology focuses on specific instances of behavior which provide positive or negative outcomes, attempting to give specific behavioral referents to positive or negative evaluations. Because it is both an exploratory technique and one which is tied to behavior, it is well suited for the generation of real-life conflicts which may then be used as stimuli in studies of training effectiveness. Critical incidents were collected from 11 black and 13 white workers from a number of  Champaign and Urbana firms, by interviewers of the same race as the respondent. Workers were asked about incidents of conflict between themselves and members of the other race. To perform the content analyses, the authors first read the texts of all black and white respondents. A system of categories, based on the texts, was then devised separately for white and black subjects. Texts were numbered and checks were placed under each category name present in a given text. Categories and text codings represent the consensus of the authors. (Author/JM)",

By understanding cultural backgrounds of individuals from different cultures, it was anticipated that one could more correctly interpret the motives and actions of others and reduce the conflict and misunderstanding which might otherwise occur. The objective of the slide-tape presentation was to present a  systematic listing of eight of the most salient cultural differences between the white middle-class culture and the black ghetto culture. A theoretical or historical explanation is given for each difference, and some of the possible effects of these cultural differences in industry, such as misunderstanding and conflict, are described. In the readers theater script, these cultural differences are portrayed in a real life setting showing two quite opposite interpretations of a black employee's behavior. (Author/JM)",

As in previous years, the major thrust of Title I or Project SPEEDY (Special Programs to Enhance the Education of Disadvantaged Youth) has been in the area of corrective reading and other programs designed to promote language development. While the emphasis of Federal programs has been to concentrate funds on fewer recipients, the implementation of such a policy has been made increasingly difficult by integration efforts. Because of busing, Title I services were extended to 50 additional elementary schools and 14 additional junior high schools. Title I services made available to pupils in &quot;Extended Service&quot; schools consisted of corrective reading instruction and  attendance services. With the exceptions of corrective reading and attendance services, most other Title I activities were concentrated on the early elementary grades and pre-school. While a total of 4887 public and 291 non-public children participated in all phases of Title I, the greatest number for any single instructional program was 1703 in all levels of corrective reading. Evaluation of the corrective reading program was based on a pretest-posttest comparison of results on the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test and on the pretest-posttest gain in the instructional reading grade level which was a teacher evaluation.

All grades, one through twelve, are tested in reading. The Cooperative Primary Test is used in the first, second, and third grades since it is the State-mandated instrument. Grades four through twelve are also tested in language and arithmetic. The Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills are used in grades four through eleven and the Iowa Test of Educational Development is employed with twelfth graders to test all three skills areas. All scores reported herein were secured from the Spring testing, May 1972, except those for twelfth graders, which were taken from the State-mandated Fall testing conducted in October 1971. It should be pointed out  that these tests are designed to measure the level of competency in the basic skills areas. Consequently some of the high-achieving students, especially in the upper grades, have a tendency to &quot;top out&quot; on the tests; i.e., to get near-perfect scores which demonstrates their mastery of the basic skills, but not necessarily their achievement level in the subject areas being tested. Consequently, these tests have the most value for demonstrating the basic skills achievement level of the average and low-achieving students whose scores generally are not affected by this &quot;ceiling effect.&quot; (Author/JM)",

The Rooms of Fifteen program had three general purposes: (1) to improve the basic academic skills of faltering elementary students to the point where they can succeed in a regular classroom; (2) to improve student attendance; and, (3) to influence children toward growth in self-confidence and toward overcoming feelings of  defeat and frustration. The Title I Lincoln High School was designed to intervene in the problems of the inner city student who has trouble adjusting to school. The South Grand Work-Study High School was designed to recruit dropout-prone students in the Title I schools and influence them to stay in school and graduate through a program of job training and services. The Nonpublic Schools program has two general purposes: to improve the basic academic skills of Title I eligible children, and to provide inservice training and facilities to Title I teachers in nonpublic schools.

        "description":"A study of the performance pattern of 1,000 elementary school children in Philadelphia was conducted to determine: (a) whether the inclusive Title I program was having a significant impact on reading achievement, and (b) whether the specific intervention models were producing significant changes in the performance rates of their respective groups. Through the use of a component impact analysis procedure, it has been found that Title I elementary schools in Philadelphia were receiving four intervention models: Educational and Cultural Enrichment, General Instructional and Supportive Support, Intensive Instructional and Supportive Support, and Remediation Programs. The evaluation of the scores of 1,000 pupils from the target population revealed that the four intervention models  were producing positive differential gains in reading achievement. When compared with their initial rates of progress, the average pupil increased his rate of progress in reading achievement by 100 percent. In Models 2, 3, and 4, the average pupil improved his rate of progress in reading by more than 100 percent. These results showed that the additive effects of the project input service configurations within the intervention models caused the development of skills/strategies which facilitate improved learning.

The principal objective of the current research was to examine the relationship between performance on an auditory PA task and the linguistic components of strings provided and generated by children from low-status-black and high-status-white groups. In addition, it was an attempt to bring sociolinguistic research closer to children's learning. Two hundred and sixteen sixth graders, comprising 108 low-status-black and 108 high-status-white subjects were aurally presented 36 pairs of concrete nouns. Linguistic strings generated in a free condition by low-status children facilitate recall for  subjects like them, whereas high-status children's performance was facilitated by strings generated within both populations. Children from low-status-black and high-status-white populations learn noun-pairs more efficiently when nouns were embedded in subject generated and experimenter-provided verbal contexts than in a no-context control. A multiple regression analysis was carried out to assess the relationship between linguistic characteristics of the strings and noun-pair recall. (Author/JM)",

The listing, it is held, is by no means a complete one. The need for listing these materials arises from the fact that, historically, children's literature on minority races has been written from a prejudiced point of view, and in a derogatory manner, by white authors for a white audience. Another major reason for putting this list together is to encourage each minority to learn about the other through authentic and reputable authors. This way, the stereotyping and negative attitudes that have resulted from bad children's literature may be offset. In most listings there is sufficient information to order the books listed. Where possible, the  cost, audience or grade level, and binding--paperback or hard cover--of the books is specified. Some of the films indicate that a preview is available prior to purchase.

        "description":"Current trends in reporting and discussing the educational progress of disadvantaged urban children seem to be made without the benefits of recent findings in educational psychology, learning theory, studies of the effects of societal conditions on educational progress, or psychometric procedures. When these recent findings are considered, one would find that the characteristics such children bring to school are fixed behavioral patterns that are reinforced by their environments. Secondly, one would find that their underachievement is related to the discontinuity between their societal patterns and the prescribed educational referents. Therefore, the methods they use to solve problems are significantly different than those expected in the educational setting. For these and other  reasons, methods to measure their ability to master educational tasks provide indices of the discrepancies between their cultural experiences and those offered in the educational setting. The circumstances which prevent disadvantaged children from being successful in school are not universal. They are complex and take on a variety of forms. To argue that a specific set of materials or educational programs will do the job for all urban children within a given school or at a given grade level would tend to suggest that the advocate neither understands the problem nor appreciates the situation.

        "description":"This study is concerned with attitudes of family members, and whether such attitudes indeed vary with different family structures. The increasing sociological and psychiatric evidence seems to support the existence of family strengths in families which have been defined as unstable because of structural attributes. Given the historical character of the Negro lower-class family one would expect to find strong attitudes of family identity and integration among female members of the family and some sense of isolation from the family by the adult Negro male. The types of attitudes to be found among their white counterparts have not been documented. A study concerned with the evaluation of retraining workers provided an opportunity to explore the relationships between the family  structure of persons applying for retraining in Michigan, and their subjective attitudes toward their families. The research design was a two-stage panel study in which the first stage data used here were derived through an interview schedule and a test battery of attitudinal and psychological items administered during the first week of training. The original sample consisted of 561 persons. The analysis here is based upon a sample of 471 lower-class and working-class adults, male and female, Negro and white. (Author/JM)",

The program was started three years ago, but was actually in full operation for about one and a half years. The services to children are a part of the total program and it is difficult to separate them without speaking about the rest of the program. The goals of the Outreach Services are: (1) to make mental health services easily accessible to all residents; (2) to establish programs with high-risk populations to prevent the development of psychiatric disabilities; and, (3) to educate neighborhood residents about mental health, psychiatric illness, and the various services available to them. In terms of these goals, five  clinics were successfully established in five areas, and a higher percentage of the population there is being reached when compared to the rest of the catchment area. Some preventive programs have been started and work continues on the education of the neighborhood residents with some success. These programs are even more difficult to evaluate and only long-term studies will probably provide the answer about success or failure in this respect. One of the main obstacles to this work has been the low priority of mental health and mental disease for the poverty stricken residents of the inner city. (Author/JM)",

The purpose of this paper is to detail the manner in which the activities and role of principal in this urban black school are affected by positing an \"external social forces\" model to explain the failure of children to learn. The institutionalized role of \"principal\" involves acting as \"cultural maximizer\" for the school. The cultural maximizer is one whose functions include maintaining the level of the culture as it is and contributing certain qualitative features necessary to the continuance of the cultural life. His function is never to alter the culture radically. He may help give more intense  expression to features that already exist, but never wants to bring about fundamental change. This statement closely describes the organizational activities of the two different principals who served at the school during this study. The school contains classes ranging from kindergarten through eighth grade, with one special education class. The enrollment of the school fluctuates near the 900 level and the staff consists of 26 teachers, a librarian, two physical education instructors, an assistant principal, and the principal. All teachers, administrators, staff, and pupils are black. (Author/JM)",

The project's primary purpose is the encouragement of greater numbers of students to stay in school and subsequently to continue their education at an appropriate school or college. The only full-time staff member at each center is a Project Opportunity counselor; this counselor works within the normal school setting and is assisted by a local policy committee that is composed of school administrators and  representatives from nearby colleges that have agreed to sponsor the program. Report Number 1972-5 examines data concerning the third successive group of Project Opportunity students. Summary data is presented for the 411 Group III students who completed high school in May and June of 1972 at the 11 centers. Report Number 1972-6 focuses on the colleges chosen by the outstanding black graduates of the program.

The purpose of the present study was to examine several facets of this question. Interrelationships were studied among pupil's self-esteem and the following demographic variables: school's racial composition, pupil's sex, pupil's socioeconomic status, and school's socioeconomic composition. The author takes the position that pupils' attitudes are just as important, if not more important, than scholastic achievement, particularly where attitudes are studied in relationship to school's and pupil's racial and socioeconomic groupings. Self-esteem was measured by 47 items from the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and six items from the Equality of Educational  Opportunity Survey. Two samples were employed. Data were analyzed for 2753 white subjects from 72 schools throughout Pennsylvania. The samples were drawn from a larger Pennsylvania Department of Education state assessment sample of 20,000 subjects from 355 elementary school buildings throughout Pennsylvania. Data were collected in the fall of 1969. The results of this study have implications for pupils' assignments to buildings, as well as implications for the selection of teachers, the allocation of resources, and the offering of special programs.

Indexes utilized were (a) level of aspiration; (b) Thematic-Apperception Test;  (c) Edwards Personal Preference Scale; (d) performance inventory; (e) achievement tests; and, (f) grade-point-average. Compared with Anglo-American and Mexican-American subjects, Negro subjects ranked high on interview measures of achievement motivation but scored low on measures of achievement performance in school situations.

        "description":"In June of 1971 there were many fragmented efforts attempting to deal with the problems of ecology and ekistics and the kinds of material which should be included in the curricula of the public schools and in the training and retraining of public school teachers. The purposes of this study were to: (a) design a system which would encourage participation of people from many sectors to produce suggestions on content and techniques which should be a part of urban education and teacher preparation; (b) establish criteria for the selection of curricular content for the training of urban teachers; and, (c) identify some elements to be included in an urban teacher education and re-education program. This study had a primary emphasis on a prescribed \"brainstorming process\" involving  eight selected groups. The results indicated that approximately half of the list of preferred qualities for teachers generated by the groups related to personal traits which are ordinarily considered a part of a student's personality at the time he applies for admittance to the teacher training program. Approximately half of the favored quartile characteristics related to teaching techniques, methodology, and interpersonal relations. One conclusion suggested by the study is that Schools of Education should give more attention to the selection of applicants. (Author/JM)",

These two groups spent the 1971-72 school year working together, with invaluable assistance from New Perspectives on Race, Inc. to develop a program that addresses itself to institutional racism, the most crucial issue confronting the American education system. The contents are organized in two parts. Part I, \"Racism and its manifestations in education,\" includes discussions of such topics as prejudice, racism, racist behaviors to be avoided, and becoming \"antiracist/racists.\" Part II, \"Antiracism activities,\" includes discussions of a curriculum on racism, and a  workshop design for racism. The latter is described in some detail. The design for a different kind of racism workshop for teachers was developed cooperatively with the Michigan Education Association's Office of Human Relations, N.E.A. Teacher Rights, and New Perspectives on Race. Appendix A includes racial checklists and inventories, while appendix B comprises group dynamics tools. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In the most narrow sense, compensatory education has failed; most Title I programs which seek to improve achievement have no discernible effect. This is apparently a result of the fact that the programs seek to provide for disadvantaged students more of the school resources which have never been found to affect the achievement of advantaged students. It is, on the other hand, clear that compensatory programs need not fail; highly structured preschool programs aimed at language development produce impressive short run IQ gains. The most important difference between these experiments and most other preschool programs is that the former were aimed narrowly at skills clearly related to what tests of IQ and verbal ability happen to measure. In addition, there are other models of what  might be called \"compensatory\" education--at least their object is to redistribute educational outcomes, and to improve life chances of children from disadvantaged circumstances. These programs however, focus on more distant outcomes of schooling--college entrance and high school graduation. The difficulty with both approaches is that they rest on an extremely limited evidence about the process of schooling. For example, we have no evidence that IQ affects life chances though if it does cause longer school retention, it may. While most standard compensatory programs have failed to affect achievement, there was never any evidence that much else could have been expected. (Author/JM)",

The project was undertaken in July 1970, as one element in the research conducted by the Title I Task Force, appointed by H.E.W. Secretary Finch. This final report consists of papers focusing on two issues. The first paper explores the notion that structured, teacher directed primary grade language programs will be more successful in raising achievement scores than generalized enrichment programs. The hypothesis was investigated by a comparative review of the evaluations submitted to the Center for Educational Policy Research and by field  visits. The second paper reviews the effectiveness of parent involvement in compensatory education. The paper tries to systematically investigate an area about which there are many opinions but little coherent data. It identifies those models of parent involvement which have been most effective in reaching parents and sustaining their participation as well as those which seem to be most effective in affecting achievement. Survey and other research evidence concerning the effects of parent involvement on student achievement are reviewed.

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to determine to what extent inequalities in educational opportunity exist in Manitoba, Canada and, should extensive inequalities exist, to propose ameliorative policies to provincial policy-makers. Equality of educational opportunity is considered to exist when educational resources and services are provided in such a way that access to them is distributionally equal across the province; conversely, inequalities exist when access varies consistently, on a basis other than need, for students in the province. Since unitary school divisions are the administrative units responsible for providing educational services to the great majority of public school students in Manitoba, since there are major variations in student enrollments in school divisions, and  since such variations in administrative unit size have been associated with variations in service provision in other jurisdictions, the method adopted is to present data on nine different educational services and resources by size of school divisions. This presentation shows that students in larger school divisions, which are generally urban, have substantially higher levels of access. These vary in size by service, but the direction of advantage or disadvantage is constant. There is no evidence that the discrepancies are positively associated with need differentials. (Author/JM)",

Trainees are asked to read such anecdotes, and asked to consider potential explanations for the behavior at issue, after which information is given whereby the trainee can both evaluate his understanding of the situation, and be taught appropriate explanations. Two formats for structuring training in cultural assimilators were investigated. The first, a branching format, requires subjects to choose the best of four explanations. If he is correct, the basis for the correctness is expanded upon, and the trainee continues to  another anecdote. If he is incorrect, the reason behind the incorrectness of the choice is given, and another choice required, continuing until the correct choice is made. The second format, called linear, requires each trainee to rate each alternative explanation of the behavior at issue in the anecdote on its correctness, after which the degree to which each is correct is explained before the trainee continues to the next anecdote. The contrast between linear and branching formats was the greatest when difficult anecdotes were examined. Unexpected effects of different sequences of linear and branching format training were discussed. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The \"elitist\" tradition of American education was found out in the 1960's. Not until a social force quite alien to the profession took hold and a revolution was declared, was the system of education called to task. In education, the response generated a spate of books that examined the many inequities, recommending remedies. Some of these studies became popular reading, either by dint of their daring or the esteem of their authors. Among the first was \"Slums and Suburbs,\" by James B. Conant. Despite the intellectual concessions and comprised recommendations of this book, the study marked a beginning that was to encourage closer scrutiny and clearer perception of the underprivileged by educational researchers. Most popular among them was Frank Reissman and his book \"The Culturally  Deprived Child.\" There yet remained a more intimate, realistic study to be made of the ghetto and its youthful inhabitants. Kenneth B. Clark's \"Dark Ghetto\" was just such a book. The evil of ghetto school education was fully recognized by the mid-1960's. It followed that in the resolution of these problems that consideration would be given to school leadership. Nat Hentoff's \"Our Children are Dying\" afforded just such a view. Many of the benefits to be derived from these years of educational study in the sixties were reflected in \"The Disadvantaged--Challenge to Education,\" by Mario D. Fantini and Gerald Weinstein.

The issue is whether or not EOP is successful in recruiting and developing disadvantaged but high potential students. This report compares EOP and non-EOP children of black, Asian, and white American parents on such variables as family relations, motivation toward learning, achievement, self-concept, political awareness, and social participation. Also, attitudinal changes of EOP students before entering the program and after completing one year will be examined. The research reported was pursued in the framework of motivation toward learning. Motivation is affected  by various social factors. It is expected that EOP students, in contrast to non-EOP students, are likely to: (1) show lower motivation toward learning; (2) have lower self-esteem; and, (3) feel powerless in controlling their environment, and hence be politically and socially apathetic. If EOP is effectively operated, it should produce students who are highly motivated, and politically and socially conscious. Although most of the EOP students are from ethnic minority groups, the behavior of low-income students is by no means homogeneous. Attitudes toward education and punishment for failure vary among ethnic groups. (Author/JM)",

The data in this report and in the report on  persons of Spanish origin are the first that have been presented on the basis of questions that ask for self-identification of the person's origin or descent. Previously ethnic origin had to be inferred from information on place of birth, country of origin, mother tongue, surname, etc. The data shown in this report were derived from detailed tabulations of the replies to the questions on origin or descent, on birthplace, language, and literacy asked in the November 1969 Current Population Survey.

Data were analyzed using multiple regression equations and zero order Pearson correlations by sex. The results showed that the SAT was not a significant correlate of college grades overall and the SAT-Math actually had a negative correlation with grades for males. Additionally, high school grades did not correlate with college grades for either males or females. On the other hand, reasonable predictions of freshman grades are possible using several nonintellectual predictors. (Author/JM)",

In an attempt to eliminate these obstacles, Sedlacek and Brooks developed the Situational Attitude Scale (SAS) to measure the attitudes of whites toward blacks. It includes two Forms, A and B. The effects of the same individual taking one form after the other were not known. The SAS was administered to 164 white freshmen during summer orientation. Eighty received Form A followed by Form B (order 1) and 84 received Form B followed by Form A (Order 2). Results of a repeated measures analysis of variance design indicated that Form, Order, and their interaction were all significant above chance. The Form main effect showed that despite taking both forms, subjects still  responded more negatively to Form B. The nature of the Order main effect and interaction indicates that subjects tended to be more negative toward blacks if they took form A first rather than Form B first. The writers interpreted this as indicating that it is harder to fake or withdraw from Form B than it is from Form A after a subject learns how his or her attitudes are being assessed. The writers conclude that it is possible to give an individual both forms of the S.A.S. and successfully measure his attitudes by examining differences between responses to the two forms.

Among these is \"The Disadvantaged Learner\" by Staten Webster. Over 600 pages in length, it is loosely organized around three themes: knowing the disadvantaged, understanding the educational problems of the disadvantaged learner, and educating this population. Among the most useful of the books of readings is \"The Disadvantaged Child, Issues and Innovations,\" by Joe L. Frost and Glenn R. Hawkes. The editor's introduction to the section on psychomethodological considerations places the teacher in the most significant role. Probably the most successful effort to move away from the potpourri of a book of readings and  develop a consistent point of view is \"Tactics for Teaching the Disadvantaged,\" by William F. White. The essence of this book is the chapter which discusses the teacher as a conditioner of emotions. Techniques or systems for developing skill in emotional modification are presented. A basically dangerous book, written for the preparation of teachers of minorities and the disadvantaged is \"Teaching the Culturally Disadvantaged--A Rational Approach\" by Kenneth R. Johnson. \"Preparing to Teach the Disadvantaged,\" by Bruce W. Tuchman and John L. O'Brien, was developed by a group of knowledgeable people invited together by the authors. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"A 6-month study of elementary and junior high school bicycle riders and events accruing to everyday use of their vehicles was conducted in Raleigh, North Carolina. Of the 2,369 mail questionnaires that recorded demographic and bicycle description data and information which permitted calculation of bicycle ownership rates by sex, 495 useable responses were obtained. Accident data were accumulated from hospital emergency rooms, police records, and a monthly report form that received 397 useable responses. Mileage data was calculated through use of cyclometers on the subjects' bicycles. Younger riders tend to sustain the more serious accidents, while the older rider is more often involved in a police-reported situation. Riders with less than two years experience tend to sustain more  accidents. Only the time of the day (three to six P.M.) and the month of the year (May and June) were positively associated with bicycle accidents. Accident rate differences according to the type of bicycle, its age, condition, or passenger carrying status are statistically insignificant. The findings of this study substantiate other studies that cite rider disaccommodation to the bicycle as a factor in development of the accident situation. Bicycle riding instructions might be organized according to the experience and sex of the rider. (Author/AG)",

Infrequently, custodians will adjust to this situation by &quot;training&quot; teachers or avoiding them, although they usually bid for or transfer to schools which they feel will provide satisfactory staff and community relations. Another response to status inconsistency is political activity, wherein Bay City custodians campaign for politicians in exchange for some measure of control over their working conditions and their lives in general. This monograph examines the backgrounds of the custodians and their required job skills. Both a literature review and a sociological model are used to  structure a series of in-depth interviews of custodians in a city of average size. (Author/AG)",

Changes made included introduction of semester-length courses. To facilitate the development of individualized schedules for attaining career objectives, a summer workshop included administrators, guidance counselors, a librarian, supervisors, and vocational teachers. Leaders in business and industry were used as resource staff, with semester-length courses and an occupational guidance program as innovative features for flexible modular planning. Parents were consulted about their children's vocational course placements, especially focusing on  parents of potential drop-outs. The use of a locally-developed vocational preference card, vocational interest testing, and related evaluative records enabled the staff to select 34 students for admission to an area vocational school, in addition to aiding other students develop vocational interests and capabilities. It was concluded that cooperative work experience is significant, because over 80 percent of the vocational students were permanently employed upon graduation.

Data gathered by analyzing the instructional expenditures of 19 community colleges for the fiscal year 1969 showed that: (1) Neither of two suggested mathematical formulas could accurately predict vocational program costs, (2) Expenses for similar programs vary widely according to the college, (3) Distributive education and home economics programs required less funding than non-vocational programs, while five other occupational areas required more, and (4) The size of student enrollment affected the cost per student. Minimum vocational program enrollments and identification of expenditures should be  established for community colleges, and distribution of federal vocational education funds should consider student enrollment, types of programs, and the development of cost effectiveness data for planning purposes. Further cost studies for vocational education are recommended.

In one laboratory study, effects of variations in task indices on skill acquisition of a set-up task were examined, while in a companion effort, preliminary data were collected on relationships between task index variations and performance during transfer of training. In the field study quantitative task index data were related to  ratio estimates provided by instructors on four training effectiveness criteria. Significant multiple correlations were obtained between task indices and speed and accuracy of performance during skill acquisition. Predictor patterns changed over time and between criteria. Set-up task speed was predicted early in training, while errors made were predicted later during acquisition. Similar but more provisional relationships were found during transfer of training. The results continue to indicate that quantitative task index data can be predictively related to training criteria. (Author/SB)",

To accomplish their goal, the evaluation team made a series of visits to the campuses of four colleges, where questionnaires were used to obtain the necessary data. At the conclusion of each visit, team members met in taped sessions to review their findings. Some of those major findings include: (1) Administrators were reluctant to allow first-line personnel to be interviewed outside of their presence, (2) Administrators tended to supply first-line personnel with acceptable answers, and (3)  Similarities were found in the policies and procedures regarding programs for the disadvantaged at the participating colleges. Conclusions reached were: (1) The Office of Economic Opportunity needs to create a more specific definition of the term, disadvantaged, (2) Programs which serve the disadvantaged are virtually nonexistant, (3) The development of existing programs was done in absence of minority input, and (4) Community input regarding decisions consists of after the fact information.

        "description":"On an international comparison basis, data derived from censuses in 1950 and 1960 indicated a significant international correlation, but a weak intranational relationship between productivity and formal education. Meaningful correlations that exist for some industries across countries lead to the conclusion that there exists a relationship between productivity and education for each industry separately. The major determinant in the variation of productivity is the occupational distribution in the total labor force rather than the variation in the years of schooling of the same occupations. Correlations between the proportion of people with more than a secondary education, with productivity are most significant. Formal education, as a derived demand, is a misleading indicator of  productivity, due to the importance of other modes of occupational training. The present use of educational distributions for analysis and planning must be reviewed, incorporating a wide range of variables in order to arrive at a correct appraisal of educational data.

Some conclusions from the review were: (1) The entire process of inservice education is not routinized, (2) Teacher autonomy is a major issue in inservice training, (3) Educators are relying more on electronic equipment for inservice training, (4) Planning and evaluation systems are inadequate, and (5) The problems of who decides what should be taught still faces educators today. It  was recommended that state-wide systems of planning and evaluation be developed and that the problem, who decides what should be taught, be investigated. (SB)",

        "description":"The Pacific State Hospital conducted a demonstration experiment with 12 severely and profoundly mentally retarded male adolescents, which concentrated on modifying disruptive, bothersome behaviors while developing basic work skills required for daily activity in sheltered workshops. The experiment provided an integrated program for an entire day, utilizing the concept that skills would transfer from a hospital environment to a community environment. The same daily schedule, work skills, and social behaviors sought during the project occur in sheltered workshops in the community. The concept of work and reward were utilized as behavior modifiers. Performance evaluations indicated success in achieving the objectives, and clinical observations indicated growth in the students'  self-esteem and social awareness, but their adaptive behavior was still unacceptable for community standards. One of the problems was that their behavior deteriorated unless very structured rewarding circumstances were present. The program has been continued with a token economy being substituted for the tangible rewards, and an hour interval now occurs before reinforcement is given. The efficacy in providing a vocationally oriented program for severely retarded adolescents was demonstrated. (SB)",

A pilot study developed and tested instrumentation and interview techniques prior to collecting 252 interviews of typical office workers. In a random sample of 305 interviews representing the four regions, 91 items of hardware, divided into 11 categories, were found to be used by beginning office workers. Typewriter keyboard machines, communicating machines, and adding-calculating machines accounted for 60 percent of hardware usage. Of the changing tasks reported, 52 percent were represented by  computers and data processing, and 94 percent were found in large metropolitan areas. A national survey of office supervisors, covering both effective and ineffective behaviors of office workers, yielded 829 usable social interaction critical incidents, which usually involved the worker's use of social sensitivity in dealing with customers, peers, and superiors. A classification scheme was developed, based on the worker's perception of social role expectations within the system. (Author/AG)",

Data were collected from the three major American automobile manufacturers, from federal regulatory agencies, and from insurance companies and others interested in auto safety. It was found that although it is more cost effective to work on the car than on the human being, American automobile manufacturers have traditionally promoted driver behavior modification and road improvement rather than any design improvements for safety and reliability. It was concluded that the auto manufacturers will not voluntarily develop a safe car. Their only consideration is profit, regardless of safety, and this attitude  will not change except by mandatory requirement. (MF)",

Participants' evaluations of the Institute indicated that the experience was felt to be educational and thought-provoking, with special value for personnel unfamiliar with the opportunities in vocational-technical education.

        "description":"This survey of the occupational status, future needs, and educational interests of volunteers and professional personnel serving senior citizens who live in communities or institutional settings in Hartford, Connecticut, is based on the assumption that new careers will open up in fields related to gerontology to meet the needs of a rapidly expanding population of older adults in Connecticut. A questionnaire and a pretest were sent to personnel in social agencies, visiting and public health nursing associations, welfare departments, senior centers and clubs, convalescent homes, nursing homes, boarding homes, and hospitals serving Hartford, Connecticut. From the 254 respondents, the following service areas were identified: (1) medical care, (2) mental health, (3) financial  assistance, (4) housing, and (5) social functioning. A second questionnaire was administered to 96 senior citizens both to determine their needs and to compare the results with organizational responses. Conclusions were: (1) Followup studies should focus on discrepancies noted between services reported by organizations and services seen as needing improvement by older adults, and (2) A geriatric program at the college level should be developed to meet in-service training needs and vocational interests related to the aging process.

        "description":"The purpose of this monograph is to present a theoretical framework useful for measuring structural unemployment. Developed on the basis of a literature review, this framework was applied to Canadian data. The approach which explains structural unemployment in terms of the causes of labor displacement is inadequate because it ignores impediments in the labor market adjustment process. The structural maladjustment approach used here takes these forces into account, although only the symptoms of structural maladjustment are quantifiable, not the forces themselves. A model was developed that determines the cyclical relationship between the unemployment and vacancy rates and attributes unexplained factors to changes in the level of structural imbalance. The model was intended to  employ variables directly related to the labor market, to use a theoretical rationale, and to compare structural unemployment under various demand conditions. Several forms of the relationship between the unemployment and vacancy rates were empirically tested, using data derived from National Employment Service vacancy data. Results indicate that variability in unemployment is largely caused by variability in aggregate demand, with an upward trend in the structural unemployment rate from 3 percent in the early 1950's to nearly 4 percent in the 1960's.

Since that study had to be completed rapidly, the present study was undertaken in order to provide a more comprehensive study of teenage drivers. The sample for this study consisted of 13,915 persons who were 16 or 17 years of age when licensed in five California counties in 1962-63. The driving records of persons in the sample for their first four years of driving were described and correlated with other biographical data. Data were collected from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, permanent high school records, a mail questionnaire, and personal interviews. Some findings include: (1) Those taking  behind-the-wheel driver training had better driving records and more socially desirable personal characteristics than those not taking the course, (2) Citizenship grades in high school was the best predictor of accidents and convictions, and (3) The average number of accidents showed little change in the first four years of driving.

Each of the four project schools then held a local inservice training workshop, involving 339 teachers and/or administrators. An inservice training handbook was developed, containing a rationale for career education, concepts, objectives, and suggested activities. Leaders from business and industry gave speeches on career education in the community, and teachers met by grade level and subject matter area to discuss the implementation of career education concepts. Problem areas in program development were identified by means  of a teacher questionnaire, and resource lists were provided for teachers. A final workshop was held to evaluate progress, discuss implementation problems, and plan future activities. Continuation of inservice training in career education is recommended, since the workshop objectives were successfully achieved. (AG)",

Begun in 1792, with the unification of a group of Philadelphia shoemakers, labor unions spread from local to national by 1860. Competition of products side by side in the same market or town as well as that experienced from immigrants entering the country in increasing numbers, soon led to the development of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), an organization which brought together national trade unions. The enactment of federal legislation in 1930 which protected the worker caused a tremendous increase in union membership. In 1938 the  Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO), which was later changed to the Congress of Industrial Organizations was established as a result of confusion and differences of opinion within the AFL. A merger between the two groups produced the currently existing AFL-CIO from which state and city-wide organizations have emerged, each having a certain interdependence, yet maintaining a great degree of autonomy.

An interrelated project being conducted at the same time consisted of a survey of 54 state and territory project directors requesting instructional materials for career education. The survey resulted in a disappointing quantity and quality of materials, and this scarcity was attributed to the incomplete nature of program development in career. It was recommended that career education planning and  implementation for Mississippi begin immediately, with pre- and inservice teacher educator training, coordination at the state and school district levels, and the appointment of a state director in career education.

Some of the major conclusions reached from the cost-analysis technique were: (1) There are considerable cost variations among the districts, (2) Cost variation depends heavily on the number of graduates by districts as well as on the number of courses offered under a program or occupation, (4) Scientific-technical courses increase the absolute cost of a  program as opposed to nontechnical courses, and (5) Costs are affected by the level of courses offered. In regard to the cost-benefit analysis, it was concluded that: (1) technical courses generally bring about a higher level of learnings than do nontechnical courses, and (2) benefits are seriously affected by the number of graduates joining the labor force and finding employment on a full and/or part-time basis.

To obtain the necessary data, 686 exhaustees were contacted and informed of the availability of short-term employment under the Supplementary Training and Employment Program (STEP). Responses were registered on questionnaires completed by interviewers whenever exhaustees made contact with a local office. A series of three notifications were given concerning the STEP program in order to increase participation. Analysis of 393 usable returns revealed that: (1) 54 percent of the claimants were males and 46 percent were females, (2) 56.6  percent were skilled in blue collar or industrial occupations, (3) 60.6 percent were 45 years of age or older, (4) 16.5 percent were employed full-time subsequent to exhausting benefits, (5) 24.8 percent were unemployed but not looking for work with 62.2 percent indicating retirement as a reason for nonparticipation, (6) 38.7 percent were unemployed and seeking full-time work while 12.7 percent were unemployed and seeking part-time work, (7) 10.6 percent were receiving welfare payments, (8) 7.3 percent were employed part-time, and (9) 52.4 percent were primary wage earners.

Data obtained from high school vocational agriculture graduating classes of 1961, 1964, 1967 and 1970 by means of a mail questionnaire and 20 interviews revealed that: (1) enrollment has doubled from 1961 to 1970, (2) post-secondary education was positively correlated with the level of income and (3) about ten percent of the  vocational agriculture graduates attended a 4-year college. Multiple regression analysis supported the hypothesis that the mean salaries of persons employed in the non-farm sector were higher than those working on the farm. An analysis of variance substantiated the fact that work experience is positively correlated to higher income levels. Although most students value the FFA, the 1970 survey showed that many respondents felt that FFA become impersonal and has ignored new fields related to agriculture. (AG)",

Students in the two experimental schools plus a control school without vocational programs were administered the Ohio Vocational Interest Survey, the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, and the Career Plans Survey in the fall of 1970 and again in the spring of 1971.  As compared to students from the control school and the general high school, the students from the area vocational school were better informed about career choice and demonstrated more positive attitudes toward their abilities and chances for vocational advancement. However, changes in vocational interests were more closely related to grade level than to school programs. Parents of the vocational students were the most favorably impressed with the school's career exploration program. (AG)",

Many elementary educators lack the knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed to make career education a concrete reality in local schools. To provide guidelines for educators in developing career education curriculums, a schema was devised and articulated by administrators and teachers who took part in two career development institutes sponsored by the University of Georgia during the summer of 1970. This schema arranged key questions, concepts, and procedures in a systematic framework for dissemination to elementary school faculties. The  following seven major categories were proposed: (1) goals, (2) organizational elements, (3) student needs, (4) instructional units, (5) correlation patterns, (6) resource materials, and (7) evaluative criteria. As an instrument for involving local educators in an ongoing process of developing programs and units in career education, this proposed schema should guide them in constructing more relevant patterns of elementary schooling.

        "description":"Career education, as viewed by the Division of Education in Washington, is essentially an instructional strategy aimed at improving educational outcomes by relating all teaching and learning activities to the concept of career development. Although teachers of the humanities may fear that career education is fundamentally anti-intellectual and rejects the humanist tradition, academic skills will not be supplanted by vocational preparation, but instead enriched by relating them to relevant vocational interest. Student motivation will be increased by preparing students either for immediate post-secondary employment or further career preparation. Of the 15 occupational clusters identified for career education curriculums, five are presently being developed at the high school level  by leading curriculum specialists. We humanists can elaborate and refine career education as well as benefit from the utilitarian aspects of that concept. At its best, work is a humanity and has a central position in the fashioning of a satisfactory human life. (Author/AG)",

In 1972, 790 students were in CCEW classes, 118 in related classes, 350 reached through the Traveling Rap Center, and 614 in attendance at CCEW forums, seminarios, workshops, and the Education and Job MINI-FAIR. CCEW courses in the fall term consisted of a survey series and one-theme seminars on contemporary literature, East Asian politics, and the urban-suburban mix. Courses during the winter terms consisted  of a survey series and one-theme seminars on books that are changing America, East Asian political history, understanding the American political system, anthropology and social change, contemporary literature, conversational Spanish, and psychology and the status of women. Courses during the spring term consisted of a survey of literature series and seminars on Caribbean cultures and political history, psychology and the status of women, great decisions, books that are changing America, and conversational Spanish. The Intergroup Relations Task Force conducted group discussions with 125 women at the county jail. CCEW's work with intercampus programs, community programs, professional associations, and conferences is summarized. (KM)",

Attendance data were collected on which to base estimates of hours of instruction between tests. The calendar interval between tests was usually 4 or 5 months. The percentage of students gaining a full grade or more was 26% for reading and 20% for mathematics. Initial test scores are somewhat related to amount of previous schooling and to race, sex, and age (whites, females, and younger students tended to score higher than minorities, males, and  older students). Gains between tests were highest, on the whole, for students with the lowest initial scores. Gains showed no clear relationship with attendance, race, age, or previous schooling. Females gained slightly more than males, even though they started at somewhat higher levels. A comparison made with test results obtained in a study of basic education students enrolled in Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) programs showed that the MDTA students had higher initial scores but made similar gains for similar numbers of hours of attendance.

        "description":"This report to the Australian Commission on Advanced Education is intended as a basis for discussion by those who have the responsibility for making program and policy decisions in continuing education in Australia's colleges of advanced education. Though the idea that education is continuous with life is coming to be widely accepted intellectually in Australia, it has, as yet, made little impact on educational planning and policy. One result of the establishment of colleges of advanced education might be improved learning habits in the adult community, resulting in an increased demand for adult education. Colleges of advanced education have the resources to make a broadly based contribution to adult education, and, since their primary concern is with the application of knowledge  in the day-to-day world, adult education is consonant with their purpose. Colleges of advanced education would benefit the community, the nation, and themselves through involvement in adult education. Colleges of advanced education are currently much less involved in adult education than are comparable institutions in the U.S.A., Canada, and the United Kingdom. But, given the need and resources, considerable growth seems inevitable. However, if growth is not carefully planned, it will not be as beneficial as it might be and might find itself serving only advantaged groups. A first step toward planned growth should be discussion and definition of policy, involving all concerned policy-making groups. (Author/KM)",

The agricultural programs are international and range from domestication of the musk ox to rural leadership training to technical assistance in agriculture and home management to food science and technology programs to extension education, resource development, community services, and an agribusiness educational program. Observations on rural development include the following: (1) it has been suggested that the most economically rewarding kind of education for developing countries is for rural females; since they are responsible  for the younger generation, they can most quickly and constructively change attitudes and norms; (2) rural development is often equated with agricultural development when the non-agricultural rural population is a large problem; (3) land-grant universities in the U.S. have been slow to change their orientations from agricultural technology and business back to their original focus on the problems of people in rural areas; and (4) governmental commitment is necessary for rural development efforts to be effective, a commitment lacking in the U.S. (KM)",

The roles researchers have played are: (1) the researcher who conducts studies, writes official reports, and leaves the use of the findings to others; (2) the professional who reports his findings in journals and at professional conferences; and (3) the educator and change agent who considers teaching and public service, as well as research, aspects of the profession. Those accepting the third role accept the idea that interface between research and practice is the researcher's responsibility. Three essentials in bringing about an interface between research and practice are: (1) the research must be relevant to the practitioner; (2) the researcher  must be involved in the practice of adult education; and (3) the researcher must communicate research plans, practice and research results to the practitioner. Means of dissemination suggested for the third objective are writing, film, TV, videotape, radio, result demonstrations, models, reports at conferences and inservice programs, personal conferences, and teaching.

        "description":"This speech examines the role of change agents in third world societies and indicates that the change agent must, to some extent, manipulate the social situation, even if his view of society is a more optimistic one than he finds in reality. If he considers strains and stresses to be the lubricants of change, then his focus on conflict as a mechanism of change comes more easily. Although in pursuing directed change a conflict model of society is considered theoretically more satisfying and practically more realistic, this model does not provide guidance in controlling or utilizing knowledge and skills (nor, actually, does the functionally integrated view of society). But it does provide a different view of the future than the functional model, a future always changing, societies  always experiencing stresses, individuals always negotiating relationships. If in utopian terms this is an unpleasant view, it does instruct us practically to foster the growth of individuals and groups possessing those qualities that will ensure their survival. The ethics of the change agent as agent of conflict has its foundation here. (Author/KM)",

Teaching provides the resources of materials, techniques, and teachers themselves. Research provides results concerning the analysis of communication problems, audience information, the efficiency and effectiveness of media services, and the form of messages. Three assumptions are made about the ideal organization of information training activities: (1) there is central administrative control and direction over the information, training, and teaching functions; (2) staff members who are training have joint appointments in information offices; and (3) communication pathways between cooperating units are direct, not via administrative  hierarchies. Research can aid training through: (1) researching trainees to find out their information abilities and habits and what they want in training; (2) research of agents' use of mass media; and (3) audience understanding of technical terms. A teaching program aids training through the ready-to-use materials, methods, and teachers it provides. It is recommended that the AAACE invest in a centralized accumulation of existing training materials from all states. (KM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether a relationship exists between several selected socioeconomic characteristics and the adoption or non-adoption of soil testing as a farm management tool and to establish whether or not a statistically significant relationship exists between adopters and imperfect adopters (discontinuers). Data were collected from 166 Pennsylvania farmers whose names were supplied by the Pennsylvania State University Testing Service and county agents. Names from the testing service were known users of the soil testing program in 1970 and 1971. County agents were given the names of the known testers and asked to match them as nearly as possible by size and type of farm operation and, if possible, by neighborhood with names of nontesters or discontinuers.  Each individual was interviewed by telephone. Results showed that nontesters had a lower level of formal education than those who had previously used soil testing. Nontesters were older than testers, had lower gross farm income, and lower organizational participation scores. Adopters were younger, had higher organizational participation, had nearly two additional years of formal schooling, were more likely to own their crop land, and were slightly more prone to adopt other farming innovations than were discontinuers. Nontesters who had considered testing had a higher level or organizational participation than other nontesters. Implication and limitations of the study are discussed. (Author/KM)",

Each agent in the sample completed a 209-item questionnaire dealing with his communication with his supervisor, and each supervisor completed ten such questionnaires for each of his ten field agents. This resulted in 200 questionnaires giving matching information about 100 pairs or dyads. Similarities and differences and agents' and supervisors' backgrounds are analyzed. Supervisors perceived less frequent overall communication than did the field agents. Field agents perceived significantly less communication about personal matters and new ideas than did their supervisors. Significantly more supervisors wanted more  communication about the existing program. Field agents perceived significantly more of the communication that they received as being initiated by the supervisor. A high level of similarity of orientation between supervisors and field agents was found at both the agreement and accuracy levels. But between 1/3 and 1/2 of the dyads showed disagreement or misunderstanding. Similarity of orientation was found to be associated with dyadic satisfaction and interpersonal perceptions, but other factors contribute to these states.

ASCILOS covers a 60-mile radius around Sioux Falls. ASCILOS, based on symbiosis in nature, assumes that unlike communities, working together for mutual benefit, make for a strong social fabric. CENCOAD's objectives are to improve the human condition in the area by increasing the performance of the social systems and to develop a religious force at the local and area level that has the power to influence the lifestyle in the area. Citizens need to develop a value system that combines economic forces with religious forces to achieve  community advancement. In order to develop a symbiotic community, citizens need: (1) a catalyst such as CENCOAD; (2) to organize resources to best meet their needs; (3) a new image of community; (4) a sense of community among individuals; and (5) a new approach to resource development that will be sensitive to the national, social, and ecological cost. The three basic factors in community development are a major input of education, horizontal communication, and a motivational force. Development of a symbiotic community requires a study of the value system, development of an aware, responsible, positive spirit among the people, leadership, and a catalyst. (KM)",

The study is based on a stratified random sample of adult residents in 6 rural Iowa counties regarding 35 outdoor recreation activities. Five hypotheses were tested. The results indicate a direct effect of the level of participation as a child on adult level of participation. Childhood residence has no effect on adult activity level or on the percentage or composition of adult activities that included childhood activities. Childhood outdoor recreation activities are an important predictor of adult recreation activities in that approximately 40 percent of the 35 activities were participated in similarly during childhood and adult life.

Each function--personal, political, and moral--has special significance for continuing education. Adults continue their education to update their job skills or to seek satisfaction in the use of leisure time. Yet the less obvious relationship betweeen continuing education and the political and moral characteristics illuminates some of its distinctive aspects. Its position outside the central concerns of most schools has been both cause and effect of its special quality and contributions. Its spirit of immediacy, directness, and relevance inspires a mode of examination and questioning most essential in our mass  society. The Continuing Education Center for the Public Service at Syracuse University has been called the \"social conscience\" of the University. The Center approach--concern for real social problems, involvement of clientele and faculty, use of participatory training methods, flexibility in time and place, and relevance--these factors characterize program development at the Center for businessmen, government officials, social planners, poor people, minorities, or any identifiable group of adults.

Interviews were conducted with 238 and 227 farmers (1956 and 1966 respectively) in Ozark and 218 and 174 (1956 and 1966 respectively) in Prairie. Each was asked to whom he talked most frequently about farming, from whom he obtained general farm information, where he obtained first and additional information about new farm practices he had adopted, the sources that were most influential in his adoption decisions, with whom he exchanged work, and the persons  with whom he associated most closely or regarded as his best friends. The unit of analysis was the dyadic relationship of one farmer naming another rather than farmers as individuals. Results included the following: (1) there was a continued inclination for the proportion of opportunities to obtain farm information from fellow group members to persist at a much higher level than in the cross-group situations; (2) social cliques took the lead as a retaining influence in the low-importance relationships, dispossessing neighborhoods from this position; and (3) neighborhoods showed a marked tenacity of the retaining power.

Communication research in IEPE during the past 4 years has concentrated on mass media performance and use, because extension agents were ignoring mass media, though they were using personal communication techniques ingeniously. A study was conducted that controlled for literacy and education and then investigated the effect of mass media exposure. It was found that literacy affected media use more than education. A substantially larger percentage of the mass media users than non-users were high adopters of farm practices. Two research projects were conducted  concerning agricultural information received from radio, newspapers and magazines and the value of it. To study the potential role of newspapers, six relevant agricultural articles were sent to the newspapers in the state; it was concluded that newspapers are generally receptive to printing agricultural information when it is sent to them. Several readership, comprehension, and source credibility studies were conducted. A study of two infrastructural factors and the correlation between their restrictiveness and farmers' search for information supported the hypothesis that the amount of search for market and price information is inversely related to the restrictiveness of the market situation.

The community reconnaissance method was used in selecting and interviewing 117 positional-reputational leaders and in making demographic, historical, and current events sketches as background information for the study. To get a random sample of the views of DeKalb County's average citizens, a random sample was drawn from the registered voter list and 322 voters were interviewed. Included in the report are an introduction to a community social analysis, a history of DeKalb County, a descriptive analysis of the county's  social structure, and implications of the data for the seventies. A rank order of respondents' views of community needs and problems is appended, as well as a copy of the leader nomination questionnaire and interview schedule and a list of available resources.

A random sample of 60 producers of the population of 571 was personally interviewed. A profile of the average Macon County manufacturing milk producer was compiled, and statistics concerning the adoption of practices relating to breeding and herd replacement, record keeping and use, feeding and feed production, health and sanitation, and general management were compiled. A comparison of the average high and  low producer revealed that the former: (1) was slightly older; (2) was better known to the interviewer; (3) had about 39 percent greater income; (4) had considerably higher per cow butterfat and milk production averages for 1965; and (5) had 10 acres more cropland. A comparison of adoption practices showed that high producers had higher ratings on 17 of 23 practice studies and tended to feed a slightly higher protein ration and that fewer high producers had hay ground. &quot;The regular income&quot; was rated first by 88 percent among things liked about the occupation.

Data were collected through group interviews with 200 juniors and 70 seniors--116 boys and 154 girls. Identification of eating habits was sought related to breakfasts, snacking at school and at home, and drinking milk. The study also attempted to determine whether sex, age, place of residence, employment status of mother, and enrollment in the food-nutrition project affected food choices and eating habits of the interviewees. Results indicated that: (1) boys tended to have better eating habits than did girls; (2) senior members had slightly better  eating habits than did junior members; (3) farm residents had somewhat better eating habits than did rural non-farm and urban members; (4) no appreciable difference existed between the eating habits of interviewees whose mothers were employed outside the home and those whose mothers were full-time homemakers; and (5) members enrolled in the Extension 4-H food-nutrition project did not have noticeably different eating habits than those not enrolled, but members who had been enrolled for a longer period of time had slightly better eating habits than did those who had been enrolled for a shorter period of time.

A secondary purpose was to determine the association of agent effectiveness scores and knowledge scores with selected independent variables classified in four subgroups--agent background and training, agent interest and attitudes, county situation, and work-related factors. Data were collected from 41 agents. Effectiveness ratings were determined by supervisory personnel and dairy specialists. A multiple-choice test was used to measure dairying knowledge and related subject matter, and an interest and attitude scale gave other measures. Among the findings from the testing of hypotheses were:  (1) effectiveness ratings and knowledge test scores were inversely related to tenure; (2) more effective agents spent more time on group and mass media teaching methods and made more contacts with dairymen; and (3) more effective agents involved dairy specialists more frequently in their dairy educational work. Multiple correlations analysis indicated the most accurate predictors of effectiveness ratings and agent test scores. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"Taboo communication is examined in relation to its distinctive characteristics and its significance in inhibiting social change involving birth control in Asian and other countries. Taboo communication tends to occur between very high homophilous individuals, which poses problems for communications research. Research is inhibited when researchers are quite unlike the persons they are trying to communicate with. The high degree of homophily between individuals in taboo communication acts as a barrier to diffusion of taboo messages, which in turn perpetuates the taboo status of the topic. This homophily frustrates individuals seeking taboo information because the individuals sought are unlikely to have the information and because of the high degree of redundancy in homophilous  friendship networks. Taboo communication can be facilitated by encouraging widespread communication about the taboo message and by relabeling the taboo topic with different word-symbols. Problems involved in diffusion of family planning ideas are different from those involved in diffusion of ideas in other areas. Certain implicit assumptions in the diffusion model on which most Asian family planning programs are based do not recognize these differences. Family planning programs in Asia suggest two modifications in this model: (1) use of paraprofessional change agent aides--to over come the homophily barrier; and (2) payment of diffuser incentives to encourage communication about a taboo topic.

This hierarchy starts with the easiest (and least useful) type of evaluation and six progressively more difficult levels of evaluation are added in cumulative fashion. The seventh and final type is a master plan for evaluation, which should be accomplished by starting with the top steps and their interrelationships and working down. The evaluation types, with applicable questions for extension leader orientation, are: (1) inputs made--How much time and money are expended in leader orientation, and is this the right amount? (2) activities performed--What kinds of orientation activities are new leaders engaged in,  and are there the right number of activities? (3) recipients involved--With how many leaders do we allocate certain amounts of orientation time and activity? (4) reactions--How do volunteer leaders react to their orientation? (5) \"KAS\" change (change in knowledge, attitudes, and skills)--Which development are a consequence of orientation? (6) \"practice\" change--Do the attitudes, skills, and knowledge gained through orientation help the volunteer in working with 4-H participants? (7) results achieved--Do the volunteer roles help achieve ultimate aims with 4-H youth? Evaluation at the lower levels is meaningless without answers to higher evaluative questions. (KM)",

        "description":"This study was undertaken for the purpose of seeing how a health counseling program for overweight girls could be developed in a secondary high school setting. The study first reviews the health literature on obesity, surveys school nurse-teacher health counseling programs, and investigates relaxed community characteristics. The report on a six-month pilot health counseling program follows. It included a careful selection of 16 overweight girls and a control group. Nutritional education, retraining of eating habits, stimulation of diverse interests, and encouragement of physical activity formed the nucleus of the counseling sessions. The results of the study showed an overall weight loss of 224 pounds among the 16 counseled girls in contrast to a weight increase of the 16 pounds  among the 16 uncounseled group. An improvement in personal appearance, attitudinal realism about the weight problem, along with self-acceptance, were changes evident with the counseled group. The study shows that a thoroughly informed school nurse-teacher is in a strategic position to offer her expertise in assisting the student with a weight problem. (Author)",

        "description":"This workshop report focuses on the necessity of broadening the base of evaluation in higher education and beginning to look at types of student development other than purely academic: their characteristics, strengths, weaknesses, goals, values, motivations, and most effective learning styles. The need for non-standardized measures occurs in two contexts. First, in helping students plan their future there is frequently a need for appraisal of special talents or inclinations beyond those concerned with academic background or potential. Second, is trying to determine the effectiveness of a given program--such as counseling method, teaching approach, or orientation program--standardized measures are seldom appropriate indicators of success. The workshop provided some principles  underlying non-standardized appraisal techniques. The two principles essential for this individual, primarily non-academic appraisal are 1.) student self-appraisal, asking \"him\" what you want to know about \"him,\" and 2.) prediction of future behavior by past behavior which resembles the future behavior. Both principles, the workshop leader felt, suggest the need for awareness of, or determination of, the environment where for a given individual learning experiences have most likely occurred. Practical applications of these principles are included as examples from the workshop. References are included. (Author/SES)",

        "description":"The paper explores a behavioral paradox which occurs in everyday life: people try to make themselves different and stand out from others, but they also try to minimize their differences and be just like everyone else. The major hypothesis of the study states that people will work to individuate themselves when a positive event is forthcoming in the environment, but will work to deindividuate themselves in the face of an impending negative event. A second hypothesis, in which individuation is both the independent and the dependent variable, states that people who are already in a deindividuated state should have to work harder to make themselves stand out than people who already feel individuated, but should have to work less hard to make themselves anonymous. In contrast, people  who are in an individual state should show the reverse pattern. The study also explores the hypothesis that males and females would use different techniques to call attention to themselves, as a result of previously learned sex roles. Subjects for the experiments were 80 university undergraduates; results are analyzed statistically while the ensuing discussion examines the outcomes of the study as they underscore the complexity of the individuation process.

The author hypothesizes that males found to have high levels of self esteem will have favorable and positive attitudes toward women's liberation while men with low levels of self esteem will oppose the principles of the women's rights movement. Male subjects for the study were chosen from five different college settings; a sixth sample of a non-college population was also included in the study. Subjects were first administered the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, followed by the Women's Liberation Questionnaire (WLQ). Findings from the study in general support the author's hypothesis; however, males who attend large,  state, and non-religiously affiliated institutions were more approving of the principles of the women's liberation movement than those who attend small, religiously affiliated or private schools.

The current study introduces a personality variable, Machiavellianism, which can differentiate between the proposals of Kerckhoff and Davis and those made in other research and which is also essential to evaluation of the former's model. The subjects sampled were well established female college roommate pairs. Age, year in college, and  major field of study were used to determine similarity in social attributes. The Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Scale of Values and the College Student Questionnaire were selected in order to ascertain degree of value-consensus and also to assess accuracy of perception and assumed similarity. The Mach Scales were employed to indicate complementarity and to relate personality to perception data. Results are discussed in relation to the Kerckhoff and Davis formulation and to Machiavellianism. (Author/SES)",

Data were obtained from the parents on a self-administered medical history questionnaire and a more detailed supplemental medical history administered by a Survey field representative. From these data assessments were made of the extent of association among a number of behavioral variables: early behavior development, sleep-related behavior, eating habits and behavior, peer relationships, abnormal fears, behavioral traits (temper and tension), degree of responsibility in the home, and participation in organized activities in and outside of school. The relationships among these aspects of  children's behavior generally were of a low order of magnitude. However, some strong associations were found which reached statistical significance; where possible, comparisons were also made with findings from previous studies.

It is based on a reassessment of present public policies for dealing with youthful deviance, and on the development of new linkages between an understanding of what causes such activities and what can be done about them. The strategy itself focuses on institutional reform, without overlooking the importance of direct work with individuals and families. Provision of services to help prevent delinquency as well as rehabilitation of youth already in trouble with the law are stressed. The study points up the legitimate role which youth have to play and the fact that institutions must change to help provide those roles. The strategy further states that whenever  possible troubled youth should be diverted from the juvenile justice system and furnished aid through community-based programs. The publication summarizes principles that are offered as guides in establishing programs of youth development and delinquency prevention. (Author/SES)",

The experiment was conducted at the University of Tennessee with 20 female volunteers from undergraduate education courses serving as subjects and four male and female graduate students in counseling and guidance acting as experimenters. While subjects were instructed to talk about any topic of their own choosing during the 40 minute counseling interview, the counsel counselors followed timed light cues and changed their verbal styles to include reflection, probe, confrontation, and free style. Results show that the indiscriminate use of counselor behavior does not have reinforcing  effects on client verbal behavior; thus, training programs that enable the counselor to assess and evaluate his discriminations and their effects on client behavior need to be developed. Such programs would relate more to empirical evidence of client outcomes than to theoretical orientations and biases. (Author/SES)",

This point of view recognizes that the physical organism, the society, and the psychological organization of a person are all determinants of learning. While the slow, orderly unfolding of the organism determines in large measure the timing of the learning tasks which an organism is capable of at any given moment, the social groups to which a person belongs and the accumulated meanings which  together constitute a person's psychological organization are also major forces influencing the individual's learning and development.

Fourth grade high-IQ low achievers were used as subjects in the study, because the authors felt that while they would learn fast, they would not be as likely as high-IQ high achievers to have previously learned responses to expectancy conditions. The results of the experiment support the hypothesis that children can learn to behave differentially to different adult expectancies when the expectancies are followed by consistently different outcomes; thus the \"discriminative cue\" function proposed for expectancy conditions is supported. The study provides a valuable  model for an analysis of teacher behavior, implying that many kinds of teacher statements and non-verbal cues may potentially serve as discriminative cues for children. Used positively, such cues can increase responding and even bring about initial responses in new situations. (SES)",

The nature of these effects on clients has been found to depend on several client characteristics. While recording is not as inhibitory as clients expect it to be, counselors tend not to be sensitive to the inhibiting effects that do occur in their clients.

Specifically, the paper describes microcounseling, a videobased system of teaching counseling or psychotherapeutic skills to counselors, clinical psychologists, and medical students. In addition, the method has proven equally effective in training paraprofessional counselors, parents as peer drug counselors, teachers, and the general lay public. Microcounseling is seen as a systematic program which enables the helping process to be taught directly and explicitly. It is a scaled-down sample of counseling in which the counselor, therapist, or lay trainee talk with volunteer clients during brief five-minute sessions which are video recorded.  Microcounseling thus focuses on specific single skills and trainee learn quickly important aspects of the total helping process. Specific skills of microcounseling are outlined, illustrations of how methods may be used are presented, and implications of a teaching role for the professional psychotherapist are discussed.

The rationale for such evaluation is twofold. First, it provides a scientifically rigorous method of determining the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment or program, and secondly, these results can exercise a feedback into the system, modifying the clinical operations. The major types of evaluation studies are considered: intra-institutional studies, effect of relocation from one institution to another, alternative treatments upon admission to institutions, and alternatives to institutionalization. Further issues considered include contented vs. angry patients, patient deterioration, and covert deterioration which is less obvious to the  observer. It is considered that the best hope for the future is a comprehensive mental health system with many flexible alternatives, integration of community and institution, and continuity of care.

One such criteria deserving exploration is potential effectiveness as a practitioner in the helping professions. The author presents here the outline of an instrument he has constructed which measures an individual's discriminative ability in identifying human emotional states. It consists of 45 audio tape segments, each of which expresses an emotional state which a viewer is asked to identify. Extensive reliability and  validity procedures were performed and are reported. The author feels that the present instrument could be a positive step toward establishing greater compatibility between the selection criteria and the goals of the counselor education programs.

The personality concept applied here, internal vs. external control of reinforcement, has evolved out of Rotter's social learning theory; internals (I's) tend to feel that they control their own destiny while externals (E's) tend to see forces beyond their control as being factors which determine the occurrence of reinforcement. Female fourth, fifth, and sixth grade teachers were subjects for the experiment and were classified as internal or external on the basis of their scores on Rotter's (1966) I-E Scale. After observing a video-tape of a boy performing Crandall's (1963) angle-matching task in either an ascending or descending pattern, they evaluated him as to performance recall,  performance prediction, intellectual quotient, and academic achievement. Both internal and external teachers exhibited a primary effect on performance recall. The findings suggest that teachers may be influenced more by a student's initial performance than by more recent performance on his part. (Author/SES)",

Thus, two instruments were chosen; one the teachers would use to evaluate the children's changes in behavior (Walker, 1968-Walker Problem Behavior Identification Checklist) and a second an objective classroom observer would use to rate children's behavior (Spaulding, 1968-Coping Analysis Schedule for Educational Settings (CASES). The hypothesis that there would be no significant differences among Group  Counseling/Parent-Teacher Consultation, Group Counseling, Parent-Teacher Consultation, and Control Group Procedures was not accepted.

Results included: (1) presenting  examples and non-examples in a rational teaching set promoted correct classification of unencountered instances; (2) removal of negative instances from the rational teaching set resulted in significant overgeneralization; and (3) providing a concept definition with the rational set of 3 or 4 instances and 3 or 4 non-instances was not more effective in promoting concept learning than providing the rational set alone.

        "description":"This paper argues that there has been an overemphasis among reading and English teachers on the role of diagnosis, prescription, and testing for mastery of isolated skills. The result has been a short-term profit of increased scores on posttests, but a long-term sacrifice of students who are eager to read. The author suggests that the best method of teaching reading is to encourage children to trust their own responses to what they read. Rather than a managerial technique of reading instruction, an affective approach, stressing the importance of student reading motivation, is proposed. Reading should be taught as a kinetic experience--the teacher should not ask what a word or sentence means, but what it does. Reading, then, is a language sensitizing experience. Literature  teaching should emphasize the interrelations between life and literature; it should not regard a literary work as an object to be studied, but rather as a process to be experienced. The author concludes that in order to excite a student to perform more actively in his reading, teachers must encourage curiosity in the student, rather than overstressing his ability to make sophisticated judgments.

The students, who were one or more years below grade level in reading skills at the start of the project, made positive gains in vocabulary and comprehension; progress was from two to six times that which was expected based on previous achievement. Gains were measured by the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test. The project used 32 TV-like teaching machines housed in two mobile units servicing four schools. The objectives were to raise reading levels in comprehension and vocabulary by one year in 80 hours of instruction. Although students operated the machines and tested their own progress by themselves, a certified reading teacher and aide were available for  assistance. It was recommended that the project be continued, that only the comprehension section of the Gates-MacGinitie test be used for evaluating gains and that a controlled study be set up to investigate the effects of rewards on student achievement.

One hundred and ninety-two subjects were selected from among the third and sixth grade students attending nine public elementary schools. The subjects were asked to state the main idea of each of three paragraphs either accompanied or not accompanied by content relevant pictures. The various reading conditions were paragraphs alone, paragraphs and pictures with no direction to view the picture, paragraphs and pictures with minimum direction to view the picture, and paragraphs and pictures with maximum direction to view the  picture. The three paragraphs developed for each of the three main ideas were four sentences long. The results indicated: (1) the analysis of variance did not reveal significant differences between responses of boys and girls, irrespective of grade, or among the reading conditions; (2) the addition of a content relevant picture to a paragraph with or without direction to use it did not enhance either third or sixth graders' main idea statements; and (3) the simplification of the paragraphs did lead to higher scale ratings for both third and sixth graders.

The subjects were 23 residents of Maryland's principal institution for the retarded. They ranged in age from eleven to 51 years and in Stanford-Binet IQ from 33 to 72. Daily five-to-twenty-minute teaching sessions for one year resulted in all subjects being able to read at the third grade level as measured by the Spache readability formula. The Fuller Reading System consists of simplified alphabet learning based on the distinctive features of each letter; the most common phonic sound as the name for each letter; an auditory, visual, kinesthetic, and tactile approach; and action-oriented space  oddysseys as reading content. Dr. Fuller poses a number of questions about what intelligence is and the high positive correlation between IQ measures and predictability of school performance. The discussant, Dr. Sam Glucksberg, also questions the accepted relationship between measured intelligence and reading comprehension, citing prominent twentieth century research on several sides of the issue.

In repeated individual test sessions, 44 normal children in suburban primary school registered their listening preferences for either the natural soundtrack or an electronically processed unintelligible soundtrack accompanying selected segments of \"Sesame Street\" programs. Thirty-three of the children decisively rejected the unintelligible TV soundtracks. The remaining eleven children each spent as many as 30 minutes viewing TV programs with garbled, distorted soundtracks, although clear soundtracks were  easily available. Each of the nonselective listeners also showed patterns of mild to moderate language and reading dysfunction in the classroom. These data confirm other studies in suggesting that approximately 25 percent of presumed normal children manifest unrecognized anomalies of selective language listening. These results strongly suggest the importance of including systematic evaluation of speech-stream receptive language functioning in language and reading assessment. (Author/TO)",

Teachers can promote purposeful reading by providing suitable motives which students can discuss and weigh. Problem solving can eliminate teacher inspired purposes. The ability to grasp context clues and morphemic clues and to distinguish between literal and figurative meanings, and the study of multiple word meanings and the dictionary can help build better vocabulary skills. The ability to see relationships among ideas, to understand  paragraph and other organizational patterns, and to discover meanings and relationships by analyzing sentence patterns are important measures of comprehension the teacher can help students develop. Helping students discover inferential meanings involves thinking about other ideas the messages might convey. Finally, the student's ability to judge accuracy, distinguish between fact and opinion, recognize qualification, and perceive persuasion can be accomplished by studying information obtained from several sources.

English Review is a course which aids students whose deficiencies in English preclude their taking the regular freshman English courses. Instruction is individualized and students are required to write short themes and other expository prose essential for vocational goals or further studies. Notetaking, outlining, use of dictionaries, and test taking techniques are also taught. Developmental Reading is a course designed for adults who never completed their years of formal education. Work is given to increase skills in vocabulary, phonics, listening, reading comprehension, spelling, and written  expression. English as a second language is offered in both of these courses for those whose native language is not English. A special tutor works with these students so that a meaningful program is developed for their particular needs. Interpreters are provided to aid in lip reading, and classes are offered teaching sign language. The philosophy of the Hearing Impaired Program is to provide those services which allow the deaf student to compete on an equal basis with his hearing peer in an integrated classroom. (HS)",

The purpose of this paper is to provide a list of the disadvantages which may be inherent in the adoption of i.t.a. The disadvantages of i.t.a. may be divided into two categories, factual and attitudinal. Some factual disadvantages are that the weaknesses of students, teachers, and schools are revealed more when i.t.a. is used, and the damaging effects of arbitrary administrative systems of grouping students are highlighted by an i.t.a. program. A list of negative statements which are often made about i.t.a. includes: (1) i.t.a. makes more work for the teacher; (2) i.t.a. promoters  make exaggerated panacea kinds of claims; (3) i.t.a. materials are expensive; (4) i.t.a. is not a perfect alphabet; (5) i.t.a. is a phonic method; (6) i.t.a. is taught by a formal instructional approach; (7) i.t.a. is a scheme for forcing precocious readers; (8) i.t.a. is unnatural; (9) there are not enough books in i.t.a.; (10) children have difficulty in forming the i.t.a. symbols; and (11) transition from i.t.a. to traditional orthography is difficult and wastes time.

Oral responses were tape recorded, transcribed by graduate students trained in phonics, and coded as correct, plausible, or incorrect. Separate analyses of variance were run on each of the four pattern categories. Some of the results indicated that although ability to generalize each of the four patterns increased from second through sixth grade, there were striking differences in the acquisition of the patterns. At the second- and, to a lesser degree, the fourth-grade levels, there was  little difference in ability between the best and worst readers to generalize invariant consonant correspondences when the letters occurred in initial position, but large differences were evident for medial and final positions, with the poorer readers showing the least ability. For the \"c\" patterns, learning of the correct pronunciation for \"c\" before \"e,\"\"i,\" or \"y\" occurred slowly and failed to reach 60 percent by sixth grade. For the \"c\" pronounced as /s/ pattern the correct responses were high at all grades. (Author/WR)",

The results indicated that with picture pairs, pronunciation facilitated learning as a method of choice and a type of rehearsal in nursery school subjects. For fifth-grade and college subjects, there was no significant difference between pronouncing and pointing as a method of choice. Spoken rehearsal was superior to control performance for the fifth-grade subjects. College subjects performed equally well in the control and pronouncing conditions, but pointing during rehearsal produced significantly more errors than pronouncing. Word pairs produced  no significant pronunciation effects. The verbal stimuli tend to elicit implicit pronouncing responses sooner than the nonverbal stimuli.

Richard Hodges identifies the nature and sources of behavioral objectives as he examines assumptions related to goals of instruction, measurement, and the content and methodology of learning. Kenneth Goodman's paper on testing concerns reading tests, design problems in constructing reading tests, and abuses of tests. Advantages as well as  limitations and disadvantages of performance contracting are discussed by Mary Galvan.

The questionnaire was sent to randomly selected schools throughout the United States. It was found that (1) yearbook costs revealed no clear trend, except that most of the yearbooks surveyed were self-supporting; (2) most of the yearbooks contained paid advertising; (3) all the yearbooks contained pictures of seniors and a majority had pictures of all upperclassmen from grade ten; and (4) athletics, general, musical, and  club activities received about the same amount of coverage.

Each section of the guide begins with a position paper outlining the goals of that particular discipline and then presents a teaching or resource unit to accomplish these goals. The literature section offers a teaching unit in popular music as literature and a unit in the novel, \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" The rhetoric section has a resource  unit on writing a visual description of a person. The language section includes a resource unit on the varieties of English and an appendix entitled \"A Mature Attitude toward Usage.\" The reading section presents a resource unit on vocabulary.

Four assumptions about education, experience, reality, and value formation were identified to provide a fuller reference point for social science educators when they are viewing current standardized measurement practices within the social science: (1) that there are two kinds of existence and two kinds of experience and that current measurement does not encompass the full range of existence and experience; (2) that human action involves decision-making processes stemming from the total experience of an individual and that these predispositions to act do not necessarily stem from learnings within a discipline, but stem from the  values of individuals which have greater emotive effect; (3) that though a society may agree on universal goals and also agree upon the approach to the instruction necessary to bring about the desired goal, there is no assurance of the fulfillment of the goal; and (4) that implied in the process of education is a certain kind of relation--triadic (teacher, student, subject) that must be held constant in both time and location for universal criteria to be valid in measurement. The central theme of the paper suggests that if these four assumptions hold true, they greatly limit the possibility of measurement providing a universally applicable set of criteria for making value judgments in the social sciences.

The experimenter stopped the tape after each sentence containing a test item and asked the child to repeat the sentence.

It is synergistic in that (1) its activities require the involvement and complete interaction among students, professional educators, and parents; (2) it requires the interaction between technical and non-technical aspects of the evaluation; and (3) its activities include both goal-based evaluation (GBE) and goal-free evaluation (GFE).

        "description":"Bilingual education programs for Mexican-American preschool and elementary grade pupils almost invariably include some type of instruction in English as a second language (ESL). Usual ESL Programs for young Spanish-speaking children are found to emphasize pronunciation drill (minimal-a pair drills: pit-bit, choose-shoes). An alternative approach deemphasizes phonological drill, concentrating instead on teaching of word order of new language (syntactic structure). Results of several studies from bilingual projects in Lower Rio Grande Valley show that Experimental groups perform no better than Control (no formal ESL instruction) groups on Pronunciation, Vocabulary, and Communication scales of Michael Test of Oral English Language Production (MTOEP), but that Experimentals scored  significantly (.001) higher on Structure. Hypotheses advanced are that young children may benefit only slightly by repeated drills in pronunciation and vocabulary. Primary grade children learn pronunciation by modeling. (Author/CK)",

Model for the program was that of the State's ESEA Title III program with certain exceptions. The 19 projects selected were funded to conduct innovative programs in 13 different priority areas. They were designed to be carried out in elementary, junior and senior high schools, an entire LEA and in two regional centers which provided services for 10 or more LEAs. A review of the SEED program revealed a need for two separate evaluations and for information to identify possible weaknesses. It is concluded that the evaluation  design implemented clearly demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing a model of formative and summative evaluation in multiple-project programs. (CK)",

The aptitude selected for this study is sensory modality preferences. Three types of modality data were gathered: norm-referenced (Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities), criterion-referenced (Individual Achievement Monitoring system), and teacher ratings. Use of the modality data was made under two different interpretations: forced decisions and nonforced decisions. A total of 21 variables were generated under these two interpretative conditions. A Campbell-Fiske convergent-discriminant intercorrelation matrix was formed. The first major question asked of the data was whether the  commonly used, task-general ITPA modality assessments relate logically to the task-specific IAMS assessments. The second was whether the forced interpretation is compatible with the nonforced. (Author/CK)",

There were many startling and promising programs developed during that time such as Head Start. However, many of the measured rapid gains were quickly lost as programs were phased out or studies were completed. A close evaluation and assessment revealed that those programs having parental involvement sustained the child's measured gains and often improved upon them; thus, family-centered preventive mental health programs are to be the major focus for the 1970's. Society can begin to help both the child and the family by strengthening the family through  reform of welfare legislation, instituting procedures to encourage low income men and women to remain with families, establishing a guaranteed income, and providing family services and education. The family's eco-system can be studied and supportive forces such as the extended family, churches, social networks, and schools in the environment can be pinpointed and integrated in treatment plans. The challenge to families and those who care about families then is to increase the incidence of success and diminish the frequency of failure. A new \"Galilean\" approach to research must be taken in the 1970's. (Author/JM)",

The discussion focuses on three issues: (1) The study was conducted in such a way that performance contracting schools and the comparison schools were generally not comparable in terms of initial achievement, socioeconomic status, and a host of other demographic and social variables that may have influenced the results. Since the contractors were generally assigned to the schools with the lower achieving students, who also had lower S.E.S. and family income, the effect of the noncomparability of the comparison schools was to negatively bias the estimated effect of performance contracting. (2) The statistical adjustments used by Garfinkel and  Gramlich were inadequate to offset these biases. (3) The data base was open to a wide variety of potential biases that were not assessed; e.g., the testing conditions (at some schools) were terrible, the tests may have been highly speeded and thus not measuring reading and mathematics ability per se, and there was no control on the control group in that they may have been trying harder to outdo the experimentals.

How best to utilize Title IV grants for this purpose, however, has been the subject of continuing disagreement. From the beginning of the program, some officials have argued that local Title IV programs should focus on educational problems which may become visible in the process of desegregation. Other staff members have contended that the emphasis should be on desegregation per se and that local programs funded under Title IV should help build understanding across lines and improve interpersonal relations. In its  examination of Title IV, the Commission has concentrated its investigation on the Southern and border States where the bulk of Title IV funds have gone. The Commission also has investigated the operation of the program in New Mexico, where some program innovations have been undertaken which seemed to merit special consideration. In examining the role of Title IV as a facilitator of the desegregation process, the Commission has looked at programs developed by individual school districts, training institutes, and desegregation centers established in colleges and universities, and at Title IV units in State departments of education.

Additionally, almost all the tables appearing in the  source book are presented at the appropriate places amongst the abstracts in the bibliography. The articles in the book cited and abstracted in the bibliography cover such topics relating to disadvantagement in Israeli education as: cultural enrichment and religious education, changes in methods of teaching reading in grade 1, grouping procedures, pedagogical guidance, longer school days and extended school years, tutorial systems, research into the longer school day and extended school year, and research relating to the preparation of disadvantaged preschoolers for school.

Project Outreach will bring about a complete transformation of the present Sheridan Public Schools. By concentrating on meeting the total needs of all students, most specifically alienated youth who are potential dropouts and youth who have already rejected school, Project Outreach will demonstrate, develop, and disseminate a new system that will provide relevant and meaningful educational experiences. The third program year will place special focus on: integration of Project Outreach activities and concepts with the permanent school  system and personal capability development of administrators, School Board members, faculty, and community group members representing the entire school system. Students who possess a high potential for dropping out of school prior to graduation will be recruited by the Outreach Center. Students who have already dropped out will also be recruited. Parents will be counseled to obtain their cooperation and permission in such a placement. The Outreach Center program will expand its recreational and enrichment activities to include all Sheridan secondary school students. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In June 1969, The Rand Corporation was funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity to evaluate an experimental commuter program operated by the Los Angeles Women's Job Corps Center (LAWJCC). An earlier report has described the evaluation design [ED 052 372]. This report presents the results of the empirical analysis. In the interest of deriving useful evaluative information for program administrators within a reasonable period, short-term indicators of long-term outcomes must be used. This study examines the relative effectiveness of the commuter program in terms of three such short-term indicators: corpswomen's cognitive gains, changes in corpswomen's work-relevant attitudes, and the length of time that corpswomen remained in the Center. With respect to cognitive gains, the  main finding is that any influence of residence upon cognitive gain, as measured by changes in Job Corps Test and Stanford Achievement Test scores, is in a negative direction. Significantly positive increases in reading and mathematics, as measured by the tests, occur while women are at the LAWJCC. There was considerable evidence either that the accuracy of measurement of cognitive gain varies from one test to another, or that the tests measure different dimensions of progress. Resident corpswomen are substantially more likely to leave the Center within 90 days of entry than are commuter corpswomen. (Author/JM)",

The role taken by the researcher is that of participant-observer. The collection of field data entailed the following: (1) a written survey (questionnaire); (2) interviews and tape recordings, if and where possible; (3) an inspection and/or review of the \"Job Analysis Division\" as a description of each administrative position and requirements for these positions; and, (4) a search of personnel records in order to show career achievement and professional growth patterns. The data source was the total population of Black Male  School Administrators working in a large urban school system. All the black administrators were surveyed and interviewed. A search of personnel records was made to determine career achievement and professional growth patterns from educational beginning in the system to present. There were a total of 40 individuals in the study. Some of the problems uncovered by this study included that of identifying racial prejudice as opposed to normal job competition. Blacks compete among themselves for good jobs, as well as against whites, and whites, too, must compete against each other as well as blacks. (Author/JM)",

It is hypothesized that: (1) black principals are more apt to be employed in schools with a predominantly black student body rather than a school with a predominantly white student body; (2) significant other black administrators will have a higher expectation of black principals than the black principal may have of himself in areas of client orientation as it relates to advocacy, and initiative as it relates to creativity in role; and, (3) influential blacks and other active black community persons will have a higher expectation of black principals than the black principal may have of himself in areas  of client orientation as it relates to advocacy, and initiative as it relates to creativity in role. Records of a large urban school system pertinent to the school years September 1954 through August 1972, were collected and utilized for purposes of this study. A stratified sample was obtained to test adequately the hypotheses by choosing respondents from three relatively discrete populations within the total school community: principals, administrators subordinate to the principal, and influential and active community persons.

Vanguard, the instructional model which has emerged from this reality testing, effectively coordinates three proven techniques within a highly structured context. First, Vanguard stresses individual diagnosis and continuous progress learning based on demonstrated mastery. Second, Vanguard makes systematic use of incentives. Third, student tutors are used as an integral part of the in-school instructional function, in contrast to more common remedial tutorial programs. Although Vanguard methods have  been applied at all levels ranging from preschool to college, and with student populations from disadvantaged to affluent, the focus of this paper is on preschool efforts. To date, a total of six projects have been carried out in three different locations designed for extremely disadvantaged preschool populations. The reading readiness programs at the Marlin Neighborhood Center, Marlin, Texas, provide a good example. In November 1971, 29 five year old children were enrolled in a demonstration project. The specific behavioral goal was to raise their scores on the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Test. This goal was abundantly realized. (Author/JM)",

In the public schools, the students &quot;identified&quot; for the purpose of participating in the Title  I program were those in the first, second, third and seventh grades, whose test scores on the Fall 1971 citywide tests placed them at or below the fiftieth percentile of the D.C. school students in these grades in either reading total or mathematics total grade equivalent score; or, in the case of the first grade, in the reading readiness percentile rank. In the eight nonpublic schools, identified students were selected from only those students in grades one through eight who lived within the attendance areas of public Title I schools and who fell below the citywide median in their test scores in reading or mathematics.

For elementary pupils, test results in both reading and arithmetic showed gains slightly improved over 1970-71. Significant gains were found for pupils in Preschool and English as a Second Language programs. Activities in parent involvement and intergroup relations were expanded at both elementary and secondary levels. An encouraging upward trend was found in achievement scores for secondary students when three-year data were plotted. Secondary students who do remain  in the ESEA program three consecutive years can be expected to make about twice as much progress as comparable students who are not in ESEA reading and arithmetic. Through the use of the Resource Room, augmented instructional services were provided to more than 1000 public and nonpublic school pupils enrolled in Special Programs for the Handicapped. The Follow the Child Program involved transporting more than 500 Title I eligible pupils to non-Title I schools for the year. Children in nonpublic school ESEA programs were scheduled for remedial help in reading and arithmetic. (Author/JM)",

The program presently consists of four units of approximately 200 students (chosen by lottery from throughout the city), ten teachers, ten to 12 interns, and a Unit Head and administrative assistant housed in four separate non-school locations around the city. The students attend classes in: (1) conventional subject matter areas, the bulk of which are taught by the Parkway teachers, and which usually take place in sites around the city contributed by agencies and institutions, and (2) subject fields not ordinarily available to high school students, offered by volunteers (many from institutions) whose courses are monitored by Parkway staff. To provide intellectual and  interpersonal coherence to the program and to offer counseling and basic skill development to all students; Parkway offers a period each day called tutorial. This report poses as the central question: Is Parkway a justifiable public enterprise despite its weaknesses? The program is justified in terms of its goal as seen through the eyes of its major constituencies, in terms of its student body's academic achievement, attendance and attitudes, and in terms of a perspective for viewing the program as part of the public school's commitment to meet the educational needs of all children.

A full discussion of our reading of the relevant research would be too lengthy and technical for the non-specialist. We must limit ourselves to outlining and discussing briefly our principal disagreements with Armor, which center on four major points. First, his article begins by establishing unrealistically high standards by which to judge the success of school desegregation. Second, the article presents selected findings from selected studies as &quot;the evidence on busing.&quot; The bias is twofold. The few studies  mentioned constitute an incomplete list and are selectively negative in results. Only cursory descriptions are provided of the few investigations that are reviewed. Third, the paper's anti-busing conclusions rest primarily on the findings from one short-term study conducted by Armor himself: an evaluation of a voluntary busing program in metropolitan Boston. This study is probably the weakest reported in the paper. Fourth, objections must be raised to the basic assumptions about racial change that undergird the entire article. The whole national context of individual and institutional racism is conveniently ignored. [For David Armor's reply, see UD 013 499.] (Author/JM)",

The essential requirement for sound reasoning on this matter is observance of the distinction among the findings of science, the results of policy, and the dictates of law or morality. I studied the results of existing policies of induced school integration (all of which used, out of necessity, varying amounts of busing). I was not studying the scientific issue of what might happen under various conditions (other than those in effect in the programs studied), nor the legal question of whether it should have happened according to various constitutional interpretations. My task was far simpler. I asked only the question: What has happened? My critics have confused the &quot;has&quot; with the &quot;might&quot; and the&quot;should.&quot; This confusion is further compounded by their application of two double standards for the evaluation and use of the evidence on busing. I am accused of having too severe standards and unrealistic expectations about the benefits of induced school integration. But I did not formulate these standards and expectations. They come from the programs themselves, buttressed by several noteworthy studies. I would like to see more voluntary busing on a controlled, experimental basis accompanied by a careful research and evaluation effort. This is the only responsible way to resolve the busing controversy and to establish sound guidelines for policy makers. [For the article by Thomas Pettigrew, see UD 013 498.] (Author/JM)",

The first part is an &quot;overview&quot; discussing such topics as the lack of commitment to the disadvantaged, making desegregation work, opposition to busing, and public opinion. There follow six chapters: Chapter 1, &quot;Where Educators Stand,&quot; discusses the way professional and lay educators have swung behind desegregation as others have attacked, abandoned, or belittled it. Chapter two, &quot;Ten Rules: How to Begin,&quot; provides some guidelines for the majority of school administrators, board members, and teachers who wish to try to make desegregation work with regard to forming alliances supporting desegregation. Chapter three, &quot;Womanpower at Work: The League of Women Voters,&quot; describes how to utilize this group in the promotion of school  desegregation. Chapter four, &quot;Implementing Desegregation,&quot; traces the pattern which emerges from the experience of United States Office of Education and the experiences of some desegregating or desegregated school districts.

        "description":"This monograph provides a format for teaching about busing, either to prospective teachers or to students, on all levels of the educational process. A model is developed that can be used by students themselves in the development of methods of improving human relations and studying problems of democracy and American life. The model presented here is that of a game that has been formulated to study the implications and effects of a busing policy. It involves a definition of the actors (those people who participate in the decisions), the rules by which these people may interact, the objective parameters (the \"facts\") that \"set the stage\" for the interactions and the attitude parameters (the \"emotions\"), that govern the people's feelings. Hopefully the effect of \"The Busing Game\"  will be to explain the reasoning behind the formulations of the parameters so as to facilitate the use of this tool in teaching and learning. Originally the model was done as a project for a \"Foundations of Education\" class in which the instructor stated that if the students were to give presentations, the presentations should be fun and involve everyone in the class. This forced the author to look into the busing question, and the social decision-making process as a whole, to examine the parameters, both objective and subjective, and to determine the roles and attitudes of the players in such a drama.

Section I gives an overview of Title I and its comparability provision. Section II shows how to read and analyze the reports (called &quot;comparability reports&quot;) which school districts must prepare to show whether the educational services provided with non-federal funds in Title I schools are comparable to those provided in non-Title I schools. Section III describes the types of errors that a school district may have made in its comparability report and the general procedure to be followed to check for such errors. The data sources used for this check  are explained in an appendix. Section IV is a brief summary of the legal requirements of Title I arranged in the order in which they would be considered by a school district that was developing a Title I project. A draft of a model complaint for enforcing comparability in Federal court and legal memoranda on certain issues that may arise in the course of litigation are included. Appendices include: selected U. S. code provisions related to the enforcement of comparability; requirements in code of federal regulations; Title I program guide number 44; United States Office of Education draft manual on comparability (Fall 1970); and, brief for the U.

Its purpose was to select and document a variety of programs including Head Start, Follow Through, elementary and secondary programs in inner city schools, programs for Spanish-Speaking, and programs in basic skills and vocational areas for initial dissemination through the six Regional and National White House Conferences. In addition it was planned that OEO and OE could use the print and nonprint materials developed by the project for independent  dissemination efforts. The exemplary reading programs phase of the project involved the field assessment of selected programs related to reading instruction and the verification of their effectiveness as demonstration sites for visits by personnel from other school districts. Program descriptions and leaflets were prepared for the 37 reading programs and 34 childhood education programs. Audio-visual documentation was prepared for 12 childhood education programs. This project was one in a series directed toward the wider dissemination of new and innovative practices in education, and was funded by the Office of Information Dissemination of OE. (Author/JM)",

In June, 1970, Mrs. Lily Fleming, a young black woman was assigned by the New York Life Insurance Company to serve as a full-time project associate in the Brandeis High School partnership program sponsored by the Economic Development Council (EDC) of New York City. Soon after arriving at Brandeis, she undertook the task of trying to improve the health of students at Brandeis. A conference of the Social Studies Department on November 8, 1971 gave impetus to the idea of a health project, and the minutes recommended that EDC and the school work together to start a health program. The first of a series of planning meetings was held in December, with representation from school departments, EDC, and the Department of Health of New York.  The date set for the Health Fair was the week of April 17, which gave the planning group five months to put together the whole program, including plans for follow-up procedures after the Fair. The decision was made to devote three days to the testing of students in Grades ten through 12 in the main building and two days for testing the ninth grade in the Annex. This turned out to be an appropriate decision, since the number of students who took tests in the ninth grade was as large as the total number of students tested in the other three grades combined.

The Urban Institute and the Atlanta schools are attempting to demonstrate a technique for grouping schools on the basis of their student composition, comparing performance among similar schools, and then using the results in planning new programs and in assessing and restructuring existing educational activities. The method involves a means of identifying groups of schools which serve similar student populations and in which performance is therefore expected, a priori, to be similar. These groupings provide the framework for comparing relative performance, both within a single group and  among groups, as a means of determining what is happening in a large complex school system. The technique focuses on outputs--on the changes that are occurring as a result of exposure to the educational process. The classification technique focuses on the school as the unit of observation, since it, rather than the pupil or the project, is the basic administrative unit in a local school system. Finally the classification techniques relies primarily on data which is already at a central location in the school system. (Author/JM)",

The use of these techniques and the evaluation of the results of these techniques constituted the Accelerated Learning Experiment. The research design called for study groups of 50 each in three different cities, using the education system and materials developed for the Job Corps Conservation Centers. Measures of academic achievement of enrollees were taken at the beginning of the program and again after three and six months. Bi-weekly reports on each student and program progress were prepared by the instructors. The three cities selected for the Accelerated Learning Experiment were: St. Louis, Missouri; Cincinnati, Ohio;  and, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Each of the sites was provided with the criteria for an &quot;ideal&quot; experiment, and arrangements were worked out in each city for the most feasible programs in relation to local problems and conditions. Teachers from all three cities were brought together in Pittsburgh in early February, 1968, and were trained by a Job Corps staff member in the use of the Job Corps materials. During the course of the Experiment, educational consultants visited the classrooms periodically to assist teachers with any problems that they had encountered. (Author/JM)",

The Corrective Reading Services  Program was developed to provide elementary and secondary school students with three basic activities in small group settings: (a) verbal discussions geared to develop and enrich a basic meaning vocabulary; (b) word analysis activities geared to develop independence in decoding; and, (c) guided and independent reading activities geared to develop ability to comprehend written materials.

It began on the assumption that children in slum area schools could benefit from tutorial assistance administered by other students from similar demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. As initially realized in the 1962-63 school year, the program consisted of tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade students who were to serve as tutors to pupils in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades who were working below grade level. During the following years the program was extended horizontally in order to include subjects aside from reading,  and vertically to include junior high school students as well as senior high school students. At the high school level, centers were established at both academic and vocational high schools. In 1970-71 there were 48 high schools in the program; and approximately 800 college and high school students provided tutorial assistance to over 6000 high school students. The operation of the Homework Helper centers is the responsibility of a Master Teacher who sees to it that every student who requests individual help is able to get it either from a qualified tutor or from the teacher himself.

A secondary objective was to examine any differences which might exist between inner-city and suburban children in the attainment of spelling skills. A third purpose was to measure the growth in spelling achievement from pretest to posttest for all subjects. Three spelling strategies were used as treatments: (1) teacher constructed strategy; (2) Kottmeyer strategy, involving a series of eight grade level workbooks which sequentially present the phonetic and structural characteristics of words; and, (3) Hanna strategy, which assumes that the phoneme-Grapheme  correspondence can produce reliable spelling generalizations. Two hundred and sixteen graders served as subjects. Half of the subjects came from an inner city elementary school with an ethnic composition of 88 percent Negro and 12 percent Korean and Japanese. The other 108 subjects came from a suburban elementary school which draws from a middle to upper-middle class Jewish and Caucasian community. A pretest-posttest design was employed. There were 36 subjects in each group. There was an equal number of boys and girls in each group. (Author/JM)",

In all, some 4000 different studies are examined to develop an overview of the communication environment of the urban poor. No more than 200 had some relevance to poverty-communication; only some 30 studies were directly related to the issue, and most of these were research products of the last four or five years. The work available provides an adequate baseline picture of the communication behaviors of the poor and shows surprising agreement on findings. In addition, this document includes original findings from a recent large-scale study of the communication behaviors of low-income black adults. The study, conducted by  Greenberg, Dervin, and Bowes consisted of interviews with 366 low-income black adults in Cleveland. This study provides the most comprehensive evidence available on the use of information sources by the poor. The use of sources for information was approached from two perspectives. The first asked respondents what sources they had used for help or information in any area in the past. The second asked respondents to name potential sources in ten hypothetical problem areas. This review documents the fact that there is now a sizeable body of evidence available describing the communication behaviors of the poor, and demonstrates that these differ from those of the middle class.

The research described here was directed toward an attribution theory analysis of academic achievement of Negroes. The purpose of the research was to systematically observe and evaluate causal factors in determining academic performance among subjects varying in social class and race. In the first study, attributions to the four factors of ability, effort, task difficulty, and luck were examined in order to determine their effects on feelings of pride-shame and subsequent action. The second  study focused on the basic premise of the present research, i.e., there are racial and/or social class differences in how success and failure are interpreted. One hundred and twenty Grade Five children were selected as subjects from three schools in a school district with a population which was heterogeneous in both social class and racial background. In the third study, self-reward was used as a nonverbal indicant of the extent to which internal attributions are being made. Ninety-six fourth and fifth graders were tested. They were divided into six groups of 16 subjects each on the basis of sex, race, and socioeconomic status. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"A promising measure of learning ability has emerged from extensive research on schema theory: the Schematic Concept Formation (SCF) Test. Experimental evidence has already demonstrated substantial individual differences in SCF performance for third and fourth graders and college students. Because SCF depends on the learning of relatively unfamiliar patterns rather than upon measurement of previous learning, it might be utilized to tap a few of the more important cognitive abilities in ways not presently available. A measure of SCF ability which could be shown to be substantially unrelated to cultural background or educational level, and which had some power to predict learning ability, would be socially relevant and extremely useful in both educational and industrial settings. In  order to assess the potential utility in this context, two studies were conducted, a pilot study and a main study. The purpose of the pilot study was primarily to refine the SCF test for subsequent use; the purpose of the main study was to determine the predictive power of the test in a remedial training program. The results indicate that SCF test does have some potential utility as a measure of cognitive aptitude in disadvantaged students, where such aptitudes are defined as aptitudes bearing on success in a remedial training program.

The research project examined the attitudes of ABC students in the areas of aspirations, fate-control (the degree to which they felt they were guiding their own destiny), self-concept, racial relations, and relationships to home. It also assessed their academic performance during high school and college, and their post-college activities. During the time they were enrolled in member schools, the attitudes of ABC students underwent some changes. Two areas in which the attitude changes of ABC students differed from the control group were the self-esteem and  racial beliefs. One thousand nine hundred and sixteen ABC students (1,640 in independent schools and 276 in Public School Programs) were scheduled to complete secondary school by June, 1972. ABC students attended colleges much more selective than the national average, but the control group attended colleges similar in selectivity to the national average. Of the 1916 students scheduled to graduate by June 1972, the program had the net effect of increasing the proportion who entered college by 32 percent and increasing the selectivity of the college entered among nearly half the others.

The Academy services approximately 500 high school students who have dropped out or are about to drop out of Benjamin Franklin School and other high schools in the adjacent local areas. The age range is 16 to 21 years, and the grade range is nine to 12. The Academy also services approximately 300 out-of-school youths from neighboring parochial schools in the East Harlem community. The Academy services students who have been referred by high school guidance staff, student advisors, and social service  agencies. Through an extension program, the student advisor services are also available to students at Benjamin Franklin High School. The services of the program fall into one of three categories: East Side Cluster Service, summer enrichment, and educational. The latter is divided into phases. Phase I is essentially oriented toward motivating dropouts who want to continue their education. Phase II is academically structured. The East Side Cluster Program provides assistance to potential dropouts by offering direct counseling when sought, tutorial assistance to students who seek such aid, a recreation program, and a personal counseling and employment service to dropouts.

One aspect of the design, on an indepth level, was based on a descriptive analysis of the ethnic studies programs in a sample of schools throughout the State. The data for this analysis was collected by personal interview with school staff members. Another aspect of the design, on a broader level, was based on a comparison of the components of ethnic studies program from a larger number of schools throughout the State. The data for this comparison was collected by a mailed questionnaire. Two instruments were developed: The first was a questionnaire which was administered in an interview. The purpose of  the interview was to identify such major factors as historical and environmental perspective, program description, program objectives, population to be served, method, techniques and activities, available instructional resources, staff and personnel, and community involvement. The second instrument was a shorter version of the interview questionnaire. This was a precoded, short-answer questionnaire which was mailed to a representative number of randomly selected schools. A special check list describing ethnic studies programs was developed as a part of this questionnaire. One hundred schools were selected to be personally interviewed and 400 to receive the mailed questionnaire. (Author/JM)",

Nothing touches the lives of the disadvantaged more than the constant struggle to stretch limited financial resources to meet the increasing costs of living. This module is designed in the hope that it will help the poor to make better use of their income, as well as with the expectation that those of higher income will be more understanding of the problems of their fellow citizens. The first seven  modules in the series are: consumer issues and action; education and the consumer; the consumer and recreation; consumer problems of the poor; the consumer and his health dollar; beauty products and the consumer; and, the consumer and transportation. It is expected that another module will be produced in the field of The Consumer and His Tax Dollar. Each of the nine modules may be used as a discrete unit or with other units in the series. The nine modules may be presented as a semester or part of a semester course, or presented in conjunction with the original syllabus. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The Youth Tutoring Youth program, funded under Title I of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act, was directed toward attitude and ability change of underachieving high school and elementary school pupils. It also attempted to effect a change in basic language study skills of these students by using the Youth Tutoring Youth (YTY) model which is currently being implemented extensively throughout the United States. Basic to the YTY model is the employment (for financial remuneration) of underachieving high school pupils in the capacity of tutors to underachieving elementary school pupils. Early reports of the National Commission of Resources for Youth, Incorporated (the national coordinating agency for YTY) indicated that both the tutor and the tutee gained valuable reading  skills as a result of experience with the YTY program, noting that some tutors have gained as much as three years in reading skills over a period of one semester. More importantly, however, it is the feeling of having helped another student that seems to prove most beneficial. Owing in large part to a short project interval, few positive data changes were noted among the participants. For this reason, in addition to other more intuitive reasons, it is suggested that this project be lengthened, with the preservice training beginning perhaps as early as the spring quarter of the regular school year.

This type of program entailed the hiring of the following staff: (1) lead teachers, who performed varied duties in relation to improving the reading instructional program; (2) educational aides, who were assigned to schools on the basis of enrollment; and, (3) social workers, who were primarily involved in activities to improve attendance. The Comprehensive Instructional Program (CIP) was directed toward improving achievement in reading and, for the first time this year, also in mathematics. Through the CIP, each school was encouraged to develop behaviorally stated objectives directed at improving the reading  and mathematics instruction. The Follow Through Project was designed for disadvantaged pupils. Follow Through made use of the Interdependent Learning Model, a games approach to learning. The project utilized a specialized method of teaching phonics skills, and offered special instruction in music, art, speech, and inactive communication. In addition, medical and dental care and psychological guidance was offered to all eligible pupils. The performance of the Follow Through pupils was evaluated on the basis of the Follow Through Phonics Skills Test, the Metropolitan Readiness Tests, the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, the Self Appraisal Inventory, and the Test of Attitudes of Children.

Included in the scope of the study are social insurance programs, income-in-kind programs, public assistance, and other income supplement programs. The report focuses particularly on cases in which persons receive benefits under more than one program and examines the issues which are raised by receipt of multiple benefits. The fact that some persons receive benefits under several programs generally results from their availing themselves of benefits to which they are entitled, and it does not imply wrongdoing. However, the consequences of combined benefits, in some instances, may not be those that policymakers desired in establishing the programs individually; that is, the  combined impact on recipients and nonrecipients alike may be quite different from the effects anticipated for individual programs. Because of the high degree of overlap of beneficiaries among the various programs, the policy implications of the interactions of these programs deserve greater scrutiny. Chief among the issues raised are the following: work incentives; family stability; administrative error; differential treatment based on personal characteristics; program inefficiency; and, administrative complexity. This report's findings suggest that these issues are critical and real. (Author/JM)",

The findings of the Harvard professor rejected a sacred cow--that there is any correlation between one's education and income. Meeting at Teachers College, Columbia University recently for the expressed purpose of examining Jencks' study were four educators: Gertrude S. Goldberg and Nicolaus Mills, Scholars in Residence at ERIC/IRCD, and Joseph Grannis and David Wilder, Professors of Education at Teachers College. Goldberg examines two basic questions: whether Jencks has shown that school reform is a poor strategy for reducing economic inequality and how, if not as an anti-poverty measure, equal educational opportunity is to be justified. Mills  maintains that although we can agree with Jencks in some respects, utimately this book extraordinarily misleading, in terms of what it suggests and in terms of what it cites as evidence. Wilder states that his chief problem with the book is that the focus of research is not on how one might improve schools or education but rather on how we can use the schools to do what he does not think they are supposed to be doing: namely, improving the distribution of economic rewards in our society. Grannis points out that the book does not address the vital questions: What part might the schools play in the reconstruction of society? Dare the schools build a new social order? (Author/JM)",

For minorities, the home usually means housing vacated by whites, who, because of their race as well as ability to pay, are able to acquire a more desirable dwelling elsewhere. Congress, in 1968, incorporated fair housing legislation into the Nation's body of civil rights law. Yet between 1960 and 1970 residential segregation actually increased. That the housing laws have not had an impact on reversing the patterns of segregated housing underscores the complexity of the denial of equal housing opportunity to minority groups. Like other social problems that have deep roots in history, fair housing cannot be understood without  housing and residential segregation involve a variety of issues. Many of these are legal in nature, involving the scope of protection against housing discrimination afforded by our laws and Constitution. Others involve fundamental questions of the relationship between Government and the people and how to strike the proper balance between protection of the rights of home seekers and those of property owners. Still others involve practical questions such as the effect of racial integration on property values and the relative importance of economics and discrimination as factors that determine where people live.

Centering on the development of individual university-based teams through the involvement of selected leaders in a series of national conferences, the April 1972 conference for deans of colleges of education and an accompanying May conference for professors of educational administration are described. Pre- and post-conference evaluations were collected from 134 professors and 75 deans concerning the conference planning and its impact. Representing a diversity of universities in terms of size and funding base, the program participants generally rated the pre-conference planning as more than  adequate. Almost 70 percent of the participants agreed that career education is a viable alternative for the American education system and should involve all faculty members of universities in implementing the concept. Numerous tables present the data, and recommendations for further conferences are included. Resource materials are available in a related document, available as ED 064 498 in a previous issue. (AG)",

        "description":"In this study, which focused on the influence of leaders in bureaucratic structures on the opinions of staff members, 45 staff members in each of two state divisions of vocational and technical education responded to a questionnaire soliciting nominations to determine opinion leaders. In addition, personal interviews were conducted with selected members of the staffs. Sociometric analysis was used to compute scores for opinion leadership and to determine the shape of the communications cluster associated with selected information requests. The most important finding was the highly significant relationship between the opinion leadership and the formal authority structure in each division. With one exception, all opinion leaders were either state directors, associate directors, or  head state supervisors. Opinion leaders and isolates alike tended to be oriented to change. No differences in the extensiveness of communication nets were found between opinion leaders and isolates on profession-relevant information or general vocational and technical information. Sources of profession-relevant information were no more diverse than sources of work-relevant information. This communication pattern tended to place the director and his close associates in a gatekeeping role for activities pursued by supervisory staff. (Author/SB)",

A flexible curriculum was developed to offer courses not available elsewhere and to enable students to perform at varying levels, terminating at different points in any of the courses. A new report card was designed to report student progress based on individual achievement, allowing a student to compare his growth with his own past performance. Evaluation of the Center during its first year was limited to collecting information on teacher, student, and parent attitudes about various aspects of the program. Attitudes concerning the new forms  for reporting student progress showed that the new system was generally well-received by students and parents but that teachers were still opposed to the process, although not the concept. No final study of student progress was prepared due to several record deficiencies. More than three-fourths of the students indicated positive feelings toward classes, career values, and the Center. However, most of the educational clusters had attrition rates higher than 50 percent of the enrollment. Study findings are detailed in the report, with recommendations for improvements in the Center's programs. (MF)",

Program effectiveness can be enhanced by means of interagency coordination. In order to unite the Federal, State, and local services resulting from Federal vocational legislation, local coordinators, administrators, and other leaders in education must assume responsibility for developing coordination systems and techniques. Supportive services include guidance and counseling, identification of potential students, job placement and followup, and other activities which meet the needs of vocational education students. A conceptual framework for a supportive services coordination model contains four sequential steps: (1) determining clientele needs, (2) determining what  supportive services are available, (3) matching of services to needs, and (4) assessing the overall processes and outcomes in order to improve the procedures and objectives used.

The subjects used were those seniors from the five high schools who were interested in one of the vocational technical programs offered at the college, recent graduates of the college, and currently enrolled sophomores. A number of instruments such as the School and College Aptitude Test (SCAT), the Otis-Lennon J., Advanced Level Test, and College Qualification Test (CQT) were administered to participants in order to obtain generalizable results. Findings indicated that the CQT was the more accurate of the three tests in predicting grade point  average, therefore predictive models based on the principle inherent in the CAT were developed for both the technical and vocational skill areas. The models include a percentile range on chances in 100 of earning the quality point average, giving rise to the expectation that applicants who are admitted as students can be expected to earn a &quot;B&quot; or &quot;A&quot; in more cases than previously were seen.

Based on the results of the interviews and the review of materials assembled, the concept of integration of Navy careers into career education was deemed feasible, and recommendations were formulated pertaining to: (1) development of career guidance materials describing occupations and career development opportunities in the Navy, (2) Navy support of career education curriculum, and (3) establishment of linkages between the Navy and agencies involved in career education.

To achieve the objectives, project personnel, secondary business teachers, and an advisory group: (1) established a hierarchically arranged clustering of the office occupations, (2) identified job functions and tasks, (3) performed detailed task and skill analyses, (4) developed instructional objectives for all the job tasks, (5) constructed skill/competency matrices, and (6) established entry-level performance standards for the various jobs. The resulting performance-oriented model was devised to permit any  student to prepare for entry level employment, it provides for continuous feedback, individualization of instruction, skill mastery, and inclusion of students as the instructional medium. Seven of the 15 job-instructional packets, developed in conjunction with the model, were pilot tested with 35 high school students. Comparisons of the performance of 35 experimental subjects with 35 control subjects indicated that the experimental subjects had statistically significant superior job knowledge and job performance. A detailed plan for implementation and evaluation is included in this report. (Author/SB)",

Members of the University of California San Francisco Medical Center went into residence in 14 communities in Northern California and Nevada for periods of three days. Choice of specialities and the programing were developed by the local community in close liaison with the University and related to specific areas of current interest and needs. Although final evaluation has not yet taken place, many achievements can be identified in the field of patient care and development of facilities, and there has been a real expansion of continuing education for the practicing physician. New community development and community-university relationships of great potential  value have resulted from the program. An unexpected result of the program was that it provided medical school faculty with the opportunity to observe practice and problems in ways not otherwise available, pointing up the importance of continuing education and the leadership role to be assumed. The Physicians-in-Residence Program suggests that manpower projections must be community-based, tied to work function and serving delivery systems. Cooperative regional arrangements would maximize resources and improve services. (MF)",

Conclusions from the project experience show that temporarily laid-off workers (the primary target group) will not enroll. The program attracted relatively young and inexperienced workers on indefinite or permanent layoff. The target group perceived no job-related benefits in such training, because in most industries worker advancement and promotional systems are negotiated through the  collective bargaining process which ensures advancement on the basis of seniority. Employers response to the JAT concept was minimal as they could not perceive any area of self-interest. Findings suggest that application of such a program would be of potential benefit only in industries where internal labor market practices are not ridigly tied to a worker's seniority. (MF)",

In addition, a survey of the opinions of officials in 93 technical institutes in the regions served by two regional accrediting agencies was conducted. Based on the relative frequency of comments in accreditation evaluation team reports, technical institutes appeared to have common weaknesses in complying with accreditation requirements, including: (1) inadequate library holdings, (2) inadequate or limited physical facilities, (3) excessive teaching loads, and (4) failure to develop, clearly define, and adhere to formal policies and procedures within the institution. The  survey of technical institute officials revealed that the officials generally felt that regional accrediting agencies did not fully understand the philosophy, purposes, and operational characteristics of the institutes. Major challenges identified by the institute officials included: (1) reconciling conflicting expectations between accrediting agencies and other agencies, (2) successfully developing appropriate physical facilities, student activities, and faculty and student loads, and (3) developing effective criteria and procedures for faculty and staff evaluation and promotion.

Meetings were held with aides monthly, and written reports of the meetings were sent to the teachers. This input resulted in teachers' formulations of performance objectives and completion of goal statement questionnaires. Findings include: (1) There is a need for preparing the professional to work with the paraprofessional, (2) Many of the aides encounter difficulty with educational terms, indicating perhaps that  handbooks which contain defined terms should be developed, and (3) Because many of the aides encounter problems such as physical or psychological difficulties, family problems, unwanted pregnancies, divorces, car breakdowns, and impoverished backgrounds, the teacher's attitudes and the curriculum itself may need modification.

        "description":"This is an interim report for the period January 1, 1972 through December 31, 1972 of a project designed to develop a comprehensive program of vocational education in a rural school system located in an economically depressed area. The exemplary project design provided for four major areas: (1) career awareness in grades 1-6, (2) career orientation in grades 7-8, (3) career exploration and exposure in grades 9-10, and (4) career preparation, including guidance and skill development, in grades 11-12, with expansion of vocational education offerings to out-of-school youth. Program evaluation, utilizing pretesting and posttesting of the occupational knowledge of project and non-project students, provided evidence that the process of systematically receiving meaningful career  education experiences produces a positive effect on language achievement, mathematics achievement, and occupational awareness. Recommendations made as a result of observations of the project include a need for more inservice training for teachers in correlating existing disciplines with occupational studies. Students should be able to enter any occupational study through any one of the existing disciplines. Related documents, available in this issue, are VT 019 877-VT 019 879. (MF)",

Data were collected and analyzed for performance and attitude profile variables for 1,321 Center students and 9,121 high school juniors in the six school districts served by the Center. The primary factor identified to account for the success of the guidance program was the use of the Performance Profile data in assigning students to instructional programs.

Detailed responses are presented in tabular and narrative form. Seventy-five percent of the responding companies stated that they would be interested in hiring the graduates of the 2-year associate degree program. However, many firms indicated that a positive attitude was more important than technical training and that they would hire the graduates because of their demonstrated interest in the  insurance business rather than because of what they had learned at school. Some firms stated that they look for persons with a liberal arts background and do the training themselves. Fifty-seven percent of the respondents felt that a liberal arts graduate was preferred to the business graduate. As a result of the survey, it was recommended that a salesmanship course be added to the curriculum, as most insurance jobs involve some sort of selling.

Findings derived from the data include: (1) At present, there exists no immediate employment placement locally for 2-year trained environmental technicians, therefore it would not be feasible to institute such a program in this vicinity, and (2) The environmental technology topics most often offered were Introduction to Environmental Technology, Disease Prevention Technology, Pollution Prevention and  Control Technology, Resources Conservation Technology, and miscellaneous courses.

The questionnaire was mailed to a panel of experts consisting of 100 North Dakota secondary vocational teachers, teacher educators, and field practitioners who were asked to respond to the importance of the items in their vocational fields. Responses from each of the 100 panel members were rank-ordered by project  personnel into those items considered most essential, useful, and least essential. The highest ranked items related to personal characteristics of the worker and dealt with attitudes of the worker rather than job skills. Items viewed as useful pertained to the economic system, worker's benefits, and types of business. The commonalities identified could serve as a basis for curriculum development or for a prevocational course.

Therefore, the initial and continuing priority in career education should focus on the student. It also necessitates career preparation for all students. The emphasis, however, should be shifted from job training to student self-awareness, and career choice is a by-product of self-awareness. In restructuring education to develop student self-awareness, five objectives have been identified and include: (1) recognition and articulation of individual differences and similarities, (2) recognition of changes in self and society, (3) decision-making based on critical thinking, (4) thrust for continued learning, and (5)  constructive and satisfying use of leisure time. Concomitant with these objectives are the recognition of readiness, maturation, interest, and student participation in pre- and post-planning. Therefore, there must be transfer of potential achievement of these objectives to subsequent developmental stages to ensure the continued achievement of self-awareness throughout life. (Author/SB)",

Newly formed nations, the rural population of which formerly maintained a subsistence agriculture with limited industry, found it essential to establish a better-balanced economy. This led to a variety of rural services and institutions, including agricultural extension service. Although the basic principles have evolved mostly in the more advanced countries, much of the material included in this publication was prepared by experts working in the developing countries and found to be effective there. Contents include sections on the meaning of extension, extension programs, extension teaching, extension administration and operation, international cooperation  and relations, and a bibliography. The primary audience to which this publication is directed is the professional field extension worker and supporting staff of specialists and administrators responsible for the effective operation of extension work in each country. Personnel in departments of extension education may also find it of value in the preservice training of future extension workers. In addition, government officials responsible for national economic and social policy may obtain a clearer understanding of the role of agricultural extension in national development. (MF)",

Findings include: (1) More tobacco and \"other field crop\" farmers hired seasonal workers on a direct basis than any other farmers, (2) As many as 84 percent of the fruit farms and nearly two-thirds of the vegetable farms used seasonal workers, although less than 40 percent contracted to obtain them, (3) Cash  grain and livestock farmers were least likely to use seasonal workers, but when they did, they often used contract labor, (4) Most farmers in the three southern regions preferred the direct-hire method over contracting, whereas in the midcontinent, contracting was often used, and (5) Hiring practices and hours of seasonal labor varied by size of farm.

Each unit contains developmental objectives, behavioral objectives, activities, and sample lesson. Developmental objectives have been written for the seven broad areas of career development: individual and environment, world of work, self, economics, education and training, employability and work adjustment, and vocational decision-making. The last three areas are for Grades 5-6. Behavioral objectives are written in three main areas to form taxonomies of behavior: cognitive domain, affective domain, and  psychomotor domain. Activity levels (experiencing, simulation, vicarious) are integrated into the curriculum in stages. The final outcome of career development activities should be the integration of career education into the total curriculum of the school. Sample lessons drawn from those found successful in elementary school classrooms are suggested for each developmental objective unit. (MF)",

A major outcome of the workshop was the establishment of a professional association, Professional Rehabilitation Workers with the Adult Deaf. The workshop was organized around six topics: (1) case finding and referral, (2) preliminary case survey, (3) case study, (4) vocational rehabilitation diagnosis, (5) planning goals and services, training and higher education, and (6) provision of services and counseling. Papers presented on each of these topics, with commentaries and discussion summaries, are included in the report. Most of the workshop participants were rehabilitation counselors who  specialized in work with deaf clients, and most of the State vocational rehabilitation agencies were represented. Appended are the bylaws of the professional association, counselor training programs, and a listing of workshop participants. The document is a reissue of the original report, as it continues to be in heavy demand as the main basic guide for effective vocational rehabilitation services to one of the most severly handicapped groups.

        "description":"To analyze the directions of change in health-related employment in Ohio over the next decade in order to provide limited guidelines for the development of education and training programs in the allied health field, an examination was made of health manpower data derived from the 1950-1970 U.S. Censuses. The examination revealed that the health manpower stock has grown at a very rapid rate over the past 20 years and is projected to increase at an even faster pace over the coming decade. The growth in health-related employment has occurred in those job functions generally requiring less education and training than those occupations traditionally identified with the health care field, e.g., the physician. These allied health manpower functions have been expanding at three to four  times the annual rate of growth of highly-trained core practitioners. Several educational policy implications resulting from this and other trends include: (1) Educational resources must expand to operate the training system needed to meet the demand for trained manpower, (2) Greater attention must be accorded health-related education, which implies a shift away from university-level programs to secondary and junior college programs, and (3) There will be increasing need for coordinating the entire health training system.

The driver education curriculum is intended to achieve numerous, sometimes diverse goals. In addition to the obvious short-range goal of a competent motor vehicle operator, another important long-range objective is that of responsible citizenship, both in relation to traffic and in the larger societal setting. The nature of high school driver education has changed over the years, particularly in the laboratory portion of the course, as evidenced by use of simulation and multiple-car method. Financial support of high school driver education has, over the  years, shifted from almost exclusive reliance on local tax dollars to some type of special state aid. Whatever the future may hold for high school driver education, it is important for educators to work toward instructional improvement through examining issues and problems relating to: (1) legal authority, (2) organization and administration, (3) teacher selection, preparation, and licensure, (4) curriculum and instruction, (5) facilities and equipment, (6) financing, (7) evaluation, research, and development, and (8) public support.

Program evaluation was accomplished at the end of the school year by administering achievement tests and a comprehensive examination to students in an experimental group and a control group. In addition to the tests, students completed a questionnaire at the end of the first and second semesters, and parents responded to the questionnaire near the end of the school year. Comparisons of experimental and control group test results revealed that experimental students achieved significantly higher  scores on the post-test achievement tests than similar controls at the seventh and eighth grade levels, but there was no difference at the ninth grade level. An item analysis also revealed that experimental students tended to score higher, but there were many important concepts not mastered by the experimental group. Results from the questionnaire plus a supervisor's report and budget information are included in this publication. (SB)",

The preschool and elementary curriculum considers: (1) safety in transportation, home, and schools, (2) information on drugs, alcohol, and smoking, and (3) safety concepts for seasonal activities. The secondary curriculum covers material on: (1) driver and traffic safety, including motorcycles, (2) emergency and evacuation procedures, (3) safety concepts for various school shops and classrooms, (4) home and recreation safety, and (5) drugs, narcotics, and  alcohol.

More than half of the students routinely dropped out in the tenth grade, leading to the decision to start the program at that level in an effort to hold potential dropouts by stimulating their interest in health-care occupations. The key to the demonstrated success of this effort was getting the students into hospitals the first week of school for orientation to the institutions, gradually working into &quot;real life&quot; task performance in the hospital environment. Academic credit was given by the school for the work experience, and as an incentive to participate a stipend of fifteen dollars a week was paid from project funds to each student involved in the work  experience phase of the program. As the program starts its third year, most of the students have been placed in part-time hospital jobs, where their training will continue. In every instance they will leave high school with salable skills qualifying them for at least an entry level hospital job or for college credit for work already accomplished. Reactions to and ratings of the program by the hospitals, the students, their parents, and the project director were all generally quite favorable. Recommendations for improvements are included in the report. A related document is available as ED 064 474. (MF)",

Findings from the 7-state regional survey were presented during a 4-day regional correctional administrators institute, which was designed to propose a tentative model of correctional  industries and solicit participant reaction toward the research findings. The proposed model: (1) locates the position of industries in the total correctional system, (2) focuses upon the correctional industries process as a subset of the total correctional system, (3) examines inmate progression through correctional industries by length of sentence, (4) suggests wage levels for three types of work, (5) presents a 10-year projection of the external factors affecting correctional industries, and (6) suggests the correctional industries functional mix over time. Charts illustrating the model are included in the discussion. (SB)",

The evaluation model is in the form of a computer printout by individual vocational programs and by each function within a program. The model offers an unbiased view of a vocational program as it is actually functioning, notes recommended courses of action for areas of weakness, and provides an accurate job market analysis. Appendixes contain data  collection forms, detail procedures for gathering population needs data and job market analyses, the computer programs, and sample evaluation printouts. The system's function and integrity were verified using segmented dummy data and actual data from one high school.

Summarized in this document are the outcomes of attempts to construct an analytic framework within which both the ghetto labor market and the appropriateness of CEP can be assessed. Part One contains a critique of the existing assumptions underlying the CEP and suggests some alternative models of the behavior of ghetto labor markets. Part Two describes the Boston CEP as it was developed from April 1967 to March 1968 and appraises it within the framework established for the basic CEP model. Conclusions and policy recommendations based on  analyzed results include: (1) Current programs have paid too little attention to the effect which low-wage, low-quality employment has upon the labor market behavior of the disadvantaged, and (2) Federal manpower policies need to be reoriented toward the demand side of the labor market.

Findings seem to suggest that people have some set preferences in terms of their work, which are not easily changed once they reach maturity.

Further, people should be advised to seek jobs which are compatible with their predispositions or at least to avoid those in which they are likely to be uncomfortable. (Author/SN)",

The concept of \"manpower\" has emphasized the training and placement of the disadvantaged. But a comprehensive manpower program must focus on the employment problems of individuals at all levels of occupational structure. Two critical aspects of the manpower problems of scientific and engineering personnel are their present substantial unemployment and the long-range equation of supply of and demand for educated manpower, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The welfare of the nation rests more heavily on the relatively small numbers of professional personnel, particularly scientists and engineers, than on any other  occupational group. The effective development and utilization of talent and competence represent a challenge to the nation equal in importance to providing training and employment opportunities for the disadvantaged, and the federal government bears responsibility for both. The document presents policy directions to make the development, conservation, and utilization of scientific and engineering talent an integral part of a comprehensive national manpower policy.

Chapters Three and Four define the basic reading skills and give examples of activities for learning these skills, examples for the teacher to build upon. Chapter Five, on measurement of reading performance, concerns ways to determine the skills a student has, the skills he needs to learn, and ways of implementing a diagnostic teaching-learning program. Chapter Six looks at students as individuals and as group members in order to help the teacher organize his students for most  effective learning. Chapter Seven concerns evaluation of personal growth, materials, and the overall program. A list of supplementary reading is provided at the end of each chapter.

        "description":"An English as a Second Language (ESL) project was conducted for parents of Mexican-American students in the Florence-Firestone neighborhood of Los Angeles. The major part of the curriculum was built on home-school communication to allow parents to learn the language of the school setting. Other objectives were to establish more effective dialogue between home, school and community and to encourage involvement in PTA, School Board and other public meetings. A bilingual counselor explained counseling services available for parents and students. Twenty-nine teachers offered morning and evening ESL classes for two academic years. Child care was available for day classes. Bilingual teacher aides were used. Seventy special lessons in home-school-community communication skills were  developed, stressing the audiolingual approach. Community and city resources were widely used. Project accomplishments have been positive, as evidenced in: (1) the high attendance of Mexican-American parents at parent and civic meetings; (2) group orientations and individual counseling; (3) the numerous social and cultural activities held on school sites; (4) student surveys showing that ESL lessons were instrumental in creating a better understanding of the school system; and (5) the positive opinion of the project held by parents, community leaders, and school personnel. The special lessons are provided. (KM)",

Usable responses to the six-page questionnaire for clientele totaled 391. A shorter questionnaire was used to determine the feelings of agents on specialization. Findings included: (1) the shift to area agent specialization has created slight problems in contacting agents; (2) 5 percent were dissatisfied with programs, 35 percent were satisfied, and 60 percent  were neutral; (3) nearly all were in favor of working with youth groups other than 4-H; (4) 50 percent were in agreement with agent specialization--not considered a mandate in favor of the change; (5) people want a part in deciding program direction; and (6) role ambiguity and value conflict among agents as a result of agent specialization is widespread.

Specifically, both groups were compared in personal characteristics, satisfaction regarding in-class instruction, satisfaction regarding on-farm instruction, and relevance of program to student's needs. Mail questionnaires were sent to a random sample of everyone enrolled for at least one year since 1967; returns totaled 75 for dropouts and 195 for continuing students. It was concluded that: (1) dropouts were generally older and more established in farming--they were interested less in developing problem-solving abilities than in acquiring the most recent technological information; (2) respondents generally were satisfied with  their instructors' teaching abilities; (3) general agreement existed that feeds and feeding, crop production, soils and fertilizers, and farm records should receive the most emphasis; (4) respondents were generally satisfied with the administration of the in-class instructional program; (5) more respondents placed greater emphasis on the on-farm instructional part than on the in-class part; and (6) two-thirds or more in each group indicated their needs were almost or completely met by these programs; reasons for dropping out were primarily of a personal nature.

Individual competencies in the following were stressed: adult teaching and learning, cultural awareness and pride in heritage, and the subject areas of math, reading, social studies, and language arts.  During an extension period, 16 consultant visits and/or workshops were conducted. Such topics as ESL, recruitment, motivation, curriculum, materials, consumer education, teaching techniques, and proposal writing were discussed.

This is an outgrowth of three interview studies in which information about factors influential in enlistment and reenlistment decision was elicited. Interviewee samples included men who were at various stages of considering enlistment in the Navy, as well as personnel in three shortage ratings at four points in their first enlistment. Key influences affecting enlistment decisions are explored. On the positive side, these include job training and educational opportunities, financial benefits, travel opportunities and support from peers. On the other side, associated with lack of interest in the Navy, are factors such as perceived loss of freedom, and incompatible job and  educational goals. With personnel now in service, the latter factors were further explored in the context of actual experience. Perceived benefits of training and job satisfaction were associated with positive reenlistment intentions, and loss of freedom and unmet expectations were linked to separation intentions. On the basis of these interview data, a longitudinal model of career motivation is described and key points that may be susceptible to administrative intervention are cited. A set of suggestions from administrative experiments and possible means for implementing indicated changes aiming to enhance career motivation are then offered. (Author)",

There is much evidence that society is not measuring up in helping all youth become useful, well-informed, self-reliant, socially responsible people. The Cooperative Extension Service's youth programs will increase the productivity of over one million adults as they become inspired, more technically competent, and satisfied by programs of systematic training followed by work with young people. One of the greatest deterrents to poverty, the program is designed to assist disadvantaged rural and urban youth--to reach the most deprived and bring them into the mainstream of society. It will employ over 20,000 adults and teenagers and  give them the inspiration and training to move into full-time employment and to move up the career ladder as far as their capabilities and desires permit. The implementation of this proposal can allow the land-grant university to extend its knowledge source and bring it to bear on the important needs of all youth--those who do not go on to college as well as those who do.

The analysis, drawn from a 1966 nationwide survey, included 35 campgrounds, 18 fishing areas, 14 vacation farms, 10 hunting areas, and 9 riding stables. In general, the kinds and qualities of facilities found in this survey have limited potential for expansion to meet increasing urban needs for outdoor recreation. Most of these recreation enterprises were small, family-operated, and supplemented other major income sources. Capital investment specifically for recreation usually was small and often was undistinguishable from that of the overall farm.  A minimum of facilities and services usually was provided. Relatively isolated locations and managerial disinterest in expansion helped keep these enterprises small. Occasional exceptions demonstrated that supplemental enterprises providing larger incomes can be established when favorable conditions exist. But managerial interest and capabilities often are major limitations. (Author/KM)",

        "description":"The confluence of three major forces has given a new significance to nonformal education for the developing countries--denied educational opportunities and resource constraints, questions about the relevance of formal education, and growing awareness of the importance of lifelong education. The absence of inadequacies of concepts and priorities of rural development are a fundamental impediment to the progress of nonformal education because they should set the context for education, help define the educational tasks, and provide the criteria for assessing educational performance. Signs of progress in overcoming this obstacle are indicated in that economists and development planners have become disillusioned with the relentless pursuit of the growth of GNP and are making the  elimination of problems of poverty one of the goals of development. Educational obstacles to the progress of nonformal education include: the narrowness of the concept of education; fragmentation of organization and program; resource problems; problems of knowledge, techniques, and capabilities; and the responsibilities of international agencies. Major features of the new learning system, if continued progress is made, will be: wider distribution of education and structural flexibility, freedom of education from lock-steps of levels and grades, enlargement of educational resources, shared responsibilities between schools and employing agencies for occupational preparation, and local variations and flexibility.

Most of the governmentally sponsored educational activities now classified as NFE are conducted by organizations other than the Ministry of Education. The extensive experience of missionary and other private organizations and the more recent experience of the agricultural development programs need to be analyzed for the guidance of the expanded NFE program. Examination of programs designed to promote development in rural areas has demonstrated the learning abilities and adaptability of illiterate persons and the usefulness of rural leaders. Linkages between formal and  nonformal education are currently very limited and must be greatly strengthened to meet NFE objectives. The approaches and programs for literacy training must be thoroughly evaluated before additional resources are allocated to it. Operational research should be built into NFE planning and activities to provide data for decision-makers. The Sector Review was successful partly because it was comprehensive and realistic. (KM)",

        "description":"Nonformal education, though unsystematized, is of at least equal importance with formal schooling in developing countries. Nonformal education can be classified as follows: (1) activities oriented primarily to development of the employed manpower; (2) activities designed to facilitate access to employment; and (3) activities not specifically related to labor force participation. Their contribution to national development is far-reaching. In some cases, non-formal education is the only practical means of skill and knowledge development; in others, it offers an alternative, and often a more effective one, to education and training than formal schooling; in most cases, it can supplement, extend, and improve the processes of formal education. The formulation of a strategy for  development of non-formal education is no easy task. An initial step would be to identify the principal target groups, to specify the actual and possible roles of both formal and non-formal education in their development, to evaluate alternatives, and to select \"leverage points\" where more concentrated efforts would have the highest payoffs. The costeffectiveness of these efforts should be objectively analyzed by systematic tracing of the employment and career pathways of persons who have participated in the various programs.

Data were secured by group interviews from 237 Home Demonstration Club members representing 24 clubs. The data were classified according to the members use of consumer credit: those who were using consumer credit and those who were not. Of the group, 162 were using some form of consumer credit. Twenty-two variables were identified and used as a basis of comparison. Contingency tables were used to show the relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Chi square values were accepted as statistically significant at the .05 level. Use of loans by the members was found to be significantly related to the  following personal and/or family characteristics: age of respondents, marital status, place of residence, having one or more children, total number of children living at home, occupation of husband, total family income, use of credit cards, number of items purchased on credit, and feelings concerning overuse of credit. Characteristics not significantly related to members' use of consumer credit were: number of years as HDC member, level of education, and frequency of family income. Implications and recommendations are made. (Author/DB)",

The purpose of this study was to obtain a basic word list, based on oral vocabulary of adult black illiterates in two urban centers, which could subsequently be used to develop basic education reading materials, reading tests, and a readability formula. A sample of 263,727 words was obtained from interviews with 128 Negro informants enrolled in ABE classes, representing a subset of the total spoken vocabulary that can be used by the population. The resulting word list was examined for the effect of geographic area (Buffalo and Chicago), age and sex of informants, and race and sex of interviewer. A group of ten informants was also interviewed a second time to determine effect of  change in stimulus questions. Chi-square tests were used on the one thousand most frequently used words; for the five variables tested, no significant differences were found (.01 level). The effect of change in stimulus was significant, with differences occurring in words of lesser frequency. However, the vocabulary list based on 128 interviews is considered a valid list for the population sampled and can be used for production of ABE materials. (Author)",

        "description":"Results are reported of a study made in Washington State to (1) discover educational constraints of the elderly, (2) identify the scope of educational opportunities and planning by community colleges, and (3) assess on-going programs. Questionnaires and interviews were utilized to obtain opinions of and data about urban and rural elderly citizens concerning their education and educational expectations. In addition, questionnaires were used to collect data from 22 community colleges, and 8 community college administrators were interviewed. The results of the study were compared with a pilot program conducted by Edmonds Community College at two senior centers. From the results of the study, it is concluded that: (1) while the educational needs of the elderly are as diverse as those  of other age groups, the intensity of those needs is considerably dimished; (2) older persons share a common need to reevaluate what contributive channels remain open to them; (3) older persons who attend a multipurpose senior center on a regular basis place high values upon the center's activities in which they play a contributing role; and (4) courses which require a minimal tuition charge (e.g., one dollar per credit hour) are valued higher than those for which there is no charge. The study also shows that the choice by administrators of courses thought to be popular with the elderly is quite different from those expressed by the elderly.

Study results identified such predictive variables as attendance record, citizenship average, academic GPA, as well as teacher's estimate of the  pupil's feeling toward authority, assumption of responsibility, playground behavior, and perception of abstract concepts.

        "description":"The paper presents a model of counseling outcomes which distinguishes between within-interview change and extra-interview change in order to identify and study the counselor behaviors which constitute strategies or techniques. The author feels that research must: 1.) assess the relative productivity of these behaviors within-strategies in terms of client change within the counseling setting and 2.) clarify how these within-interview outcomes may be used by the client as tools or strategies with which he can operate upon his environment. Another salient feature of this research is its implication for the training of counselors, bringing into focus the relationship between the counselor's behavior and the outcomes of counseling. The author stresses the continuing challenge of  relating specific counselor behaviors to the client's improved functioning in his environment. References are included. (Author/SES)",

The study also investigated the relationship between children's occupational knowledge and their attitudes toward occupations. One-hundred and forty-eight inner-city ghetto children in grades four, five, and six were administered pre- and post-tests to measure their occupational attitudes and knowledge before and after exposure to an occupational unit. Data suggest that the unit made a significant impact on the children, although the greatest mean gains were seen in the scores of fourth grade subjects. Findings also show that occupational knowledge was related significantly to two selected attitude  subtests: accuracy of vocational perceptions, level of occupational choice and future occupational choice level.

The keynote address suggested ways in which the professional counselor could personalize occupational freedom for women. For instance, providing a community learning center would encourage the emergence of vocational evaluation in people at their own pace. The speaker employed tape excerpts to analyze the importance of self-concept and self-study to vocational development. She stresses the experiencing of process rather than of content as the key to vocational exploration. Included are the comments of a panel of reactors consisting of a female attorney, housewife, female engineering student, female personnel manager, and a male professor. The  proceedings included remarks from the question and answer session following the reactors. (Author/LAA)",

The study also reviews the literature regarding the results of differentiated instruction for different characteristics of learners, commonly referred to as aptitude-treatment interaction (ATI). The major hypothesis of the study which expected a significant interaction between methods of presenting the free recall learning task and the conceptual  tempo of the learner was not confirmed, due to the lack of sufficient uniqueness in the three treatments to elicit differentiated effects of reflective and impulsive subjects.

Anxiety management training (AMTO has been developed to overcome some of the deficiencies of desensitization approaches. Through the use of instructions and cues to arouse anxiety responses and the training of clients to develop competing responses such as relaxation, success, or competency, AMT provides the individual with a method for self-control appropriate to any anxiety provoking situation. Forty undergraduates referred by counseling centers participated in a study to assess the effectiveness of AMT. AMT was found to be effective in reducing both generalized and public speaking anxiety. A second paper presents the considerations  involved in setting up a desensitization program in a counseling center. Areas covered include preparatory procedures, assessment of need, announcement of services, program operation, and follow-up and evaluation. (Author/LAA)",

The problem is particularly acute for students of the working class or minority groups. This study investigated whether there are differences among city high schools, differentiated according to racial composition, in what is classified as relevant or irrelevant in the educational program, and to identify and explain these differences. Forced choice Q-sorts related to the student's social-personal and academic development were used. The findings indicate that there were differences in the relevance of education, depending upon the racial composition of the school. In many instances, aspects of the  educational program which were categorized as relevant for students in one school were categorized as irrelevant for students in another school having a different racial composition. Further, the identical items were sometimes considered irrelevant for different schools for entirely different reasons. (Author/LAA)",

Since behavior modification techniques focus on behavior and since most offenses involve observable behavior, these techniques are remarkably well-suited for integration into the criminal justice system. The author describes the major behavior modification techniques of classical and operant conditioning, aversive suppression, and electronic monitoring and intervention and discusses significant research related to these techniques. In examining the legal regulation of offenders, he notes the inconsistent and vague statutory standards among the States, the poorly defined administrative standards, and the need for judicial intervention to protect the  offender's rights covered in provisions on cruel and unusual punishment, due process, equal protection, and privacy.

Sex and social deviance was factorially combined in two experimental conditions requiring cooperation. The study demonstrated that whether a \"minority group\" effect is produced with sex as a variable depends upon the nature of the experimental task. When \"femaleness\" and \"social deviance\" were factorially combined and the same experimental manipulations utilized, social deviants were uniformly discriminated against while females were favored in one case and treated negatively in the other.

Mothers of 441 fifth graders were interviewed about independence training of their child, personal qualities attractive in a child, and relative importance of various job factors. These data were analyzed in relation to the child's I.Q. and achievement test scores and to socio-economic status of the father. The authors conclude that: 1.) results are similar in terms of how parental attitudes and expectations in reference either to over- and under-achievement or to absolute  achievement; 2.) parents of over-achievers differ from parents of under-achievers in the relative importance they attach to various personal qualities and job factors; 3.) a modest relationship exists between independence training and school achievement; and 4.) two factors concerning initiative and the child's purchase of his own goods jointly determine independence training.

Results indicate that the divergent student is not considered less appealing than his convergent peer in the classroom; in fact, the diverger distinguishes himself by participating more often and offering more original ideas. In terms of the teachers, classroom climate appears to be highly dependent on their cognitive styles.

The following five areas of decision making were studied: student curricula, student-faculty relationships, student governance, student discipline and grievance, and student records. The motives of capability, improving education and school, and personal power associated with school control were analyzed, in addition to the socio-psychological characteristics of race, credal values, and alienation. The findings include: (1) high  school students desire some involvement in decision making, and (2) there is no difference between white and non-white high school students relative to desired involvement in areas of decision making.

Each of these skill areas is described in detail, behavioral objectives are stated, and procedures for class time--including cognitive input, demonstration, practice, and summary--are outlined. These class meetings are designed as training and practice sessions and not as lectures, discussions, or therapy.

The author points to the black females who have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the service professions to which they have historically been admitted and who at the same time have begun to examine seriously the mores which have labelled them intellectually inferior because of their sex. Perceptions of her own ability and professional potential create under tensions when they conflict with the self-image imposed upon her by a white, male dominated society. The author feels  that educators, counselors, and others can make significant strides in reducing and eliminating special problems of black women by setting new priorities and goals and by being aware of biases which do exist.

An immediate aim of the program was expansion of existant school guidance services by substituting classroom for counseling office as therapeutic milieu. After six months, the students assumed active leadership of their classes, set their own academic and counseling goals and developed a contract with the administration for earning graduation. The positive results of this study support the current movement within the guidance profession toward greater counselor involvement in the total educational process. The author feels that the generalizability of the  Collaborative-Consultant role to a non-insular school setting and to working practitioners may have practical implications for school counselors and may suggest a possible avenue for expansion of guidance services within the school.

To implement the concept of evaluation, the counselor must identify his goals, specify the objectives, and determine ways to evaluate accomplishment of his goals and objectives. The important evaluative criterion in the procedure is the translation of the goals into behavioral terms. First, the counselor must identify areas that the guidance program must serve. The major areas are educational, social, and vocational. Within these areas, the services provided include counseling, evaluation, follow-up, group guidance, information, orientation, personal data, placement, referral, and research. Finally, the counselor must identify specific guidance  objectives which state what the counselor or client must do to accomplish the task and must describe the specific criteria for measurement of achievement of the objectives.

        "description":"This essay discusses why the theme approach to the teaching of literature to elementary school students is an effective way to focus attention on concepts related to pupils' lives. The author argues that this approach is better than organizing children's literature according to either subject or type because the teacher can more easily guide his students toward the goals of critical thinking. While various students may read different books (depending on their reading level and interests), the class as a whole can meaningfully share ideas focusing on one theme. The author asserts that teachers often become preoccupied with the problems of word recognition and literal comprehension and consequently fail to raise the level of comprehension or to encourage interpretation, evaluation,  and application of ideas gained from reading. A theme approach to literature may serve to personalize the reading experience and to develop critical thinking. (Author/DI)",

The author argues that a number of studies have been concerned with viewing pupil-teacher interaction during instruction, but few have focused on this interaction during the teaching and learning of specific language arts lessons. There is a need for establishing relationships between interaction and pupil success. The author praises a recent study by Frizzi, utilizing and interrelating Mitzel's three classifications for criteria of teaching effectiveness (product--measure of student growth; process--social interaction of pupils and teachers; presage--such predictors as teacher traits and successes on paper and pencil tests, etc.). It is concluded that observation of specific teacher-student  interactions during specific types of language arts lessons with some measure of achievement administered may be more useful for viewing teacher effectiveness in the language arts than vague evaluations undertaken in the past.

The subjects were 65 undergraduate students from two introductory educational psychology courses. Three factors were investigated: questioning procedure, instructions, and scales. Two question positions were investigated: (1) subjects answered questions just before relevant text portions, and (2) subjects answered those same questions after reading the relevant text portions. Instructions to subjects were of two types: Part, which indicated that the inserted questions were only a part of the questions which would appear on the  criterion test, and Total, in which subjects were instructed that the inserted questions represented the total information they were expected to learn. Some of the results indicated: no differences were observed on practiced items; Dunnett's test revealed that the control group exceeded the experimental group on non-practiced items; and the control group was fastest on practice retention.

Rolland Callaway begins with the idea that the teaching of reading must be looked at in terms of educational policy or politics. Jack E. Williams follows with a semihistorical orientation which traces social class, ethnic, and racial biases on achievement. James B. Macdonald continues with a broad view of the impact of technology upon culture and specifically that of television upon reading. Wayne Berridge looks specifically at the reading establishment as a social phenomenon. Modifying this theme, Will Roy focuses upon the nature of school bureaucracy and how it may impinge upon reading achievement. John A. Zahorik discusses social factors in the classroom, particularly the general climate and  teacher-pupil interactions, and their effect upon reading tasks. Alex Molnar completes the monograph with a broader look at the problem of values, suggesting that reading must be seen outside the context of technical problems where the concomitant teaching of values is put into focus. Macdonald offers a brief introduction and a short final summary. (Author/TO)",

This request reflected three needs: (1) to help communities develop reading instruction programs that meet the needs of learners within those communities; (2) to provide a framework for examining the development of reading programs, but leaving freedom for tailoring instruction to local needs; and (3) to provide a basis for consistent assessment of funded programs. The assessment scale has been so constructed that it could potentially serve as a device for self-study, for reading project planning, for project proposal review, and for a site visit to an ongoing reading program. Nine general  areas of evaluation are included in the scale: management and planning; goals and objectives; instruction; staff; leadership development; materials and facilities; community involvement; environment and background; and program evaluation, auditing, and reporting.

Thirty-eight subjects were divided into three groups. There were 19 disabled subjects with a mean chronological age of 9.17, a mean IQ of 104.84, and a mean reading level of 1.80. Ten normal-old subjects were matched to the disabled group on chronological age, 8.61, and IQ, 106.00, and the reading level of the group was 4.20. Nineteen normal-young subjects, with a mean age of 7.00, an IQ of 105.36, and a reading grade level of 1.91, (were matched with the disabled on chronological age and IQ. Criterion referenced tests of phoneme-grapheme association skills were constructed and administered to both  disabled and normal readers. The strength of subskills in the disabled group was virtually identical to the comparable subskills in the normals similar in reading level. Both of these groups were inferior to normals matched on age who had completely mastered each of these skills. Intercorrelations among subskills were high positive for the normals and were largely insignificant for the disabled. (Author/WR)",

The Indian child is not basically a competitive individual; hence, he cannot understand the traditional classroom's emphasis upon individual achievement. In general, the Indian student is involved in being, not in becoming. Therefore, education as preparation for the future is not a realistic motive for him. Research shows that many Indian children rely heavily on nonverbal means of expression. They must first be taught to speak and read their own language before English language instruction can be successful. The following guidelines are offered as recommendations for those involved with teaching reading to American  Indian youth: (1) Identify the basic premises of Indian culture, or any culture, which require an adjustment in the learning setting. (2) Review and apply the teaching strategies which are applicable to the special instructional problems represented by Indian youth. (3) Recognize individual differences among Indian students as well as collective differences between students and majority groups. (4) Facilitate the ultimate goals of self-reliance and self-direction. (Author/TO)",

This study indicated that: (1) trained teachers display method prescriptions while untrained teachers do not; (2) teacher personality influences teaching behavior; and (3) because teachers have difficulty gauging the ability level of children, they place children into reading ability groups according to some non-competence based criteria established to determine their learning potential. Teachers were also found to be the predominant actors in the classroom, because they restrict--quantitatively and qualitatively--the participation of children. The potential of child-child interaction are seldom recognized as a part of  the learning situation. There is, in the author's opinion, a need for future research to explore children's visible attributes, which teachers use for judging their learning potential, and to explore the kind of inservice training needed to promote the occurrence of teaching behaviors which help children learn.

        "description":"Use of the syllable as a unit for initial acquisition of reading is advocated. It is argued that since English alphabetic writing is based on a mapping between sound-stream and symbol, a decoding approach is necessary at early stages of the acquisition process. However, conventional phonics methods confound two very difficult tasks in initial learning: (1) acquiring the notion that the orthography tracks sound directly and meaning only indirectly; and (2) understanding that the alphabetic unit corresponds to the highly abstract phonological unit, or phoneme, which is both difficult to pronounce in isolation and difficult to recognize and blend. On the basis of research in speech perception, it is suggested that syllables are more natural units than phonemes because they are  easily pronounceable in isolation and easy to recognize and blend. Introduction to a syllabary will teach children the basic notion of sound-tracking uncontaminated by simultaneous introduction of the difficult and inaccessible phoneme unit. Preliminary evidence that a simple 23-element syllabary can be acquired with ease by inner-city and suburban kindergarteners is presented. In particular, it is shown that this population can blend previously untaught combinations of known syllables to form and comprehend new multisyllabic words. (Author/TO)",

Objectives were drawn up for the program and related to all of the participants. Teachers were released from classroom duties every Friday afternoon to participate in training activities at the university; the teacher aides attended workshop sessions at the university once a month and received supervisory assistance in the schools; the parent volunteers  attended a program every Thursday at the university and gave voluntary assistance to teachers during the week; and the principals of the four schools met periodically with the program staff to assist with planning. Tests, questionnaires, and observational schedules were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. All of the participants made significant gains in their particular areas, and the schools benefited from resources placed at their disposal. Overall, the program was termed successful. (WR)",

As new developments come to the fore in reading instruction, authors, editors, and publishers of basal readers prepare new or revised series incorporating those trends which they consider worthwhile. Currently important trends which are likely to appear in basal readers of the near future include behavioral objectives, criterion-based mastery and diagnostic tests, and prescribed individualized practice based on analysis of pupil needs, some of it audio-visual or multi-sensory. As these  trends develop, the differences between systems approaches and basal reader approaches will diminish. Much will depend on the ability of ordinary teachers to manage a complicated system.

        "description":"The primary aim of this study was to ascertain whether expectations affect children's performance on a measure designed to assess development of understanding of the Minimum Distance Principle (MDP) and its exceptions. There were three major hypotheses: (1) sentences harmonious with expectation should be more easily understood than neutral sentences, and contrary sentences should be most difficult to understand, regardless of the verb; (2) there should be fewer misinterpretations of sentences using the verb &quot;to tell&quot; than of those using the verb &quot;to promise,&quot; regardless of expectation; and (3) performance should increase with grade level. The test population consisted of 14 males and 14 females from each of the three levels (K-2). It was concluded that there seems to be a point  at which expectations have the greatest effect on performance. There were differences between the harmonious and the contrary mean on &quot;tell&quot; sentences in kindergarten and grade one, even though the mean number of correct responses was relatively high. In grade two there was no such difference. (Author)",

The first section (12 lessons) is designed to develop an understanding of and some skill in using the dictionary.

Each lesson is accompanied by a statement of its purpose, content, background, possible procedures, and suggested student activities. (See related documents CS 200 482-493, and CS 200 495-499.)

Finally, the students are led to a study of Modern English through a discussion of the advent of the printing press and its subsequent influence on the language. Each lesson is accompanied by a statement of its purpose, content, background, suggested procedures, and student activities.

Consisting of fourteen individual lessons, the unit begins with a series of lessons whose purpose is to develop students' ability to recognize ways in which objects belonging to the same set may differ. These lessons serve as preparation for observing the kinds of differences that exist among dialects of the same language. The next few lessons observe natural differences in people that are accepted without any value judgments attached. This material directly leads to lessons in regional dialect differences in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. The final group of lessons examine other reasons for speech differences (sex, occupation, age, and situation). The main theme for the unit is  that all these factors contribute to language variety, which is natural and inevitable. Each lesson is accompanied by a statement of purpose, additional goals, content, preparation for the lesson, possible procedures, and suggested activities.

The subjects--219 undergraduates at Montana State University--were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) control, receiving normal speech stimuli, and (2) experimental, receiving deaf speech. The results indicated that subjects had higher degrees of comprehension for non-deaf speech compressions than for deaf speech compressions. The level and form of the test did not appear to be operative factors. The sex of the speaker was not found to be a pure variable, and in all  instances 30 percent compressions were not as highly significant as 15 percent compressions. The most conclusive results of this research were those findings related to percentage of compression, which tended to confirm for deaf speech the earlier findings relating to normal speech that time-span compressions can be detrimental to comprehension.

While the study of black communication must deal with the usual problems of obtaining primary resources, establishing the appropriate methodologies, developing a community of scholars, and developing methods of disseminating information, the development of the area of black communication is also hampered to a large degree by its intercultural dimension. Specifically, a reference to \"black\" communication calls attention to the fact that a distinct cultural group exists and that this group's communication is substantially different from that of others. The author concludes that the  researcher is faced with the problems of (1) defining black in a way that is consistent with an attitude of mind rather than a designation of race, (2) understanding that blacks are not simply a neglected population that is either devoid of culture or an incomplete form of the \"dominant\" culture, and (3) developing research methodologies that are based upon primary assumptions that are the same as those supporting black communication.

The broadcast media and television in particular served as a primary information source. The controversy caused by the actual decision and the events leading up to it during the week disrupted normal media exposure patterns among the majority of respondents. This paper examines these disruptions and finds several major variables significant in affecting news diffusion, including degree of interest in the outcome, actual time when the decision was learned, whether the respondent was a registered voter or not, and actual  media reported as source of the news. The paper concludes with a discussion of the spread of information about McGovern's decision and how people attended to media as their normal exposure patterns were interrupted by their interest in this event.

Self-perceptions and perceptions of others were scored along a dominance-submission dimension and a love-hostility dimension. Average intensity scores for each of the sixteen variables which comprise the Interpersonal Check List were determined.

Perhaps this can be attributed to the complexity of the variables involved. It is possible, however, to identify striking similarities in the role of consultant and professor. The author outlines and discusses the strategies used in business and governmental consulting that may well be relevant to improving teaching in university courses in communication. Whether in the classroom or the marketplace, the consultant/professor is a facilitator of learning and a catalyst for change. His objective is to create a learning environment in which new ideas can be evaluated and assimilated. Since his roles as consultant and professor are  consistent, his own learnings in one field are readily transferable to the other. Further, the consulting experience can be particularly useful in developing classroom tasks in simulated reality practice. Consulting activities have the potential for producing beneficial effects on teaching, and realization and utilization of this potential depends on the imagination and energy of the communications consultant-professor.

Critics asserted that the shorter spots did not allow enough time for the voters to learn substantive information about the candidates. A telephone survey of 743 voters in central California, conducted the weekend before the election, however, revealed that the new media strategies utilized by both candidates did not impart adequate information to the public. This lends credence to the idea that the media strategy itself is not the critical variable; instead, the content of the message is still most important, no matter how it is presented. Longer commercials seem to offer little benefit to  the voters in terms of additional information on which to make their political choices. (EE)",

This may be an insubstantive issue, however, in that whether a specific leader or a group as a whole provides the direction, both must still contend with the rhetorical problems, requirements, and strategies.

Cicero and Quintilian, drawing from Isocrates, sought prospective orators who had a natural talent for eloquence and who could adopt a cultural approach to rhetoric that emphasized the worth of reading and writing as important to forming the abilities of the model speaker. Their particular contributions were their emphases on the relationships between writing and speaking ability and their construction of systems of rhetoric which viewed the orator as the prime motivator of a group of listeners on a specific occasion. Their writer-speaker centered rhetoric anticipated the  tradition of rhetoric and letters that flourished in later centuries, with special relevance for mid-twentieth century students of communication theory.

If violent or aggressive behavior is viewed on television by children, how will they respond to the action when they know the action takes place in either the past, the present, or the future? Fifth and sixth grade boys viewed four television scenes and were tested with scaled word items tapping the dimensions of enjoyment, perceived acceptability of the action, perceived reality, and perceived violence. The author concluded that (1) action was enjoyed more in the present context, (2) the same aggressive action was felt to be less acceptable in the present context, (3) action in the present was thought to be more realistic, (4) perceived violence did not  differ between contexts, and (5) no social class differences were observed on the perception dimensions.

In addition, a number of studies about the differences among men and women in vocabulary and pronunciation, grammatical forms, retention and comprehension of oral messages, and compressed speech are examined. Overall, these research projects reveal conflicting results and inconsistent findings which are interpreted as indicating that the role of sex in communication has not been clearly enough defined. In the second section, the popular beliefs regarding what constitutes women's speech--what is  believed to be women's speech and what people believe it should be--are examined. The fact that women as speakers have been largely ignored by communications researchers is stressed, and it is suggested that popular beliefs can be useful as bases for research hypotheses. (LG)",

The prominent method for soliciting and sharing such data has been survey feedback. An Organizational Development (OD) consultant should have at least three skills in order to use survey feedback effectively. First, he should be adept at collecting relevant, valid data and at putting the data into a form for feedback that is understandable by and energizing to the participants. Second, he should be able to raise the mundane data to a level of larger, essential significance, making the data worthy of notice by the participants. Third, the consultant should find ways of incorporating survey feedback into the natural ebb and flow of  OD training. This paper discusses each of these three capabilities. Further, it illustrates ways in which questionnaires, interviews, and observations can be employed at five stages of OD training. Survey feedback can thus take its place as an integral and natural part of a larger macrodesign for organizational development in schools. (Author)",

They are designed to respond to different societal issues and make different types of responses to these issues. Tavistock conferences focus consciously and exclusively on group operation, role, role relationships, intergroup relationships, and total organization. Human relations laboratories (laboratory training) focus at the levels of self, other, relationships in small groups, and group operation. At the same time, both laboratory training and the conference have in common the attempt to provide the learner with direct opportunities for learning from his experience. Both utilize trainers to guide the learning process. Nonetheless, the techniques also differ in that  they have different orientations to training clients for conflict. The conference attempts to provide situations that provoke anxiety about behavior and decisionmaking and that allow the members to learn at the rate they want to learn. It relies on organizational structure that is established by the staff on the basis of their authority. The primary emphasis is to study and cope (within the given structure) with conflict that arises out of a simulation of a classically defined bureaucratic authority structure. The concern of the conference is, therefore, for the effectiveness of individuals in given institutional and organizational roles. (Author/WM)",

Each of the separate school districts can, and often does, introduce different types of changes at different times. Yet a piecemeal description of an educational system unduly complicates the task of understanding that system. As the number of changes introduced into the school system increases, a means of developing a coherent portrait of education is clearly required. Such a portrait may serve to enable a summary assessment by policymakers and planners, and to act as a tool for educating a confused public in times of rapid social change. Primarily this scheme should define the basic elements of the school system and designate the nature of some of the relationships between specific  elements in that system. It is possible to delineate appropriate categories for analyzing the structural and interpersonal process at any given point in time while also allowing consideration of the dynamic aspects of the situation. On the other hand, the internal structure of the school system may be viewed as a series of interrelated decisionmaking components, each with its own set of alternative decisions and constraints specifying limits of appropriate action.

        "description":"A program at Pennsylvania State University is described, wherein American Indian trainees with special knowledges and skills necessary to changing institutions are encouraged to use these skills and knowledges in an effort to change federal, State, and local public and private institutions. Changing institutions to become responsive to clients is the main goal of the training process. One assumption undergirding the program is that administrator behavior is more complex than theory-concept development and testing, and that administrator behaviors demanded in multicultural settings require recognition and analysis. A second premise is that group solidarity is essential for creating a critical mass for change in an institution. Encouraging trainees to keep cultural loyalties,  maintain their integrity, and become involved in tasks is an essential part of the training process. The aggregate model is the institutional change model. Clients' involvement in institutional change is the test of the trainees' skills and value commitment. Finally, value commitments are recognized and made explicit. (Author)",

        "description":"One criticism of professionals in public service is that they resist changing the occupational norms that would decrease their power even though it would benefit their clients. In an examination of the relationship between professionalism and change, data were collected from elementary school principals, local school board members, and lay members of community health planning. Principals were slightly less inclined than school board members to accept change. The least professional of the three groups, community health members, were the most negative about change. The mixed findings may result partially from the spurious relationship between professionalism and change. Two additional variables were introduced to test this hypothesis: amount of \"turbulence\" or dissatisfaction among  clients and diversity of viewpoints within groups. Controlling for the former variable yielded little difference; however, there was a strong positive relationship between diversity of viewpoints and change. Consequently, group consensus is seen as a major variable in predicting acceptance of change. (Author)",

The Walberg-Thomas Scales rated each school as to degree of openness. No significant difference in any of the six &quot;areas&quot; of self-concept was found between students in the open and those in the traditional groups. Significant differences in total self-concept were found between males in open and traditional schools, between males and females in open schools, and between open schools.

Saturation (participating more than desired) was next, and Deprivation (less participation than desired) was least satisfying. This continuum of &quot;Decisional-Deviation&quot; correlated with perceived organizational effectiveness at .21 (significant at .001).

Finally, these themes are integrated and extended in a model specific to the school system as an organization.

These strategies and tactics provide useful conceptual models for both the practice of administration and the conduct of research in organizational change.

As a result of activities over a 2-year period, the existing program was discarded and a new one adopted reflecting an interdisciplinary leadership and decisionmaking rationale conceptualized with a systemic framework. The application of an open systems model required information and decisions about a multiplicity of historical and projected program outputs. Following output identification, retreats were held to consider throughput strategies and input needs. Throughputs were delineated in terms of a typology of subsystem dynamics. Finally, necessary inputs were identified, internal and external constraints were considered, specific courses were developed  and sequenced, and various evaluative feedback mechanisms were explored for continuous program monitoring and assessment. The authors discuss the conceptual aspects of the systems model and the translation of that model into an applied systems framework for program revision and implementation. The utility and limitations of the systems approach are presented and analyzed within a case study narrative depicting circumstances, activities, and events at the University of Kansas between 1970 and 1973.

The supervisor will, therefore, achieve the greatest overall success if he is supportive in his leadership style. His performance depends, too, on technical competence and managerial ability. There is a need for more creative courses in the training of supervisors with such qualities. Since nonverbal behaviors play such an important part in interpersonal relationships, the supervisee and his supervisor should agree on the validity of the observation instruments and methods to be used.

Teacher competencies, new relationships with colleges and universities, systematic inservice training, instruction aids and media, behavior based instruction, parent involvement, peer teaching, and criterion-referenced evaluation  constituted the instructional design. Reality testing was achieved by conducting the experiments in a blue-collar community, in an old &quot;box&quot; building, and within normal budget limitations. (Author)",

The instrument is constructed to measure parental perceptions of five factors that seem heuristically to compose the social-psychological boundaries of a school, and to elicit information about the degree and quality of interaction and influence of parents with the personnel of their child's school. The results of the field test of the PSCQ indicate its potential as a tool to assist school administrators in testing parental perceptions of the current status of their schools. (Author)",

None of these interpretations appears to be fully satisfactory for curriculum research, although the third and fourth (with qualifications) seem more promising than do the first and the second.

The uncertain relationship between the short term and long range goals of instruction is problematic to evaluation in the traditional subject matter areas; but it is a much more serious predicament for evaluators of education in values and attitudes where little is known about the skills essential to the attainment of long range goals. Procedures being used for formative evaluation of an elementary school program in achievement behavior are presented.

To meet this need, Project D developed a diagnostic system of appraisal whose aim was to pinpoint areas in which teachers might reasonably be expected to improve their performance. The procedures adopted included the development of a set of standards for effective teaching, the construction of a self-appraisal instrument for the diagnosis of teaching needs, and the development of a network or set of guidelines for using the Self-Appraisal Instrument in an effective way. Over 800 critical incidents of effective and ineffective teaching were collected from a sample of teachers in the sponsoring school districts. Three fields of psychology (learning,  measurement, and child development) were reviewed for principles whose application in the classrooms were critical in bringing about the intended instructional results. A list of principles of effective teaching and a collection of behavioral illustrations for all principles were employed in the construction of the Self-Appraisal Instrument (SAI). A diagnostic scoring system was developed to assist the teacher identify areas in need of improvement. Finally, guidelines were established for the proper implementations of the instrument.

The projected framework is intended as a heuristic device to stimulate curriculum and other leadership \"actors\" (Duncan and Frymier, 1967) as they engage in the design of planning activities. The intention is to synthesize a form from elements that have not been previously connected, but that are suggested in this paper. The thinking is addressed toward curriculum development in preparation programs in institutions of higher education that prepare curriculum actors for leadership positions in public education and for teaching positions in higher education. The problem is  that of identifying and clarifying processes that seem to have potential for (1) confronting present day educational dilemmas, such as the calls for democratization and curriculum renewal; and (2) serving as a foundation for further curriculum development within institutions of higher education.

Such problems presently occur in many elementary schools in Western Canada. The problems of educational planners in dealing with declining enrollments are examined in terms of school organization, staff utilization, and the utilization of facilities. Proposals especially appropriate for elementary schools with less than 150 students in eight grades are illustrated in four models for classroom grouping. Two models assume that teachers can develop teachable groups and a variety of activities; that students can benefit from extensive  individualization of curriculums and changeable groupings; and that school facilities can be modified to allow for a variety of groupings. Two other models are more traditional, suitable for schools whose physical structures are not easily changed. Implementation of these proposals could improve the quality of education in areas of declining enrollment, while keeping costs down. (Author)",

The concepts of curriculum theory, design, and practice are approached from the point of view of axiology. The argument presented is based on a distinction between value principles and value judgments and the type of justification involved in reasoning about such principles and judgments of value. It is asserted that nonnormative grounds may be found for justifying educational value principles although the principles have a normative function with regard to curricular practice. Further, the level of classroom practice is characterized as normative and involving the use of value judgments. Theorizing within the field of curriculum is thus defined as a nonnormative endeavor aimed at marking off a domain of  educational value (to be distinguished from domains of moral, aesthetic, political, religious and other types of value). A curriculum theory is a set of value principles on this account, while a design is factual in nature and serves as a bridge between theory and practice. Curricular practice consists of judgments and actions based on judgments of educational value. Curricular practice is, therefore, normative. (Author)",

Armed with the equal protection clause of the Federal Constitution, judges are handing down decisions requiring school taxes and expenditures to reflect State wealth rather than variations in local wealth. Voters in rich and poor districts alike are threatening political reprisals for increases in property tax rates. In a few localities, voters have been forcing schools to close by refusing to approve their budgets. As the attack on present methods of financing schools has unfolded, attention has been focused increasingly on three issues: (1) the fiscal disparities in current school finance systems; (2) ways of insuring fiscal equity in restructured school finance systems; and (3) the  fiscal and educational consequences of substituting fiscally equitable methods for present taxing and spending practices.

Maximum-likelihood factor-analytic methods, with subsequent oblique rotations of the factor matrixes, and taxonomic clustering procedures followed by multiple  discriminant-analyses yielded factor solutions and climate types that differ from those which Halpin and Croft identified in their original climate study.

The results support implications of the theory regarding effects of personal income, State and federal aid, the relative price of education, the pupil/population ratio, and enrollment growth on per pupil spending. A population density variable and a South versus non-South regional variable, both included on the basis of earlier results, also affect spending significantly. The nine cross-sectional equations are generally consistent, but there are some structural shifts over time, and the hypothesis of coefficient homogeneity is not supported. Consequently, a pooled equation that allows for such shifts provides the most useful predictive model. Policy  applications of the results are limited by (1) omission of some \"taste variables\" that affect spending, (2) uncertainty about differential State responses to aid, and (3) the absence of price data for individual States.

The market incentives for school districts are systematically different from those of a competitive firm, resulting in a different pattern of innovations. The main bureaucratic influences are bureaucratic safety, influence of external pressures, and peer elite approval. These factors lead to certain recommendations for educational R&amp;D policy. Policies for effective innovation require better understanding of the existing structure of incentives, as well as efforts to modify that structure. Often it will be impossible to know what the objectives of  educational policy are, and the practice of trying out new methods may, in the process, disclose what the objectives are. (Author)",

The conference includes (1) a discussion of long- and short-range objectives agreed upon by both the evaluator and the evaluatee, (2) a discussion of the administrator's overall performance as outlined in the administrator's position description, (3) a discussion of the evaluatee's performance in terms of responsibilities common to all administrators, and (4) a written narrative report by the evaluator.

The time period is characterized by both unprecedented effort to produce change and slow change in schools. Talcott Parson's hierarchy of levels; Charles Perrow's notion of goals, technology, and structure; and Kirst and Walker's assumption that curriculum decisionmaking was &quot;political&quot; were used to conceptualize and stabilize the data as curriculum development was traced through the time period. The study findings revealed that change occurred in small ways in individual classrooms -- by policy decision and by organizational &quot;drift.&quot; Change and financial resources were found to  be related. School system resources were used for &quot;maintenance&quot; of the system; few resources were left for innovation. The advent of federal funding (NDEA, Vocational Education Act of 1963) brought additional funds, which permitted the curriculum change that the Gary school system had failed to bring about with its own limited resources.

Design modules were then created describing activities for a school program in terms of the individualization of activities and the potential for an activity to distract other ongoing activities. Square feet per student were computed using optimal dimensions and collected observational data relevant to the actual space used during activities. A system of computer programs was designed and partially implemented that would accept as  input a school program designation, a planned enrollment, and a proposed school floorplan and would apply the appropriate model to a schedule of activities to determine the adequacy of the proposed design in terms of projected space needs.

Therefore, difficulties arise in setting up control groups, the timing of post-measurements, and the use of varied intervention techniques. Dilemmas are caused by focusing on projected, rather than on desired, outcomes. Additionally, attempts to derive conclusions are limited because many studies (1) fail to specify the conditions under which a relationship between variables is tested; (2) are based on information from one school or one school district, thus limiting generalizability; (3) utilize variables unique to the particular study and/or are nontheoretical, providing little framework for integrating findings from different studies; and (4)  fail to allow for differentiating among behavior patterns, providing only limited alternatives and involving just one specified behavior -- the only other one being the absence of the one observed. These studies rely on the participation of involved persons rather than on objective others, and often obtain information regarding two or more variables from the same respondents. (Author)",

This distinction would thus provide the possibility of developing two separate paradigms for the study of organization models that differ from the bureaucratic model. The advantage of such an approach would be greater logical clarity among concepts used under the rubric of each paradigm, a concomitant potential reduction in confusion arising from differing theoretical orientations  which involve similar observational variables, and an opportunity to systematically investigate the \"cash value\" of each paradigm.

The study conclusions indicate that the structure of the concept of procedural due process, or any legal concept, is not the same as the structure of scientific or moral concepts. Parts of the structure of legal concepts change in accordance with changing social and political norms, whereas other parts remain constant. The use of procedural due process in decisionmaking does not guarantee errorless judgment, nor does it guarantee a particular procedural requisite. (Edited copy may reproduce poorly.) (Author)",

        "description":"An economic framework that melds the theories of human capital and internal labor markets in a probabilistic matrix has been developed to analyze teacher mobility. This framework is general and could be applied to other labor markets possessing similar institutional structures, such as those in the Civil Service sector. Several important implications of the framework were confirmed when tested by regression analysis and Markovian analysis with data for the San Diego school system. Four of these implications are: (1) Internal mobility of teachers is based on nonpecuniary differences between assignments (e.g., teachers in San Diego tend to move from schools where student socioeconomic status (SES) is relatively low to schools where SES is relatively high); (2) newly hired teachers  tend to be placed in the lower SES schools; (3) teachers with the most experience are least likely to move between assignments; and, (4) higher SES schools have faculties with relatively greater experience and educational attainment than do lower SES schools, largely as a consequence of the three mobility patterns noted above.

The lead article by Mary F. Compton gives some of the major philosophical and psychological foundations on which middle school programs are theoretically developed and outlines many reasons why a restructuring of our schools in the middle grades should be considered. Donald R. Nesbitt traces the development of middle schools and gives the available evidence indicating what has actually been accomplished through the establishment of middle school programs. David J. Mullen suggests some ways to explicate the educational promise  inherent in any such new movement. O. Paul Roaden gives some practical alternatives to consider when new middle school buildings are to be constructed. In the final article, C. W. McGuffey explores the relationships of the emerging middle school program to facilities needs and discusses several potentially useful guidelines for planning a middle school plant. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"This book is an interpretive history of the organizational revolution that took place in American schooling during the 19th century, its politics and ideology. It attempts to assess how the schools shaped, and were shaped by, the transformation of the United States into an urban-industrial nation. It looks at the shift from village school to urban system using a variety of social perspectives and modes of analysis. &quot;Community control&quot; in the rural and village school (a pattern of governance followed by many of the early city schools) is analyzed first. Then, the development of ideological and organizational consensus in the search for an urban educational order is traced--a process frequently complicated by heterogeneous values among the urban populations and diffusion of power  in school governance. Next, the author deals with the centralization of education (1890-1920); and reformist emphasis on expertise, efficiency, and the disinterested public service of elites. Case studies of four cities offer variations on the central theme and analyze the opposition to centralization. Finally, some of the major changes (1890-1940), the appearance of more complex educational structures and new specializations, and the development of a &quot;technology of discrimination&quot; are described. The author stresses that it is the persistence of historical myths and problems that today stands in the way of realistic reform of urban education. An extensive bibliography is included.

The author attempts to underline the complexity of appraising the impact of year-round schools on community life without carefully collected research data, while considering briefly the possible effects of year-round school on family, religion, and delinquency rates. However, he hypothesizes that the community will be affected by a change to a year-round  school calendar insofar as such a change requires an adjustment in the precarious routinization of community interest clusters competing for authority and influence on matters related to the child's socialization process.

Steps seen to be necessary for building a corrective teaching program are the isolation of the problem, the identification of the performance necessary for re-entry into  normal programing, the analysis of the task, the writing of instructional objectives, and the designing of the procedure. Examples of teaching procedures and samples of record keeping forms are given. Alternatives of the implementation phase by the teacher alone, by the teacher using the services of others, or by others with the teacher monitoring the program are considered. Evaluation is recommended both during the teaching procedure and ultimately in the group setting to which the pupil is returned.

        "description":"A task force approach to care of profoundly retarded children includes parent counseling services. Counseling is usually limited to initial interviews in which the psychologists must explain the diagnosis, teach parents to accept the child's maturity age as the best gauge of his ability, and make parents aware that their child will require constant care. As counseling is so limited, the psychologist must plan for the child in terms of initial family attitudes, whether these include belligerence, denial, depression, guilt, apathy, or rejection. Psychologists should deal with these attitudes by allowing parents to vent hostility, by discussing state services that can alleviate the burden of total care, by informing parents of various causes of profound retardation, by convincing  overprotecting parents that their child can be trained to achieve some degree of independence, by showing rejecting parents how to include the child in family matters, and by assisting parents to accept their child's intellectual status. Clinicians must be alert to factors (such as cultural or experiential deprivation, autism, or undetected hearing loss) which may cause an appearance of profound retardation. Difficulties in working with children suspected of profound retardation, including hyperactivity, withdrawal, lack of speech, or belligerence, can often be overcome by allowing the child to play and interrelate freely with his parents until he feels comfortable in the diagnostic setting.

Experiences at the Merrimack Education Center (Massachusetts) are said to suggest that program development be preceded by assessment of local needs, and agreement on educational goals and teacher roles. The model recommends that inservice teacher education programs be responsive to the following three interacting dimensions: organizational structure, including personnel and role assignments; decision-making competencies expected of the teachers; and the cognitive affective, and psychomotor behaviors evidenced by teachers. Data related to these three dimensions are said to be determined by systematically delineating the competencies required for teaching normal  youngsters; determing the special competencies needed to cope with any child who has special problems related to school learning and performance; and defining the special competencies which must be mastered because of the unique characteristics of different handicapping conditions. Various teacher competencies required by special educators are summarized, including, competence in psychoeducational aspects of special education (diagnostic and recording skills), competence in planning, developing, utilizing and evaluating a variety of effective teaching/learning activities and situations; and competence in assisting students to understand and accept their abilities and limitations.

Compared were nine educational alternatives for the gifted such as homogeneous grouping and early admission to college in terms of educational goals such as allowing for individual differences. Thirty-five scorers in a science fair competition were evaluated individually and detailed analyses of seven of the students' test scores and backgrounds were given. It was recommended that the students take college courses, or enter college early. It was reported that family background of the students usually involved bright parents though not all parents were college educated or in professional occupations. No obvious differences in college class participation between  college students and the junior high students were found, and no grade of less than B was reportedly received by a student taking a college course. Mathematical knowledge appeared to derive from independent study or from working math puzzles. Briefly noted was a Saturday class in algebra, geometry, and trigonometry for a group of 22 mathematically gifted sixth graders. To stimulate the highly talented, schools were encouraged to identify advanced students, provide additional testing and counseling, and allow flexible scheduling and program planning. (DB)",

Multi-modal communicative behavior was noted, with focus on interpersonal spatial distance as one index of relationship and affect between interacting partners. Empirical data collected on 1,400 dyads with the use of the Dennis Infracommunication Analysis Device showed that EMR pupils and TMR pupils communicate with their classmates at the same mean distance. In across race pupil/pupil dyads, the white pupils set the distance. White pupils also maintained closer distance with each other than did black pupils. TMR pupils interacted with their teachers at closer range than with other TMR pupils,  though EMR pupils interacted at moreintimate distances with other EMR pupils than with their teachers. Other factors bearing on non-verbal communication appeared to be angle of orientation, gaze, kinesics, and kinesthetics. (Author/DB)",

SAT-M scores of 396 7th, 8th, and accelerated 9th grade students show a wide range of abilities among students scoring at the ceiling of in-grade tests. The rationale for discrimination among gifted students should be individualized educational planning which may include college courses and early college admission for the gifted junior high student who also scores high on the SAT-M. Because younger students may have to make greater use of reasoning abilities to  solve problems to which older students apply learned formulas, this reasoning ability can be predicitive of success in advanced courses of new material. Gifted junior high students have been placed in college courses with unbroken success. (See EC 051 774 for a related document). (DB)",

Non-deviant behaviors (both competent and incompetent) were considered adaptive at the upper-middle class level while only competent behaviors (both deviant and non-deviant) were considered adaptive at the lower class levels. The perceived appropriateness of the mental retardation label appeared to be a function of social class with the student of low  social class more likely to be labeled retarded.

        "description":"Cable television can dramatically increase the existing television offerings and open up important new services for the public. It offers a double potential: one for general service within a limited geographic part of the region and one for highly selective service all across the region. As a result, television will no longer have to be everything to everybody. However, this potential may not develop because of the boundaries of local government within which franchising takes place. Local franchising presents two problems: small municipalities may not attract a cable franchise, and interconnection between municipalities may not take place. Furthermore, because no production assistance or funding has been provided by the federal government, the promise of channels reserved for  public agencies. organizations, and individuals may not occur. In order to curtail these deficiencies, the following actions are recommended: 1) although cable television will be developed by private individuals, it should be subject to public regulation; 2) although regulation will be handled essentially by municipalities, the state should set forth standards to assure that all built-up areas be covered and interconnected and to assist public programing; 3) the legislature and governor must act in 1973.

        "description":"A study investigated the relationship between avionics subsystem design characteristics and training time, training cost, and job performance. A list of design variables believed to affect training and job performance was established and supplemented with personnel variables, including aptitude test scores and the amount of training and experience. Thirty functional loops from ten avionics subsystems were selected as the units of equipment to be investigated. Ten students were observed performing each of the functional checkouts. Training time and training equipment cost data were collected for each loop. A factor analysis identified six factors which account for a major part of the variance in maintenance task performance: length of checkout procedure, equipment complexity,  difficulty of checkout steps, nonautomatic checkout, diagnostic information, and clarity of information. The magnitude of the regression coeffients (.92 or better) establish this as a promising approach to deriving human resources data for systems under development. Additional research is needed to develop and quantify better hardware and personnel variables. (JK)",

        "description":"About 30 educators, cable operators, and foundation and government representatives discussed cable television and continuing education at a conference. They concluded that cable has great potential for education, because of the following features: 1) multiple channels, 2) controlled access to cable channels, 3) an educational access channel, and 4) eventual two-way capability. Barriers to the greater use of cable include: 1) lack of high quality educational materials suitable for televised use and a shortage of skilled personnel to produce them; 2) need for means to evaluate media-based education; and 3) lack of adequate and equitable funding means to support continuing education. The panel's recommendations were: 1) establishment of close liaison between educators and cable  operators; 2) a campaign to educate educators to the potential uses of cable and other technologies 3) a major study of the means for financing expanded access to continuing education; 4) development of a national system for the collection, assessment, and distribution of instructional materials for post-secondary education; 5) a continuing overview of progress in the use of cable and other technologies for continuing education.

        "description":"A study was devised to determine the efficacy of picture sequencing as a method of evaluating a child's interaction with a film, particularly children who are low in verbal expression. A series of five photographs were used which illustrated important points in a film about the ill effects of smoking. Subjects were selected from two primary educable mentally retarded classes, two intermediate educable mentally retarded classes, and two nonhandicapped fourth grades. Each child saw the film (except for control subjects), was interviewed, and then was asked to sequence the five photographs. Results showed that those children who saw the film obtained higher sequence scores, that older children did better, and that sequence scores did not correlate significantly with scores on the  interview (although the correlations were all positive). Thus, verbal interviews may not be tapping a child's ability and sequencing procedures may provide a better way to assess his abilities. (SH)",

Information was gathered either through questionnaires, college records, or interviews about course effectiveness, audience composition, and publicity effectiveness. Results showed no significant differences between on-campus students and students taking the televised courses in grades, although more students did not complete one of the televised courses as compared with on-campus students in the same course. Further, televised courses did not significantly reduce on-campus enrollment in the same courses, and students taking the televised courses like their  convenience best. Analysis of the data on audience characteristics showed that the typical television student was a married female with some college education who was taking the course on a part time basis to get a college degree. Finally, the publicity data indicate that heavy publicizing of the courses probably led to greater enrollments, and that brochures were the most effective method. (SH)",

It consists of several papers presented at a symposium held in Wisconsin in May 1972 dealing with freedom of the press particularly from the perspectives of journalism and law. The first paper discusses constitutional guarantees, accommodations between freedom and permissible restraint, the ever changing patterns and needs of society and the growth of law, and journalistic self-restraint as an alternative to governmental restraint. The second paper reviews Supreme Court decisions on issues of libel and privacy and asks what remains of the rights to reputation and privacy. Five causes for concern about press freedom are presented and discussed in  the last paper: neglect by the nation's best minds of responsibilities toward general citizenship, abuse by public officials of democracy's basic precept that government derives from and exists for the public, mass citizen indifference to restraints being put upon press freedom, the changing character of print media ownership, and attacks on the principal practitioners of press freedom by the Nixon administration and its emulators.

Objective tests decrease the level of intellectual mastery required from recall to mere recognition, tend to be used as evaluative devices rather than as learning devices, provide slow feedback, and encourage a loafing-cramming approach to course subject matter. Donald Jensen's computer generated, repeatable testing (CGRT) attempts to overcome these difficulties by providing frequent tests with immediate feedback, flexible scheduling, test forms, and a method of coding fill-in responses. An attempt  was made to implement a CGRT type system for an introductory Personnel Administration course. Student attitudes towards the course and their performance were both very good, although there did seem to be some problems with unreliability of the tests. Some additional implications of CGRT and possibilities for the future are also discussed. (RH)",

These techniques ranged from instructional to experimental treatments and were investigated in a range of computer-based situations. The state-trait anxiety inventory developed by Spielberger, Gorsuch, and Lushene (1970) was used to measure both trait and state anxiety in these studies. The materials were presented by an IBM 1500 computer-assisted instruction system, which also presented the state anxiety scales and recorded student responses. Six studies were conducted to accomplish the project goals. The first study focused on the effect of stimulating curiosity as an anxiety-reducer. Next, a series of five studies examined the impact of  anxiety on computer-based intelligence testing, and methods were investigated for reducing test anxiety. Prior terminal experience was shown to reduce anxiety for students during a computer-administered intelligence test. The comparative effectiveness of these test anxiety reduction treatments across the several studies was discussed. (Author)",

It is the author's theory that in applying numbers to nouns, the Japanese make a formal distinction between things they conceive as being independent and self-contained and things they conceive as being dependent and attributive. A form containing a classifier implies that the object of quantification is felt to be independent; a form that omits the classifier implies that the object is felt to be attributive to something else. The author enlarges upon these theories and discusses exceptions which can be attributed to language styles or particular  derivations. He establishes the categories of count noun, numeral suffix, numeral adjunct, and numerical compound to formalize his discussion. Concluding remarks concern Chinese. (VM)",
