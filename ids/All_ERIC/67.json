        "description":"In the last 50 years, the school music program has broadened from just band, choir, and orchestra activities to also include other music classes and activities needed by the students served by the school music program. Just as other subject area curricula have expanded from more general studies to very specific courses, the music program now includes classes in such areas as music theory, music history, composition, chamber music, popular and commercial music. The one segment of music instruction that has not been directly incorporated into the secondary music curriculum is the area of applied music. The reason for this apparent neglect is pure economics. The funding for public education will never be sufficient to provide one-on-one instruction. However, through cooperation with  professional organizations and other instructional service opportunities, there is a way that advanced applied music studies can be reflected on the student's high school transcript. This proposal is for such a program and is intended as a guide for schools wishing to institute a program. Goals and responsibilities are set out, teacher qualifications are given, sample application and evaluation forms are included, course outlines are presented including suggested music literature, and course outcomes are discussed.

        "description":"Cooperation among Scandinavian nations (Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden) is important in order to develop an effective policy regarding the education of immigrants and refugees. Each of the Scandinavian countries has a definitive education policy for refugees and immigrants. However, cooperative efforts among the nations through the Nordic Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Nordic Council, and the Helsinki Agreement set no firm policy on refugee and immigrant education. Significant issues for policy makers to evaluate and consider in studying refugee and immigrant education include minority language, culture, and group development. Minority populations in Scandinavia, as in all of Europe, are expected to increase, creating a greater need for minority education at all levels that  will benefit the whole of society. (AS)",

        "description":"This paper discusses three diverse philosophical schools of thought that pertain to the teaching of history. The identification of objectives, selection of learning activities, and methods of pupil achievement appraisal are outlined for each school of thought. Experimentalism emphasizes diverse methods of instruction, a stimulating environment, and the importance of problem solving using relevant examples. Group activities are stressed in which pupils identify and solve problems. Essentialism emphasizes precise content in the study of history in which measurable objectives are predetermined and written by the teacher. Pupils are not involved in developing objectives or learning activities. Textbooks, rote learning, and memorization of facts and concepts is emphasized.  Existentialism stresses the role of personal choice on the part of learners. Each pupil is responsible for choosing between competing purposes and values in an environment involving dilemma situations. The curriculum is open-ended and provides opportunities for free choice by learners. (AS)",

        "description":"The role of parent choice in publicly funded education in six selected nations is examined. Focusing upon education in developed Western democracies, this study is intended to be instructive to U.S. education as it examines the interplay between state-mandated universal education and parents' right of choice. Twenty-five national education systems were reviewed, and six were selected for this study--France, Netherlands, Belgium, Britain, Canada, and West Germany. Each country is discussed separately, examining: (1) historical background, (2) research on reasons for parents' decisions about their children's schools, and (3) current policy debates. In these six nations, parents' choice of particular schools or forms of education for their children is usually based upon either  religious reasons, or preference for a particular type of curriculum or language of instruction. The document includes an introduction by U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos, followed by a foreword by Assistant Secretary Christopher T. Cross.

        "description":"The 20th century has brought many demographic changes to the United States. This booklet briefly relates some of those changes and provides many charts and graphs to illustrate the changes graphically. The century has been one of population growth, but the rate of growth has slowed since the 1950s. The population is mobile, with more than two out of five people changing their place of residence every five years. There are now more young singles, more divorced, more children in single-parent homes, and more widows. More mothers work outside the home than ever before. Average house size has increased, and more people now own their own home though the cost of doing so has increased also. Life expectancy has risen, largely due to extraordinary progress in reducing illness, but  medical costs have soared. Each generation in the United States has so far achieved a higher level of education than the one before. Worker productivity has increased along with wages. More women have entered the work force, but most still earn substantially less than men. Blacks have made significant gains, but are still substantially less well off than their white counterparts. There are more elderly now, and their economic well-being has improved. Advances have been made in the war on poverty, but these have slowed recently. A growing middle class has higher earnings and larger assets, and recreation has become not an option, but a vital ingredient in good health. A 39-item bibliography is included. (JB)",

        "description":"There is an important relationship between history and geography that needs greater emphasis in the social studies curriculum. By emphasizing the temporal and spatial relationships in geography and history, geographers can help develop curriculum that focuses upon the fundamental themes in geography, the relationship of the themes to the study of history, and the cognitive skills important for both disciplines. The integration of history and geography is carried out currently at the elementary level, but secondary level teachers need to strive harder to incorporate this concept into their teaching. Secondary level history textbooks by focusing little attention to geographic concepts do very little to support integration. Geographic literacy is necessary in the teaching and  learning of history and needs to be emphasized in the curriculum. (AS)",

Geographic learning is therefore essential to sound teaching and learning of history in general and U.S. history at the high school level in particular. This report contains a description of the content, structure, and instructional characteristics of ten 20-minute video programs and accompanying print materials on geography in U.S. history. These programs, intended for use in secondary level U.S. history courses, fit easily into normal classroom schedules; and the content reflects most existing course sequences, as indicated by standard curriculum guides and widely used textbooks. Each of the 10 programs focus on a major period  of U.S. history and a significant event and related developments within that period. All programs also incorporate the most recent thinking about the teaching and learning of geography and reinforce current efforts to help students understand the investigative and analytical aspects of this subject. While the programs constitute a chronological series, each is self-contained and may be used independently.

Usually these graphs have been accompanied by dire warnings and pointing fingers. The main source of the data on international comparisons has been the International Association for the Evaluation of Education (IEA). The articles that make up this document focus primarily on the studies conducted by the IEA. Seth Spaulding sets the stage by looking at the history and policy implications of comparative studies in education, including those of IEA. Ian Westbury shows how complex the interpretation of comparative achievement scores can be. Inger Marklund from Sweden and Zoltan Bathory from Hungary show how two systems of  education have used the study results to foster curricular changes in the schools of their respective countries. Both show how the public and planners can use comparative data in a thoughtful fashion. Edward Kifer, Lorin Anderson and Neville Postlethwaite, and Alan Purves examine the various studies to see what broad implications can be drawn concerning issues related to curriculum and instruction. Herbert Walberg examines the relationship between student performance measures and other indicators of a nation's well-being in the world. Chester Finn concludes the volume with a look at comparative performance from a policymaker's point of view. (JB)",

        "description":"Demographic data are presented about the people who have immigrated to the United States from Asia and the Pacific Islands. Twelve figures (pie charts, bar graphs, and maps), and eight tables provide detailed, statistical information on such things as (1) distribution of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States, (2) states with the largest percent of Asian and Pacific Islander populations, (3) median age, (4) percent in the labor force, (5) percent high school graduates for those over 25, (6) businesses owned by these immigrants, and (7) median value of homes, and other topics. The data are based on 1980 census figures. A narrative account summarizes the information found in the charts and tables. For example: Asians and Pacific Islanders living in the United States  numbered 3.7 million in 1980, with 58 percent living in the west. Their median age was 28.4 years, and the average family size was 3.8 persons. Of those aged 25 years and older, 75 percent were at least high school graduates compared to 66 percent nationally, and 33 percent were college graduates, compared with 16 percent of the total population. Sixty-seven percent of Asians and Pacific Islanders participated in the labor force. They owned more than 200,000 firms, 92 percent of which were operated as individual proprietorships. The median family income for Asians and Pacific Islanders was $22,700, and about 13 percent of the individuals were in poverty. Fifty-two percent owned or were buying their own homes, with the median value at $83,900. Teachers and curriculum developers will find  this document a resource for developing multicultural lessons and activities. (JB)",

A series of charts, maps, graphs, and tables provide detailed statistical data on such things as population growth trends, population by race and age, educational achievement, number of people living alone, male and female occupations, percent homeowners, and so on. A narrative account elaborates on the information found in the charts and tables. The information may be summarized briefly as follows: It is unlikely that the U.S. population will ever again grow as rapidly as during the 20 years following World War II. The population is moving south and west, out of large cities, and to suburbs and the countryside. Minority populations are growing at a faster rate than the rest  of the population. The population is aging and will continue to grow older. More people are living alone, and families are smaller. The population as a whole is better educated than earlier generations. People are marrying later than they used to. Slightly over half of all women are now in the work force. Incomes rose in the 1970s, but the gains were largely offset by increases in the cost of living. The poverty rate dropped slightly during the 1970s for the total population, but it dropped substantially for senior citizens. More people are buying their own homes, despite higher costs. Classroom teachers can use this resource for research projects and lecture material. (JB)",

Designed to be used in conjunction with a video by the same title, this booklet provides a brief overview of the five areas that Title IX covers, specifically related to West Virginia public schools. (1) Each county must conduct a self-evaluation of policy and procedures, appoint a Title IX coordinator, and adopt and publicize a grievance procedure for students and employees. (2) No county may discriminate on the basis of sex in admitting students to any of its public schools. (3) Students, male and  female, must be provided equal opportunity in being admitted to courses or curricular and extracurricular activities. They may be separated only during portions of courses that deal with human sexuality or during contact sports. They must be provided with unbiased counseling and testing. They may not be discriminated against if they are pregnant, if they are married, or if they are potential parents. (4) Males and females, either potential employees or those who are already employed in the public schools, should be afforded equal and fair treatment in all aspects of employment. (5) It is the responsibility of the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education to review the state and counties' Title IX programs. (JB)",

The model involves six regional districts specifically located across the state which serve as the administrative units for the field program. All of the centers have a common structure to allow for program continuity. Several examples of this continuity include: (1) every center has a tenure track professor who is the administrator for all aspects of the center's operation; (2) all centers have implemented a full semester student teaching curriculum; and (3) all center partnerships have established an advisory cadre of local educational practitioners, consisting  of at least five professional educators from regional schools. Individual cadres are free to engage in projects they believe are pertinent to their needs. The center-specific component of this partnership program is designed to encourage creativity to respond to regional needs. Cadre involvement extends beyond clinical field experience activities because cadre members are involved in a variety of teacher education matters. Each regional partnership structures the student teaching clinical field experience in ways that best fit the regional district. (JD)",

A step-by-step approach to integration is presented, proceeding from selection of an organizing center to a scope and sequence of guiding questions to a matrix of activities for developing integrated units of study. A distinction is made between curriculum-content and metacurriculum--those learning skills helpful in acquiring the curriculum content being taught and in  developing the capacity to think and learn independently.

The paper begins with a consideration of schools and classrooms as cultural settings and examines the beginning teacher's role within them. The remaining sections of the paper examine the interweaving of school social life with the fundamental teaching concerns of planning, instruction, and equity. This examination focuses on three images coined by educational researchers to capture key aspects of the teacher's role in school and classroom culture and their hiddeness to members of that culture. The &quot;hidden world&quot; of teacher thought and planning, the normative or &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; of schools, and the &quot;invisible culture&quot; of communication style related  to language and ethnic identity are described. These hidden dimensions of teaching, rarely available to the pupil or novice teacher by means of observation or participation, must become the subject of critical examination and reflection if the novice teacher is to make a successful transition from &quot;pupil&quot; to &quot;teacher&quot; in the familiar culture of the classroom. The study of the social organization of schools and classrooms is therefore important to beginners in its own right and as a means to the end of becoming a thoughtful professional able to consider alternatives and possibilities as well as realities of classrooms.

The 1987 polls focused on priorities for federal, state, and local government expenditures, on measures to improve education in the basics, and on sources of discipline problems in the schools. This year's surveys also explored opinions regarding several recommendations to ensure teacher competence, the importance of having certified teachers in every classroom, and the value of various indicators of public school performance. This report first presents highlights of the results of the survey and a description of the sample. It is organized into several sections: (1) priorities for government  expenditure; (2) K-12 teacher compensation; (3) willingness to pay for increases in teachers' salaries; (4) improving the quality of education; (5) improving the quality of teaching; (6) discipline in the schools; and (7) public/private school enrollment patterns.

The first paper, by Samuel B. Bacharach and his colleagues (Scott C. Bauer and Joseph B. Shedd), offers an overview and appraisal of the CART survey by the research team intimately involved in the survey's preparation and evolution. The second paper, by Susan J. Rosenholtz, places the CART survey in the context of related scholarly literature. It is noted that the CART survey reinforces a conclusion reached independently by many other researchers: The social and  organizational conditions in today's schools create many of the problems that undermine quality education. In the third paper, Charles S. Benson states that these conditions can be changed, and proposes a step-by-step plan designed to accomplish needed changes. The final paper, by E. Gareth Hoachlander, addresses the educational reform question regarding the economic ramifications of reform and provides examples of alternative strategies. The report concludes with an appendix that presents the survey's numerical data. (JD)",

This monograph summarizes the research findings and suggests some underlying principles of effective instruction. Recent research has reinforced findings that teachers who adopt the principles of direct instruction increase the academic engagement time of students, and this leads to greater achievement. Teachers who focus on academic goals, structure learning activities, and provide clear academically oriented feedback create a businesslike learning environment which enhances time on task and achievement. This monograph introduces the basic principles of effective instruction and lists selected sources which provide concise summaries  of more recent research reports.

The playground can offer natural fitness development and within this setting the physical education teacher can be the most influential with all children, not just with those who are physically active and aggressive. The primary feature of a well-planned playground is the interlinking of structures and play components that allow for continual movement and interaction opportunity. Thus, a smooth natural integration of all physical development components and related activity options is achieved. All the physical fitness feats methodically worked through in the traditional physical education class are evident in children's free play behavior on  the playground.

Project participants included the Catholic University Department of Education, District of Columbia and Montgomery County (Maryland) public schools, Washington, D.C. parochial schools, and a private school. The aim of the project was to improve the process of teacher preparation by helping elementary education students become more reflective about their work, become better able to use professional knowledge to improve their teaching, and become more self-directed. Drawing on the research base of effective teaching and effective schools, the project focused on practice, coaching, and development of self-critical attitudes and skills. Task force teams, comprised of education  students, cooperating teachers, and university supervisors and faculty worked cooperatively to identify issues which concern neophyte teachers in their initial field experiences. Team members, using observation/data gathering techniques such as journal keeping and audio and videotaping, developed and tried out improvement activities. This report describes the activities conducted during the project and summarizes the project's impact. The report includes a final project report, a practice profile, and the program assessment report.

        "description":"The validity and reliability of the Yugoslavian (Beograd) version of the Hungarian adaptation of the Torrance Divergent Capacities Test (HAT-DAT) were tested, with a view toward improving the methodology of scoring the creative abilities test and determining standards for Yugoslavia. The test, based on the work of J. P. Guilford (1977), examines the basic divergent problems of fluency, flexibility, and originality. It contains four subtests--circles, kidney (picture construction), tin can (unusual multiple utility), and monkey (object improvement)--out of the nine in the original Torrance version. The reliability of independent expert assessment of children's paintings and stories was also assessed. Research began in 1978-79 with 104 children; they were studied for the 4 years  following enrollment in grade 1. Children were tested with the HAT-DAT in grades 1 and 3. The creative value of artwork and writings from grade 3 was independently assessed by experts from representative fields. The HAT-DAT was not reliable when item analysis, factor analysis, and retesting were used. Correlating test results with results from artwork and stories produced by the children showed that the test was neither valid nor predictive. Independent assessments of children's creative products were not congruent and were no better indicators of divergent abilities than was the test. While the testing method can be improved, results will still not be useful. Study results call the Guilford theoretical approach into question and make the theoretical status of fluency, flexibility, and  originality problematic. (SLD)",

Data from these students will be collected again in 1990. The primary research questions involve identifying factors that contribute to the effective transition from secondary school to employment, further education, and independent living. This report documents the data collection and data processing  procedures used in developing the primary database for the NLTS. Four data components were used to obtain the data specified by the conceptual framework: (1) parent/guardian interviews; (2) data from school records; (3) a survey of secondary special education programs; and (4) survey of non-respondents. The combined database includes data from at least one source for 8,678 youth, 84% of the initial sample.

The meta-analysis technique was promoted by Braver and Braver as the most powerful single test for analyzing data from an SFGD. They demonstrated that customary analysis on fabricated data sometimes failed to find significance, while meta-analysis found significance. The current paper counters that meta-analysis is a five-step process, and that fabricated data sets can easily be constructed to show that customary tests can find significance, whereas meta-analysis does not. Statements about the efficacy and power of meta-analysis should be made more cautiously. (TJH)",

This problem may cause &quot;guilt&quot; on the part of the professor who must advise students when they encounter discrepancies between their own calculations of the degree of freedom and critical values provided in popular statistics and research textbooks. To avoid hazards of interpolating, professors often suggest using a higher or lower critical value, which usually differs only in the thousandths place. The current study is a Monte Carlo investigation comparing the robustness and power properties of the independent means &quot;t&quot;-test when using the correct critical value versus the approximate values under normal and various non-normal distributions at different alpha  levels. The results indicate that the lower critical value allows increased chances of making a Type I error. In the worst case, use of the higher critical value resulted in a modest (6.25%) loss in power.

        "description":"The 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF), which is reviewed historically in this essay, represents a unique and significant chapter in the history of personality assessment. During the first 20 years of its existence, the 16PF underwent numerous revisions and restandardizations. During that period, R. B. Cattell, the creator of the 16PF, laid the foundations for an approach that would uniquely characterize his approach to personality assessment. The 16PF became the parent of an entire family of tests, including shorter versions, single-purpose instruments, and age-specific instruments. At the present time, the system consists of 13 different self-report instruments that encompass 23 different test forms and a total pool of nearly 3,000 items. During its second 20 years of  existence, 16PF development has slowed, but use of the instrument has increased. Two notable developments are the Clinical Analysis Questionnaire (CAQ) and the Adult Personality Inventory (API). For the future, it seems that the 16PF tradition will most likely be reflected in the CAQ and API. The former significantly broadened the range of application of the 16PF by adding scales to assess affective and cognitive disturbances. The API anticipated the enormous growth of computerized testing. A 46-item list of references is included. (TJH)",

A familiar illustration is the play-the-winner rule in which there are two treatments; after a random start, the same treatment is continued as long as each successive subject registers a success. When a failure occurs, the other treatment is used until failure occurs. Sequential sampling procedures are discussed in relation to clinical trials, but there are many applications of such procedures in statistics. Models are presented for the adaptive allocation of dose levels to subjects arriving sequentially. Natural multivariate design spaces occurring in radiotherapy given at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center motivate this work. The allocation rules proposed adapt to  accumulating failure data, possibly censored, and thus are governed by an underlying, unknown, multivariate failure distribution in the limit. An urn model is used to effect the adaptation of the allocation scheme. A recursive algorithm for updating the urn distribution is derived. The Bernoulli environment and urn models on ordinal sample spaces in a random environment are also considered. (SLD)",

The existence of long-term effects would support the hypothesis that indirect genetic effects on learning are mediated by temperament. Initial participants were 104 children from six first-grade classrooms in one elementary school in Georgia. Scholastic aptitude was assessed in grade 1, and achievement was assessed in grades 1 and 5. Temperament measurements were obtained from the Temperament Assessment Battery for Children--Teacher Form (TABC) of R. P. Martin (1988). Achievement data were recorded for 77 of the original students when they were in fifth grade. Results  indicate that distractibility, activity level, and approach tendency were related to achievement in both years, with the relationship for distractibility most evident. Results support the hypothesis that temperament has important effects on learning, suggesting that high distractibility and activity level in the first grade are risk factors for poor achievement in later elementary school grades.

The 4MAT system is a curriculum delivery model developed by B. McCarthy that incorporates research by D. Kolb in the fields of learning styles and brain dominance. The model identifies four dominant learning styles, each assumed to be present in approximately 25% of the population. The model is graphically displayed as four quadrants with the axes representing two major functions that determine how each individual learns; specifically, the axes represent means of perceiving information (sensing and feeling versus thinking) and means of processing information (doing versus watching). The research performed for this study  was designed to determine the effects of the 4MAT system on teachers' attitudes about differences in students' learning styles and students' and teachers' perceptions of the efficacy of the system. A total of 14 units of study based on the 4MAT model were developed, and six were retained for use in this study. Teacher and student questionnaires and teacher follow-up interviews were used upon completion of the unit to determine curriculum effects on 31 teachers and 572 students involved in the study. Results indicate that the system was received well by both students and teachers. The 4MAT Research Project Teacher Interview Schedule, Teacher Survey, and Student Survey are included; and summaries of the responses are provided. (TJH)",

The first lecture was a fact-based description of instructional formats, and the second lecture discussed theories of motivation. Before each lecture, the subjects received either complete or skeletal notes concerning the lecture. After each lecture, students reviewed their notes and then completed a 10-point examination, which assessed application, analysis, and knowledge of instruction objectives. Subjects also completed a brief rating scale assessing the usefulness of the notes provided to them. The  best performance on the posttest occurred after the more information-based lecture, with performance on the knowledge portion of the posttest also significantly better. The type of notes appeared to have little effect. No long-term recall was measured. Lecture complexity appeared to be a variable that might be more carefully considered in future research on instructor-provided notes. One table summarizes posttest results. (Author/SLD)",

The acceptance of small effect sizes for biomedical research is contrasted with the rejection of similar effect sizes for psychological research. The Binomial Effect Size Display is used to depict the practical magnitude of an effect size regardless of whether the dependent variable is dichotomous or continuous. Other topics discussed include: (1) the meaning of successful replication, including successful replication of Type II errors; (2) reporting results of replications, including tests of significance; (3) meta-analytic procedures; (4) sampling bias; (5) overemphasis on single values and disregard of details; (6) problems of heterogeneity of  method and quality; (7) problems of independence of responses within a single study and within sets of studies; and (8) exaggeration of significance levels. Several benefits of meta-analysis are outlined. It is concluded that many findings of psychological research are neither small nor practically unimportant. Nevertheless, it is also concluded that in the areas of replication and of the cumulation of research findings much remains to be done. Eight data tables and one graph are provided.

        "description":"This longitudinal study focused on predicting student outcomes through multiple test scores and vocational preferences using standardized instruments and self-reports of career plans. A total of 444 students in the class of 1986 were enrolled in either a non-vocational or vocational curriculum at one of 4 high schools in a small, rural, working-class school district during the 4 academic years between 1982-83 and 1985-86 and completed from 1 to 4 standardized tests as part of the district's comprehensive testing program. Three hundred and fourteen of these students actually graduated in 1986; these graduates were all administered the Differential Aptitude Test, Ohio Vocational Interest Survey, California Achievement Test, and Stanford Achievement Test; and they were mailed a  follow-up questionnaire. Using the stepwise method of discriminant analysis to predict group membership, classification efficiency ranged from 61% to 74%, indicating that a significant portion of the class might have benefited from an alternative curriculum. Career choice and actual plans were more likely influenced by socioeconomic status, rural location, and expressed vocational preference than by actual test scores. Results suggest that some of the non-vocational students might have been more successful in a vocational curriculum. School counselors must help students achieve more congruence between test scores, expressed vocational choice, and their mitigating environmental circumstances. Four data tables and a 23-item list of references are included. (Author/TJH)",

Textbook views and recommendations regarding the use of these two types of multiple comparisons are summarized. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and related methods remain popular, although other methods are sometimes more useful and although the frequency of use of these methods in published research is declining. Researchers conducting an ANOVA frequently conduct unplanned or post hoc tests to determine exactly where statistically significant group differences actually arise. Various methodologists have referred to this practice as &quot;fishing&quot;,&quot;milking&quot;, or &quot;data snooping&quot;. It is widely known that planned multiple comparisons have greater statistical power than do unplanned multiple comparisons. Secondly, and more importantly, planned comparisons tend to make the researcher think in advance. Graduate study in statistics should reflect the importance of planned versus post hoc statistical design. In addition, there is a need for further investigation of current statistics textbooks being used in the different schools of education, business, and the behavioral sciences to determine if the issue of planned versus post hoc tests is being adequately addressed in instructional materials. A 63-item list of references, 4 data tables, and a list of selected computer control cards are included. (TJH)",

This study documents some key events leading to the passage of Proposition 98 and the subsequent implementation of the report cards. Events leading up to Proposition 98 include the publication of numerous national reports indicating the failure of public schools in the United States, the passage of the Hughes-Hart Education Report Act of 1983, a study in 1987 by Policy Analysis for California Education describing the poor state of financing in state public schools, and the institution of annual statewide and individual school performance reports. Proposition 98  requires more detailed reports of school performance and characteristics than were previously required and sets minimum funding levels for public schools and community colleges. The California State Department of Education and the Association of California School Administrators developed models of school accountability report cards; these models are compared and contrasted. The role of the California Parent-Teacher Association is also discussed. Overall, the program has been a cooperative effort involving legislators, bureaucrats, administrators, teachers, and parents, and the system of accountability that results will likely be achieved through numerous political compromises. Even so, the experience presumably still has value in getting people to work together for positive ends.  (TJH)",

America's state and federal governments spend more than $150 billion a year on programs to alleviate poverty, yet poverty continues to be a problem. Weaknesses within the centralized welfare system contribute significantly to the persistence of poverty in America. The following recommendations are offered: (1) the welfare system must be treated as a system; (2) no &quot;national&quot; welfare reforms should be proposed or supported without first being locally tested; (3) reform goals should be adopted that comprehensively define federal requirements for reform,  allow maximum flexibility for state- and community-based reform efforts, and retain the current federal-state financing commitments; (4) the Federal Government should initiate a program of widespread, long-term experiments in welfare policy through state-sponsored and community-based demonstration projects; and (5) legislation should be proposed to implement the experimental program and ensure that its useful results are gradually incorporated into the national public assistance system. The report discusses findings, the potential for reform, and the proposal for a new national welfare strategy. Section I is the President's call for action. Section II describes the features and failures of the current system. Section III analyzes the weaknesses in the system and describes the potential  for reform. Section IV presents the new strategy and proposes policy goals. Data are illustrated on 12 tables and figures. Sixty notes are included. (BJV)",

        "description":"This report provides an overview of the current welfare system. The number and size of federal public assistance programs have increased during the past 25 years, with particular growth in noncash benefit programs, which now constitute about three-quarters of all means-tested assistance. From mid-1983 to mid-1984, more than 52.5 million Americans benefited from federal assistance. The total funding for the 59 major programs reached $132 billion in fiscal year 1985. This effort reduced the poverty rate by 42 percent, from 12.8 to 7.4 percent. But the effect upon poverty by the welfare system was not achieved efficiently. Before any means-tested benefits were counted, it would have taken $51.6 billion to bring the general poverty rate down to zero. Weaknesses within the centralized  welfare system that contribute significantly to the persistence of poverty in America are identified. On top of an order of self-reliance, family support, community charity, and state and local public assistance has grown a federal component of great size. The federal component has introduced disorder, a wide array of rules and purposes without overall coordination, and a general practice of making programs blind to the effects of other non-cash programs. As a result the United States spends more than it would take to eliminate poverty entirely, and yet a residual poverty gap of $19.1 billion remains. Data are illustrated on 23 tables and figures. Notes are included. An appendix documents public assistance spending from 1960 to 1985. (BJV)",

        "description":"The study reported in this document found no evidence for the minicipal overburden (m/o) hypothesis of urban school finance. The theory asserts that there is a causal relationship between high levels of non-school municipal expenditure or tax rates and low levels of school spending. Demand for expenditure on education in a sample of school districts in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Virginia was estimated using a median voter model and the hypothesis was tested by including in the estimating equation several versions of a variable representing municipal overburden. The following conclusions are reported: (1) m/o does not influence the demand for expenditure on education are demand for municipal services and demand for education are influenced by much the same factors, so that where  the demand for one is high the demand for the other is also likely to be high; (3) demand for education behaves similarly to demand for any other good in that the quantity demanded responds positively to income and negatively to price, with elasticities that are within the expected range for a good that absorbs an appreciable fraction of income, for which quantity can be varied, and for which there are substitutes; (4) proxies for preferences also play expected roles; (5) federal and state aid influence demand for education in ways that are not satisfactorily explained by either the income-constraint expanding role or the &quot;flypaper&quot; mode; and (6) none of the forces often alleged to lead &quot;inexorably&quot; to high expenditures for municipal functions is found to do so. Two tables of statistical  data are included. A discussion of the methodology used to estimate the demand for municipal services, details of the regressions used as tests of the municipal overburden hypothesis, and a list of five references are appended.

The following sets of economic data are updated: (1) earnings of family heads; (2) young family incomes; and (3) poverty rates. The findings of this report indicate that where the situation did improve from 1986 to 1987, it improved very little, and that in some important respects the situation worsened. The following trends are discussed: (1) the poverty rate among children living in young families continued to rise in 1987; (2) the median earnings for all heads of families younger then 30 with children fell by more than 36 percent from 1973 to 1987; (3)  a 24.4 percent plunge from 1973 to 1987 in median income for young families with children because of lower earnings for family heads and increasing number of single-parent families; (4) in 1987 the median income of the nation's 1.3 million young black families for the first time fell below the amount needed to keep a 4-person family out of poverty; and (5) the proportion of births to young women who received late or no prenatal care increased from 1976 to 1987. The following measures are recommended to help young families: (1) an increase in the federal minimum wage; (2) the enactment of the Act for Better Child Care Services (ABC); (3) the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC); (4) an extension of Medicaid coverage to reach all poor and near-poor pregnant women and children;  and (5) a continuation of building upon the successes of proven, cost-effective programs such as Head Start, Chapter 1, WIC, and the Job Corps.

As many as 736,000 persons are estimated to be homeless on any given night, and between 1.3 million and 2 million different individuals may experience homelessness at some point during the year. The following characteristics of the homeless are outlined: (1) families comprise about 25 to 33 percent of the homeless population, the majority of which are female-headed; (2) mentally-ill individuals and alcohol or substance abusers comprise 50 percent of the homeless; and (3) the remaining 25 percent of the homeless population includes employable individuals, those for whom some form of training is required  before employment, and small segments comprised of the elderly, the physically disabled, and veterans. The following strategies are suggested: (1) expand the supply of low-income housing; (2) preserve the existing subsidized housing stock; (3) reassess welfare allotments; (4) improve single-room occupancy (SRO) housing; (5) reduce housing costs through innovative design and regulation; (6) create alliances among public, private, and nonprofit housing providers; and (7) develop counseling and assistance programs for those at risk of homelessness.

        "description":"This essay, written from the point of view of a social researcher with a direct personal involvement in the cases studied, discusses how public schools, as universally accessible moral communities, engage in patterns of systematic exclusion. Through three case studies of public secondary schools in which groups of students have been situated outside the schools' boundaries, this theoretical analysis considers educational ideologies of &quot;merit,&quot;&quot;choice,&quot; and &quot;tradition&quot; as they have justified moral exclusion. The following schools were involved in the case studies: (1) Comprehensive High School (New York, New York); (2) Dwight Morrow High School (Englewood, New Jersey); and (3) Central High School (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). The following aspects of each case study are  discussed: (1) school characteristics; (2) the exclusion issue; (3) the ideologies used to cover up the exclusion practices; (4) the researcher's role in resolving each exclusion problem; and (5) the decisions concerning the exclusion problem. Across the schools, students were being educated within publicly sanctioned communities of exclusion, sheltered from a rich education of diversity and critique. The analysis contained in this essay challenges scholars and practitioners interested in public education to probe beneath the surface of ostensibly neutral ideologies, and to expose the dynamics of moral exclusion shadowed by some liberal arguments voiced ostensibly for the &quot;common good.&quot; A list of 20 references is included.

        "description":"Drug and alcohol abuse and teenage pregnancy are two behaviors manifested by at-risk children that are both a cause and a result of their lack of success in school and possible subsequent dropping out. The distinction between substance use and abuse may be determined using the following criteria: (1) age of onset; (2) physiological responses; (3) levels of dependence; (4) attitudes about substance use; and (5) effects on other areas of functioning. The following factors predict drug and alcohol experimentation: (1) parental drug use, absence, and lack of consistent parenting; (2) early antisocial behavior; (3) school problems; (4) peer drug use; (5) attitudes, beliefs, and personality traits; and (6) stress. Teen pregnancy has become a national epidemic because more teenagers  keep and raise their children at great individual, family, and societal costs. While the national average age of first sexual intercourse is 16 years, the average age for initiating sexual activity for some groups of urban youth is as young as 11.6 years. Disadvantaged minority youth account for a disproportionate number of teen pregnancies and births. The following factors influence early pregnancy and parenthood: (1) expectations for the future; (2) poor academic achievement; (3) ignorance about reproduction; and (4) family influences. Teenage childbearing has serious negative effects on the mother and on the child's health, as well as on the educational attainment and employment of both parents.

Denver School District, Hispanic students are more segregated today than they were 20 years ago, and gaps between the educational attainment and earnings of Hispanics and non-Hispanics continue to widen. The nation's Hispanic population has grown almost five times faster than the non-Hispanic population and is heavily concentrated in certain regions and major cities. Recent enrollment studies show an increase in the number of Hispanics who attend heavily segregated schools, a fact attributed to rising Hispanic enrollment and the disproportionate concentration of Hispanics in urban school districts with large minority enrollments and a lack of any significant desegregation initiatives. Hispanic parents and leaders have not insisted  on integration, as have many Blacks, because they believe that Hispanic children are better served in a predominantly Hispanic school with extensive bilingual services. The following trends indicate a need for desegregation: (1) many students in predominantly Hispanic schools are not receiving the bilingual education entitled to them under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (2) Hispanics have the highest dropout rate of any minority group; and (3) few Hispanic students are prepared for college in the same way that White and Asian students are.

Cultural deprivation was originally considered the single cause of at-risk status. Subsequently, educational deprivation was considered the primary cause. Another cause was thought to be the failure of all social institutions charged by society with educating youth. The current definition of at-risk status is the probability that the student will fail academically. A new definition of at-risk status must incorporate all of the factors that put a student at-risk, including the influence of family and ommunity. Acknowledging the  influence of home, school, and community highlights the need for comprehensive academic and non-academic program strategies that serve students throughout their school careers. The following factors are associated with exposure to inadequate educational experiences: (1) poverty; (2) race and ethnicity; (3) family composition; (4) mother's education; and (5) language background. The highest concentrations of at-risk students are in urban centers and rural areas; roughly 40 percent of the school-aged population can currently be considered at-risk and the number is certain to increase. The problem of restructuring schools to meet the needs of at-risk students is one of developing an environment, programs, and services that will provide appropriate educational experiences. Making schools more  responsive to at-risk students will be difficult for the following reasons: (1) unique family backgrounds and school experiences of the students; (2) the responsibility of schools for a diverse array of educational goals; (3) society's need for highly skilled workers; (4) increased number of at-risk students; and (5) imprecise nature of education. A list of seven references is appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"Career Beginnings (CB) is a national program begun in 1985 to increase the likelihood of minority and other disadvantaged urban students to participate in postsecondary education or to obtain a good job. CB unites high schools, businesses, and local colleges in working partnerships to develop the potential of moderately-achieving high school students and help them overcome their social and educational deficiencies by exposing them to the college environment and the world of work in a personal way. The program provides the following services: (1) college and career preparation; (2) summer and school-year work experience; (3) academic tutoring; (4) counseling and support services; and (5) individual guidance and encouragement from adult mentors from the business and professional  communities. Participants are targeted during the beginning of their junior year in high school and attend a series of structured workshops to assist them make the transition from youth to adulthood. Each student is matched with a mentor who meets with the student at least once a month to discuss career and college planning. Students have the opportunity to work in entry-level jobs with career potential to teach them the demands of the workplace. Ongoing advising, advocacy, and counseling is provided year-round to keep the student focused on his/her goals. In the first three years of the program, 95 percent of the participants graduated from high school, 65 percent attended college, and 80 percent of those students completed their second year of college. In October 1988, 90 percent of the  graduates were either in college, enrolled in training programs, in the military, or on the job.

Each new skill can then be practiced in role playing sessions in which a student takes the part of the counselor and the instructor takes the part of the counselee. As student proficiency increases, the skills can be practiced in a \"fish bowl\" session in which students assume the parts of counselor and counselee and the rest of the class observes and assists the counselor in dealing with a real-life concern of the counselee.

Samples of 25-35 year old men and women for 1970 and 1985 drawn from the March &quot;Demographic File&quot; editions of the Current Population Survey (CPS) were analyzed. The following factors were examined: (1) differential fertility declines across educational groups; (2) the extent to which the status of children improves as birth rates regain equilibrium; and (3) the gap between the educational level of parents and the educational level of the workplace at large. The following findings are reported: (1) a decrease in the number of children in two-parent families was the most important factor contributing to the declining economic status  of children, followed by an increase in the number of children in female-headed families and a decline in the economic status of less-educated working parents; (2) a projected 35 percent increase in the number of children in two-parent families due to postponed childbearing would have only a modest effect on the overall economic status of children; and (3) the gap between the educational level of parents and the educational level of the workplace widened modestly, probably due to the increased number of female family heads who are high school graduates.

        "description":"Implementing the principle of equal pay for work of comparable value, usually called \"pay equity\" or \"comparable worth,\" should not be a major problem for either the public or private sectors. Information was analyzed from a survey of 24 State and local public sector employers involved in the implementation of pay equity, telephone interviews with 15 private sector employers involved in the implementation of pay equity in 9 different industries, and personal interviews with a cross-section of 15 other private sector employers about their views on pay equity and its prospects for voluntary implementation. Three brief case studies were also developed from the public sector sample to provide fuller information on costs and the complex processes involved. The following conclusions  are outlined: (1) the experience of the public sector indicates that improvements in equity are making moderate increases in proportion to the employers' ability to pay, and that implementation becomes less difficult over time; (2) accurate cost estimates are impossible to obtain because the issues involved are still emerging and fear of lawsuits inhibits the flow of information in the private sector; (3) costs will be influenced by the extent of pay equity remedies and the reliability of job evaluation methods; (4) prospects for voluntary implementation in the private sector are likely to improve as more employers implement plans creating competition for labor; and (5) private employers appear to be committed to pay equity as a good business practice. The following material is appended:  (1) five tabular summaries of the public sector survey responses; (2) the 1982 New York State Salary Table used in the public sector survey; and (3) a copy of the public employer survey questionnaire.

The partnership's definition of literacy included critical thinking, problem-solving, oral communication, and interpersonal skills, as well as the ability to read, write, and compute. The following recommendations were made: (1) reach consensus on the definition of literacy, based on the context in which it is to be used; (2) ensure linkage with a broad base of employees; (3) facilitate an education process with the partnership on literacy; (4) identify industry managers who are well educated about their  own work force training needs and skill levels; (5) confirm that the manufacturing division and the training staff within the company are linked to ensure that they have the same perception of needed training; (6) identify one focal person from each partner, and then use others as resource people; and (7) set realistic goals in the management of change for all partners. The partnership conducted a needs assessment, developed a basic literacy skills and English-as-a-Second-Language curriculum, and delivered the instruction. Two important elements in all of the courses included the use of job-related materials and curriculum modules for short-term and flexible scheduling of classes. (CML)",

The five guides include (1) a general guide to the development of trainer competency for the creation of effective small business training programs; (2) a guide to the basic competency requirements for developing training programs to stimulate pre-start-ups; (3) a guide to the basic competency requirements for developing effective training programs to assist small business start-ups;  (4) a guide to the competency requirements for developing training programs for businesses under 50 employees; and (5) a guide for trainers to help small firms cope with the creation of the European Market in 1992. A topic of workshops at the conference was the small business trainers and training organizers who need to improve their competencies and the main obstacles encountered when trying to do so. Ways that the guides could be used to improve training competencies were examined. Finally, amendments to make the guides more accessible were suggested. (KC)",

The study found that schools serving disadvantaged populations and schools with relatively large enrollments enrolled fewer handicapped students in vocational education overall and fewer handicapped students in mainstream vocational education courses. These schools also provided fewer vocational education offerings to nonhandicapped students, although the trend was more pronounced with handicapped students. Some of the explanations for these findings are that small  schools are friendlier and more accepting of disabled students, that the climate of small schools fosters a sense of community that carries over to their treatment of handicapped students, and that larger, older schools have more traditional programs and are more reluctant to incorporate handicapped students into the regular vocational curriculum. In addition, schools with large percentages of disadvantaged students may have fewer financial resources and/or may use their resources to serve the disadvantaged population and not handicapped students.

        "description":"From July 1985 through September 1987, the County of San Diego, California, operated the Saturation Work Initiative Model (SWIM) as a demonstration project. The demonstration tested the feasibility and effectiveness of requiring ongoing participation in employment-related activities by a high proportion of persons on welfare. SWIM provided job search and unpaid work experience. SWIM also included some of the features emphasized in the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program of the Family Support Act of 1988: the program required ongoing participation as long as people remained on welfare, had monthly participation goals, and included education and training among its services. One goal of the SWIM demonstration was to determine whether the program had an impact  on employment and welfare dependence and whether the approach proved cost-effective. The random assignment research design included a sample population of 2,312 recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children in the experimental group and 2,302 in the control group--two-thirds of all who registered during the first year of SWIM. The study found that SWIM's effects on employment, earnings, and welfare receipt were encouraging, particularly for single parents who were already receiving welfare when they came into the program, and principal earners in two-parent welfare cases. For the single parents, SWIM produced gains in employment and earnings that were larger than those observed in any study of a program serving the full range of Work Incentive-mandatory caseload. For the principal  earners (primarily male) in two-parent households, SWIM provided the first evidence of sustained earnings gains. For both groups, SWIM also resulted in notable welfare savings.

The surveys were completed by 331 parents, 1,454 students, 154 vocational teachers, and 29 administrators. More than 85 percent of students and a smaller majority of parents (73 percent) perceived vocational education to have three purposes: to explore occupational areas, to develop general skills for later use at home or on the job, and to prepare for employment in specific occupations. The education level of the parents appeared to influence their perceived choice of purpose for vocational education; parents with less college education indicated more often that one of the purposes of  vocational education was to prepare students for technical school. Approximately three-fourths of the students and four-fifths of the parents surveyed recommended that students take a vocational course, especially for the purpose of career exploration. Parents and students who did not recommend taking at least one vocational course cited choice of subject or that it was not necessary for college. Three-fourths of the parents had favorable opinions about vocational education. Nonvocational students did not enroll because of lack of interest and lack of time. The study recommended more teacher recruitment; more accessibility to the vocational education curriculum; more public relations activities to educate parents, students, and the community about the benefits of vocational education;  additional vocational guidance; and other actions to increase enrollment in vocational education.

        "description":"Programs and curricula in vocational education in Taiwan have traditionally been linked to the nation's priority of economic development. The current vocational education system originated in the 1950s. In the 1970s, public free education was extended from 6 years of elementary school education to include an additional 3 years of junior high school. Vocational education at the junior high level was phased out, with all vocational education being placed at the senior high level. By 1980, enrollment in vocational education programs accounted for 68 percent of secondary school enrollments. New curriculum standards, implemented in 1986 for industrial and marine education and in 1988 for agricultural, business, nursing, and home economics education, stressed a broader academic  foundation and technical skill competency. In 1989, more than a half million students were enrolled in vocational schools and 20 percent of employees were vocational school graduates. Recent social changes, such as a shortage of workers in traditional and high technology industry, the overburdened school curriculum, and changing career and education expectations of students, have led to new national education policies. The Ministry of Education has extended public free education from 9 to 12 years. The 12-year free public education system will begin for students entering senior high and vocational schools in 1993. According to projections, more than 60 percent of high school students will choose to attend vocational schools. (The document includes an appendix with nine statistical tables  and figures.) (CML)",

One thousand twenty surveys, in packets of 20 each, were mailed to 50 ABE state directors and the District of Columbia director of ABE. Eighty-one percent of the directors indicated they would foward the surveys to programs within their states and the district. Of the 840 questionnaires forwarded and presumably disseminated to teachers through local program coordinators, 51 percent of the questionnaires were completed. The respondents can be characterized as predominantly female (83.3 percent), college-educated (93.9 percent), and teacher-certified  (87.4 percent). Their average age was 45.08 years, they had taught ABE an average of 8.32 years, and they spent an average of 11.94 hours in test-related activities each month. The following were among the findings reported: (1) the teachers perceived testing as most effective for functions that relate directly to initial student placement, selction of appropiate instructional materials, and instructional planning; (2) the repondents believed that the use of formal testing entails costs for students, programs, and instruction, due to student anxiety and problems of self-esteem and motivation; (3) formal testing was most often used by respondents for the purpose of starting students at the right level; and (4) 78 percent of respondents rated their programs' use of formal testing as  effective.

        "description":"This document describes a mathematical model designed to produce a weighted, standardized index that can be used to represent a statistically unbiased measure of a Future Farmers of America (FFA) chapter's level of activity in relation to other chapters in Ohio. The index, called the FFA Chapter Activity Index, is expected to be applicable to other states as well. The case for the new model is that the self-report instruments that have previously been used to collect data about the activity level of a chapter often produce biased or inaccurate information. The paper explains the model components and specifically how to compute the index by (1) calculating a weighted coefficient equal to the number of FFA members in the chapter divided by the number of instructors in the  agricultural education department; (2) calculating a standardized score that represents the chapter members' state degree and district proficiency awards; (3) calculating a standardized score that represents the chapter's placing in the various agricultural skills contests; (4) calculating a standardized score that represents the chapter's participation in the various chapter awards programs; and (5) summing the three standardized scores and multiplying the result by the weighting coefficient. The mathematical model eliminates the reliability concerns raised by the older instruments; for example, if the same set of data is substituted into the model several times it always produces the same result. Good content validity as rated by a panel of experts is indicated. Two examples are given  to explain the index, and the advantages of the index compared to the more common self-report method of assessing chapters' activities are discussed. Recommendations and six references conclude the document. (CML)",

The paper discusses the salient features of reform in teacher education as mandated by policy groups in at least 46 states. Some of the philosophical underpinnings of vocational teacher education are presented, and their uniqueness within teacher preparation is discussed. The paper addresses issues in vocational teacher education with regard to reform in initial state certification requirements, teacher testing, and program or curriculum changes. Some data on teacher education and vocational teacher education are  included. A proposed framework for determining the knowledge base of vocational teacher education and three alternative, testable models for its delivery are offered. Among the specific recommendations are the following: (1) establish a national commission to examine and study vocational teacher education within a context of education reform; (2) collect data on vocational teacher education; (3) validate the philosophy undergirding vocational teacher education; (4) determine more specifically the effects of mandated reforms on vocational teacher education; (5) determine the knowledge bases for vocational teacher education; and (6) experiment with varying models for delivering vocational teacher education.

        "description":"A study was undertaken to provide a database relative to the missions and objectives for undergraduate programs in agriculture. Over 900 faculty representing 50 randomly selected universities offering undergraduate degrees responded to a mailed questionnaire. Graduating seniors at land grant universities were surveyed. Faculty findings included the following: (1) critical thinking and technical competence were the most frequently supported primary objectives essential to undergraduate education in agriculture; (2) two enabling objectives--written communication and oral communication--received the greatest amount of support; (3) approximately two-thirds indicated that their colleges and respective departments had written mission and objective statements, but only one-half of the  two-thirds reported having a working knowledge of the mission and objectives; and (4) 97 percent agreed that faculty have primary responsibility for monitoring student attainment of undergraduate educational objectives, but there was little evidence to suggest that this is currently occurring on a formal basis. Both faculty and students had very similar perceptions regarding the seniors' technical competence and competence relative to comprehensive application; however, only 72 percent of the graduating seniors thought that they possessed entry-level competence relative to career and job orientation whereas 86 percent of the faculty felt that the students did. Data is displayed in four tables and seven figures. (CML)",

        "description":"Literacy and work force preparedness are two of the most important issues facing education today. Findings of nationwide studies show that reading and writing performance of students is inadequate. One of every eight current workers reads at the fourth-grade level or lower. The nation's economic future will be determined by the quality and competitiveness of the work force in a global context. Adult education has a critical role to play in helping thousands of people to participate fully in an increasingly complex and competitive world. For many, adult education is the critical link to economic self-sufficiency and the key to breaking the cycle of illiteracy. The decade of the 1980s was marked by growth in adult education to meet demands for increased and diversified services,  coalition building among diverse providers, and the infusion of new resources from both the public and private sectors. The decade of the 1990s must see policy, not programs, driving literacy initiatives. There must be informed goal-setting and long-range planning based on identifiable needs. The challenge to the federal government is to establish national policy that provides leadership, coordination, and research in adult education and literacy to guide state and local efforts. Effective adult education programs are those that enable all students to master basic skills; provide relevant courses to meet student, employer, and community needs; strengthen and expand partnership efforts; and set standards of accountability.

Other variables in the study included vocational training administration, vocational training laws and regulations, and vocational training curriculum and instruction. Of 649 questionnaire packets distributed, 420 usable ones were received, a return rate of 64.7 percent. Research findings showed high positive correlations between age and professional satisfaction and working experience and professional satisfaction. Vocational trainers were unhappy about the personnel questions included. They also complained about  recruiting, lack of opportunities for on-the-job training, few chances for promotion, and heavy work loads. Vocational trainers expect real improvement from the current administration. They also expect a social movement to assist in retaining confidence in vocational certificates.

Some 60 conference participants examined various research reports, conducted discussions, and presented papers on three major topics: continuing education and training strategies, current policies and programs, and innovative approaches to technological and economic change. The conference participants concluded that continuing education and training for adults lacks resources and has unequal access, unequal distribution among enterprises of various sizes, and inadequate training techniques and contents. The conference concluded that the approaches lacked consistency. The  following recommendations were made: (1) reforming education and training policies and provisions; (2) formulating a better response to the needs of underprivileged groups; (3) reforming initial education and training systems; (4) using continuing education and training as a local and regional development tool; (5) making industry play its part; (6) developing more rational and more consistent methods of financing; and (7) facilitating the exchange of ideas and experience in the European Community.

        "description":"An examination of the ways in which vocational training can be extended to small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Economic Community, this document consists of: an introduction; four parts containing multiple chapters; 10 case studies; and a bibliography. Following the introduction, which is an update of a report made in 1985, part one defines relevant terms. The three leading characteristics that differentiate small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from larger enterprises (being legally and financially independent, being run by owners, and possessing a relatively small part of the market) are discussed. The economic reality of the SMEs is explained, as well as the concept of &quot;diffusion.&quot; Part 2 deals with the SMEs and their relations with employment, training, and  information. A conclusion is reached that a local approach to the SMEs is needed, which would form the foundations of an information exchange strategy. Part 3 explains communication structures and networks. After the characteristics of communication structures are compared, five principles for action are summarized. Part 4 gives a general framework for an exchange network and six proposals for action to be taken to coordinate information, desegregate information, promote exchange, make CEDEFOP (the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training) a monitoring unit for community exchange, set up a community reference plan, and stimulate and coordinate efforts to organize an exchange network. Case studies of Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Federal  Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom follow. The document concludes with 1 English and 15 French references.

The centers are located in France, the United Kingdom, Italy, West Germany, and Belgium. The study of these centers was based on questionnaire responses and interviews with the administrative and economic experts at each institution and an analysis of the services offered at each. Chapters 1 and 2 describe the study's purposes and the research methods used. Chapter 3 analyzes the education systems within the five countries--with  special reference to education, training, and research in the textiles sector--and contains the case study analyses of the individual centers of excellence. Also in the third chapter appear descriptions of research, development, transfer of technology, and training initiatives taken by the EEC in the textile and ready-made clothing sector. The fourth chapter offers conclusions on the structural criteria for a center of excellence, operating criteria for such a center, the social system levels at which the center should operate, and the criteria for defining a center of excellence. The appendix examines the approach to technology transfer taken in the United States, from which the approaches taken by the studied countries differ.

        "description":"A study looked at the overall situation of the immigrant population, and young immigrants in particular, and analyzed such problem areas as the transition from school to working life and the inadequacies of initial training with relation to the situation in Denmark. The study identified the following problem areas: (1) problems relating to the education of children of migrant workers and (2) problems concerning access to vocational training and the links between success at school, success in vocational training, success in employment, and access to the labor market. Analysis of the data suggested some conclusions among them: (1) there have been signs recently of an official readiness to acknowledge that the immigrants are not merely &quot;guest workers&quot; but form a more permanent part  of the population in Denmark and that a need exists for more systematic treatment of the problems of immigrants; (2) the official Danish policy is of integration; (3) projects have been started to teach Danish as a foreign language; (4) efforts are being made to train immigrants as primary-school teachers to teach in the immigrants' language and help them preserve their culture; (5) changes must be made in Danish attitudes--they had been thought to be tolerant but that may have been true only because immigrants were so few; and (6) expected increases in immigrants for the next 20 years demand planning for education and employment.

        "description":"This document reviews the literature on France's approximately 1.5 million young migrants. The introduction states that it is the second generation of migrants that were studied. In the second chapter, the statistical sources analyzed are explained and general descriptive statistics about foreigners in France are reported, including their numbers, where they come from, their predominant nationalities, where in France they live, and their economic role. Chapter 3 analyzes particular problems of the young migrants, including their education, transition to work after leaving school, vocational training, patterns of employment and unemployment, and cultural integration. Chapter 4 recapitulates the studies' findings and makes several proposals. Among them are that (1) a system of  information and training for parents be developed to reduce the gap between them, their children, and institutions; (2) cultural institutions--even &quot;cultural cafes&quot;--be used to help orient young people where they are rather than where adults would like them to be; (3) vocational preparation should become an instrument specifically designed to facilitate integration; (4) closer links be forged between the training systems and employment policy; and (5) wider application of alternative training, modular training structures, and recognition of skills already acquired. The document concludes with a list of reverse acronyms and 62 references, most of which are in French. (CML)",

Analysis of the data suggested some conclusions, among them: (1) the question of vocational training for ethnic minorities and migrant young people cannot be separated from an understanding of the  position these groups have come to occupy in British society; (2) contrary to many assumptions, these young people are highly motivated and at least as able as those to whom they can be reasonably compared; (3) these youths represent a demand for high quality skill training that is currently unmet; and (4) although a transformation will not occur through training itself, substantial improvements in access and availability will greatly enhance the possibility of equal opportunity in employment.

Material was gathered through the personal experience of the author and from interviews with those responsible for vocational training in various employers' professional organizations, universities, and government structures. The report is organized in three parts. The first part covers employers' involvement in community institutions of the European Community. Organizations profiled include the Standing Committee on Employment, the Advisory Committee on Vocational Training, the European Coal and Steel Community Consultative Committee, the European Social Fund, the Economic and Social Committee, the Tripartite  Conferences, and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training. Pat II examines the role of employers' participation in international institutions beyond the European Community: the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the International Labour Organization, the Council of Europe, and the Union of Industries of the European Community and the Employers' Liaison Committee. Part III looks at employers' participation in vocational training policy development in the various sectors of the economy, such as in agriculture, in metal industries, in the construction sector, and in the services sector.

        "description":"This document describes the current links between the world of work (employees, employers, industrial sectors, and companies) and the world of vocational training (in-company, inter-company, and school-based training bodies) in member states of the European Community; and the degree and nature of the involvement of the social partners in the development, implementation, administration, and control of training programs, including the scale and nature of state intervention. The industries in which these relationships were studied were the construction, metal working, electronics, insurance, and banking industries. The following research questions were among those addressed: (1) Why is it important to increase the participation of the social partners in decision making?; (2) Under  what conditions can such participation be a positive contribution?; and (3) What are the major obstacles to greater participation? Following an introduction, the second chapter describes the current situation against a background of social, economic, and technological changes. The third chapter analyzes the situation in member states, including the participation of workers in their organizations; their participation at local, regional, and national levels; the participation of sector-specific organizations; the various forms of social dialogue; the role of the state in the social dialogue; the autonomy of the organizations of social partners; vocational training as a subject of the social dialogue; and preliminary results from the analysis. The fourth chapter takes up problems and  prospects of developing the social dialogue. A 15-item bibliography concludes the document. (CML)",

Chapter 2 outlines the Dutch system of industrial relations and presents the concept of &quot;neocorporatism.&quot; Chapter 3 identifies national developments that are relevant to employers, employer organizations, and trade unions (the social partners) in relationship to vocational education. Chapter 4 analyzes the degree to which national-level agreements are followed by agreements on the sector and enterprise level and includes examples from the metal and electrotechnical engineering industry, the building industry, and banking. Chapter 5 summarizes the report with 10  developments at the national level, 5 at the local level, and 7 areas of conflict. The national developments include the rise of direct technocratic advising, access of social partners to decision-making circuits with respect to education, decentralization within the trade unions, integration and professionalization of the employers' organizations, changes in the power relations between trade union and employers' organizations, the socioeconomic crisis as a background for consensus between the social partners on the central level, and appeasement through vocational training.

        "description":"A survey of 42 Massachusetts workplace literacy programs was conducted in fall 1989 to determine whether the programs generally fit a standard definition of workplace literacy derived from &quot;A Guide to Developing Instruction for Workforce Literacy Programs&quot; by Jorie W. Philippi. The study's seven-item questionnaire included the definition to which respondents were asked to compare their programs. The questionnaire instructions stated the researchers' suspicion that the definition does not &quot;represent the great variety seen in workplace education in Massachusetts.&quot; Respondents were asked to state how their programs did not fit the definition, if that were the case. Respondents were encouraged to ignore the questions and respond in another manner if the questions were not useful. The  return rate was 64 percent. Most of the practitioners agreed with these elements of the definition: (1) their programs were designed to meet the needs of the organization and the worker by translating learning into improved job performance; and (2) the results of their programs should be measured in terms of job accuracy and productivity, employee retention/promotion, and (lower) accident rates. Most of the respondents believed that their programs differed from the definition in that their programs: (1) had important goals in addition to meeting the goals of the organization and translating learning into improved job performance; (2) had instructional content that did not focus exclusively on basic skills applications that are used in the context of job tasks; and (3) should be evaluated  by measures in addition to job accuracy and productivity, employee retention and promotion, and accident rates. There was a widely held opinion that the definition was too narrow; too constraining; too much like job training rather than education; and not respectful of students', workers', unions', or employers' interests and goals.

Meetings with members of the project's advisory committee and three 1-day conferences involving more than 300 persons and organizations were organized. Five major categories of issues were identified: access, information, networking, accountability and quality, and pedagogy. General recommendations and five specific action strategies were identified. The action strategies included surveying Black elected officials in Boston, planning and implementing a regional conference of minority vocational education personnel, developing a &quot;mobile&quot; career training workshop for executives and personnel working with clients in community-based  organizations in Black and Latino communities, offering a workshop to inform Boston public school counselors of opportunities for minorities in vocational education programs, and developing a proposal for a television program focusing on the minority experience in vocational education. The project staff reported that if some of the strategies and recommendations are adopted and implemented effectively, there may be a significant increase in the acknowledgment of the importance of vocational education in Black and Latino communities, as well as an increase in the number of minority youth expressing some interest in vocational education, leading to a closer look by minority educators and civic leaders at the quality of education being offered in vocational education schools and programs. It  was pointed out that the union community wants to cooperate with minority leaders and parents in regard to vocational education. (CML)",

Coahoma's evening adult basic education program at the Parchman facility lacked key administrative controls such as adequate supervision of teachers, instructional quality control, monitoring the sufficiency of educational  supplies, and providing managerial guidance.

        "description":"A study of Florida's apprenticeship programs was conducted to provide the State Department of Education with relevant program and cost data and also with a discussion of related program issues. Data were collected on site visits to 11 local educational agencies selected for their range of representation of institution size, program size, geographical location, institution type, and unique program characteristics or offerings. A limitation of the study was that, because Florida's funding formulas and operational reporting formats are not organized pragmatically, an accurate programmatic cost analysis is not possible. Therefore, the figures reported were only estimates. The following are among the conclusions reported: (1) in public educational agencies, more funds were attributed  than expenses incurred for apprenticeship programs; (2) there is a lack of clear policies and guidelines on the functions for which the public school systems have responsibility and funding; and (3) current program structures seem to permit potential funding abuse because adequate mechanisms to assure public supervision and control of funding disbursements were not in place. (The report includes 21 tables and figures, 16 references, and 10 appendices comprising more than half of the document and containing research team itineraries for state interviews and site visits, letters and research instruments, various kinds of sample information including information on apprenticeship and on-the-job training programs, and national and state laws regarding apprenticeship.)

An introduction suggests how to use the handbook. Part 1 addresses the situation of young people in transition from school to work, including the importance of better-organized services and programs with a local focus. Seven initiatives in six member states of the European Community are featured. Part 2 discusses education and training for the future, including what is permitted, what is possible, relevant issues  and principles, the needs of young people, local delivery of services, coordinating resources and agencies, and the special problems of nonindustrial areas. Part 3 offers a planned approach to providing services in a coordinated and integrated manner. Part 4 takes up national and community policies, mechanisms, guidelines, policy frameworks, and proposals. Part 5 describes the following seven initiatives mentioned in Part 1: (1) Business School/Technical School in Randers, Denmark; (2) Verbundsystem Oberhausen, West Geramny; (3) Missions Locale for the Transition of Young People to Adult and Working Life in Lorient, France; (4) Mission Locale for the Transition of Young People to Adult and Working Life in La Rochelle, France; (5) Cork Vocational Education Committee/An Chomhairle Oiliuna  (Comtec), Ireland; (6) Contactcentrum Onderwijs Arbeid Limburg, The Netherlands; and (7) Sussex Training (West), England.

        "description":"In late 1986, the Ontario government began a 4-year undertaking to establish a distance education network for northeastern and northwestern residents. The network, Contact North/Contact Nord, uses a full complement of interactive telecommunications systems to make secondary and postsecondary education more accessible regardless of community size or distance from a larger center. At present, 30 access sites exist for the network, with 26 located in communities of fewer than 15,000 people. Every site has an electronic classroom equipped with state-of-the art educational technology linked to network centers in Sudbury and Thunder Bay. As part of the implementation process, a two-part study was conducted. The first phase was designed to collect baseline community data prior to the  full-scale implementation of Contact North/Contact Nord. Information was gathered through local interviewers in each community who sampled 5 percent of the registered voters. The results are presented in this report in profiles of the following: (1) the people served--demographic characteristics; (2) patterns of using formal educational resources prior to the start of Contact North/Contact Nord; (3) attitudes of nonusers toward adult education; (4) community perceptions of accessibility to education resources; and (5) implementation of Contact North/Contact Nord. Extensive tables, statistics, and copies of the survey forms are provided. (KC)",

Principal sources for the study were a survey sent to practitioners in eight countries; country studies on France, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom; and field work involving visits to Belgium, the Netherlands, West Germany, Ireland, and Spain. About 40 databases and information services in 9 EEC countries were investigated, many of which are both accessible to the public and are also processed electronically. The study found that the content of the databases includes description of qualifiers, university courses and courses leading to qualifications, short courses, training institutions and training resources, career guidance and details of  occupations, open learning materials, legislation on vocational education and training, and funding available for training. It also found that public access databases typically need substantial funding and are nearly always supported by public funding. Nevertheless, information provided was fragmented, there was no common pattern of database sponsors and operators, and database operators were isolated from each other. The study also described the main aspects of computerized databases in the context of their content and target clients, the design features of databases, the main issues relating to the demand for training information, and the transfer of information among databases. A possible strategy for the EEC was suggested. (Appendices list the databases visited and provide a glossary  of terms and acronyms.) (KC)",

The population studied was office technology users below the executive level. The project found that the impact of the new information technologies (NITs) is dependent on the following factors: technical characteristics and possible applications, the economic context that produces the objectives or expected results, the organizational set-up, and finally, an important factor, the methods of human resource management and the behavior of the individual and professional groups concerned. The research is organized in three chapters. The first chapter shows how  technology, applications, the context, and the occupational categories have evolved since the 1960s, and how the daily experience of NITs has brought about new concepts of information and changes in patterns of behavior and roles. The second chapter shows how occupational activity has had to redefine its content and cope with a rearrangement of jobs, especially jobs in the banking, insurance, and secretarial sectors. The options offered by the present are highlighted in the last chapter. A 177-item bibliography arranged by country is included. (KC)",

        "author":["King, Elizabeth M."],
        "description":"This study examined how education and postschool vocational training affect the type and extent of labor market participation of women in Peru. It also estimated monetary returns to different levels of schooling, to formal general and technical schooling, and to training. The sample, which comprised more than 5,600 women in urban and rural Peru, was drawn from the Peruvian Living Standard Survey. More than 70 percent of these women were in the labor force at the time of the survey, about 35 percent working in paid jobs. The overall level of female labor force participation in Peru is 72 percent, and this percentage is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The majority (60 percent) of paid female workers are self-employed, but these jobs tend to be very low paying. Women  holding jobs in the public sector are the best paid. In general, the study found that education and training enhance the contribution of women in the labor market. Although education does not increase the participation of Peruvian women in the labor force (and may in fact decrease it), it alters the occupational distribution of female workers by increasing the proportion of women in paid employment. Among paid employees, education is positively related to hourly earnings; the relationship is nonlinear, with primary education showing higher returns than secondary education. The return to postsecondary education appears low and negative, except for the small fraction of women who have earned a diploma. The poor performance of the Peruvian economy since the early 1970s has influenced this  result. (26 references.) (Author/KC)",

        "author":["Pardee, Ronald L."],
        "description":"Job satisfaction, motivation, and reward systems are included in one area of organizational theory. The strongest influence in this area is motivation because it overlaps into both of the other two components. A review of the classical literature on motivation reveals four major theory areas: (1) Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs; (2) Herzberg's Motivation/Hygiene (two factor) Theory; (3) McGregor's X Y Theories; and (4) McClelland's Need for Assessment Theory. Maslow states that people are motivated by unmet needs which are in a hierarchical order that prevents people from being motivated by a need area unless all lower level needs have been met. Herzberg states that satisfaction and dissatisfaction are not on the same continuum and are therefore not opposites. He further states that  the motivational factors can cause satisfaction or no satisfaction while the hygiene factors cause dissatisfaction when absent and no dissatisfaction when present, both having magnitudes of strength. McClelland's need for achievement underlies Maslow's self-actualization. McGregor's Theory Y matches much of Maslow's self-actualization level of motivation. It is based on the assumption that self-direction, self-control, and maturity control motivation. Reward systems must correspond to intrinsic factors if employees are to be motivated. Satisfying extrinsic factors is an all too commonly attempted method for motivating workers, but theory shows that these efforts cannot lead to motivated workers. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"Two studies examined racial differences in regard to childhood sexual experiences and the proportion of wife abuse reported by black and white women. The first study examined the childhood sexual experiences of women (N=501) and the relationship of these experiences to their adult functioning. A majority of women (55%) reported having some type of sexual experience by the age of 14; 24 percent had such experiences with relatives, but when the dictionary definition of incest as sexual intercourse between two persons too closely related to marry legally was used, less than one percent had had incestuous experiences. Neither the occurrence of sexual experiences as children nor the type of sexual partner women may have had was statistically significant for adult functioning. The  results indicated that 67% of the white sample had had sexual experiences as children compared with 36% of the black sample. The second study was a comparative analysis of women (N=312) who were living in an intact marital relationship. The results indicated that 35.5% of the women had been victims of wife abuse in the past year. Thirty-one percent of the black women as compared to 32.2% of the white women reported that their partner had pushed, grabbed, or shoved them during the past year. (ABL)",

Designed to be interactive, the workbook motivates the students to become involved in interpreting their ASVAB scores and completing exercises and charts that help them determine their values, skills, and educational goals while they think about the features they want most in an occupation and career. The workbook uses a comic strip format with exercises which feature four students who are beginning to think about what they will do after graduation. These students consider careers, explore occupations, and begin making decisions and plans. In the section on values, students are asked to pick their most important values. In the  section on interests and skills, students are asked to evaluate which activities they like the most and activities for which they have aptitude. Next, students may choose one activity which they feel they must avoid and must decide how much education or training they are ready or willing to undertake. An appended oversize &quot;Occu-Find chart&quot; in which the previous information and ASVAB scores can be plotted to help determine what occupations are matched to the student, is too large to be reproduced here.

        "description":"There has been considerable conjecture about the psychological effects of the threat of nuclear war. This study examined political, psychological, and educational variables based on previous clinical impressions; survey research and interview observations that might help explain students' levels of concern; and objective knowledge about nuclear war. Three developmental groups (early adolescents, late adolescents, young college students) were included. Subjects included eighth graders (N=195), high school seniors (N=136), and college juniors and seniors (N=186). Several measures were obtained for each respondent which attempted to tap salient political, educational, and psychological predictors of both knowledge and concern about nuclear war. It was proposed that influences on  concern and knowledge about nuclear war might be broadly categorized as distal and static or proximal and dynamic. Since dynamic variables are by definition alterable, it was hoped that they would be found to make the largest contribution to students' concern and knowledge. The results partially supported this view. More educational opportunity through both formal and informal means played a role in increasing students' concern, as did a tendency to be interested in international affairs. The results suggest that there is a critical need for ample opportunities to study, reflect upon, and discuss the complex social realities of nuclear threat for junior high, high school, and college students.

Counseling graduates will be tested on aspects of  gerontological counseling. Suggested topics on counseling older women include: (1) demographics; (2) health issues; (3) mental health; (4) family; (5) mature women and sexuality; (6) widowhood; (7) older women and addictions; (8) resources for older women; (9) other topics such as minority women, elder abuse, effects of work and retirement, older lesbian women, and older women and divorce.

While there has been some improvement in delivering services, and state departments of education have developed guidelines which have helped school programs to function, problems still remain. It is becoming evident that just as there were several mini-epidemics simultaneously involving different populations and substances, stemming the tide of chemical use requires a range of services. These services must include prevention and treatment referral. Successful prevention efforts should include written policies and procedures; establishment of a philosophy based on empirical research; identification of problems and  development of goals; and involvement of community and student groups. Research on drug abuse is available and needs to be used. (Research information on prevention programming by grade level is presented in a chart.

        "description":"The &quot;Being Who You Are&quot; model is an integrative group counseling model for adult women, particularly those who are experiencing loss of control over their lives and/or are depressed and anxious. It was developed for a population of clinically depressed women in a psychiatric hospital. To date, variations of the original model have been presented to diverse women's groups, abused, displaced and/or transitioning women, and career women exhibiting depressive symptoms and low self-esteem. The issue of self-esteem permeates many of the concerns brought to helping professionals by their clients in both individual and group settings. Yet it is often addressed only as a part of a broader issue rather than as being seen as a viable area for possible intervention in and of itself. A  positive self-worth is a critical element of empowerment for women. The model employs these sessions: (1) managing change; (2) becoming aware of negative thinking; (3) discovering the meaning of worth; (4) understanding the concept of self; (5) recognizing cognitive distortions; (6) disputing the internal critic; (7) discovering one's own emotional reality; (8) beginning acceptance of self; (9) owning and appreciating accomplishments; (10) accepting and trusting positive feedback; and (11) maintaining self-esteem.

Clients below a certain threshold of readiness lack the life experiences and personal inclinations needed to make fitting occupational choices. To increase their readiness, a counselor may help these clients develop the decisional attitudes and learn the choice concepts that sustain realistic career planning. To do this, some counselors use an intervention method in which they discuss client responses to items in career development inventories. In one form of this didactic career counseling, counselors use instructional materials that explain the rationales for the items in the Career Maturity Inventory Attitude Scale. The logic for teaching the test as an intervention is that the items state attitudes  which clients should hold. Counselors have adapted these instructional materials for use in group counseling, career development courses, and newsletters. Other innovative ways of teaching the test will appear as more counselors use the item rationales.

The subscale scores were analyzed by discriminant function analysis and the demographic data by chi square analysis. The results displayed unique levels of psychological  symptoms between male/female returners and non-returners. Chi-square analysis illustrated demographic differences between male/female returners and non-returners. Men who returned for counseling evidenced higher levels of somatization and lower levels of anxiety than men who did not return. Women who returned for counseling showed higher levels of obsessive-compulsiveness and hostility and lower levels of anxiety and paranoid ideation than did non-returners.

Survey questionnaires sent to 300 randomly selected Ohio counselors were completed by 210 elementary, middle school/junior high, and secondary counselors, and by 207 principals located at the respective schools. Respondents were asked to estimate the percentage of counselors' work time actually spent on each of nine categories of counselor activities. They also indicated the \"ideal\" percentage of time they would prefer (or that principals  would prefer counselors) to spend on each of the activity areas. The findings revealed that counselors spent over 40% of their time on individual or group counseling. Both counselors and their principals tended to agree in both the actual and ideal distribution of counselor time. Both groups reported a desire to see counselors spend a greater proportion of their time providing direct counseling services. One encouraging finding of the study was the accuracy of the building principals' perceptions of how counselors spent their time and congruence with the counselors' ideal distribution of time.

        "description":"The Teacher Advisor Program (TAP) is an innovative developmental approach to counseling that directly involves teachers as advisors to 18 to 20 students, with whom they meet both individually and in group sessions. An introductory chapter that cites the need for a developmental approach to counseling in contemporary schools and the potential role of teachers in guidance. The second chapter discusses the suitability and limitations of teachers as advisors, and then describes the design and purpose of TAP, discussing the counselor's role in such a program, approaches to building support for TAP among teachers, and critical factors for success of the program. Chapters 3 through 8 present case histories, by participants, of the following teacher advisor programs throughout the  nation: (1) PRIME TIME in Sarasota, Florida middle schools (Bill Highland); (2) OUR TIME in Green Bay, Wisconsin (Sue Todey); (3) TA groups in La Porte, Indiana (Charles Blair); (4) the Middle School Advisory Program in the Collegiate Schools, Richmond, Virginia (Sally Chambers); (5) TAP in Pasco County, Florida (Madonna Wise and Cathy Micheau); and (6) Florida's Model and Pilot Schools (Elizabeth Lawson). The final chapter answers common teacher questions about the program and discusses staff development and training workshops. Appended are developmental guidance units, roles of school personnel in TAP, a sample advisement telephone call, and TAP staff development. References are included. (TE)",

It was hypothesized that Jewish caregivers would make significantly more use of formal services than non-Jewish (usually Christian) caregivers. Two separate data sets were analyzed. The first study, \"Senile Dementia Patients: Mental Health of Caregivers,\" had 239 subjects with complete information from the variables used in the analyses: clinical depression (to measure caregiver's psychological well-being) and the use of formal services (to measure caregiver's behavior). The second study, \"Caring for Spouses with Alzheimer's Disease or Related Disorders: Crisis vs. Adaptation,\" had 228 subjects with complete  information on all variables needed. Hierarchical stepwise regressions were completed with the ethnicity measure entering after all the other independent variables had entered the equation. Results showed that while ethnicity remained a significant predictor of behavior after controlling for the major correlates of the use of formal services, it was no longer a significant predictor of psychological status after controlling for the same independent variables. Discussion focuses on the role of ethnic heritage in determining attitudes toward suffering and willingness to use formal services. (TE)",

This paper raises questions that college and university counseling center professionals need to address regarding this phenomenon. The first section focuses on defining the term \"bulimia\" and its evolution. The second section identifies numerous symptoms that need to be evaluated during assessment and diagnosis. Behavioral, physical, personality, and interpersonal and family characteristics of bulimics are listed. The third section is a succinct discussion of treatment modalities, noting that the consensus of opinion is that a comprehensive multidimensional approach or program is desired. It is stated, however, that when the problem is assessed as unidimensional and specific in a given area, a  single or noncomprehensive program may be effective. To illustrate the variance in size and scope of treatment strategies, a few examples of programs are given. The fourth section raises issues which college and university counseling center professionals need to address, including whether college and university counseling centers should treat clients with bulimia.

In regard to evidence of the relationship of family involvement in school activities to children's academic performance. The paper notes that while research on parent involvement is somewhat limited, a strong correlation between parent participation in school activities and children's achievement and interest in school has been demonstrated in the research that does exist. The document concludes with suggestions drawn from the research literature for the implementation of  effective home-school relationship programs. This resarch has indicated that parent involvement programs are most effective when they include opportunities for a variety of parent involvement and when parental roles are characterized by a balance of power with the school. It has been further indicated that most interactions between families and schools are most likely to be successful when there are increased opportunities for such interactions, when parents and teachers receive training in interpersonal skills, when parents and teachers recognize that they have separate, but complementary role responsibilities for children's well-being, and when schools incorporate families' cultures into their curricula.

        "description":"In order to understand the meaning of wives' labor force participation for dual-earner families and the consequences of that participation, the breadwinner role must be conceptualized more clearly and the concept used more precisely. Researchers must abandon their assumption that all wives who are in the labor force are breadwinners and instead treat the allocation of breadwinning responsibility in dual-earner families as a variable. The breadwinner role should be the subject of research in its own right. Much work is needed before basic questions about the allocation of breadwinning responsibility in dual-earner families can be answered. Questions that need to be answered through carefully designed and conducted research include: (1) the extent of breadwinning responsibility  assigned to employed wives; (2) variation among dual-earner couples in how breadwinning responsibility is allocated; (3) factors influencing the extent to which breadwinner role is shared; and (4) the relative importance of various factors and their interaction. This research would greatly enhance understanding of the meaning of labor force participation in married women's lives. (ABL)",

The aim of this longitudinal study was to assess the relationships between work-role quality, family-role occupancy, and family role quality on one hand and mental and physical health outcomes on the other hand. The results indicated that: (1) among female health-care providers, work-role quality was an important predictor of  mental and physical health measures, particularly subjective well-being, physical health symptoms, and cardiovascular disease; (2) family role occupancy had few direct effects on psychological distress, well-being, or physical symptoms; (3) parent role and partner role quality had direct, but not interactive effects, with subjective well-being; (4) family role quality had both direct and interactive effects with psychological distress and physical health; (5) the subjects showed stability with respect to role occupancy, role quality, and health measures.

This study examined the relationship between multiple-role occupancy and quality and psychological distress in a disproportionate random sample of employed female health care workers (N=403). Subjects were interviewed in their homes or offices about their major social roles, psychological distress, well being, and physical health. The results indicated that there were no negative spillover effects from work to parenting or from parenting to work. Most importantly, there was evidence of positve spillover effects from work to parenting. Women with rewarding jobs were protected from the negative mental health effects of troubled  relationships with their children. Moreover, this protection accrued to employed women regardless of their partnership status or whether they had preschool-age children. These findings suggest mechanisms by which women reap a mental-health advantage from multiple roles, even when some of those roles are stressful. Future research is needed to determine if the findings apply to women employed in non-health care occupations. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"Previous research on the relationship between workplace stressors and physical health symptoms in men has generated such important insights as the importance of job demand or overload to physical health. However, research on women, work and health raises several necessary additions to the paradigm: (1) a focus on the positive aspects of the workplace; (2) possible gender differences in the model; and (3) attention to the impact of family roles. This paper addresses these considerations using data from a disproportionate random sample of 403 employed women ages 25 to 55. Subjects were interviewed in their homes or offices about their major social roles, psychological distress, well being, and physical health. The results indicate that work rewards as well as work concerns are  related to physical health symptoms; helping others at work is an important work reward for this sample which has not been identified in men; for employed mothers, satisfaction with salary is directly related to physical symptoms; and for women in troubled marriages or relationships, deriving reward from helping others at work reduces the impact of relationship problems on physical health. It is important to recognize that men and women operate in the worlds of work and home and that these two worlds affect each other. (Author/ABL)",

Examination of the relationship between life events and psychological distress has been redirected from an early emphasis on major life events to a focus on minor events, i.e., the positive and negative happenings in day-to-day living. This study examined the relationships between rewards and concerns in the employee role and three health measures: psychological distress; psychological well-being; and self-reports of physical symptoms. Subjects (N=403) were a probability sample of health-care providers, i.e., licensed practical nurses and social workers, who varied in partnership and parental status. Subjects were interviewed in their homes or offices  about their major social roles, psychological distress, well being, and physical health. The results indicated that the rewarding aspects of day-to-day life in the employee role have an important effect on health measures and that the relationship of work rewards and work concerns differ both for different health measures and for women in different family-role statuses. Work rewards and work concerns have main effects on psychological distress and physical symptoms, i.e., high work rewards buffered the negative effects of high work concerns on these two measures. For each health measure, the relationship between work rewards and concerns was conditioned by family role status. The effect of work rewards and concerns was conditioned by partnership status; the effect on psychological  distress was conditioned by parental stress. (Author/ABL)",

In the discussion of group process research it is suggested that it remains largely unclear what the relationships are between process variables and member outcomes and what elements comprise each of these assumedly important process variables. The models, means, and methods of group process are discussed. It is noted that the means for conducting observations and descriptions of group process events could be categorized as being events themselves, such as member behaviors or verbal statements. Following this discussion, the \"Group Observer\" (Wilson, 1989),  an automated system for collecting group process observations from the perspective of a variety of process observation models is presented. The Group Observer, currently undergoing field testing, was developed to ease the collection of group process data for research, training, and supervision. Finally, the \"Systematic Rater Training Model,\" designed to enhance the utility of the observational data by increasing the reliability, validity, and motivation of group process observers, is presented. The paper concludes that for group process research to flourish, it will be necessary for researchers to record \"who does what to whom in the process...of their interaction.\" In summary, success depends on the use of carefully trained observers of the group process phenomenon assisted by automated  data recording devices.

A combination of didactic and experiential approaches to learning and to practicing the course material is taken. The approach to learning is based on the integration of theory and practice through the use of experiential learning paradigms. Theoretical perspective provides structure for simplifying and analyzing  particular situations and for implementing and adjusting interventions appropriately. The component of the class in which class members simulate family interactions and their counseling experiences is described in detail. It is asserted that a simulation of family interaction and family therapy can be a useful learning tool, although it takes time and effort beyond normal class structure.

        "description":"The Attendance Improvement Dropout Prevention program (A.I.D.P.) is a state-funded, multi-faceted program designed to provide services to students considered to be at risk of dropping out of school. The elementary school A.I.D.P. program is comprised of six components: facilitation, attendance outreach, guidance, health, school-level linkage, and extended school day and is modeled on the middle school A.I.D.P. program. The implementation of the A.I.D.P. in five schools was reviewed. The evaluation results indicated that all five programs shared certain features. Each program emphasized individual attention to students, and consistent outreach and guidance and counseling services, including phone calls or letters to parents, home visits, and parent conferences. Generally,  elementary school A.I.D.P. programs were successful at reaching parents when an outreach attempt was made, though success rates varied from school to school, depending on the outreach method used. Students in the program tended to improve their attendance, improve or maintain academic achievement levels, and pass to the next highest class at the end of the school year. A small number continued to have trouble passing all their subjects. The findings suggest that the programs should continue and staffing should increase. (ABL)",

        "description":"Within the past decade the role of the primary care physician caring for older patients has expanded to include counseling and \"healthy aging\" education to reduce multiple behavior risk factors. Project AGE WELL was a longitudinal study of the impact of a comprehensive and team delivered health promotion program on the health status of the elderly. Four hundred elderly adults have participated in this program through primary health care or wellness clinics. The AGE WELL staff implemented \"Health Peers\" in 1988. Through this program a group of Health Peers counselors (elderly volunteers) were trained through initial 2-day workshops with monthly update sessions. Preliminary results indicated that Health Peer counselors improved self-esteem and self-efficiency and were successful in  content acquisition. The counselors reached a significant number of elderly peers individually and in groups to distribute important health information to change behavioral lifestyles to reduce risks. Through the Health Watch Of Arizona study in the Sun Cities, AGE WELL staff will train Health Peer counselors to serve as elderly educators within participating primary care physician offices. Health Peers will extend the role of primary care physicians in health promotion and may potentially have impact on \"reaching the unreachable\" for those persons who do not seek regular care.

        "description":"Members of ethnic and racial groups, such as African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, or Native Americans, particularly those who are unemployed and living in low income districts, have continued to struggle to overcome social barriers. A review of the literature reveals that the lack of opportunity or means to overcome social and economic barriers caused by unemployment has precipitated a number of psychological and psychosocial disorders. Unemployed individuals who suffer from such disorders often need professional help. Leisure counseling, an approach whereby individuals are directed to meaningful leisure endeavors, is a process which can retard these negative emotions and behaviors while helping individuals develop feelings of hope. Such a leisure counseling  program consists of: (1) the establishment of client contact; (2) the identification of the client's problem and/or area of need; (3) the identification of the client objectives; (4) the generation of program solutions; (5) the implementation of the program; and (6) continuous program evaluation. To implement such a program, however, decision makers of society must become sensitive to the existing need of this population for programs of this kind and public funds must be allocated to assure implementation.

        "description":"Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the functional theories of attitudes. These theories assume that there are certain individualistic needs that are being met by one's attitudes, and that these attitudes allow the individual to implement certain plans to attain certain goals. This study examined whether source characteristics (i.e., likability) and argument quality (i.e., strength) might serve different functions for high and low self-monitors. Subjects (N=103), undergraduates who were classified as high or low self-monitors, were assigned to experimental conditions of a 2 (source of message; likable or dislikable) x 2 (argument strength; strong or weak) factorial design. Overall, the results of this study generally supported the hypotheses that peripheral cues and  message quality have different effects as a function of self-monitoring and, thus, perhaps as a consequence of different functions of attitudes for these two types of individuals. These findings have several implications especially for researchers investigating attitudes and persuasion processes. It appears that source characteristics and argument strength have functionally different effects on high and low self-monitoring individuals in the amount of attitude change experienced and in the mode of cognitive processing performed on a persuasive message.

        "description":"Although all people experience interpersonal conflicts in their lives, peer conflicts play a particularly important role for adolescents. Undergoing rapid cognitive, physical, and social changes, adolescents' peers assume increasing importance in their lives. The study reported in this paper focused on peer conflict among adolescents in order to examine how factors in a conflict affect one's beliefs about fairness. Subjects, 40 inner-city 7th graders, were interviewed and asked to describe a peer conflict, responding to questions about causes and progression of the conflict, perceptions of their opponent, and their beliefs about fair and unfair behavior. The findings indicated that: (1) conflicts pervaded adolescents' lives, offering opportunities for self-protection, social  status, personal growth, interpersonal insight, conflict resolution, and heroic drama; (2) adolescents lacked conflict proficiency, and reacted instinctively; (3) peer conflict for adolescents had a different meaning than for adults, rendering adult intervention intrusive; and (4) one-third of the respondents may have been morally isolated from both peers and adults and may have been at risk for socially irresponsible living. Adults close to adolescents are well situated to offer adolescents a wider and richer moral perspective. Systematic attention to adolescents' peer conflict would not only enrich psychological knowledge of adolescence and counsel productive approaches to establish intergenerational links, but it also has the potential to effect social change.

An evaluation of PIP focused on its planning and implementation and determined the program's effectiveness in meeting its goals. Eighteen PIP programs were evaluated. The results of the evaluation indicated that generally all PIP programs were implemented as planned. There was a variation in the activities offered by component, school level, and type of program organization. Parents participating in PIP included those targeted by the policy statement; that is, they were parents of: children at risk in academic performance; children living in temporary housing;  children with medical and health needs; and children in underserved areas with high concentrations of ethnic and/or racial minorities. Almost unanimously, coordinators and providers reported that PIP was effective in increasing parent involvement. Effective PIP programs used a school-based coordinator, had school staff who contributed their knowledge and expertise, included social gatherings, offered activities as a series of workshops, presented activities in parents' schools, employed funding from public and private agencies, and offered activities to meet needs of target parent populations.

Print will be introduced naturally and continuously used throughout all developmental stages. Future reading programs will be activity oriented, with ample opportunities for verbal, written and artistic expression. The teacher will teach most of the process strategies for reading in the environmental context. Molding and shaping of the best qualities of past and present programs into a new way of organizing and teaching will enhance program building. Teachers need a reorientation of their own perspectives and beliefs about  reading and how it should be taught in order to select and fuse together ideas and techniques which are suitable for their own style. The teaching role becomes one of creating the environment and atmosphere, of leading students, mediating between them and the text, and being inductive in their approach. In this way, teachers will create an environment where reading becomes a discovery process. A program such as this can happen when and where teachers are given the freedom to create in a supportive environment. (One table of comparisons is included.) (MG)",

Most thinking about how to educate people for work, whether in school or elsewhere, is as outdated as an old-fashioned assembly line. Job-related training and education bear directly on individual opportunity and on the competitiveness of U.S. employers. Even though U.S. employers spend $30 billion a year on formal training, this is only enough to train 10 percent of employees. Job-related training and education are unevenly distributed among the population, with managers and professionals getting a bigger share than other types of workers, and the college-bound  getting a bigger share than other types of students. For the 1990s, the work force must be equipped to learn; prepared for change; prepared to apply new technology; competent, skilled, motivated, and fulfilled; and valued, developed, and renowned as a national resource. The American Society for Training and Development adds its voice to many raised in concern for the potential of the U.S. work force. The society supports work-related learning as a lifetime undertaking and makes recommendations to educators, employers, and legislators. (KC)",

The purpose of the study was to determine how the British are improving their services to meet the needs of the rapidly increasing population of the elderly in an era of slow growth of public spending. The analysis showed the presence of some types of innovation particularly suited to improve efficiency: (1) more intensive inputs of home care delivered at more appropriate times; (2) plans organized by social service departments using social workers to undertake some of the core tasks of case management and organize more intensive care, targeted at those at high risk of admission to institutions for long-term care; (3) neighborhood-based care plans intended  to increase the degree of horizontal target efficiency of the care system and reach some types of clients with severe needs; and (4) plans involving the collaboration of housing with social care agencies to combine shelter with support. Most such efforts, however, are local in scope and fragmentary in effect, not parts of a clearly articulated plan. What is now needed is greater clarity in the analysis of the main sources of inefficiency and models that relate service policy and arrangements directly to these sources of inefficiency. One such model, the &quot;community care approach,&quot; developed at the Personal Social Services Research Unit in collaboration with various British agencies, creates incentives to clients, caregivers, and workers who manage the allocation of services to improve  efficiency. Early evaluation of applications of this model shows a halving of the possibility of entering long-term care homes and improvement in recipients' quality of life. (KC)",

The last focus is currently a controversial one, given the high unemployment France is facing. Two fundamentally different systems of action have spawned these policies. One system sees social policy as compromises proposed by the state in disputes between labor and management. The other system of action sees social policy as the result of the dialectical relations between the state's administration and society. The present crisis, both of old-age policies and of the welfare state, represents  a crisis of the rationale behind social interventions. Moreover, the contradictory nature of public interventions has blurred the very meaning of old age. Therefore, the very policies that have played a fundamental role in making old age a coherent and autonomous category are now breaking down the boundaries of this category. This breaking down of the category of aged persons might lead to the development of other ways of managing the relationships between old age and society. (KC)",

        "description":"Like most Western countries, Switzerland experienced an increased birth rate following World War II, followed by decades of slower growth. However, the number of those over 65 will have increased five-fold during the 20th century, and the number of those over 80 will have increased ten-fold. Thus, there is a smaller number of young people to support an aging population. With a growing number of elderly persons, Switzerland has striven to establish sound policies and practices at all levels. A comprehensive old-age policy began in 1947, with adoption of Old Age Insurance. However, the Swiss have realized that providing for old age involves more than money. It involves making life attractive to the elderly and necessitates providing services during health as well as during illness.  It involves society's attitude toward the elderly and their integration in the population. A comprehensive approach was begun in 1966 through the publication of the report &quot;Old Age in Switzerland.&quot; This document expressed the needs for more than pensions for older persons. It recognized the need for improved social services, more retirement and nursing homes, and additional geriatric medical services. With the population of the aged increasing rapidly, however, the magnitude of the challenge is formidable even for the frugal Swiss. It will require cooperation at all levels of government, the family, and the private sector to meet the growing needs of the elderly. (KC)",

The second chapter, &quot;Older Workers and the Labor Market in Sweden&quot; addresses older workers and the labor market. Special attention is given to the contrasting trends in labor force participation rates between male and female adults, the issue of what explains variations in early retirement rates, and governmental policies that  impinge on older adults' labor force participation and their &quot;decision&quot; to retire early. This chapter includes six references. The third chapter, &quot;Pension Policy in Sweden,&quot; explains the pension policy and summarizes its history and recent evolution. Among the issues discussed is the affordability of adequate pension benefits at a time of challenging demographic and economic developments. Six references are included in the third chapter. (CML)",

The second paper considers the part in China's 2,000-year-old tradition played by family structure and respect for the elderly, describes the Chinese retirement system, explains reforms  being considered for the retirement and insurance systems, lists activities in which the elderly are being encouraged to engage, mentions a university set up exclusively for the aged, recommends traditional exercises to help the elderly become healthier, and discusses types of activities that can be devised to make the life of the elderly more enjoyable. The third paper describes the Chinese response to the social problems posed by the elderly, explains the important role and the characteristics of the elderly, and discusses problems yet to be solved. Among them are elderly support, widowhood support, management of retirees, improvement of the social service for the elderly, and keeping up the moral standard. (CML)",

        "description":"This document, examining transition to retirement from a sociological perspective, consists of four sections and a 14-item bibliography. The first section traces the evolution of West German retirement from what was considered a new phenomenon into what is now commonly assumed to be a normal or even natural life stage. The second section discusses the recent changes (earlier eligibility for pensions, a shortage of jobs and concomitant increase in disability pensions, and new preretirement programs aimed at bridging the gap between early exit from work and entry into the pension system) that have moved the time of exit from the work force to an earlier and earlier age for many West Germans. The third section examines the preretirement program. The fourth section examines the  consequences of these changing retirement patterns in West Germany. Among those consequences are that the age of retirement cannot continue to come earlier and earlier; retirement becomes less and less associated with the concept of &quot;old age&quot;; financial and other planning must become more individualized as people retire earlier; and in the year 2030, contributions to the West German pension system as currently set up would require about 35 percent of personal incomes.

        "description":"The number of entrants to the labor market today in most sub-Sahara African countries far exceeds the number of new jobs generated by the economy. This mismatch is one of the most serious problems the region faces. With too few jobs to go around, vocational training should focus on the generation of self-employment possibilities. In the mid-1970s the International Labour Office and the Swedish International Development Authority teamed up to develop and try out a new approach to the creation of rural employment through training. After 10 years, an investment of more than $5.3 million, and much trial and error, a successful approach has been developed for the creation of rural employment. The Skill Development for Self-Reliance (SDSR) program has been applied in Kenya, Tanzania,  and Zambia. The overall SDSR strategy aims at creating self-employment for rural youth and women. It uses existing government training structures and financial institutions, and it applies a comprehensive approach to ensure the profitability of business activity on a sustained basis. There are five key program elements of the SDSR approach to rural income generation and self-employment: (1) market analysis; (2) selection of entrepreneurs; (3) training; (4) credit; and (5) follow-up/monitoring. Now the SDSR program faces the issues of expansion on a larger scale and the creation of a supporting infrastructure. (KC)",

A job placement component eventually was put in place for participants who finished the course. The three sites, developed in cooperation with existing agencies or organizations and using space on college campuses, were in a small city, a larger urban area, and a metropolitan area. The key instructional components of the program include (1) one-to-one tutoring; (2) reading, writing, math, and job search curricula; (3) instructors who also are older than 54 and who meet Job Training Partnership Act low  income guidelines; (4) use of the language experience method; (5) active involvement of participants in the planning of the instruction in order to increase their feelings of self-worth and motivation to continue the program; (6) use of computer-assisted instruction; (7) materials that are appropriate for adult students; (8) materials that are job related when participants know what job they want to prepare for; and (9) opportunities to practice job contact calls and interviews. (The document includes information on staff selection and training, participant recruitment, goals and objectives, evaluation, and instructional materials.

The course was developed collaboratively during 1979-82 by B.P. Chemicals Ltd. and Grimsby College of Technology and Arts, using the Business and Technician Education Council certification program. Following an abstract in German and a short introduction, the two collaborating parties are described. Open learning is described as learning for which there is often no entry requirements; learners can choose what to study, where and when to study, and what instructional materials to use; specially prepared packages of instructional materials are often used; and learners will have regular contact with a tutor and/or counselor. The training  needs of B.P. Chemicals Ltd. (including the requirements that the course involve no time off work, have no academic entry requirements, be provided at no cost to students, and lead to a nationally recognized qualification) are listed, as well as the Grimsby College response to those constraints. The course is described in terms of units for three levels (mathematics, physical science, chemistry, instrumentation systems, communications studies, unit operations, fluid and heat transfer, safety, communication studies, plant technology, unit operations, plant combustion and steam, and student projects), learning objectives, materials, course organization, student recruitment for the pilot year, and dropouts among the pilot group. The next section describes the activities since the pilot year,  including changes made in the course on the basis of student feedback. The document concludes with short sections on the value of the training to the company, the titles of student projects, and the costs of open learning. (CML)",

        "description":"The purpose of a project was to develop and test curriculum-based procedures and measures to monitor and assess the reading and writing progress of adults in a basic education program. The most efficient, reliable, and feasible measure of reading performance from beginning reading level through eighth-grade level was the repeated oral reading procedure of 1-minute readings. The most feasible and efficient measure of writing was a fluency procedure of a 3-minute writing sample. Both measures enabled teachers to chart and monitor progress of adults throughout the program. Teachers reported that the measures were useful and easy to use. Students were receptive to the measures as a means of obtaining feedback about their progress. Results suggested that curriculum-based measures may  be useful in adult basic education programs because of their feasibility and reliability in monitoring the performance of adults and as a supplement to the standardized measures often used to assess performance of adults. (An instructor's guide to using curriculum-based measures of reading and writing in an adult literacy program is included, along with 11 references and 10 appendices that contain survey forms, coding sheets, data summary sheets, student reading and writing graphs, and writing prompts.)

        "description":"The theme of the 1983 Australian and South Pacific External Studies Association concerned developing efficient teaching-learning systems and efficient management systems. Such an emphasis on efficiency was symptomatic in the United States' educational arena to a commitment to the practices of scientific management. The central role accorded to efficiency by some theorists of educational administration is illustrated by educational principles that use the term &quot;raw materials&quot; for students and &quot;worker&quot; for teachers. Business ideology still dominates Western discourse and those in the education sector still perceive themselves and their institutions as vulnerable to it. Institutions that provide distance education materials feel even more vulnerable than do those that maintain a  more cloistered and discrete relationship with their students. The methods adopted in a standard approach to distance education materials resemble the methods of scientific management. In order to complete materials successfully, students are required to submit to an &quot;if you can't beat them, join them&quot; approach because the materials fail to acknowledge the centrality of the possible contributions students can make. Issues such as qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, efficiency have not been sufficiently addressed in discussions about efficiency in distance education methods. Differing political commitments generate differing standards and measures of efficiency. (10 references) (CML)",

The importance of workplace literacy has been underscored by the link between basic skills and productivity. The importance of &quot;functional context&quot; to basic skills training for adults is illustrated by programs for extreme low-level literate persons who need long-term intensive adult literacy programs, programs for  improving the effectiveness of training through basic skills improvement, and simulation programs that illustrate the effects of on-the-job mistakes without jeopardizing the employee or the work process. The steps for developing programs to improve job-related basic skills are as follows: identify the problem; prepare an action plan; design, develop, and implement curriculum; and evaluate and monitor the program. Workplace literacy programs can improve worker self-esteem and job performance, company productivity, and the nation's competitiveness. (13 references) (CML)",

        "description":"The most significant factors affecting the labor market during the 1980s were the United States' loss of competitiveness in the world marketplace, continued shifts in production from goods to services, changes in the skill requirements of many jobs, and demographic shifts in the population. During the next decade, incompatibility between the type of work available and the kind of labor force available to do it is expected because (1) the most rapid growth will be in occupations that require some postsecondary education and training, but the work force is not expected to have the educational background to qualify for the required training and education; (2) minorities and women, who continue to enter the labor force in large numbers, are underrepresented in the fast-growing  occupations and overrepresented in occupations for which the slowest growth is projected; and (3) projected job decline will displace some goods-producing workers who are not expected to have the training for other available jobs and, unless men infiltrate the &quot;pink collar ghetto,&quot; there may be serious worker shortages in health occupations. Strategies for vocational and career educators include playing a larger role in dropout prevention; developing articulation models between secondary and postsecondary education; emphasizing the importance of all students considering nontraditional occupational choices; developing programs that are accessible to all groups within the population; and providing programs that include the development of basic skills as well as those that are occupationally  specific.

        "description":"Pending legislation for the reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act mandates the development of performance indicators or standards, which are also called educational indicators, quality indicators, outcome indicators, performance standards, and performance measures. There is general agreement that indicators or standards are single or composite statistics that reveal something about the performance or health of an educational system. Three of the most frequently used outcome measures developed for vocational education in the last decade are labor market (including job placement, earnings, and the duration of employment and unemployment), learning (most often measured in occupational competency testing), and access (monitoring the numbers of women,  minorities, and students with special needs who are enrolled in programs). None of the outcome measures currently in use appears to be sufficient when used singly, although some combination of labor market, learning, and access outcomes seems promising. Illinois and Minnesota are working on such combinations. Developing and implementing a system of performance standards for vocational education requires making demanding decisions on performance assessment, accountability, and actions. Among potential problems are the impact of performance standards on those whom the program serves, the influence of performance standards on the types of training provided, the difficulty of meeting multiple standards, and the difficulty of adjusting standards for programs in different labor markets.

        "description":"To find vocational education curriculum materials, educators can contact their State Liaison Representative (SLR) to the National Network for Curriculum Coordination in Vocational and Technical Education (NNCCVTE), regional Curriculum Coordination Center (CCC), state vocational education resource center (SVERC), and/or one of the consortia that develop and sell vocational education materials. They may also search the ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) and VECM (Vocational Education Curriculum Materials) databases. ERIC is a general education database that contains more than 700,000 references to print documents. VECM is limited to instructional materials but includes audiovisual as well as print materials. The NNCCVTE is made up of six regional CCCs and a web of SLRs  that serve as links between the education community of a particular state and its regional CCC. One of the advantages of borrowing curriculum from a regional CCC is that the materials can be reviewed and evaluated before purchase. Some SVERCs are maintained as libraries of print and audiovisual vocational education materials, and provide services such as curriculum development workshops and computer searches. SVERCs can be contacted by calling a state department of vocational education, SLR, or CCC. Among the many commercial and nonprofit agencies that develop curriculum materials are the Vocational-Technical Education Consortium of States (V-TECS), Mid-America Vocational Curriculum Consortium, and American Association of Vocational Instructional Materials.

A total of 120 FFA advisors randomly selected from 6 southern states were mailed a questionnaire. Data were obtained from 68 teachers, a 57 percent return. The findings and conclusions of the study included the following: (1) chapters with advisors who had more than 10 years of advisor experience were more likely to be involved in a wider variety of FFA activities; (2) chapter advisors with  1-10 years of advisor experience participated more in fund-raising activities, opportunities for students to seek office beyond the local level, cooperative efforts with other school organizations, active advisory councils, and national conventions; (3) participation in FFA in high school appeared to be a fundamental factor that contributed to the preparation of teachers for the role of advisor; and (4) enrollment patterns in agricultural education were influenced by public recognition of programs and students, lack of public understanding about agricultural education, and selection of electives other than agriculture. The study confirmed the worth of FFA activities in agricultural education. (KC)",

Questionnaires assessing what graduates were doing 9 months after graduation were mailed to all graduates in March, 1990. Findings from the 25 graduates who returned completed questionnaires revealed that all were enrolled in schools, colleges, or training programs pursuing fine arts and letters (32%), education and social services (24%), commercial arts and communications (12%), engineering and architecture (8%), medicine and health services (8%), law and government (8%), and science and agriculture (4%). Sixty-eight percent were working, and 44% planned on pursuing additional degrees after the completion of their present  program. Two personal problems were mentioned: worrying about being as successful as others want (28%) and self-imposed pressure to succeed (24%). Almost three-quarters of the graduates reported having had a mentor while in the CAS program and most had kept in contact with these mentors. Graduates reported that the CAS program had offered better educational programs or opportunities than their home schools, had teachers who took a personal interest in the students, and provided a broad area of intellectual and artistic stimulation. Graduates thought that the CAS program could be improved by allowing more opportunities to socialize between classes and being more selective of students entering the program. (Sample letters to graduates and the follow-up questionnaire are appended.)  (NB)",

        "description":"Certain aspects of a school environment can be stressful for students. The School Situation Survey (SSS) was developed to assess school-related stress among students in grades 3 through 12. The seven scales of the SSS assess four sources of stress (Teacher Interactions, Academic Stress, Peer Interactions, Academic Self-Concept) and three manifestations of stress (Emotional, Behavioral, Physiological). A pilot form of the survey was administered to 907 fifth-, seventh-, and ninth-graders and a revised form was administered to 1,111 students in these grades. To date, the SSS has been administered to over 7,000 students in grades 3 through 12 in 16 Connecticut and Rhode Island school districts representing rural, suburban, and urban districts. Normative information is available by  total group, grade-level cluster, and gender. Reliabilities are considered moderate to high; test-retest data support the stability of the perceptions of stress levels over time. Teachers and school support staff can help students to cope with stress by enabling them to learn to make friends and to learn to identify and deal with different types of stress. Teachers and staff can also help students to deal with stress by informing them of possible stressful situations before they are encountered. (NB)",

        "description":"Research has confirmed the usefulness of Tinto's model in predicting undergraduate student withdrawal from college and in conceptualizing and explaining the process of student attrition. Tinto proposed that college students are more likely to withdraw if they are insufficiently integrated or if they maintain values sufficiently different from the values of the college they are attending. This study was conducted to further explore the utility of Tinto's model and to investigate the nature of the process Tinto describes. Subjects were 25 first time, full-time college freshmen. Interviews were conducted with 10 freshmen in Fall 1988 and with all 25 in Spring 1989. Four students who withdrew from the university were interviewed during Summer 1989. The findings revealed that the  institutional experiences of living on campus and participating in extracurricular activities appeared to enhance the students' social integration by exposing them to other students and to opportunities to interact and develop friendships with other students. The external experiences of interaction with non-university high school friends and family appeared to interfere with the students' opportunities to socialize with other students. These findings confirm the usefulness of Tinto's model in understanding student perspectives regarding the pressures that lead to their persistence decisions. (NB)",

        "description":"Transpersonal Counseling and Wholistic Counseling are two relatively new approaches to psychotherapy. Transpersonal counseling is based on the work of transpersonal psychologists who believe that there are potential cognitive, moral, and motivational stages of development beyond those reached by most adults. It suggests a &quot;fourth force&quot; in psychology in addition to psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, and humanistic forces. Wholistic counseling may be viewed as the epitome of eclectic counseling, working with the total person and employing information and methodology from virtually any source. The wholistic counseling approach strives for prevention as well as remediation and cure. It is both a proactive and a reactive approach which works with the whole person in terms of body,  mind, emotions, and spirit, in the context of the person's total environment. This document describes the transpersonal counseling and wholistic counseling approaches to psychotherapy. It presents the background, basic concepts, goals, processes, and counselor roles associated with each approach and examines the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The characteristics of these approaches are compared to other major counseling approaches (person-centered, Gestalt, transactional analysis, behavioral, rational emotive cognitive) on an accompanying chart.

It is noted that, although the population aged 60 and over in Ghana is estimated to rise from 286,000 in 1960 to 2,425,000 in 2025, the aging of the population will not get under way until well after 2025. It is suggested that aging trends in Ghana will have a number of developmental implications and socioeconomic consequences, including a growing demand for specialized services and the weakening of the traditional family and community support systems for the elderly; age selective migration from the rural to urban areas; and reduced opportunities for older persons to remain economically active. This document also examines: (1) traditional beliefs  associating old age and aging with dignity, wisdom, knowledge, respect, and obedience in Ghana; (2) the modernizing influences on these beliefs, including the effects of formal education, industrialization, migration, Christianity and Islam, and technology; (3) the current status of the elderly in Ghanaian society in terms of education, training, employment, income, and assets; (4) the living arrangements of the elderly; (5) the relationship of the elderly with family members; (6) the organized support systems for the elderly by the government, the family, and voluntary organizations; and (7) community participation and social networks.

In general, the results showed that students who obtained higher total WGCTA scores also had higher cumulative grade point averages (GPAs). The results seem to indicate the not all aspects of the ability to think critically contribute equally to overall academic performance. Although the abilities to accurately infer, interpret, and evaluate arguments were found to  significantly correlate with cumulative GPA, only the abilities to infer and evaluate arguments significantly and uniquely contributed to 9.2% of the variance within cumulative GPA. Gender differences were also found. Findings appear to indicate that proficiency in only one skill (inference) associated with critical thinking was required for higher male student academic achievement, while proficiency in both deduction and evaluation of arguments was required for higher female student academic achievement. These findings suggest that what is required for a male student to succeed academically is quite different from what is required for a female student to achieve, even in cases where ability levels are quite similar.

Individual interviewees were in the school's general track while group interviewees were primarily in the college track. Students in all schools reported positive experiences both in learning situations and with teachers and peers. For many students, however, these experiences were  idiosyncratic rather than being built into the policy and practice structure of the school. The data revealed important contrasts between the policies of the high, median, and low graduation districts within the sample. In districts with the high graduation rate, affirmative policies generated a belief that students were important and adults cared whether or not they succeeded.

        "description":"This paper discusses how a holistic, collaborative approach to advising can be developed and what important pieces are needed to implement an effective advising system for the 1990s at Ferris State University (FSU). These actions/policies are recommended: (1) see advising as a university-wide responsibility with collaboration on the delivery of advising services; (2) define information that is readily available to all persons interested in the advising process and eliminate redundancy of information; (3) develop a personal advising system; (4) break advising skills up into the areas of information giving, communication process, and helping skills and work to enhance each area; (5) recognize the special needs of special populations at FSU, such as the needs of nontraditional  students, women, minority students, undecided students and underprepared students; and (6) clarify the responsibilities of being an advisor. The paper concludes that there are several areas of the advising process at FSU that could be improved with little or no cost to the institution. It is claimed that these changes would help bring about a more collaborative and holistic system of advising. It is recommended that FSU examine alternative advising systems that would have new cost but would help the institution keep competitive through the 1990s. (ABL)",

It is offered at one high school in each borough, and the program is linked with a college in the CUNY system. The C.D.D.P. offers students an enriched curriculum, guidance services, and an opportunity for on-site exposure to college activities. The goal of the program is to better prepare and motivate students in order to increase the likelihood that they will attend college. The extent to which the program was meeting its objectives was evaluated for the program years 1987-88 and 1988-89. The specific program objectives are that participants should improve by five percentage points as compared  with a comparison group in these areas: attendance rate, graduation rate, college plans, and pass rates for Regents examinations, academic courses, and Regents Competency tests. The evaluation indicated that 73 percent of the 1,452 1988-89 participants planned to attend college. The participants exceeded a comparison group by five percent with regard to Regents Competency Tests, examinations, and graduation rates. Participants did not exceed the comparison group with regard to number of courses passed or attendance. (ABL)",

This is because: (1) CDC's Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (CCDPHP), which has lead responsibility for youth, initially targeted the larger, in-school population; (2) the state and local education agencies funded to serve all youth lacked experience with those out-of-school and the organizations that serve them; and (3) few guidelines or specifically targeted educational materials were available. To overcome these barriers, CCDPHP plans to fund local health departments or community organizations to act as focal points for providing services to out-of-school youth, including HIV education. However,  this approach is already being carried out by another center within CDC, the Center for Prevention Services (CPS). Therefore, it is believed the CDC should reassess its current strategy toward reaching high-risk, out-of-school youth, specifically considering whether the out-of-school component of CCDPHP should be merged with CDC's existing prevention programs.

Many studies have been done using demographic and norm-referenced tests to try to identify at-risk-for-failure youngsters either at the preschool level or early during their school experience. Most attempts have been costly and of limited success. This study examined the concurrent and predictive validity of performance on a test measuring the information processing characteristics of students to identify youngsters with low achievement in school. Second-grade students (N=380) were individually administered the Learning Efficiency Test (LET) and regression and discriminant analyses were conducted. Variables examined included actual levels of performance in  reading and mathematics, California Achievement Test total scores in reading and mathematics, and teacher rankings of overall student achievement levels. Results showed high levels of accuracy for the LET in predicting both achievement levels and in classifying students according to teacher rankings. The LET is easy to administer and reflects a cost-effective approach. Moreover, the predictive efficacy of the LET represents substantial improvements over past studies that used costly and elaborate diagnostic procedures which have failed to identify at-risk students beyond chance levels.

        "description":"This document presents testimony given before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs concerning a General Accounting Office (GAO) review of education programs for youth designed to limit the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It notes that most American teenagers have received essential information on the causes of AIDS and how to minimize the risks of becoming infected with HIV. Nonetheless, the GAO investigation revealed gaps in the provision of AIDS education, and those gaps are discussed in this report. These findings from the GAO review of the school-based HIV education program nationwide are presented: (1) two-thirds of the nation's school districts offered HIV education; (2) smaller districts were  less likely to provide HIV education; (3) HIV education was not provided at all levels, particularly in the upper grades, where the likelihood of sexual activity was greatest; (4) essential planning and monitoring data on students' knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors were inadequate; and (5) teacher training was often insufficient or lacking. Other findings presented are from the GAO review of education programs targeted at high-risk, out-of- school youth. From this review, it is concluded that the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) Division of Adolescent and School Health has been slow to address HIV education needs; that the Division has primarily funded education agencies and the resulting out-of-school activities have been limited; and that the Division plans a new initiative to fund  health departments to reach out-of-school youth that potentially duplicates another CDC Center's approach.

        "description":"The School Crisis Network is an organization founded in Charlottesville, Virginia by a group of practitioners in the community, local mental health agencies, and school personnel to address the needs of local school systems during times of crisis. It represents a unique cooperative effort between mental health professions and the school system which offers school psychologists a means to go beyond building limitations by using available community resources to provide support and intervention for staff and students during emergencies. Since its inception over 2 years ago, the Network has provided support to schools in dealing with the immediate aftermath of student suicides, accidents, and the deaths of parents with school-age children. This paper describes the School Crisis  Network and the importance and development of the relationship between schools and the communities they serve. A number of major components that have contributed to the success of this model are reviewed, including the routine followed during a crisis situation; the mechanism used to coordinate the school administration, building level staff, and outside volunteers; and the education and training provided by the School Crisis Network. The paper concludes that the School Crisis Network has proved to be effective in providing organizational and professional support to local school systems during times of crisis. (NB)",

There have been relatively few studies, however, which have empirically investigated the relation between body image and personality characteristics among normal women. This study investigated the correlation between the attitudinal and perceptual components of body image and self-esteem in a sample of 56 normal weight female undergraduates with no history of an eating disorder. Subjects completed the Personal and Academic Self-Concept Inventory and the Body Parts Satisfaction Questionnaire. Perceptual body image was measured with the Adjustable Light Beam Apparatus and with the Image Marking Procedure. The results revealed  that the attitudinal component of body image, but not the perceptual component, was significantly correlated with overall self-esteem and the physical appearance aspect of self-esteem. A significant correlation between the physical appearance dimension of self-esteem and global self-esteem was also found. This latter finding was consistent with findings obtained with eating disordered women. Findings have important implications for the role of physical self-esteem in prevention, treatment, and theories of etiology of the eating disorders. (NB)",

This study was conducted to develop the Money Ethic Scale (MES) and to examine the initial nomological network of the scale. A 25-page questionnaire on attitudes toward money was distributed to 1,200 subjects, including students and faculty of a state university, personnel managers attending professional compensation seminars, workers at an engineering development center, local schools, banks, churches, and other establishments. Of 689 usable questionnaires, only those from subjects with full-time work experience were selected (N=249). Fifty items were generated from the original MES scale. Data based on the original 50-item money questionnaire from 249 subjects were subjected  to a principal components factor analysis and followed by a varimax rotation. Six factors were identified: Good, Evil, Achievement, Respect/Self-Esteem, Budget, and Freedom/Power. The test-retest reliability and inter-item consistency reliability for each subscale of the 30-item MES were satisfactory. The nomological network of the MES as related to demographic variables, personality variables, values, and work-related variables was also examined. (Author/NB)",

Results revealed that the third-grade subjects made little adjustments in either typical or target reading rate between narrative and expository passages, whereas subjects in both fourth and sixth grades made such adjustments. Findings suggest that the third-subjects adopted a strategy of skimming over the inconsistency, while the older subjects slowed down, apparently in an  attempt to reconcile the inconsistency. Findings also suggest that for all subjects there was a tendency to identify semantically consistent information that had not been presented over inconsistent information that had been presented; this was especially true for expository passages.

Recall of target propositions was significantly greater when the information was in the consistent version than when the same information was in the inconsistent version.

Three lower-middle-class first graders in the Pacific Northwest participated in the study: John spent the entire day in the classroom; Ginny was pulled out of the classroom 15 minutes daily to receive remedial help in reading comprehension in the Chapter 1 program; and Michael was pulled out of the classroom 25 minutes daily to receive help in reading comprehension and word attack from the special education teacher in a resource room setting. The reading programs implemented for each of the students were investigated primarily through classroom observation, informal  conversations with teachers, summaries of journal entries, and children's written work. Portions of the core classroom program were judged to be of poor quality in both student responses and teacher-student interactions. It is likely that this negatively affected the achievement of the at-risk students. The experiences of Ginny and Michael in their respective pullout settings appear to be qualitatively different from their classroom experiences. Text difficulty was controlled by orthographic features rather than by meaning; instruction was teacher-directed rather than learner-controlled; materials were teacher-selected rather than student-selected; expected student responses differed; and student-teacher interactions were sustained longer.

When children learn to read, fluency of word identification follows the development of accuracy quite closely, with the initial period of fluency completed by the fourth grade. For adults, however, it is not unusual to find that the level at which they are able to read fluently lags several grade levels behind their level of accuracy. At about the fourth grade level, children can read all words the meanings of which they know, and they begin to see words in print that they can read but which are  unfamiliar to them. Adults at the fourth grade level and beyond are much less likely than children to encounter words in print that are totally new to them. In contrast to children, it is not at all unusual to find that adults' grade levels in reading comprehension are higher than the grade levels of words they are able to recognize in print. Children's ability to comprehend by listening exceeds their reading comprehension up until about the eighth grade. Adults, however, differ very little between their reading and listening levels. Building on what is already known may help develop literacy in adults. (Twenty-one references are attached.) (RS)",

Face-to-face services were offered to 144 students, while 32 students received a combination of face-to-face and computer-assisted instruction (CAI). The program was evaluated through site visits, review of data from program documents, interviews with program teachers, and analyses of mean gains in standardized test scores.

A teacher and a researcher collaborated in a 3-month effort to improve the way the teacher conducted her reading group discussions. The discussions were videotaped and then analyzed to reveal the types, patterns, and frequencies of the teacher's questions, her students' responses, and her feedback. The teacher was also videotaped while being interviewed by the researcher. When the teacher realized that she was controlling the class discussion most of the time, the teacher and researcher collaborated in changing the way the  teacher led her reading group discussions. By the end of the 3 months, the teacher had completely reversed her opinion considering the ability of second graders to engage in discussions about the stories they read. The reading groups had changed into teacherless discussions in which the students actively participated in discussions with each other. This collaboration succeeded beacuse the teacher: (1) gained a new perspective on her assumptions and performance through the use of videotape; (2) identified her own need for change, in collaboration with the researcher; and (3) worked toward a solution, in her own classroom, with a non-threatening, informed collaborator.

        "description":"There is considerable research evidence to suggest that (1) literature has a positive effect both on reading achievement and attitude toward reading; and (2) the use of a literature-based program is an effective alternative to the traditional basal reading approach. The majority of studies concluded that the literature-based approach produced higher reading achievement and fostered more positive attitudes toward reading than the basal-reading method. Children of all ability levels, given the opportunity to experience reading as a visual and thought process, take a more active role in their own learning. Students not only learn to read, they also develop a love for reading and become life-long readers through the process of using a literature-based approach. Research evidence also  supports the use of a shared book experience. Most teachers are required to use a basal reading series. One literature-based, whole language-oriented basal series is &quot;Impressions.&quot;&quot;The Story Box in the Classroom&quot; is a kit which provides numerous strategies for shared reading. In literature-based programs, the secret of success is creating the right learning environment, one in which a natural intimacy between teacher and children develops and one in which reading is pleasurable and meaningful.

Each chapter identified three representative public schools in its area: one elementary, one middle school, and one high school. In each school, the chapter interviewed the principal, surveyed teachers, wrote a narrative report about the school, and collected data about 100 students in each school. A &quot;holding power statistic&quot; was applied to the high school and an in-depth case study of one at-risk student was completed which included video-taped interviews. Results of data gathered from 22,018 students were used to  produce an &quot;at-risk scale,&quot; with the upper quartile designated as at-risk. Schools' efforts were examined from several perspectives including viewpoints of teachers and principals. Results indicated that principals and teachers agreed that teachers, rather than parents or the students themselves, should be responsible for helping students acquire reading comprehension. A school effort score indicated that few school interventions were provided for at-risk students and that a minimal relationship between the degree of the at-risk score and the school effort score existed. The ultimate goal of follow-up research is to identify at-risk students and provide appropriate interventions before the students experience failure.

        "description":"Imagery has a significant role in cognitive development. Reading research has established the fact that good readers image spontaneously and that there is a high interrelationship between overall preference for a story, the amount of text-related imagery in the story, comprehension, and recall. Imagery researchers agree that everyone is capable of imaging. As with any other skill, using imagery effectively appears to be a matter of practice. The basic techniques for stimulating pupils to use imagery involve relaxation and the use of images that appeal to all their senses. When pupils read a story, they should put themselves into the role of the character. They should experience what the character sees, smells, hears, tastes, and feels. Pupils who can do this experience the story  on a higher cognitive and affective level than pupils who are not able to do so. Research indicates that imagery is used infrequently in the classroom. Failure to recognize the powerful potential of imagery in the reading program denies pupils the use of a major correlate in reading instruction. (Thirty-two references are attached.) (Author/MG)",

Writing samples by two students early in the semester and class discussion about cultural influences reveal how students initially see themselves as having the option of choosing either to accept the unified world view that the teacher offers them or to maintain their own unified world view. That the world views under consideration might be internally contradictory and conflicted or that these world views might overlap, placing both student and teacher in more than one world of discourse simultaneously, are not  possibilities the students entertain until later in the course, as three additional student writing samples reveal. The goal by the end of the course is to get students to be willing and able to simultaneously value and critique themselves and the positions they maintain, even though conflicts come to light as they are asked to think in new and potentially threatening ways both about their surroundings and the role language plays in their interpretations of these surroundings.

Despite earlier predictions of American mastery of English, the Harvard Reports of the 1890s reflected anxiety over literacy among freshman college students from even &quot;the best families in point of culture and breeding, and from the best schools.&quot; In addressing who was responsible for the problem, language critics and educators of the era engaged not so much in soul searching as in blame shifting. Preparatory schools took the brunt of the attacks. The students themselves were criticized for spending too much time in the lower levels of education. Other targets included &quot;the home, the very cheap newspaper, the street&quot; and even advertising, which was labeled  an &quot;acknowledged evil&quot; and a &quot;perversion of talent.&quot; The colleges themselves and their entrance examinations were attacked by critics.

Subjects, eight girls and nine boys enrolled in a small, urban, nonsectarian, private school, were observed and interviewed during their normal writing periods from kindergarten through the third or fourth grade. Although the subjects' six different teachers used different writing programs (which ranged from the whole language approach to a much more directive approach), all teachers encouraged invented spelling in the first 3 years and provided frequent opportunities for writing. Results indicated that (1)  children struggle with the same aspects of making meaning in the writing process in many different ways; and (2) each child's developmental pace is individual. Findings suggest that individual differences can be understood within the whole continuum of writing development, allowing for more effective instruction for individual children.

In 1988-89 the program served 87 schools in 22 community school districts. The methods used to evaluate the program included on-site interviews, lab and classroom observations, questionnaires distributed to all program participants and a selected group of parents, pre- and post-program writing samples, and reading achievement scores for the Metropolitan Achievement Test for both selected program participants and matching control groups. Overall reaction  to the program was positive. Most participants believed that the program provided a good foundation in basic skills, helped to develop confident and mature writers, and that the computers and center setting were significant motivational devices.

The growth model pulled attention away from the forms of academic discourse and toward what students could and could not do as writers, and encouraged teachers to respect and work with the skills which students brought to the classroom. Recent metaphors of initiation have often seemed to exaggerate conflicts and differences, in equating learning with assimilation or conversion. At times, in attempting to balance the two competing genres of everyday discourse and academic discourse, the student seems more &quot;written by&quot; than the '&quot;writer of&quot; his text. A basic writing course should freely admit and build upon conflicts and  permit students to draw upon their full histories as persons as much as they can. In doing so, they might begin to gain a sense of why an individual works and writes at a university and of the sorts of power and insight an individual can gain there. (SG)",

While instructional levels and language requirements differed, the two classes read the same plays. Students in both classes enjoyed the experience and supported its continuation. The fact that each group had in the other a real audience helped the student writers understand what to include in their stories; students wrote on both literary and personal topics. The cross-cultural exchanges helped students explore what was universal and what was culturally bound in  literary interpretation. Future efforts in this area would be improved by direct communication between students, and the American students called for more similar writing assignments than the two groups in the study were assigned.

        "description":"A study examined the instructional benefits of a semester-long letter exchange between first graders and preservice teachers in a language arts methods class. When first graders exchange letters with preservice teachers, all are involved in literacy events. Pen pals at both levels benefit from this correspondence. Often the focus is on the advantages for children as they write for real purposes and to audiences other than the teacher, but the other half of the partnership (the preservice teachers) can also profit from a letter exchange . Initially, preservice teachers &quot;look at&quot; pen pal letters noticing handwriting, neatness, and invented spellings. They learn how to read the content, i.e., the &quot;what&quot; of children's writing. Soon they change their focus and begin to look more  deeply into the letters for an understanding of &quot;how&quot; students write. They discover children's strategies for revision, for the use of space, for punctuation, and for capitalization. They see examples of risk-taking and risk-avoiding. They identify growth through experimentation. Pen pal letters allow preservice teachers a closer look at language exchanges through a meaningful writing experience. As preservice teachers build understanding about children's writing strategies and decision making, they are clearly benefiting from a pen pal partnership. (Author/MG)",

The theme of &quot;work&quot; is naturally successful because it centers around a topic students know well, something that is within their capacity and interest to explore. Not only is there much to write about using the theme of work in the composition class, there is much to read as a way to spur students' thinking and to see other people's perspectives on the issue. By examining the theme of work in a writing class, students have the opportunity to explore those dreams that lie deep in their souls, to mine the depths to discover the riches within, to make tacit what would  otherwise go unnoticed. The single-theme composition course provides students with an opportunity to look closely and thoroughly at one aspect of their lives and the world around them and guards against a superficial encounter with a topic.

The report notes that over 50,000 students participated in the program during 1988-89 and that the curriculum and test component integrated four content areas in communication arts--reading, writing, listening, and speaking. The report also notes that participation in the drama component was about 7,000 students. In particular, the report documents the level and quality of  program implementation and assesses the program's impact on student achievement in reading and writing. The report is in five chapters: (1) Introduction; (2) Program Components (which discusses project components and implementation); (3) Reactions to, and Perceptions of, the Instructional Component; (4) Student Outcomes; and (5) Conclusions and Recommendations.

Subjects responded to 51 questions, employing the Q-methodology, in which statements are sorted (each printed on individual cards) according to an 11-point agree-disagree continuum. Results revealed a similar structure of opinions about communication among pharmacy students, pharmacy faculty, and pharmacists. The composite  findings indicated the following concerns about effective pharmacist-patient communication: (1) the degree to which the pharmacist should focus on the patients and their feelings; (2) the difficulty in counseling patients when there is much behind-the-counter work; (3) the expectations of the patients; and (4) the degree of empathy for patients and the type of communication.

        "description":"A newborn child can identify impressions by means of the sense organs with the help of &quot;non-visible&quot; sensory impressions such as tactile and kinesthetic. A communication arises early between different modalities and muscle activities, which make possible an early synchronization, and identity between the infant and its surroundings. Studies indicate that the infant is entirely dominated by sensory impressions through reciprocal coordination and muscular process. For development to occur, the infant's effort must be directed toward separating and identifying differing impressions and activities. Other research suggests that newborns can identify and imitate the movement of points of light on moving models. Imitation has been demonstrated in children less than 1 hour old,  suggesting to some researchers that imitation and intermodality are congenital abilities. Furthermore, imitation can come to be anticipatory, in that imitation begins before the model has begun to conduct its model action. In this phase, the infant learns to recognize the situation in which the imitated model is acting and to produce the imitated action without a preceding model. Imitation has an impact on the infant's communicative development. (Seven figures and two tables of data are included; 33 references are attached.) (SG)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to develop a taxonomy of decision criteria employed by Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA) debate critics. Four hypothesis characteristics were tested: (1) audience-centered critics would have a higher proportion of presentational remarks than analytic-centered critics; (2) audience-centered critics would devote a higher proportion of their ballots to critique than analytic-centered counterparts; (3) elimination round ballots for all critics would contain a higher proportion of decision criteria to critique than preliminary round ballots; and (4) elimination round ballots would have a higher proportion of substantive elements than preliminary round ballots. Subjects were 13 debate critics who had judged intercollegiate debate for fewer than 6 years.  The study integrated structured data (questionnaires and template portions of debate ballots) with unstructured data (written portions of debate ballots and judging philosophies). Results of correlational analysis found only two instances of professed preference from the questionnaire corresponding with actual preferences and indicated that several clusters of ballot behavior were indicated by different paradigms. Results showed that philosophy statements were better predictors of both ballot behavior and survey responses than questionnaire responses. Support was not found for hypotheses one and two. Support was obtained for hypotheses three and four, indicating that critics reduce the amount of critique devoted to their written ballots in elimination rounds compared with the amount  devoted in preliminary rounds.

Teachers were asked to conduct cooperative-learning reading lessons during the observation time. A total of 32 observations of students' cooperative group work were conducted in six classrooms during regular whole-language literacy instruction. Content of students' verbal interactions was examined in terms of four general categories: procedural, academic, individualistic, and social/emotional. The form of students' discussions was examined in terms of the length of their utterances. Form was examined to describe the structure of the various types of verbal interaction content, and also to ascertain the extent to which students' utterances  facilitated or hampered discussion of high-level academic content. Grade level and teacher effects were examined for both content and form. Analysis revealed that much of the students' group discussion could be characterized as on-task and non-negative in tone. Results indicated high amounts of procedural and academic talk and relatively low amounts of individualistic and social/emotional talk. The greater mean lengths of academic low-level and high-level utterances suggest that these two categories of discussion content are distinct from most or all other types of utterances.

A study proposed a more flexible model for television viewing research. The study used the television program &quot;St. Elsewhere,&quot; an example of &quot;meta-television&quot; (television programming which contains hidden references to song lyrics, movies, television, and other elements of popular culture). Thirty-seven subjects were given a questionnaire which asked about television viewing habits, familiarity with &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and other programs, and attitudes toward television viewing. Respondents then watched &quot;St. Elsewhere's&quot; final episode, &quot;The Fat Lady Sings,&quot; which was full of hidden references. While 72% of respondents reported liking the show and 69% disagreed  with the assertion that &quot;this show confused me,&quot; many were unaware of the hidden references. Each viewer perceived the show somewhat differently, in a process of reception that was found to be difficult, even impossible, to articulate. Further methodological testing of the &quot;reception theory&quot; hypothesis is required, including larger samples and more accurately cross-referenced data on television viewing patterns, personal habits, and the kinds of responses they elicit.

The first two experiments focused on the effect of glottal waveform in the perception of talker identity. Subjects in the first experiment, 30 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory psychology course, indicated whether stimuli were produced by a male or female. Results indicated that the crossover point of the identification function depended on whether the glottal waveform had been produced by a male or female talker. Subjects in the second experiment, 26 individuals chosen from a speech research laboratory's paid subject pool, were trained to identify a talker's gender. Results indicated that listeners could identify individual talkers  on the basis of glottal waveform information alone. Experiments three (20 subjects) and four (13 subjects) assessed the relative contributions of glottal waveform, fundamental frequency, and formant spacing to the perception of talker identity. In both experiments, synthetic stimuli were constructed by copying the three cues of interest from tokens of words produced by natural talkers. Subjects were required to identify the talker. Results indicated that formant spacing and fundamental frequency were the primary sources of information in the speech waveform. Results also indicated that glottal waveform played only an indirect role in talker identification.

        "description":"Visual communication media technologies, particularly television, hinder rather than enhance viewer perceptual processes, understanding, and aesthetic appreciation of visual messages transmitted by means of such technologies. Emerging technologies, including high-definition, interactive, and holographic television, will not necessarily improve or leave unaffected the perceptions of viewers. Research indicates that perceptual changes dictated by the new media are not easily adaptable by the average user. While the technologies mistakenly predetermine that most viewers' comprehension and interpretation of received messages will be the same, the notion is destructive for viewers and imposes serious obstacles in the development and acceptance of the field of study called visual  communication media literacy. Psychological evidence suggests that the significant factors of time of exposure and familiarity of visual stimuli are not taken seriously by the developers of new visual technologies. Teachers and researchers of the visual communication media should (1) help the industry develop technologies as academic disciplines and art forms; (2) increase efforts to alert others to technology's penchant for profit; and (3) work to enhance visual media literacy by research in perception, cognition, and aesthetics.

        "description":"Wisconsin has a local options competency-testing policy for public schools: participating districts receive state assistance, but are subject to regulations on test development and use. This paper examines influences on school district program adoption, focusing on local support for any testing program and superintendents' attitudes toward state mandates. School district participation is a policy innovation; local support, an adopter characteristic; and state program incentives and disincentives, innovation attributes. The purposes of the study are to: (1) clarify the importance of incentives and disincentives for adopters and nonadopters of a competency based testing (CBT) policy; (2) examine the relationship between local support and participation in the state CBT program; and  (3) investigate the relationship between local support and state incentives and disincentives. Findings, based on a 1984 survey of school district superintendents, show that local districts sharing the state's goal of competency assessment are more likely to enroll in the state-sponsored CBT policy. Early adopters demonstrate greater local support and less negative attitudes toward state regulation, and districts characterized as likely future adopters show stronger local support and more positive attitudes toward state services. Adopter characteristics and innovation attributes must therefore be studied together. The local control issue may delay initial participation, but state assistance encourages later adoption. Tables are included that demonstrate the relationship among local  support, legislative provisions, and differences between adopters and nonadopters. (LMI)",

        "description":"Government policies of developing nations to stimulate economic development do not necessarily improve the living conditions of their citizens, most of whom are economically poor and politically powerless. A major criticism of attempts by most Western and national governments to promote development is that they serve only the elite. This study of the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP) discusses the limitations and potential of a popular education movement in India. The KSSP, which translates into &quot;Kerala Science Literature Society,&quot; was begun in 1962 to make scientific knowledge available to the people in the language of the state. Growth in membership has been accompanied by an increasing involvement with left-wing political activists. Dilemmas facing the KSSP are conflicts  between Marxist and middle-class leadership over definition of &quot;the people&quot; and &quot;science&quot; and the relationship of science to religion and to the state. Lessons that can be learned from the KSSP movement demonstrate: the importance of an independent, sufficient financial base; leadership dedication to original objectives; a large &quot;critical mass&quot; of volunteers; less organizational hierarchy; recruitment of the elite; alliance with other organizations; and utilization of the arts as information disseminators. Despite its problems, the KSSP provides an innovative, indigenous model for mass educational reform. (LMI)",

This paper, exploratory in nature, describes the policy impact of shared governance in nine autonomous schools where the participants at each site have provided some insight into policy issues. It also focuses on the \"Empowerment Project,\" a 3-year effort in nine school districts, nationwide, to empower professionals to empower students to become independent learners; to assist central office administrators and board of education members in establishing autonomous schools in which empowerment of staff members and students may take place; to help principals reconceptualize their roles from directors of their schools to  developers of human potential; to aid teachers in decision-making and in taking decision-making responsibility; and to chronicle the empowerment process in each project school. If participative decision-making is to be successfully implemented, a wide range of policy changes will need to occur. These include a reframing of the traditional roles of administrators and teachers within a given building, the placement of decision-making authorities within the school building and district, and the involvement of school constituencies in all aspects of school life.

        "description":"In 1984 the Learning Technology Center (LTC) at Texas A &amp; M University negotiated agreements with three K-12 Texas public school districts to explore ways that computer technologies could be used to assist in managing instructional programs. The intent was to establish a field-based research environment in which information technologies for educators could be designed, developed, and tested. Since the agreements were negotiated before any design specifications existed, LTC could only share ideas concerning computers' assistance in alleviating paperwork associated with planning and evaluating instruction, empowering practitioners as decision makers, and tapping the power of leading edge technologies. In exchange for the center's provision of products and services resulting from  the collaboration, the participating schools agreed to provide a setting in which a few key teachers and administrators could work with products as they were developed. The school sites also agreed to allow LTC personnel to conduct research on the development, implementation, and use of emergent products and services. The collaboration facilitated the development of a comprehensive instructional management system now being used at several schools. This paper discusses: (1) the activities characterizing the partners' relationship between 1984 and 1989; (2) project development programs; (3) collaboration results; and (4) recommendations for ensuring successful future collaborations.

In 1978, 8.1 percent of public school administrative positions were occupied by minority men but only 3.4 percent were occupied by minority women. Blacks are the predominant minority group represented in administration. While minority women administrators, like white female administrators, are largely concentrated in positions as consultants and supervisors of instruction, minority men are highly represented among assistant principals, comprising one of every seven assistant principalships. The difference is important because assistant principals and athletic directors are most likely to move  upward within administration while consultants and instructional supervisors are seldom in the career advancement path in administration. Compared to their male colleagues, women administrators: (1) attain the principalship at an older age than do male principals; (2) teach longer than do men before entering administration; (3) are more likely than men to continue graduate education part-time while serving as principals; and (4) earn less than men. Appended are strategies for increasing women's access to administrative positions. (14 references) (KM)",

The first section outlines  principles and recommendations for developing comprehensive family support, education, and involvement systems. The second section discusses a framework of family programs, illustrating how state efforts to support, educate, and involve families reinforce school improvement goals and help to achieve success for all students.

Whereas NCPEA's approach was always egalitarian and tied to a policy of individual membership, UCEA was organized more formally and followed a more restricted institutional membership policy. Although both approaches have merit and are complementary, the two associations have grown apart over the years. There are two causes for the bad feelings between the organizations: (1) disagreement over research/theory emphases; and (2) loss of mission, accompanied by financial difficulties and declining membership. Without a mission, the two associations were in no  position to provide leadership and leverage against the inherent weaknesses of the colleges and universities housing them. At one extreme, some educational programs became &quot;cash cows&quot; devoid of academic standards. In other instances, slavish imitation of arts and sciences approaches made the educational administration program irrelevant to the practice of managing schools. In response to recent national directives to improve administrator preparation programs, the NCPEA and the UCEA could collaborate to bring about reform. A modest reform agenda is proposed to establish voluntary standards for recruiting and screening preservice candidates; reestablish full-time study as the norm; and commit to establishing full-time faculty consisting of both scholars and recently experienced clinical  professors.

        "description":"To be effective, project management requires a heavy dependence on the document, list, and computational capability of a computerized environment. Now that microcomputers are readily available, only the rediscovery of classic project management methodology is required for improved resource allocation in small research projects. This paper provides an overview of project management, its associated tools, and the key literature in the field. The term &quot;project&quot; refers to the organization doing the work, dedicated to completing a single task within a specific time frame. The overall project task is differentiated from a routine task by virtue of its: (1) requiring an unusually rapid completion time; (2) meeting very tight cost constraints; and (3) need to dispel considerable initial  uncertainty among project personnel regarding completion methods. These three criteria underline the project's finite nature and emphasize the exaggerated concern for maintaining schedules and costs. Accompanied by numerous illustrations, project management concepts such as preplanning, project control, work breakdown structure, graphic management procedures, and project scheduling are thoroughly discussed. Because certain evaluation tools can assume a reality of their own, management intervention may be needed to complete tasks on schedule. The justification for using project management tools may be found in improved grant management. (11 references) (MLH)",

        "description":"The California Education Summit, which brought together some 300 individuals representing major groups driving California education reform (teachers, principals, superintendents, parents, students, school board members, business leaders, and community members), was called for two reasons: (1) to begin developing a consensus, or game plan for the 1990s, regarding the next steps to upgrade California schools; and (2) to reflect on participants' experience and identify elements that would ensure the success of any forthcoming national efforts. Participants agreed on fundamental goals, beginning with the premise that more students must be educated to higher levels than ever before. At least 25 percent of students entering high school should earn a bachelor's degree, another 25  percent should earn an associate degree from a community college, and at least 40 percent should make a successful school/work transition, thus reducing the dropout rate by 10 percent. To accomplish these goals, more students must read, write, compute, communicate, and think at higher levels. Schools must teach a thinking curriculum, so that students become active learners, develop real understanding of fundamental concepts and ideas, and apply knowledge creatively. The key strategies emerging from group discussions included the following: (1) increasing accountability and improving assessment; (2) enhancing the curriculum; (3) improving high school transitions; (4) improving adult literacy; (5) organizing more effective services for children, youth, and families at risk; (6)  restructuring to improve student performance; and (7) improving teacher preparation and recruitment.

Also included is an overview of programs and initiatives designed to address those needs. In general, it appears that the legislation has prompted states to consider needs and develop initiatives in all four subject areas, with  the greatest efforts focused on mathematics and science instruction. Many teachers of specific computer courses are self-taught, and the states see an increasing need for formal instruction. Foreign language instruction remains minimal at both the elementary and secondary levels in many states. In addressing the issue of access to instruction by historically underserved student groups, the states seem concerned primarily with increasing the enrollment of females and ethnic minority students in advanced mathematics and science courses.

        "description":"The state of Oregon has mandated special educational programming or services for K-12 gifted and talented children to begin by the 1991-92 school year. Because financial support is lacking, most instruction of gifted and talented students will occur within regular classrooms. This monograph addresses the problem of providing appropriate instruction for young (kindergarten through grade 2) gifted children in the regular classroom. In chapter 1, a case study of a first-grade child and his drawings underlines the need for appropriate educational experiences for young, gifted children. In chapter 2, definitions of &quot;giftedness&quot; are discussed, along with the characteristics of young, bright children. Chapter 3 focuses on identification, and chapter 4 suggests ways to assess educational  levels and rates of learning as required by the mandate. In chapter 5, program options and models are discussed. Chapter 6 offers four major ways to differentiate the curriculum. Chapter 7 focuses on the importance of interests to young children. Chapter 8 suggests how to organize for instruction, with an emphasis on thematic teaching and learning centers. Chapter 9 considers the needs of the whole child in instruction--the emotional, physical, social, and intuitive aspects as well as the cognitive. In chapter 10, parents are offered ideas on providing a responsive environment and on being a school advocate. The appendices include the Oregon Mandate, a list of publishers for the gifted, summaries of conceptual models, and a curriculum criteria checklist. (45 references) (MLH)",

A newsletter begun without good planning and without a clearly defined purpose, however, could end up being nothing more than a drain on resources: a regularly scheduled pain in the neck. A few components of a good newsletter include: (1) a series of smaller purposes that complement the main purpose and that provide variety for the reader; (2) a tone and voice that is consistent from issue to issue; and (3) a graphic style that is not only consistent from issue to issue, but also allows for some measure of visual variety to distinguish one issue  from another. Once the conceptual aspects of the newsletter have been handled, the practical matters such as deciding on an editor and determining who will write the newsletter remain to be considered. It is useful to compare the undertaking of a newsletter to the gearing up of a small new business (within a larger organization) with its own staffing, budget, and procedures. (KM)",

The surveys provide an account of the factors that affect the status and characteristics of the K-8 principal. An 8-page instrument was mailed in the spring of 1987 to 2,414 randomly selected National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) principals. A follow-up study was mailed to the total sample, with 834 responses received, representing a response rate of 34.5 percent. What emerged from the data is a profile of the typical K-8 principal. He is a white male in his late forties who has been a professional educator for 22 years and a principal for 11 years. A NAESP member, he holds a master's degree  and state certification. He has an 11-month contract at a salary of $40,000, with a 50-hour work week. Unsatisfactory student performance is his greatest potential job security problem. He exercises discretionary control over 17 percent of the school budget and believes that the authority he is given to run his school is appropriately balanced with the degree to which he is held responsible when things go wrong. As a group, elementary school principals are satisfied in their job, confident in their skills, and upbeat about their future. (JAM)",

        "description":"This study was the third in a series of national studies of the high school principalship dating back to the early 1960s. Its major purpose was to analyze and describe high school leaders and their schools. This volume describes the characteristics and behaviors of high performing principals (type \"A\") and typically performing principals (\"type B\") as they relate to school effectiveness, and it identifies the administrative and programmatic similarities and differences between effective schools administered by principals described as \"type A\" principals and those administered by \"type B\" principals. The original population from which the sites (n=74) to be visited were selected consisted of schools whose current principals had participated with average or above average ratings in  the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) Assessment Center and in the field testing of the NASSP Comprehensive Assessment of School Environments (CASE) battery. Two researchers conducted structured interviews with administrators, teachers, and parents for a period of 3 days at eight sites. Following each site visit, the researchers prepared a case study for each school. The following major conclusions emerged: (1) The relationship between principals' assessor skills and their school management skills was not clearcut; (2) the most effective schools had well-coordinated administrative teams; (3) effective schools had strong and creative principals; (4) administrative team success was limited by the level of school autonomy; (5) instructional leadership was most  commonly exercised by department chairpersons with the support of the administrative team and the assistance of district supervisors and was a shared responsibility; (6) student satisfaction was highest in stable schools; and (7) student self-esteem was important to school efficiency or cost-effectiveness. Appendices A through F show NASSP assessor dimensions, the CASE model of the school environment, CASE variables used, administrative team site visit protocols, teacher protocols, and parent protocols.

Ten chapters written by prominent educators center on the roles to be played by education professionals, local citizen groups, government agencies, and business leaders in shaping education policy, responses to racial and ethnic segregation, school restructuring, technology utilization, and the development of education politics and policy. The introductory chapter by Margaret E. Goertz examines the changing social, economic, technological, and political environment shaping education politics for the 21st century, and provides an overview of the contents of this book. David Clark and Terry Astuto predict no change in direction for federal education policy in chapter 2. In chapter  3, Gary Orfield and Lawrence Peskin, in their discussion and description of the \"Atlanta Compromise,\" argue that if attempts are not made to integrate urban schools, poor and minority children will be condemned to attend schools that are both separate and equal. Chapters 4 (Thomas Timar) and 5 (Mary Metz) explore political, institutional, and cultural forces that shape school restructuring efforts. In chapter 6, Philip Piele examines the utilization of technology in the classroom and argues that technological innovation will not begin to change schools until it offers an educationally viable, cost-effective alternative to the classroom teacher. Chapters 7 (Kent McGuire) and 8 (Carol Ray and Rosalyn Mickelson) explore the role of business in education reform. In chapter 9, Ian Birch and  Don Smart examine the forces of change in Australian education politics. The final chapter ends with a historical review of the foundations of the politics of education and an appraisal of issues likely to control policy making in the years ahead. (JAM)",

        "description":"Although the initial focus of the reform movement was on teachers, considerable attention has been devoted to administrators--especially principals--since it has been recognized that the quality of a principal's leadership has a significant impact on the effectiveness of the educational programs in our schools. The purpose of this guide is to assist principals and their evaluators to identify the philosophical roles of the principal, the proficiencies required of principals, the purpose of the evaluation, and efficient procedures for the evaluation process. Additional information contained within this document includes the perspectives of the experts, a case study of the principal evaluation process in a moderate-sized Connecticut school system, and concluding remarks. The ideas  and activities addressed in this publication are designed to promote an evaluation program that will lead to better learning and growth experiences for principals. Ultimately, the evaluation and growth processes will ensure that only effective principals continue in the profession. Appended are an annotated bibliography of primary references on the abilities, competencies, and skills of the principal; the proficiencies of the effective principal cross-referenced to major studies of principalship; and the Principals' Survey.

        "description":"Inequitable health care for males and females is surprisingly commonplace. Despite this, health care providers, civil rights groups, educators, and even women's rights advocates have largely overlooked the issue. The 11 chapters of this document provide the first extensive civil rights view of sex discrimination in health services. Using Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 as references points, this manual offers a framework to assess health services at schools and colleges, suggests options and strategies for institutional change applicable to arenas outside the education setting, and helps those interested in providing sex-fair health care evaluate the services offered, identify health-related equity issues (such as\"special\" programs for young mothers), and eliminate discriminatory practices by understanding and using Title IX. Equity issues are discussed in the context of specific topic areas ranging from pregnancy and gynecological health care to mental health and alcohol and drug abuse services. The appendices contain a guide to what Title IX says regarding sex-fair health services and provide a set of charts for gathering information regarding Title IX and school health services to be used in conjunction with the text of the book.

Six national education goals, to be reached by the year 2000, were identified as the first step in carrying out that commitment. The goals are as follows: (1) All children in America will start school ready to learn; (2) the high school graduation rate will increase to at least 90 percent; (3) American students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having demonstrated competency in challenging subject matter including English, mathematics, science, history, and geography; they will also have learned to use their minds well, so they may be prepared for  responsible citizenship, further learning, and productive employment in our modern economy; (4) U.S. students will be first in the world in science and mathematics achievement; (5) every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and to exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship; and (6) every school in America will be free of drugs and violence and will offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning. Several objectives are given under each goal, and the document concludes with brief guidelines for the changing and restructuring of the U.S. educational system that will be necessary to achieve these goals.

        "description":"Although computer-assisted instruction (CAI) simulates a conversation between a tutor and student, it does not permit the quality of interaction so desirable in the tutorial process. This study attempted to see if team learning techniques might be one answer to the lack of interaction in programmed instruction. What would happen if pairs of students took a CAI course cooperatively? Thirty liberal arts college students were selected for this experiment on a predictor variable, College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) scores (verbal only), to take a computer-guided statistics course. Students were divided into low- and high-scoring groups. In each group, 10 students formed pairs and 5 worked separately as controls. After the final exam, students were administered a questionnaire  designed to measure their perceptions of their performance and those of their partners, if they were paired. The results from this study seem to indicate that students paired on CEEB verbal scores as a predictor variable will do as well as their controls on a final exam in a CAI course. In addition, they can complete the course in the same amount of time as their controls. The economic advantage is quickly realized since the cost of the educational terminal device has been cut by a factor of two in the process. (MLF)",

        "description":"There is a strong statistical correlation between delinquency activity level and the level of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use in adolescents. A strong association between drug use, drug trafficking, and youth gangs has also emerged. However, several important questions concerning the relationship of delinquency, gang membership, and AOD use remain unanswered in the research literature. To address these issues, the first section of the overview summarizes current knowledge about the extent of AOD use among delinquents and the relationship between AOD use and delinquency. Recently, researchers have reached consensus regarding the existence of an underlying deviance factor associated with various deviant or risk-taking behaviors in adolescence. Evidence for this viewpoint derives  from three sources: (1) etiological and risk factor research on antisocial behavior, school adjustment, family and peer influences, and intrapersonal risk factors; (2) age prevalence data; and (3) attempts to measure directly the presence of a latent deviance factor. The overview next explores the related question of gang member involvement in delinquency, drug use, and drug trafficking. The final section discusses strategies to reduce the prevalence of drug use and delinquency through prevention and intervention programs. The report also contains tables categorizing research by topics, a research abstracts section, and a bibliography of 159 references. (Author/MLH)",

Forty-seven State Part H Coordinators completed and returned the State Progress Scale between January and April of 1989. For each of the 14 components, progress was assessed in three areas: policy development, policy approval, and policy implementation. Results of the study indicate: (1) every state has made some progress in several of the 14 components; (2) states have made more progress in policy development than in policy approval or implementation; (3) the area of policy development in which the most progress was reported was &quot;definition of developmentally delayed&quot;; and (4) the areas of least progress related to  financial issues and interagency coordination. Results show that many states will have trouble in meeting the 1990 timeline required by the legislation. A number of options are presented as possible federal solutions to encourage states to implement the law and help states avoid the problem of non-compliance.

        "description":"The Statewide Systems Change Project for the Severely Handicapped was a federally funded project established to develop activities to improve the quality of special education and related services for learners with severe handicaps and to encourage a change in service delivery from segregated to integrated environments. The project identified best educational practices and implemented them within a delivery system involving an agency for preschoolers with severe handicaps, a special education program for elementary-aged learners, and a regular integrated education program. Guidelines for systems change are presented in the areas of philosophy, assessment, instruction, related services, staff development, and administration. Appendices, which comprise the bulk of the guidelines,  include: best educational practice statements, a sample philosophy statement, activities for promoting acceptance among participants in integrating learners with severe handicaps, age-appropriate opportunities for integration, an ecological inventory, functional curriculum concepts, community-based instruction, intervention strategies, instructional goals, a needs assessment instrument, a strategy for staff development, a policy and procedures review of special education programs, a transition procedure, a neighborhood preschool physical facilities checklist, community services survey, information on working with a steering committee, and an evaluation framework. Forty references, a list of films used in the project, and a glossary conclude the work. (JDD)",

The purpose of the survey was to describe and assess current service delivery systems within Indiana for children with severe handicaps. Part One of the survey gathered data on: the types of handicaps that students placed in classes for the severely handicapped might have, the setting in which the program is located, the scope of Individualized Education Programs, the number of years of teacher experience, the number of students each teacher serves, the number of students with severe handicaps in classes with nonhandicapped students, and whether the setting is rural or urban. Part Two analyzed specific &quot;best educational  practice&quot; information regarding age-appropriate placement with nonhandicapped peers, social integration, curriculum and instruction, home-school partnership, transition planning, related services, and program evaluation.

Sixty-two surveys were distributed to service agencies, and 39 were returned, representing 97 counties serving 3,608 persons with severe handicaps. The survey collected information regarding types of disabilities, settings of service, types of goals written into individualized instruction plans, day placement with nonhandicapped peers, barriers to integration, integration plans, respite care, daycare provisions, written transition agreements between schools and agencies, existence of timetables for transition objectives, and  participants in the transition planning process. Results suggest that agencies provide a vast majority of their services at the agency site rather than in natural environments, a number of agency clients were participating with nonhandicapped peers in a variety of day placements, a relatively low number of agencies were providing respite care, and transition services were frequently implemented by preschool service providers.

Required case study components in Illinois include an interview with the child, consultation with the child's parents, social developmental study, assessment of the child's adaptive behavior, assessment of the child's cultural background, medical history/current health status, vision and hearing screening, academic history, assessment of current educational functioning and level of educational achievement, evaluation of learning processes, assessment of learning environment, and specialized evaluations, including speech/language and psychological, as needed. A total of 549 professionals were surveyed, including regular and special education teachers, administrators,  psychologists, school social workers, and other practitioners. Respondents were asked to rate usefulness of the various case study components and indicate what professional should have primary responsibility for component completion. Overall ratings for usefulness of case study components were high. Highest ratings were for current educational functioning and psychological evaluation. In general, components that were psychoeducational and medical ranked as more useful than those that were sociological/environmental. Teachers, psychologists, and social workers emerged as primary diagnosticians. Modifications of case study components for different age levels and for variations in severity of behavior disorder are also examined. (JDD)",

Information for the report was obtained from BIA's special education coordinators. The report estimates that 2,948 handicapped Indian children aged 3 and 4 live on the 63 reservations. Only 838 were receiving special education services in school year 1988-89 from one or more service providers, including BIA, Head Start, Indian Head Start, and local public school districts. Of the 2,110 preschoolers who were not receiving special education services, about 1,237 were not individually identified and located, a process required by federal regulations. Of the 791 handicapped Indian  preschoolers with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), at least 24% were receiving fewer services than their IEPs prescribed. Preschoolers received insufficient services because of shortages of qualified personnel and inadequate funding to hire them. In addition, BIA, the Department of Education, and the states have differing interpretations about who must provide services to handicapped Indian children on reservations with BIA schools. Seven appendixes include: a technical description of the methodologies used to estimate the number of handicapped Indian preschoolers; the data collection instrument; and comments from the Department of the Interior.

The study compared the impact of a computer-supported versus pencil-and-paper writing process program on students' writing quality and attitudes. The study involved 62 fourth-grade students in treatment classrooms using computers, 16 of whom were LD students, and 65 students in comparison classrooms not using computers, 13 of whom were LD students. Results showed modest support for a computer-supported writing environment. The computer, in combination with an  instructional approach that emphasized extensive composing, revising, and individualized help, contributed to gains in writing quality. Experimental students reported a greater enjoyment of writing at the end of the study year than they reported at the beginning. (JDD)",

No major increasing trends were found in enrollment or expenditures over the years studied. Numbers of inappropriate referrals were reduced. Complaints and hearings were not a major problem in most areas, and most special education students were enrolled in buildings that also held regular education classes.

Barrier categories include equipment, implementation, teacher training, teaching as a profession, and classroom environment. The second section describes factors in the success of four technology programs. Edward Blackhurst outlines the development of professional standards with respect to technology, certification and licensure standards, identification of technology skills, and teacher training. Steven Robinson describes the experience and research of the Amherst H. Wilder  Foundation which indicate technology's potential in creating a powerful instructional environment. The University of Washington's approach, involving development of a grassroots network of support for classroom technology, is discussed by Owen White. Harriet Copel emphasizes that implementation requires an understanding of what motivates the individual teacher and how technology can help in each individual classroom situation. The final section of the report consolidates the thinking of the symposium participants during the process of identifying implementation barriers and possible solutions. (JDD)",

Six areas of research are addressed: choice making through environmental control, means of accessing instruction, alternative and augmentative means of communicating, information feedback in instructional design, graphics in instructional design, and speech technology. The research focuses on hardware design, software design, pedagogy embodied in those designs, teaching procedures to effect optimal  use, and the outcomes that the designs serve.

Analysis of student (N=263) evaluation of the things they liked best indicated overwhelmingly positive attitudes toward the program with the most valued aspects being classes, dorm time, options, counselors, and friendships. Program evaluation by counselors (N=26) were also very positive. Counselors saw the social environment as the most important strength of the program and low pay their most prevalent concern.  Program evaluation by teachers (N=36) was also positive. Teachers' greatest frustration was with the process of acquiring and preparing instructional materials. Administrators were concerned with hiring and pre-service orientation of staff. Specific program recommendations based on evaluation feedback are detailed. The evaluation instruments used are appended. The second document provides a less detailed summary of the same program evaluation. (DB)",

Linguistic and cultural complications, economic and attitudinal factors, sociocultural peer-group expectations, cross-cultural stress, intergenerational conflict, and school system conflict frequently deflect efforts to recognize giftedness and talent areas. Strategies are outlined for dealing with each of these specific complicating factors, and include such techniques as explaining the concept of gifted education to immigrant parents in their own language, increasing the home-school interface, encouraging journal writing, placing students according to educational background and not chronological age, and ensuring that screening and selection committees  have sufficient cultural knowledge.

The paper then discusses the responses of three organizations to the assumptions, as delineated in the joint policy statement of the National Education Association, the Council for Exceptional Children, and the American Association of School Administrators. The assumptions include: students are more alike than different; all good teachers use the same basic techniques and strategies; pull-out programs should be eliminated; the separation of special education and regular education programs results in inefficiency, duplication, and fragmentation; labeling is unnecessary and stigmatizes students; and physically separate education is discriminatory and unequal. The responses refute each  of these assumptions and argue against the effectiveness of the REI in meeting the needs of special students. A 16-item bibliography is appended. (JDD)",

Student data on performance of multiple-step functional tasks were collected and correlations were calculated between probe session scores and corresponding scores on training sessions closest in time. While the majority of student data sets were not significantly correlated, significant differences that did exist between groups indicated that single opportunity probe data were more likely to be  variable, and the difference between probe and training scores was greater under the single opportunity probe condition. Results suggest that: (1) probe conditions are not the same as extinction; (2) training data do not consistently reflect performance under probe conditions; and (3) teachers may need to use different criteria to interpret data collected under different probe conditions.

Fifty-eight low-risk pre-term Hungarian children are compared to 100 full-term children, from birth to age 6, on socioeconomic status, family climate, and intellectual stimulation. Maternal attitudes are analyzed in terms of perfectionism, over-permissiveness, over-protectiveness, rejecting/neglecting, predictability, and authoritarian/democratic elements. The evidence indicates that perinatal risk conditions such as preterm birth have a differential impact on mental development depending upon social-environmental factors. Advantaged family circumstances may reduce or even fully compensate for the adverse  effects of perinatal risks, while a disadvantaged environment is likely to amplify them. Includes 59 references.

A conceptual model guided the analysis of talk aloud protocols elicited from students as they answered questions from textbook materials used in an introductory oceanography class. Results indicated that knowledge base differences were more important than language group differences, and the most difficult questions were those requiring application of textbook information to a new situation. The data suggest that ESL students with high levels of domain-specific knowledge may compensate for less than perfect proficiency in English by employing relevant conceptual knowledge and using that knowledge to aid  text processing. Overall, project activities indicate that ESL and native English speakers attempt to use similar strategies when they read text. Most individuals demonstrated flexibility in the strategies they used for comprehension. Reasons for differences in performance appeared to reside in the likelihood that the strategy produced the &quot;correct&quot; result and in processing efficiency. Important questions for future research are those that address the nature of the cognitive, motivational, and attitudinal costs of inefficient processing and the developmental course of efficient processing in English by ESL speakers. Twenty-eight tables and 13 figures are included. (Author/JL)",

The test used for discussion is a tape-recorded test consisting of six parts, scored by a trained rater using the American Council of the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL)/Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) proficiency scale. A review of research on different SOPI tests in different contexts reveals a high correlation with the OPI and some practical and psychometric advantages over it. The OPI must be administered by a trained interviewer, whereas any teacher, aide, or language lab technician can administer the SOPI. The SOPI can be  simultaneously administered to a group of examinees by a single administrator, whereas the OPI must be individually administered. The SOPI may be preferred for some testing purposes, such as qualification for employment, and the OPI for others such as placement or program evaluation. It is concluded that the SOPI may not be, as previously characterized, only a &quot;second-order substitute&quot; for the OPI. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study examining the perceptions of college students in beginning foreign language classes toward various teaching discovered a discrepancy between the value students and teachers ascribe to communicative language teaching. The study was conducted at the University of South Carolina, in two classes where a variety of teaching techniques were used. At the end of the semester, students were surveyed on their use of language learning strategies, background as learners, and the value and difficulty of the classroom and homework activities. Thirty-one students (out of 40) completed the questionnaire. Results show that the five activities found to be most valuable to students were (1) correction of pronunciation; (2) oral correction of grammar; (3) pronunciation practice in class; (4)  oral grammar practice in sentences; and (5) memorizing vocabulary. Dialogue memorization was the least favored activity. Activities having a communicative or process orientation were not highly valued. As a followup, the questionnaire was administered to beginning and intermediate students in South Carolina and California, English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) students at all levels in a binational center in Uruguay, and ESL students in an intensive English program in South Carolina. Results were similar, with the intensive language learners' responses diverging the most. Implications for language teaching are discussed. (MSE)",

A sample analysis of a typical \"People\" magazine reveals Americans' interests in nationalism, national pastimes, youth, sex appeal, diet, food, glamour, and cleanliness. Because each magazine reflects only one segment of the reading public, it is advisable for several different magazines to be analyzed, contrasted, and discussed.

The unit addresses specific language functions, through syntactic forms, in the context of everyday social encounters that refugees are likely to find themselves. Difficulties encountered in implementing the unit include use of Indonesian teachers to teach appropriate English usage to Vietnamese students, rigidity of interpretation of the cultural information imparted, the need for instruction in lexical and grammatical forms as well as socially appropriate language, and the need to address the affective domain in intercultural encounters. Proposed  solutions include offering Indonesian teachers loose cultural guidelines rather than rigid social rules, establishing a buddy system in which American volunteers are paired with newly arrived refugees or families for increased interaction, and classroom learning integrating formal language instruction and experience outside the classroom. Appended materials include the social language unit and transcripts of videos used in the unit. Videos are not included. (MSE)",

        "description":"In its second year, Methodologies of Bilingual Instruction in Literacy Education (Project MOBILE) provided 373 students of limited English proficiency, native speakers of Spanish and Haitian Creole, with supplementary English as a Second Language (ESL), native language arts (NLA), and content-area instruction. Project MOBILE stressed the acquisition of English and development of mathematics and computer skills through computer use. The project also provided staff and curriculum development activities and basic skills courses for parents, and met its objectives in ESL, computer science, and curriculum development. It met one staff development objective, and partially met content area objectives. Lack of data made assessment of objectives impossible in the areas of Spanish NLA,  attendance, grade retention, referral to remedial programs and special education, staff awareness of pupil problems and needs, placement in programs for the gifted and talented and in postsecondary institutions, and parent involvement. Recommendations for program improvement include allocation of appropriate space for a resource and computer center at one site, and continued efforts to increase parental understanding and involvement in the program, offering activities of interest to parents such as ESL and/or basic skills.

Project strengths included a holistic, interdisciplinary, hands-on approach, an active engagement with community ventures, and the maintenance of an excellent relationship with school personnel.

In some cases, the constant influx of new students made functional grouping impossible, placing students at diverse ESL levels in the same class. Recommendations for program improvement include: examining effects of new LEP eligibility rules on demand for Chapter I funds to supplement tax levies, evaluating effects of class size on ESL learning; and exploring the effectiveness of the program model as it relates to student acquisition of English language skills and time needed to mainstream.

The first study of 60 students found significant differences between the mean grades of students participating in the tutor-led groups and the mean grades of a control set of students. In the second, corroborative study of 164 students, the tutored students received higher average grades and were less likely to fail or drop out of a class. The results of these studies demonstrate the importance of writing and talk  in the learning process, and, based on qualitative evaluation of the data, it appears that expressive talk is an equal if not greater contributor to the learning process than is writing. The results also raise questions about the effectiveness of the lecture mode as an instructional tool with the ESL population. (JL)",

        "description":"At an employer's request, a course was developed to improve the speech skills, and remediate fossilized speech, of six Asian engineers and scientists. All had spoken English for many years, and averaged 10 years of residence in the United States. These students were recorded reading a dialogue as well as in free speech. A needs assessment was performed by analyzing the recordings and by tests of grammar and listening comprehension. Based on the results, instruction focused on developing more comprehensible speech, using existing knowledge of vocabulary and structure. Emphasis was placed on suprasegmentals and certain problematic phonemes, with some work on grammatical errors. Techniques were used to stimulate student motivation to improve speech. Instruction consisted of teacher  explanations and demonstrations, structured oral practice, communicative activities, and laboratory and home work with language tapes. At the end of the course, three students clearly demonstrated improvement. All students felt they had benefited from the course and petitioned to have it extended. Teaching students with fossilized speech requires a different approach, focusing more on form and paying greater attention to student motivation. Small classes, individualization, and improvement of student self-monitoring are advisable. (MSE)",

        "description":"A review is made on the impact of educational policy making and institutional change in New York State during the governorship of Nelson Rockefeller. The study reveals how the governorship had been made an instrument of public policy, working with a strongly led Board of Regents and the educational establishment in transforming the State University of New York (SUNY) into the nation's largest multicampus public university. The expansion of public higher education in New York State is analyzed in the context of political, economic, and social developments throughout the 1960s. While the blueprint for SUNY's growth was central, parallel shifts in the state's public sector and in the City University are important elements in the analysis. The study also shows how a confluence of  individuals and events in the state provided the impetus for the growth of higher education, resulting in the nation's first and third largest public universities, largest private university sector, largest student aid program, and a broad-based political support for these enterprises making New York State Higher Education a major political and economic force.

        "description":"College union administrators should be careful about the use of facilities, particularly in public schools, because of the potential for legal liability. Institutions of higher education today are vulnerable to being sued in regard to issues of free speech, trespass, and religion. Areas of potential liability include (1) serving alcoholic beverages, (2) certain potentially physically harmful activities, e.g., trampolining, (3) structural hazards such as holes in athletic fields and dangerous staircases (particularly a problem when students have become inebriated), and (4) violations of First Amendment rights. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, although not strongly applying to private schools, is very applicable to public schools. Attempts to restrain, for example, the  exercise of free speech during demonstrations, or the banning of activities of certain religious groups must be carefully considered. Additionally, in matters of student discipline, if the institution acts irresponsibly, a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment is possible. Risk management techniques are considered necessary for all college and university administrators in avoiding legal liability. Ten suggestions are provided on improving the institution's prospects if sued. Contains 3 references. (GLR)",

This monograph attempts to provide a greater awareness and understanding of these issues within the context of the role of college unions and student activities. The first chapter provides an overview for concepts of racism, diversity, and culture and identifies the importance of institutions and power as related to oppression. Chapters 2-5 identify four racial-ethnic group classifications, including Blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, and Native Americans, and supplies historical background information for each group. Chapters 6 and 7 identify gay and lesbian and religious issues as  considerations in diversity. Chapter 8 describes a four-stage model for multicultural education and awareness based on developmental sequence for achieving a multicultural consciousness. The final chapter summarizes authors' comments and conclusions. References accompany each chapter. (GLR)",

The report begins with descriptions of the Alaska Student Loan Program, the Alaska Student Loan Corporation, and two collection agencies: Collect Alaska Network, Inc.; and Patterson and Van Abel. A historical background of the situation of defaulted loans is presented, along with an analysis of the gap in processing past due accounts, the default rate, prospective policy and  approach, and attachment of permanent fund dividends. Information regarding collection proceeds and costs is also provided. Recommendations are made for improving internal controls involving collection contracts, and for further developing and implementing a policy for identifying and writing off uncollectible student loan accounts.

        "description":"Student unions of the 80's struggled to try to find the proper balance between service and education while meeting financial requirements as institutional support began to ebb. Upgrading food service, serving alcoholic beverages, and offering packaged events and mini-courses were all used to serve the needs of the student population as well as bolster revenue. As budgets tightened, university administrators were directing college unions to pay their own way. Unions began accepting corporate support to survive and contracting became popular, but financial burdens were still high. Private businesses are raising unfair competition issues and asking for closer scrutiny of college union enterprises by the Federal government. Today, many private sector contractors are operating union  services. Today's college unions are facing some major problems, among them are space shortages and a loss of mission. The pendulum has swung in favor of financial and operational goals and away from being a unifying force in building a campus community. In the '90s, college unions must reaffirm their legitimacy as an integral part of higher education. (GLR)",

        "description":"This study used economic investment theory and attitudinal survey data to examine the relationship between the decline in low-income participation in higher education and the substitution of loans for grants in federal student financial aid programs. Loans are seen to substantially decrease the net benefits of college attendance to low-income students because of these students' greater risk of academic failure and the addition of fees and interest charges to existing cost barriers. Survey data found that far fewer persons from family incomes of less than $20,000 felt the lifetime return on a college education was greater than its cost. Additionally, low family income is related to less willingness to assume debt for educational or other expenses and to reluctance to take  financial risks for investment purposes. Examination of behavioral data revealed that college enrollment rates of students from poor family backgrounds increased when net college attendance costs were decreased due to availability of grants, that students from poorer backgrounds were likely to select less expensive higher education options, and that the poorest students incurred the greatest growth in indebtedness. It is concluded that only grants achieve desired enrollment gains by low-income students. Appendixes detail the data. Contains 17 references.

        "description":"Early retirement plans (ERPs) have recently been considered and implemented at a number of universities as a means to address their need to contain costs while simultaneously generating new ideas and energy within the institution through the revitalization of faculty ranks. This endorsement of ERPs by university administrators, however, is occurring without sufficient information about the impact of such plans in financial and academic terms. This paper addresses this deficiency and identifies four questions that must be answered to ensure that the university selected ERP is based on more than conjecture. These questions are: (1) How does increased flexibility affect provincial allocation of monies to universities and thus their ability to operate comprehensive programs? (2)  Where are the universities spending their newly acquired flexibility dollars? (3) What are the academic implications of this allocation of flexibility dollars? (4) Is the quality of the applicant pool at least comparable to that of the group of retiring faculty? Institutions of higher education that answer these questions first, before entering into an ERP, will be better able to fit the new ERP with the institutional mandate. Knowing that an ERP results in increased flexibility dollars is an insufficient reason for its adoption. Contains 12 references. (Author/GLR)",

Following this, the report offers summaries of six seminars, including topics  discussed and the recommendations developed, and provides a list of each seminar's participants. Some commonly held opinions from the conference were: (1) there exists a serious lack of standard and compatible definitions and terminology across the spectrum of postsecondary education; (2) the study's focus should be on the student, not the institution; (3) NCES should reimburse, either partially or fully, survey respondents for data provided; (4) NCES should use a &quot;quick survey&quot; technique to rapidly identify changing patterns; (5) data should be made relevant to educational data collected by other federal agencies; and (6) NCES should investigate databases now available to determine if they are sufficient.

        "description":"A preview is given of ASHE-ERIC report no. 7 which focuses on commuting students at colleges and universities and how institutions of higher education can begin to respond to these students' special circumstances that are greatly affecting their educational experience. The diversity of commuter students and their educational goals requires the use of multiple approaches, such as human development theories, campus design, and the use of Maslow's hierarchy, of needs. Institutions of higher education can determine whether or not commuter students' goals and educational needs are being met by first developing a commuter student profile, then by carrying out an institutional self-appraisal of its services and offerings that benefit all students, and finally, by completing an analysis  of the institution/student interactions that are important to the student's development and campus life. Thirteen principle elements of a comprehensive institutional response are provided. Six references. (GLR)",

        "description":"Several major studies have identified student commuters as being at particularly high risk for attrition from higher educational institutions. This report reviews the knowledge that exists about students-as-commuters in depth. Among the implications for educational policy makers is the need for commuter institutions to provide opportunities to increase students' involvement and to evaluate the institution's impact. Educators should assess how students think about important issues and how the environment of the commuter institution either challenges or supports their thinking. Ways that institutions can assess their effectiveness with their commuting students and create a sense of community for them within the institution are outlined. One model describes the development of a  comprehensive institutional response to the student-as-commuter in three stages. In stage 1, institution merely removes obvious barriers like requirements for admission or housing. In stage 2, separate student programs specifically for commuters on residential campuses are developed. Finally, stage 3 involves the active use of the principles of justice and fairness to correct inequities in a system that de facto discriminates against one group in favor of another. Thirteen recommendations for developing a plan of action are provided. Contains 275 references. (GLR)",

The survey focused on: (1) student financial needs, (2) student perceptions of academic and service programs, (3) student attitudes towards programs and services, and (4) the educational quality of student &quot;out of class&quot; activities. Surveys were obtained from 176 students. Findings are reported in terms of descriptive data, sex, age range, level of education, source, educational plans, financial support/financial costs, composite grades, instruction and curriculum, facilities related to instruction, administration, and UCT activities. Physical facilities were the area in which students were the most  displeased. Students also desired more information prior to attending the University and improved procedures for registration and applying for financial aid. Eleven recommendations were developed which include the following: increase the focus of future marketing toward female students, develop greater congruence between syllabi and instruction, and increase efforts to improve the physical condition of the classrooms.

        "description":"Since 1978, when the Middle Income Student Assistance Act was passed, federal, state, and institutional student financial aid developments have consistently expanded programs, eligibility, and benefits for students from middle and affluent family income backgrounds. Poverty-level students have experienced substantial declines in gift aid and increased use of loans, while students whose family incomes were more than 200% of the poverty threshold reported less use of student loans and greater gift aid. The 1980s also saw growing disparity between college participation rates of students from the bottom and top halves of the family income distribution; this finding holds for males, females, whites, blacks, and Hispanics. States serve as the largest reservoir of middle income and  affluent student financial aid, and state appropriations to need-based student aid programs targeted on low-income students constitute less than 6% of state support for higher education. Institutional gift assistance appears to be awarded to students without regard to financial need. The financial aid goal of equalizing higher educational opportunity for the most financially disadvantaged groups has not been achieved, and during the 1980s the higher educational participation of the poor greatly deteriorated relative to that goal and relative to what was accomplished during the 1970s.

A survey instrument was developed listing 249 attributes of faculty scholarship, and 340 faculty members (66% of the total surveyed) weighed each attribute in relation to its importance within their conception of faculty scholarship. Four significant and orthogonal dimensions of faculty scholarship were identified, accounting for 41.6% of the total variation. The four factors were identified as pedagogy; publication and professional recognition; intellectual characteristics of scholars; and creative and artistic attributes. Factors described not just what faculty  scholars do, but the way in which they go about the activities they pursue, their general orientations, and values associated with activities, processes, and products. Several of the variables that loaded highly on the factors encompassed the outcomes and consequences of faculty members' activities and orientations, such as long-lasting positive impact of teachers on students and concern for the development of others.

Data used were from the 1985-1988 follow-up surveys of 1981-1984 freshmen. Student data were also requested directly from the institutions themselves, concerning degree earned, number of years completed, admission test scores, and current enrollment status. Three retention measures were utilized: (1) received a bachelor's degree 4 years after college entry; (2) received a bachelor's degree 4 years after college entry or had completed 4 years of course work; and (3) received a bachelor's degree, or completed 4 years, or was enrolled in the fifth year. Individual characteristics that were found to be positively correlated with  retention included high-school grade point average, admission test scores, and being female. Prediction equations were developed with the use of multiple regression in order to allow institutional researchers and policymakers to assess an institution's ability to retain students. Results can be used by researchers to statistically control for the influence that student characteristics have on retention, and then make valid inferences about the effect that the college environment has upon retention.

A theory to explain young people's decisions is developed, proposing that young people choose to go because they find higher education to be both attractive and attainable. A model is then advanced to predict the likelihood of a young person going on to higher education. The model examines student motivation, student achievement, home location, parents' socioeconomic status, parent encouragement, teacher encouragement, friends' plans, and type of high school attended. The model was tested using data collected from 1,337 students in Victoria and 1,063 students in Queensland on direct  entry from school to higher education. Young people were more likely to go on to higher education if they were attracted to certain features of higher education, had attained better senior year academic achievements, received encouragement for higher education participation, had friends who were planning to go on to higher education, attended a non-Catholic independent rather than a government school, and had parents who were more financially secure and better educated.

The first section in the booklet discusses the nature and purposes of institutional research by describing several forms of research and comparing and contrasting institutional research with other types of research. The second section describes the various ways in which the function of institutional research is included in the organizational structures of colleges and universities. The third section discusses associated responsibilities, other than research, that are typically assigned to offices of institutional research as well as describing the characteristics of sound  institutional research and basic tools of the activity. Comments are included on communication of the findings of institutional research and descriptions of several special forms and methodologies of the activity. The final section is an outline of the potential of institutional research for contributing to planning, decision making, and policy formulation in a wide variety of areas of institutional governance. Fourteen additional resources are listed. (Author/GLR)",

Hispanic students felt that their weakest academic areas were their study habits (26%), their math skills (26%), and their writing skills (13%); however, most tended to agree that they knew how to use the library. About 26% felt that they would not drop out from UMCP for any reason and appeared to be in college for practical, career-oriented reasons; they tended to be primarily concerned with developing skills in college directly applicable to an occupation. Hispanic freshmen appeared to be interested in  intercollegiate sports and other fitness activities, and would consider seeking counseling for educational/vocational issues, but not for emotional/social issues.

        "description":"The norms of science define appropriate and inappropriate scholarly or research role performance. The four norms described in this study are (1) universalism: research is assessed on its merit, not particularistic criteria; (2) commonality: research must be made public and shared with the research community; (3) disinterestedness: research is conducted for the advancement of knowledge, not prestige or financial gain from the lay public; and (4) organized skepticism: research is subject to peer review and criticism. The Ladd and Lipset Survey measured the extent to which faculty in different disciplines reported how they act in accord with each of the four norms. Analysis of the survey's data show that, regardless of the disciplinary type, faculty generally agreed on the norm of  disinterestedness in that it stems from the fundamental principle that the search for knowledge itself should direct scholarly activities. Faculty self-reports also indicated that they believe that adhering to the norm of communality is how they should behave regardless of disciplinary type. The norms of organized skepticism, however, were seen to not work well in disciplines characterized by weak or conflicting theoretical and methodological paradigms. Contains 33 references. (GLR)",

The state of business education is reviewed noting criticism that business schools are too theoretical and out of touch with business realities. The ICL is a methodology derivative of Reiterative Problem-Based Learning and follows concepts of cognitive apprenticeship. Students are presented with an ill-structured problem situation and are assigned to set the problem and decide on appropriate action. Students formulate the problem collectively, engage in research and self-directed study individually, address the problem again collectively, and continue these iterations as appropriate. The faculty member selects appropriate  learning problem-situations and acts as learning manager, coach, and model. A sample learning problem is offered with a summary of group learning activities during ICL implementation at Ohio University. Additionally, the report shows how ICL develops desirable managerial capabilities and discusses the difficulties of incorporating ICL into business schools. Contains six references. (GLR)",

The process uses student ratings collected with an instrument which focuses on teacher behaviors and activities, overall assessments, and student and course information. Teaching improvement materials were developed as was a computer-based mechanism which provides statistical results, generates narrative reports that interpret the statistics, and matches areas of weak performance with the specific references and resources at hand. Products developed by the project included articles, books, reports, audio-visual items, and computer software (e.g., the &quot;Tencore&quot; authoring system and &quot;Ventura&quot; desktop publishing software). The system has been implemented at Northeastern  University (Massachusetts) where it has been favorably received and where it efficiently handles about 1,500 course evaluations per academic quarter using 4 full-time staff. It has also been field tested at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo.

The purpose of these provisions is to promote greater borrower responsibility and repayment of student loans. The report addresses how 38 guaranty agencies and 18 lenders implemented these provisions, and analyzes the effect on students according to whether they repay or do not repay their loans. It was found that all guaranty agencies had agreements with and/or reported to at least one of the six national credit bureaus, although only three agencies had entered into agreements with all six bureaus. All lenders reported to at least one bureau. The majority of  respondents believed that credit bureau reporting has had a positive effect on reducing the number of defaults. Nearly all guaranty agencies, as well as a majority of lenders, believed that borrowers who defaulted would be hindered by the credit bureau provisions when attempting to obtain other consumer credit. Most guaranty agencies and lenders were opposed to a change that would require deleting a bad credit rating if a delinquent account was subsequently made current or was paid in full after defaulting. The results are summarized in 11 figures. Summaries of the surveys are included in the appendixes. (JDD)",

In Part I of the study, 18 professors from 12 countries were interviewed; the 12 countries were England, Spain, Yugoslavia, Soviet Union, Turkey, India, Malaysia, Philippines, China (PRC), Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. In Part II, professors from Kuwait, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, England, Netherlands, and Saudi Arabia were interviewed. Findings are analyzed in terms of the academic structure of higher education, the purpose of systems of higher education, the role of professors in universities, the role of teaching, the concept of \"good teaching,\" incentives and rewards for good teaching, teaching styles and  interaction between professor and students, evaluation of learning, and faculty development. It is concluded that higher education has universal value, but teaching receives low priority in elite institutions around the world, where the norm suggests that students are privileged to attend.

The study examines two projects utilizing distinct collaborative approaches: \"The Academic Alliance for Improved Social Studies Teaching,\" a social studies improvement collaborative involving 27 Phoenix, Arizona, elementary classroom teachers and 12 support personnel; and \"The Middle Grades Project,\" a more formal, larger collaborative to restructure and revitalize programs at three Indiana schools. Comparative, interpretive analysis revealed that collaborators typically communicated orally, in fairly linear fashion, and through identifiable, if sometimes hazily  defined networks. Their interchange seemed episodic and was often influenced by dynamic advocates, external events, and personal politics. As they interacted, participants implemented significant programmatic change. Findings also suggested a relationship between the scope and direction of intra-partnership communication, participants' sense of ownership and empowerment, their willingness to change, and the degree to which innovations were adopted.

The project's long-term purpose was to contribute to the improvement of academic advising for students considering engineering majors and thus improve student retention. Usable data were gathered on 1,043 entering freshmen in the College of Engineering at Pennsylvania State University. Three models were developed to predict sophomore persistence and success at different points in time: pre-enrollment, freshman year, and sophomore year. For the pre-enrollment model, the variables best predicting success were high school grade point average, algebra score, gender, non-science points, chemistry score, and  reason for engineering choice. For the freshman year model, best predictors included grades in Physics I, Calculus I, and Chemistry I. In the sophomore year model, the variables of grades in Calculus II, Physics II, and Physics I were the best predictors. Thus, it was found that the variables which are predictive depend on the student's point of progress through the first 2 years of an engineering program. (JDD)",

The analysis on which these evaluations are based was carried out in four stages: (1) a search was initiated for evaluations of different approaches to CAI that could be used for cost-effectiveness purposes; (2) each of the evaluations was reviewed in order to select those that met the criteria established for the study i.e., a single focus on CAI, common objectives, acceptability of evaluation methods,  and availability of information for assessing costs; (3) effect sizes for the criterion of concern were estimated; and (4) the costs of each intervention were estimated. Analysis of eight K-12 CAI programs, in which the common educational outcome was that of reading and/or mathematics achievement, indicated great variation in effect size from study to study, and led to the conclusion that specific approaches to CAI and the realities of implementation account for differences in effectiveness. Data on the costs and effect sizes of each of the CAI programs selected for the study are provided in tables throughout the text and in the appendix of the report. (24 references) (GL)",

        "description":"Satellite telecommunications are part of an integrated grid of technologies that make possible what many call the Information Age. The English language is the dominant language of this age and of global telecommunications, based in part on its already clear role as the major &quot;universal&quot; language, especially in science and technology. English currently has widespread acceptance as the primary &quot;link language&quot; in the world, being no longer tied predominantly to native speakers of the language. The impact of its spread into the Third World and developing countries via global satellite technology is discussed, especially as the spread has been accelerated by these countries' desire for development and modernization. The emphasis on national sovereignty in many countries (with an  attendant emphasis on indigenous languages) is also discussed as running counter to the spread of English. Three images are presented for the spread of English: (1) the kaleidoscope image, in which message transmission is viewed as the transmission of poorly articulated values of dominant cultures; (2) the window image, in which the language itself is seen to be a transparent, neutral vehicle for communication; and (3) the mirror image, in which the language reflects the values of British and American cultures. It is concluded that English serves as a mirror and kaleidoscope in some contexts, but that most frequently it serves as a window. (46 references) (Author/GL)",

        "description":"An analysis of computer literacy curricula around the middle of the 1980s shows a remarkable overall shift away from teaching computing to teaching applications, information handling, and problem-solving. Computer use is no longer viewed as a goal in itself, but is introduced as a powerful means of fulfilling information needs and of facilitating learning and other instructional tasks. Some recent developments raise the question as to whether separate courses in computer literacy are still needed, or whether computer literacy goals could be better attained in other ways. Two interesting new lines of thinking can be observed. The first implies the integration of computer literacy goals with traditional educational goals by promoting the abandonment of separate computer literacy  courses for the instrumental use of computers in existing courses. The second development, now being discussed in the Netherlands, can be characterized as a mixed approach, in which the more general computer literacy goals are realized via traditional subject matter courses, while more specific information handling goals are addressed in short separate courses. Both approaches are discussed, and links are established to The Computer in Education study of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) in order to provide a context for interpreting some of the study's results.

A research team interviewed people at all levels of the school system--district administrators, school administrators, computer resource personnel, media specialists, teachers, students, and community persons. Students were observed using computers in a variety of contexts. Six trends emerged which raise important questions for future research: (1) differential access to  microcomputers; (2) the emergence of new roles in response to microcomputers; (3) the lack of integration of microcomputers into elementary classrooms and curriculum; (4) the inadequate quality and quantity of software; (5) the inadequate preparation of teachers for using microcomputers; and (6) the lack of knowledge of effects and outcomes.

Findings of three studies on children learning to program and the cognitive outcomes of such programming are reported: the first was a study of the level of programming expertise children had developed by the year's end; the second consisted of systematic probes of the depth of understanding of programming concepts in studies with individual children; and the last asked whether children doing programming developed planning skills that they spontaneously transferred beyond programming.

These bugs are not specific to a given programming language but appear to be language-independent. The three different classes of bugs are: (1) parallelism, the assumption that different lines in a program can be active at the same time or in parallel; (2) intentionality, the attribution of goal directedness or foresightedness to the program; and (3) egocentrism, the assumption that there is more of the programmer's meaning for what he or she wants to accomplish in the program than is actually present in the code he or she has written. All of these bugs appear to derive from the idea that there is a hidden mind in the programming language that has intelligent,  interpretive powers. Each of the three types of bugs is described and exemplified using student errors, and the implications for programming instruction are addressed. (23 references) (Author/MES)",

The field test used a case-study approach to examine the comprehensibility, appeal, and usability of the programs. The most striking finding was the range of use of the software in different classrooms, including differences in the proportion of students having access to the computer, the amount of time each student used the  software, the degree and type of teacher involvement, and classroom organization. It was also found that the use of software was influenced by computer and teacher resources, as well as by prior teacher training in and perceptions of science, math, or computers. Software design implications point to the need for creating software that allows students to work in a collaborative fashion independent of the teacher and for addressing comprehensibility at all levels. It is recommended that teachers be provided with a conceptual framework for software. (MES)",

Nine 9- and 10-year-old students in a progressive private school in New York City participated in the study. None had prior experience with videodisc technology. The two videodiscs which served as test materials--\"The First National Kidisc\" and \"Fun and Games\"--were selected because they encourage use of the special video and audio features of videodiscs. Subjects worked in pairs for two 45-minute sessions. Sessions were observed by a researcher who took notes on the children's behavior and comments. Results are reported in three sections: (1) initial learning of the disc options, the role of disc-based instructions and prompts in learning, and technical aspects of the hardware that were  impediments to learning; (2) use of audio options and use of visual options in relation to several general goals, such as navigating around the disc and playing with the speed and direction of images; and (3) use of disc options to manipulate the presentation in accordance with children's interests and playing styles. It is concluded that children are able to handle videodisc programming that leaves open the opportunity for exploration and self-motivated learning. (7 references) (MES)",

        "description":"This report describes Palenque, an interactive, multimedia, optical disc research prototype developed for home use by 8- to 14-year-old children and their families. The report begins by providing an overview of the project, which is followed by a discussion of the target audience and context for use of the videodisc. A discussion of learning philosophy covers the roots of traditional instructional design, the substitution of less traditional roots for the design of elements of the Palenque discovery learning model how the design fosters incidental learning, and the creation of a flexible environment that allows for extended sessions and repeatability. The nature of the medium is then addressed--the unique features of the optical disc medium, inspiration from other projects, and  features of the DVI (Digital Video Interactive) Development System. Design elements of materials that are incorporated in Palenque are described, including linear television narratives, interactive narratives, simulations, interactive games, multimedia databases, and interactive books. The report concludes with discussions of the concurrent process of design and development as research and the implications of future design efforts. (19 references) (MES)",

Two task dimensions were studied: (1) the form in which the information was presented (iconic or symbolic); and (2) the interactional setting in which children worked with the conceptual material (alone or in small groups). Subjects were 30 students from a mixed fifth-sixth grade class in a New York City public school; they were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Baseline information about the children's attitudes and knowledge was collected. Following a 6-week experimental phase, children's applications of concepts from the microworld game  were examined during individual paper-and-pencil tests involving two-dimensional images, small group discussions using real objects, and individual paper-and-pencil worksheets in an out-of-school setting. Results showed transfer of certain microworld concepts in some settings and application of some teacher-taught material. These conceptual gains were most clearly seen when children worked in small group settings. (16 references) (MES)",

        "description":"It is argued that the three basic issues that have typically been the concern of formative evaluation (comprehensibility, appeal, and usefulness) tell us very little about the role that an instructional product can play in the ongoing environment of the classroom. The focus in this paper is on the field test, i.e., on research situated within the framework of existing classroom activity. Four issues considered central to situated research are discussed: (1) How is the instructional prototype interpreted by teachers? (2) How does the prototype function as part of the ongoing content curriculum that is both the backbone and blueprint for classroom goals and activities? (3) How does the prototype function within the organizational context of the classroom? and (4) Within the social  context of the classroom, how is the prototype interpreted by students? Each of these questions is addressed using examples from formative research with two different prototype products: a computer-based set of interactive cognitive tools to support inquiry practices in science (\"Inquire\"), and a television series that uses a narrative format to introduce students to different arenas of scientific and mathematical inquiry (\"The Second Voyage of the Mimi\").

It is noted that the project was intended to create a rich, multimedia database environment for children and their families that would pique their curiosity and foster self-guided exploration, information seeking, and decision making as they explore a Mayan ruin in the Yucatan called Palenque. Following an overview of the project and a description of the design and development team, the report provides descriptions of: (1) the components of the prototype design; (2) the target audience and context for use; and (3) the two  phases of design, development, and research which produced the preliminary and final prototypes. It is noted that the research and development project involved concurrent and iterative processes of design, research, production, and programming over the course of a 2-year time frame. It is further noted that since the final goal was to produce research prototypes rather than products, collective research efforts in the development of design conventions that reflected chosen pedagogical biases in content and theme development, interface design, production techniques, and technical implementation, were the essence of the project rather than by-products or activities conducted after product completion.

Included in the report are descriptions of the central metaphor guiding the design process; the software's basic structure; navigation and housekeeping tools; and procedures for  researching students' own questions, writing text, drawing, recording numerical information, noting the sources of information, linking INQUIRE to a videodisk, analyzing information, and tracking student progress through the software.

The second section contains discussions of seven facts about and seven findings of research on educational technology and Hispanic Americans, including the role of technology in the schools; teacher preparedness for technology use and multicultural education; the need for equitable funding of educational technology programs for all groups; the danger of focusing on remediation rather than on high achievement; and the importance to Hispanic Americans of bilingual education,  school-community linkages, and increased functional and physical access to computers. These discussions lay the groundwork for the third section, which contains suggested policy statements for use in establishing school or organizational policy as well as for use in publications and in meetings. These statements correspond to the following areas: (1) language and culture; (2) the community-classroom connection; (3) training of educators; (4) fiscal responsibility; (5) attitudes toward technology; and (6) access to computing.

A review of the history of coordination and collaboration of research, development, and dissemination activities as a public policy concern is followed by a discussion of the rationale for institutional collaboration. General issues surrounding the concept of collaboration (including goals, organizational issues, procedures, and resources) are outlined, and policy questions associated with  these issues are posed. An examination follows of how and under what circumstances OERI units and OERI-funded institutional projects might collaborate.

Background on the Lekotek organization, whose goal is to integrate children with disabilities into the mainstream of society, is followed by a description of its audience and the need for its services, i.e., providing a toy, game, and book-lending library for children up to five years old. Activities funded through the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) and Title II of the Higher Education Act (finding an adaptive toy maker, training staff in the Lekotek method, and conducting public awareness activities) are  described, and a summary of the project's budget for fiscal year 1987 is provided. The results of a first-year survey of families participating in the program are reported. Finally, instructions are provided for obtaining further information about Lekotek and the Galesburg Public Library Lekotek project. (GL)",

        "description":"In 1985, the Chancellor of West Valley College met with California Attorney General John Van De Kamp to explore methods by which the community college district could respond to the growing problem of drug abuse. The first step was the establishment of a 15-hour, fee-supported class on drug and alcohol abuse education for adult offenders at the local county probation department. This was followed by the development of a drug diversion/education program for youths and their families. The goal of the youth program was to create a cost-effective intervention model appropriate for all socioeconomic levels of Santa Clara County, employing staff qualified to provide legal, drug-related, and psychosocial knowledge, and able to deal with the greater problem of family dysfunction. A survey  of the most visible and respected county agencies serving youth involved in alcohol and drug abuse was conducted to determine necessary components of the program. The college ultimately implemented a 12-hour program focusing on drug pharmacology, group counseling, the criminal justice system, family communication, refusal skills, values clarification, and self-esteem. It also includes one unit of instruction for parents. Adolescents were directly referred from the Santa Clara County Probation Department, junior and senior high schools, churches, and police departments, and no adolescent could attend the program without at least one parent. Instruction emphasized class participation in an informal, non-threatening way to maximize involvement, and several films were used. Though no  statistical data were available to indicate the success of the program, both parents and adolescents expressed gratitude and hope for the future after completing the program. Appendixes include a list of suggested steps for the development of similar programs and an administrative summary of the program. (JMC)",

The data provided, however, were inconsistent, with only five of the colleges supplying student-identifiable data and no agreement existing among the colleges as to what exactly constituted a transfer student. According to the submitted data, 131 PVCC students transferred to one of the following senior institutions: James Madison University (JMU); Longwood College (LC); Radford University (RU); Old Dominion University (ODU); the University of Virginia (UV); Virginia  Commonwealth University (VCU); and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPISU). Information provided by the colleges revealed the following: (1) PVCC transfer students performed as well as all students at public senior institutions in Virginia; (2) 85% of all transfers enrolled at UV or JMU; (3) the average grade point average (GPA) of PVCC transfers to UV (3.003) was slightly higher than the average GPA of all UV students (2.953); (4) PVCC transfers performed as well as all students at LC, ODU, and RU, but not as well as all students at VCU or VPISU; (5) for all PVCC transfers, the average GPA was 2.745, and over one-third had GPA's between 3.0 and 4.0; and (6) PVCC students transferring 50 or more credits performed slightly better at senior institutions than those  transferrring less than 50 credits.

Developed to project a more stable and comprehensive program for the residents of Molokai, this academic development plan outlines the priorities of MCC on the island for 1990-96. After providing an overview and history of MCC's service to the Molokai community, the report outlines the mission, philosophy, and planning strategies of MCC. The plan then presents nine long-range goals, including maximizing access to all MCC programs and services; promoting and implementing curricular comprehensiveness; establishing partnerships with business, government, and other schools on the island to identify  and address common goals; and supporting faculty and staff development activities. Next, external planning factors specific to the island of Molokai are examined, including conditions related to: economics; demographics and geography; and science and technology. In addition, community expectations and internal planning factors, including staffing and staff resources, curriculum, resource allocation, and physical facilities, are reviewed. The next section highlights recent assessment activities and the college's progress toward expanding the MCC-Molokai Farm, offering more occupational programs in response to community needs, and expanding developmental skills course offerings and student services. Next, 13 new priorities are described, including the improvement of instructional programs,  the use of new technologies, and the establishment of economic development partnerships with business and government. Finally, additional staff positions requested for the Molokai program, projected activity levels and resource requirements, and a systematic evaluation process utilized by the college are provided. An attachment lists certificates and degrees offered on Molokai and MCC-Molokai enrollment figures. (JMC)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether the two-year college facilities and programs available to residents of Fauquier County in Virginia were adequate to meet their current and future needs. Lord Fairfax Community College and Germanna Community College, which share responsibility for serving this rural county, recently combined their resources to improve their service levels. A renovated barn was donated to the schools, providing classroom and office space. This made it possible for the colleges to offer day classes, as well as the night courses offered at the local high school. Public interest in expanding the number of programs and the physical plant were instrumental in initiating a study of the future space potential of \"The Barn\" and the need for additional facilities.  In addition to projecting enrollment potential, the study investigated issues such as operating funds, faculty recruitment, student services, and administrative support. Findings from the study indicated that the main factors influencing enrollments were population, industry composition, public school enrollments, other higher education institutions, and curricula. Combining experience, intuition, and subjective assumptions with available data led to the following predictions: (1) enrollment in the program should continue to increase; (2) fall 1989 enrollment could approximate 140 full-time students and nearly 500 part-time students, but the newness of the program may reduce these numbers by about 50%; (3) facilities at The Barn will be fully utilized in 1 to 2 years; and (4) enrollments  will be contingent upon public awareness and available programs. Tables and graphs are attached, detailing population, employment, high school graduation projections, K-12 enrollments, approximate distances from colleges and universities and from The Barn, Fauquier program enrollments, and continuing education ratios.

Questions focused on respondents' opinions of the need for volunteers, type of assistance which volunteers could provide, volunteer recruitment, supervision of volunteers, and the advantages and disadvantages of volunteer use. Questionnaire findings included the following: (1) two-thirds of the respondents opposed the use of volunteers; (2) major reasons for not wanting to use volunteers were concern over confidentiality, lack of dependability, less commitment, complex scheduling, amount of training time, and quality control; (3)  the most frequently cited advantages of using volunteers were budget savings, higher motivation, student involvement, and extra help at peak times; (4) routine clerical tasks, such as answering the telephone, typing, and filing, were the most frequently mentioned assignments for volunteers; (5) the personnel office and department heads were identified as the recommended contact point for recruitment; and (6) support staff workers were generally considered most likely to train volunteers, and department heads were most often suggested for monitoring activities and terminating volunteers if necessary. Study findings suggested that there was no justification for a coordinated college-wide approach to volunteer recruitment and use. The questionnaire and a cover letter are appended.  (WJT)",

Major findings were as follows: (1) statewide transfers to UC in the 1988-89 academic year showed a 20.6% increase over the 1986-87 academic year; (2) Los Rios ranked fourth among districts in the state in numbers of UC transfers (N=476) and first in the state if considering only fall data; (3) Los Rios ranked second among districts in the state in numbers of CSU transfers (N=2,229); (4) Los Rios transfers to UC increased 26.3% between 1987-88 and 1988-89; (5) full-year figures indicate  that 2,229 students transferred to CSU in 1988-89, up 4.5% from 1987-88; (6) comparing fall-only data, the numbers of Los Rios Black and Hispanic transfers to the UC were up in fall 1988 compared to fall 1987, while Asian transfers were down; and (7) comparing fall-only data, the percentage of Los Rios Asian, Black, Hispanic, Filipino, and American Indian transfers to CSU were down. Findings indicate that transfer programs and intersegmental cooperation are necessary to increase transfer rates. An appendix provides transfer statistics of the Los Rios District by ethnicity, by full-year transfers to UC or CSU, and by individual college and ethnicity within the Los Rios district. (JMC)",

        "description":"The educational literature provides evidence of the increasing role of community colleges in serving business and industry. By providing pre-service education for persons entering the labor market or continuing education for employed individuals who seek skills upgrading, community colleges have made businesses a major consumer of college services. This literature review begins with an overview of community college services to business clients, which include instructional services such as customization and non-vocational courses, and non-instructional services such as assessment, grantsmanship, technology transfer, and consulting services to small and new businesses. The role of the community college in economic development is also examined. Next, research on administrative  factors is summarized, showing a great deal of variance between institutions in the number and types of services provided by community colleges to business and industry. State surveys are cited which provide further evidence of this uneven service pattern, indicating that while all community colleges provide at least some assistance to business, most of these services are accounted for by a relatively small number of colleges. Factors which influence community college involvement with business and industry are identified, including program management, state support, the health of the local economy, and staffing. The next section reviews papers and reports considering the effectiveness and benefits of business/industry partnerships. The final section provides a summary of the issues. A  36-source annotated bibliography and a list of 25 selected dissertations are included. (JMC)",

The first section examines the number of transfers from PGCC, providing a breakdown according to which schools students transferred to; full-/part-time status; ethnicity; and field of study. In addition, transfer rates from PGCC to Maryland four-year colleges and universities are examined from fall-to-fall for the years 1980 through 1989. The next section looks at the percentage of students who transferred, indicating that, according to the MHEC database, 25% of the students who entered PGCC in 1982 as full-time  students had transferred within four years, compared to 24% of the 1983 entrants and 21% of the 1984 entrants. Findings from a 1984 study conducted by the Maryland Community College Research Group and the State Board for Community Colleges are also analyzed, suggesting that 33% of the PGCC respondents reported having transferred. The next four sections looks at PGCC student performance at Maryland senior institutions in general and at the University of Maryland (UM) at College Park, UM Baltimore County, and Bowie State University. Comparative data on transfers from other community colleges are included. Findings from a 1988 graduate follow-up survey are presented next, including information on graduates' ratings of their preparation for transfer and goal achievement. After a section on  reverse transfers from Maryland four-year colleges to PGCC, concluding observations raise questions about the calculation of transfer rates and other research needs. (VVC)",

It presents statewide demographic data on California's limited English language speaking students and recommendations for future curriculum planning. The first sections present background on California's non-native English population, including statewide demographics, school data, and economic and workplace data. These sections indicate that an estimated 5% of California's population is limited in their English proficiency and a projected 250,000 foreign immigrants are expected to enter California annually through the year 2000. The number of K-12 students classified  as Limited English Proficiency (LEP) was 652,439 in 1988, approximately double the 1980 number. Between 1977 and 1987, Hispanic student enrollment in the state's community colleges increased from 8.8% to 15%, and Asian student enrollment increased from 4.7% to 9.7%. In fall 1987, the overall freshmen pass-rate on the California State University's English Placement Test was 43.5%, but only 28.6% for Hispanic freshmen and 19.6% for Asian freshmen. The bulk of the report consists of recommendations for an intersegmental English as a Second Language (ESL) Agenda. These recommendations focus on: (1) expectations of freshman language competencies; (2) standards for student language performance levels; (3) coordinated and articulated assessment policies; (4) issues in the assignment of  baccalaureate credit and intersegmental transfer; (5) visibility and status of programs for LEP students; (6) in-service and pre-service preparation of all California to teach LEP students; and (7) statewide priorities and planning.

        "description":"Many community college student activities and programs focus on programming for the traditional college-aged student. However, appropriate support and meaningful extra-curricular activities are also needed for the ever-increasing number of adult students. Specially designed activities for adult students can be very helpful in: (1) integrating the adult into the campus environment; (2) building self-esteem; (3) fostering camaraderie among adults; and (4) assisting adults to deal with the unique demands and constraints they face when attending college. Targeted for older students, Nontraditional Students Organizations (NTSO's) will serve a large segment of the student body, aid in retention, serve as an advocacy group, and augment the existing student activities program. When  forming an NTSO, care should be taken to recognize adults' time constraints and plan convenient meeting times; include significant others in organizational activities; develop a calendar of events for the full semester; communicate via direct correspondence rather than bulletin boards; and plan appropriate events. The NTSO should develop a constitution, organize meetings to maximize attendance, elect officers, and build in some form of recognition for members. The NTSO at Patrick Henry Community College is involved in fund-raising efforts, social functions, community services, and special projects, such as the development of a used book network, a child care needs assessment survey, and a scholarship program.

Such a model may be derived from the requirements for the survival of the human species. The content of the resulting curriculum would be: (1) socially cohesive, providing common reference points to all members of society; (2) culturally inclusive, drawing upon diverse human cultures and recognizing the contributions of all social classes; (3) ethically selective, supporting values necessary to environmental and species survival and human fulfillment; (4) conceptually generative, providing skills and general principles which allow for the synthesis and critical assessment of information; and (5) personally  significant, creating options for in-depth study of particular cultures, classes, and conditions. This curriculum would recognize a shared humanity, but also the human tendency toward xenophobia which must yield under modern conditions. Old myths of Western Civilization would be replaced with new \"one world\" myths, that perpetuate certain values (e.g., civil liberty, pluralism, religious tolerance); promote new values (e.g., nonmilitarism, globalism, and mixed economy); re-introduce others (e.g., cooperation, communalism, and respect for all ages and all labor); call some values into question (e.g., environmental exploitation, materialism, competition, and hierarchical management); and fully reject others (e.g., imposed ignorance, religious intolerance, and racism). Sources for this  paradigm include the urgent need for worldwide solutions to common problems; new knowledge in human neurology, biology, and anthropology; and the dissolution of rigid ideologies that constrained social analysis and economic and political discourse.

        "description":"An overview is provided of the marketing and recruitment efforts designed to make Capilano College (CC) an \"institution of first choice\" in the minds of its community and prospective students. The presentation by Doug Jardine defines what CC means by and hopes to accomplish by becoming a \"first choice\" institution, indicating that a \"first choice\" institution is one that strives for excellence, strives to be the first choice college in student's minds, and sets standards to find the best students. He provides several examples of institutional efforts to improve community relations, including: (1) an entrance scholarship for each public and private high school in the college region; (2) meetings with all local high school principals to give feedback on that school's students'  performance at CC, and receive feedback on the school's perception of its relationship with CC; (3) a project bringing together three municipalities to draft an economic development plan; and (4) the development of a regional arts policy. Next, Frank Gelin describes specific institutional policies and practices designed to make CC a \"first choice\" college. After describing the college's new selective admissions policies and registration procedures, Gelin explains the student recruitment functions of the student advising department, the college's information hotline, an annual science enrichment workshop for 11th grade students, Club Optima (an academic competition for academically gifted 12th graders from the college region), Natural Sciences Alumni Night, and \"The Captivator\" newsletter  for parents and students. He then explains ways in which student achievement is recognized, including board, science tuition, departmental, and English essay scholarships; outstanding student certificates; and support for student participation in athletic, arts, and academic competitions. After describing some of the high-profile activities of CC's faculty members, Gelin offers evidence of the success of the \"first choice\" efforts. (WJT)",

        "description":"Impromptu writing on tests is a useful way to evaluate student comprehension and encourage students to use critical thinking skills. Students' performance on essay tests can improve, and teachers' time required for grading can decrease through the use of an adapted holistic grading scale that clearly states expectations. First, a carefully written essay question clearly enumerates a number of sub-topics and provides cues for specific supporting information. The question suggests an organizational structure and recommends a selection of examples and details, making the essay questions easier for students to respond to completely and in an organized manner. Second, a grading scale keyed to the question permits grading to be completed quickly and consistently. The scale identifies  the characteristics of student essays that should be assigned a range of scores. For example, a student will earn top points on an essay that clearly states a position, is generally well-organized, is generally free of factual and writing errors, and completes the specific tasks assigned in the essay (e.g., identifies three aspects of the Renaissance and causally relates them to a reaction or result in the Reformation). Sample test questions, grading scales, and student essays are provided. (WJT)",

        "author":["Glock, Nancy Clover"],
        "description":"Attracting and assuring the success of students of color requires the rethinking of curricula to meet the needs of underrepresented, underprepared, and economically disadvantaged students. General education offerings should be restructured to give students the skills and resources needed to make sense out of their particular gender and ethnicity, while emphasizing not the old world or new world, but the one world shared by students and teachers. The resulting core curriculum would be: (1) socially cohesive, providing common reference points to all members of society; (2) culturally inclusive, drawing upon diverse human cultures and affirming the contributions of all social classes; (3) ethically selective, supporting values necessary to environmental and species survival and  human fulfillment; (4) conceptually generative, providing skills and general principles which allow for the synthesis and critical assessment of information; and (5) personally significant, creating options for in-depth study of particular cultures, classes, and conditions. Skills would be developed across the curriculum by making improvement in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and thinking the responsibility of faculty in every discipline. Another way of reforming college curricula to better serve disadvantaged students would be to focus on applied skills courses during the first 2 years of college and the theories supporting those applications in upper-division courses. This model would serve students who want strong occupational preparation, but also aspire to a bachelor's  degree. In revising curricula, colleges must be prepared to meet the challenges of new technology, the need for qualified faculty, and the need for resources to develop new texts, courses, and skills necessary to teach the new curriculum.

        "description":"Drawing from experiences at Cuyahoga Community College, this paper offer guidance on the use of storyboard packages and authoring languages to develop interactive instructional materials. Introductory comments reveal that the greatest use of computers in courses other than computer and information sciences is still in drills, tutorials, writing composition, and simulations; and that there is little research-based data on the effectiveness of computers as a method of instruction or on the time, energy, and resources required to prepare to use computers in instruction. Next, the paper lists several requirements for interactive instructional materials, e.g., the lesson must extend from or reinforce classroom activities; a three-way, ongoing, systematized interaction must take place  among the student, instructor, and material in the computer; the material available to the student must give clear fail-safe instructions, use a developmental/incremental process toward mastery of concepts, and draw forth questions that the student will bring to the instructor. Tips about storyboard lesson planning are presented next, suggesting that the approach is best suited to the visually oriented, that it often requires considerable tinkering and time, and that it tempts the instructor to include too many sub-menus. Next, authoring systems, which are designed for instruction based on lecturing-demonstrating-exampling, are discussed and five drawbacks are identified. Attachments include outlines of the curriculum and lesson development processes, and a basic language program for an  employment theory lesson. (WJT)",

The section on socioemotional development addresses Erikson's eight ages of man, Kohlberg's stages of moral development, motivation and Maslow's hierarchy of needs, Taylor's stage model of creative development, and Loevinger's stages of ego development. Cognitive development is approached through overviews of Skinner's operant conditioning, Gagne's behavioristic-eclectic theory, Bandura's social learning theory, cognitive gestalt-field theories, Lewin's cognitive field theory, Bruner's learning as categorizing theory, Piaget's cognitive-descriptive theory of intellectual development, the information-processing approach, and Case's comprehensive  framework of intellectual growth. Personal- and social-oriented instructional strategies discussed include Gordon's synectics, Schutz's awareness training model, the classroom meeting and laboratory training (T-Group) models, the Shaftels' role-playing model, and cooperative models of instruction. Behavioral strategies include mastery learning, individually prescribed and direct instruction, and contingency management. Information-processing strategies include concept attainment, inductive thinking, inquiry techniques, the advance organizer and memory models, and the process of Piagetian clinical interviewing.

A brief historical overview is followed by discussion of such aspects of the Reggio Emilia project as the high level of exchange between families and schools, the predominance of aesthetic considerations throughout the schools, and the importance of the physical environment and use of classroom space in meeting curriculum goals. It is concluded that even though many features of the Reggio Emilia program reflect Italian cultural values and may be inappropriate for child care settings outside Italy, some aspects of the program are worth emulating. These include: (1) the emphasis on the positive value of  multiple points of view and reciprocal participation in the family-school relationship; (2) the view that the dialogue between parents and teachers is and should be a complicated matter; (3) the emphases on the arts and aesthetic sensibilities; and (4) the significance of the environment as a provider of opportunities for social exchanges.

A study of these differential social networks used data collected in 1983 on the personal relationships of 3,089 only-child Chinese born before the one child policy was enforced in China. The study tested the hypothesis that only children have more extensive friendships than children with siblings. Findings revealed that a large portion of only children had single-parent family backgrounds prior to adulthood. Their opportunities for development of social relationships and educational attainment  were attenuated by this single-parent background, and particularly by their mothers' early deaths. These findings may explain the study's failure to find differences between groups of only children and children with siblings. Further analyses revealed effects of educational attainment, age, and gender on only children's probability of having friends. Theoretical interpretations of the findings are proposed.

Research into the effectiveness of homework is inconclusive. Nevertheless, homework serves as a vital link between home and school. It is essential that classroom teachers make every effort to ensure that assignments are necessary and useful, appropriate to the ability and maturity of  students, well explained, and clearly understood by both student and parent. It appears that home study will play an increasingly important role in learning in the next few decades.

The resulting project, the Community Childcare Center (CCC), differs from regular child care centers in that it: (1) is cheaper; (2) involves considerable community participation; and (3) serves both children in the child care center and other children in the community. The CCC is based on a tripartite model that involves the government, the NTUC, and the community. The government provides the capital needed to set up child care centers and subsidies. The NTUC provides the framework, structure, and professional expertise for operating the centers and coordinating the program. The community provides feedback,  volunteers, and a network of support and resources. This paper discusses the history of institutionalized child care in Singapore, current child care services, challenges facing child care centers, responsibilities for child care, the alternative Community Childcare Model and the roles of its participants, and strategies for community involvement.

        "description":"A sample of 212 urban, black mothers and their 8- through 12-year-old children responded to questionnaires about the frequency of potentially stressful life events experienced by the children and the feelings the children had when the events took place. A 49-item questionnaire addressed childen's concerns regarding the stress categories of home environment, family, school, drugs and alcohol, money, peers, interpersonal conflict, fear of physical harm, continuity and discontinuity, health, and lifestyle. There were significant differences between mothers' and children's reports on total life stress events and eight of the stress categories. Correlations indicated that mothers may have been valid judges of the relative stress of their children in many categories. However, results  of direct comparisons suggested either that mothers were underreporting the frequency and salience of life stress events in their children's lives, or that children, particularly girls, overreported the frequency and magnitude of life stress events in their lives. Surprisingly, discrepancies between mothers and daughters were much more apparent than those between mothers and sons. (RH)",

        "description":"Findings of a study on the relation between 6-year-olds' attachment security and their mental representations of attachment relationships are reported. It was expected that infants whose attachment behavior seemed disorganized would be fearful of their attachment figures and experience themselves as helpless, and that these conditions would be clearly reflected in children's symbolic representation of themselves and their relationships at a later age. To test the hypothesis, children's representations of their relationship to their mothers were assessed by means of a semistructured doll play situation in which an adult companion introduced a neutral story and then moved the child through a series of four stories related to attachment. Children's relationships were classified as  secure, avoidant, ambivalent, or controlling. Differences between attachment groups' responses to the story themes of separation and reunion are discussed. The doll play of controlling children confirmed predictions based on the conflict behavior of disorganized infants. Secure children expressed separation fears that originated outside the family. These children appeared to have fairly sophisticated cognitive strategies for integrating fears of separation with a successful resolution. Avoidant and ambivalent children seemed to exclude separation fears from their play and consciousness. Fears of controlling children were expressed in a primitive and chaotic way. (RH)",

Students in the fourth and fifth grades of a public school in East Brunswick, New Jersey and in a Jewish parochial school in the same community comprised the American sample of 100 boys and 115 girls. A West African sample consisted of 74 girls and 77 boys enrolled in grades 5-11 in the Carver Mission School in Monrovia, Liberia. Boys ranged in age from 10-24 years; girls from 10-21. Each student in both samples wrote a brief essay describing the person whom the student most admired and the reasons for that admiration. Some East Brunswick students also completed a rating scale. Liberians admired parents, relatives, and teachers because  of what they do for the child and because of their personal qualities. While American children admired parents, boys also admired sports figures and girls admired peers. Sex differences were reflected in the criteria for admiration. Boys were more likely than girls to cite achievement. The role of nationality and gender as determinants of admiration is discussed in relation to Bakan's (1966) concept of agency and communion. Parallels to findings of sex differences in moral judgment were noted. (RH)",

(2) How do the stages evident in children's computer-generated drawings compare with those in drawings produced with traditional art materials? (3) What evidence is there to indicate that children use the computer as a means of symbolic representation? The primary sources of data were computer-generated graphics produced by four middle-class children with no prior exposure to Apple computers or the mouse attachment. Equipment used to produce the computer graphics included an Apple IIGS computer with color monitor using a PaintWorks Plus software program and a black  and white Macintosh SE with MacPaint. Video and audio data were collected in eight 1.5 hour sessions. Findings revealed that computer-generated graphics exhibited the traditional three broad developmental stages of art. Stages evident in computer art were consistent with stages in works produced with traditional art materials. Children used the computer as a medium for creating expressive and symbolic representations that reflected stages of representational development. A bibliography provides 21 citations. (RH)",

        "description":"In this paper, discussion covers three approaches to the fostering of higher level thinking in students: (1) the stand-alone approach, in which thinking skills are taught separately from subject matter content; (2) the embedding approach, in which thinking skills are explicitly taught in the context of subject matter content; and (3) the immersion approach, in which thinking skills remain implicit and in-depth understanding of content constitutes a necessary and sufficient condition for development of higher order thinking. Advocates of the third approach argue that it is counterproductive to devote much attention to the explicit teaching of thinking, believing that thinking develops naturally in classrooms where students are engaged in the pursuit of common understanding. The  stand-alone approach is briefly discussed. The embedding approach is more extensively discussed, in terms of executive control and critical thinking skills. The immersion approach is extensively discussed in sections focusing on ideas as the central factor in the promoting of thought, examples of the approach, and the role of discourse in the approach. The concluding section of the report indicates a need for further research comparing the immersion and embedding approaches. Cited are 49 references. (RH)",

Estimates suggest that 5,000 people live in motels throughout the county. The largest segment of this population consists of families--women with young children. Mothers are often unable to participate in training programs due to a lack of child care. In an effort to address this problem, a model program called the Educational Advantage Program was developed by Westchester County in the summer of 1989. The program provided comprehensive opportunities for motel residents to obtain educational or job skill training. Based at the Elmsford Motor Lodge, the program gave residents access to drug education programs, self-sufficiency classes, health services, and participation in the  local Head Start program for children over the age of 2.6 years. Children under this age were cared for in an on-site child care program designed and implemented by the Child Care Council of Westchester. The Council also offered family day care provider training as part of its &quot;Hope for the Homeless&quot; project. (Author/RH)",

Subjects were 39 Caucasian infants and their mothers and caregivers. Mothers and caregivers were asked to rate children's behavior on a series of items related to four composites of children's social behavior: sociability, distractibility, difficulty, and aggression/disobedience. All families were interviewed about the family's background and the child's day care experience. Mothers completed the Family Environment Scale's subscales on expressiveness, conflict, independence, and control. The fit between children's characteristics and their caregiving environments was  assessed by means of a list of 20 desirable and 20 undesirable child behaviors which was given to mothers and caregivers. Findings revealed that individual differences in children's social behavior were influenced by the family environment and the relationships the children established with their parents and caregivers. Results suggested that the fit between children and the significant adults in their lives was much more promising for explaining variance in children's behavior than explaining the day care experience.

Naturalistic observation of 51 dyads consisting of depressed and nondepressed mothers and their children who were 1.5 to 3.5 years old at the time of first observation and 5 years old during the second observation revealed that &quot;do commands,&quot; interventions regarding chores, and interpersonal behaviors increased with age during the toddler period, while interventions concerning protection of objects decreased. Interventions concerning prosocial behaviors and chores tended to be positively related with &quot;do commands.&quot; Interventions concerning self-control, protection of objects, and location were  positively associated with &quot;don't commands.&quot; There were several correlations between the content and function of maternal controls and socioeconomic status and contemporaneous measures of children's compliance. Maternal use of &quot;do commands&quot; and commands regarding prosocial issues, chores, and location of child at the time of the first obervation were associated with fewer behavior problems in the child's fifth year. Maternal commands focusing on regulation of interpersonal and self-control issues were associated with more behavior problems among 5-year-olds. The frequency of &quot;do commands&quot; and control issues concerning chores, interpersonal behaviors, and cognitive and play activities at the first observation were also predictive of children's compliance at the second observation.

        "description":"Conceptual encounter methodology has been used to investigate the experience of anger. With this method, investigators have attempted to construct an abstract structure that describes essential features of the experience being investigated. People are interviewed about concrete examples of the experience, given the abstract conceptualization, and asked to indicate in which cases the description fits and in which it does not. When the method was used in this study of the experience of anger, findings revealed that persons never reported simple frustration over not getting something they wanted. Rather, their experience was that something different should happen. People described what should be rather than just what they wanted. The \"I want\" of anger implies, \"I should have it--and  I am entitled to it.\" When adults talk about their experiences of anger, they frequently seek something for which to blame another, so that anger can occur. Children also use these constructions. (RH)",

It is argued that science has three interrelated aspects: content, process, and attitude. Science education should integrate all three aspects. Content can be separated into the areas of physical, life, and earth science. Process concerns the inquiry skills that children must develop to be directly involved in gathering, organizing, analyzing, and evaluating content. Attitude involves the development of a scientific attitude that includes openness and objectivity. It is argued that children learn best through active hands-on activities and that they should be encouraged to actively explore and construct their own knowledge. Teachers  should be aware of daily experiences that might involve science; make available a variety of equipment and materials; and remember that meaningful learning is an active, self-regulated process.

Children's cardiovascular, electrodermal, and self-reported emotional responses to the angry interaction of adults were measured. Perceptions of control were manipulated in two ways: by giving children the option of terminating an angry interaction by pushing an escape button and by describing an intervention strategy for angry people to use. Participants were 43 preschool children and their mothers. Findings revealed that differences in perceived control were related to differences in children's cardiovascular, electrodermal, and self-reported emotional responses to interadult anger and resolution. The introduction of control may  have increased distress in children. It is also possible that giving children a sense of control aroused them and that not giving children control increased a sense of helplessness about the situation. It is pointed out that given the relatively small changes observed in heart rate and skin conductance response and level, the clinical significance of the findings should be interpreted with caution.

The four centers were: (1) a nonprofit center subsidized by the state that served 166 children of AFDC-eligible parents or parents in job training programs; (2) a nonprofit center serving 115 children that was subsidized by a local social service agency; (3) a private, for-profit center that served 163 children and was funded entirely by parent fees; and (4) a private, for-profit center that was part of a nationally franchised chain. Respondents were asked background questions and questions about their education and training, their decision to enter the field and to take their current job, their current working  conditions and job satisfaction, and their thoughts about alternative jobs. Findings are presented in sections on pay and benefits, adequacy of staffing, managerial skills and style of directors, opportunities for professional development, and relations with children and parents.

        "description":"The Fremont, California City Council placed a measure on a June 1989 ballot that asked residents whether a tax should be levied to pay for child care services. The measure was devised in response to the conclusion of a task force that had been appointed by the council to study child care. The task force concluded that there was an extreme shortage of affordable child care and the shortage would continue because of the large number of people expected to move into the city in the next decade. In an attempt to avoid placing the financial burden of child care exclusively on real estate developers, the council worked with city staff to design a plan to levy a $12 a year property tax on all residential dwelling units; to add a 20 percent surcharge to business taxes; and to impose a new  developer fee. Proponents of the measure campaigned on the issues of safety, city prestige, and the low cost of the proposal. Opponents argued that the measure was too costly, poorly conceived, and inadequate. This paper reports on interviews with local policymakers and results of an exit poll conducted on election day. The paper concludes by identifying reasons why the measure lost by a four to one margin. (RH)",

        "description":"This study of dimensions of variation in preschool teachers' classroom talk involved 10 white, middle-class, experienced teachers in developmental classes. Audio recordings and observations were made of 30 minutes of free play time, 5 minutes of transition time, and 25 minutes of group time. For 8 of the teachers, group time included 10 minutes of story reading, which was analyzed separately. Recordings were complemented by field notes. Transcripts of recordings were coded for eight types of questions, six types of controlling strategies, and five other speech acts. Time of day had a significant effect on the variables. Principal components analyses of the variables for free play, transition, group time, and story reading consistently produced two components that maximally  differentiated teachers from each other: (1) a tendency to solicit, clarify, and echo children's responses; and (2) a controlling tendency involving direct and indirect commands and controlling questions. These two dimensions of variation are discussed in relation to Nelson's (1973) positive cognitive and negative social parental discourse styles. For story reading, these dimensions are further related to Dickinson and Keebler's (1989) analysis of interactive versus performatory book reading styles. (Author/RH)",

The early childhood classroom provides many opportunities for the use of logos in context. Sociodramatic play provides one such opportunity. Whether the play is arranged around a home center or other theme, it will provide ample opportunities to include packages, signs, and labels appropriate to particular themes. This form of exposure to print in a meaningful context will help children begin to make the transition to reading out of context, the next step toward fluent reading.

All participating districts screened all children entering school. The three types of initial data collected on each child were classified as demographic, screening, and placement. Demographic data included: birth date, eligibility for subsidized lunch, gender, and ethnicity. Placement categories included: not enrolled in kindergarten, enrolled in junior kindergarten, and enrolled in kindergarten. Students were tested with the Brigance Kindergarten and  First Grade Screen, the Daberon Screening for School Readiness, or the Missouri Kindergarten Inventory of Developmental Skills (KIDS). Moderately predictive of placement were socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, gender, and age. More predictive was a main-effects model including SES, gender, and age. Findings indicate that poor, young males face a stronger likelihood of being placed in junior kindergarten than their peers. Poor, young males were 32 times more likely to be placed in junior kindergarten than were their nonpoor, older, female peers. Policy implications are discussed. (RH)",

Three related problems affect education in the Plains States--the devastated rural economy, limited career opportunities in rural areas, and the shortage of teachers of selected subjects in small rural secondary schools. This program addresses these problems by providing a mechanism for economically displaced rural residents with bachelor's degrees in fields other than education to become qualified to teach in secondary schools. During the program's initial 2-year period--August 1987 to August 1989--21 students completed the two-semester program and were certified to teach in one or more secondary fields. Because of participants' maturity  and motivation, instruction was individually designed for each student. Credits were awarded as a result of transcript analysis, demonstrated competence in specific areas, directed field experiences in local schools, field-based seminars related to local school issues, individualized learning units, &quot;Telenet&quot; courses, required core courses, and specific tests. Required courses were delivered as seminars at two community colleges in economically depressed areas. Student teaching experiences were coordinated with local schools. The story of one farmer's transition to teacher illustrates the success of this program. (SV)",

The project was built around an agreement between the university personnel and school districts committing them to the program and using the Outcomes Driven Developmental Model as the basis for action. College personnel provided assistance to districts in understanding and use of the model, as well as technical training and feedback service. The model involves school administration, the board of education, and the schools themselves in promoting student self-esteem, cognitive skills, process skills, self-directed learning, and concern for others. Training sessions were held four times a year for administrators and teachers.  Superintendents were involved in planning sessions at least two times a year. At the end of the 3-year program, follow-up activities were planned to allow continued improvement. Evaluation results show that participants were almost unanimous in affirming that the school districts were committed to school improvement using the outcome based development model. Responses to questions about effectiveness were generally positive, although some reservations were expressed. The major difficulties were community understanding and trust, and openness among district staff members. (DHP)",

This manual is a comprehensive reference guide for Chapter 1 Migrant Program personnel counselors and teachers serving migrant students at the secondary level. Migrant students are those who move across school district boundaries with a parent or guardian in search of temporary or seasonal agricultural or fishing employment. The manual addresses the complex credit accrual and acceptance issues confronting the migrant secondary student. These issues affect the rates at which migrant students remain in and graduate from high school. The manual describes a number of state and interstate projects for secondary migrant studies. It explains the Chapter 1 Migrant  Program and use of the Migrant Student Record Transfer System in sufficient technical detail to assist in interpreting, using, and reporting secondary credit data. Key problem areas for migrant students, including minimum competency or exit examinations, differing graduation requirements, and difficulty in accumulating credits, are discussed for the purpose of achieving more effective interstate credit accrual and coordination. The manual also addresses benefits to school staff from participation in the secondary credit accrual system and provides case analyses of problem areas for system administrators.

This document addresses the issue of designing educational facilities that contribute positively to a bicultural educational curriculum. The study examined traditional Navajo education as seen through the perspective of contemporary Navajo elders. Small group interviews in a loose, open-ended format were used to obtain data on the educational values of the Navajo elders. Navajo elders were concerned with the Navajo language, considering that a knowledge of Navajo was a prerequisite for understanding Navajo values and  traditions; at the same time, they felt that English should also be taught. Elders believed that Navajo cultural practices should be taught and practiced and that students should have vocational and professional training, including traditional Navajo craft skills. In traditional education, life-style and education are inseparable, and elders wanted this holistic approach for their children. The final sections of the report are concerned with relating these values to school site location and organization, facility design and scale, space organization, interior decoration, and the use of special rooms, possibly resembling hogans, for Navajo language teaching.

The meeting addressed characteristics that affect the academic achievement of migrant secondary school-aged youth. Held in conjunction with the New York Migrant Education Program State Conference, the meeting provided participants from both sending and receiving states an opportunity to examine the characteristics of migrant secondary students that help or hinder their academic achievement. In the course of the three-day meeting, participants were able to describe the characteristics that may contribute to migrant students' success or failure in school. These characteristics include those of migrant families, of migrant youth themselves, and of the school  system. In addition, participants were able to identify strategies for promoting success and to hear migrant dropouts discuss their own school experiences. Participants reached the conclusion that many of the &quot;problems&quot; migrant youth experience stem from detrimental behaviors, policies, or traditions in the schools. Participants recommended more emphasis on dropout services and secondary school services for migrant youth, more national consistency in migrant youth services, and increased coordination among state and national programs.

These educators have identified effective preventative strategies such as the elimination of grade retention, counseling, provision of role models, staff training, monitoring student progress, credit and make-up opportunities, and parental involvement. Obstacles to providing successful programs on a national scope include lack of money and resources, lack of communication and coordination of services, and lack of cooperation from schools and communities. Migrant educators have not made dropout retrieval a priority. They need to increase services  to dropouts and to address the post-graduate needs of graduating migrant students. Migrant educators are often leaders in the initiation of new trends in education. Among these are the move from remediation to a challenging, but comprehensible, curriculum and the incorporation of more developmental and experiential teaching approaches. New trends indicate a need to provide direct services to the whole family and to include and involve family members in educational decisions. The imperative for migrant education to be effective leads to out-of-school supplementary services that increase the child's total learning time by extending the school day, week, and year. (TES)",

The meeting, one of a three-part series, addressed student mobility, the most perplexing problem of migrant youth. Mobility is the major characteristic that makes migrant students different from their classmates and other youth at risk. Although much has been done to deal with general mobility problems, individual attention is still required for students who move from school to school. Participants in this meeting identified problems and solutions that they encountered in dealing with migrant youth. In most cases, the suggested solutions required programmatic changes in either school district policy or migrant  education program assistance. In other cases, solutions indicated the need for ongoing and increased interstate coordination. Recommendations include improvement of secondary services; a national portable assisted study program and a credit make-up system; enhancement of the Migrant Student Record Transfer System; and improved identification and recruitment of secondary students at risk.

Reports addressing disadvantaged students were also reviewed, as were two efforts that deal specifically with Indian education.

A survey instrument was constructed using questions from the ongoing &quot;High School and Beyond&quot; study. Data were collected via telephone precontact with three followups and a site visit to school districts.

Income fell 2.2% annually between 1978-86 (10% per annum in the farm industry) and unemployment rates doubled since the mid-1970s. This 1988 study describes the school-to-work transition of a sample of high school graduates, class of 1983, whose aspirations and expectations for employment were formed during this period of severe economic dislocation. Eleven of 98 rural school districts with less than 300 enrolled were randomly selected and a systematic strategy of precontacts and follow-ups contributed to a response rate of 83% and a sample size of 174 graduates. The survey instrument was based on the &quot;High School and Beyond&quot; study. Approximately 60% of the sample  went directly from high school into post-secondary education. Another 15% entered postsecondary institutions sometime in the year following graduation. Nearly 80% had pursued additional schooling within five years, with 64% of the females going on to higher education, compared to 50% of the males. Thirty percent of the sample directly entered the labor force, with over 50% going into blue collar jobs. Comparison of the students' aspirations and expectations indicates that respondents generally expected to be able to do what they wanted to do following high school graduation. The quality of employment and career paths are also assessed. The chief impression is one of change; young Iowans are geographically mobile, changing educational programs and institutions frequently, but not so  frequently as they change jobs. The two appendices explain research methods and occupational categorization. This paper contains 16 references. (ALL)",

        "description":"Alaska became suddenly and surprisingly rich in the early 1980s, with oil revenues from Prudhoe Bay paying for almost all state operations, picking up some of the costs of local government, creating a huge state savings account, paying all Alaskans annual cash dividends, and eliminating the need for state personal income taxes. The smaller projected petroleum revenues of the 1990s will mean cutting the state's budget. To make budget decisions, Alaskans need to know how the state actually spent its money in the 1980s, and they need to keep in mind that before the oil riches, Alaska's state government spending was two to three times the national average. Other factors to consider are the doubling of population between 1967 and 1987 and inflation that nearly tripled prices. The gap  between Alaska's state spending and the average for other states widened in the 1980s because, with its increased revenues, Alaska (1) expanded existing programs; (2) delivered services in more expensive ways; (3) added many new kinds of spending; and (4) increased wages of public employees. These steps created economic and political forces that will complicate balancing the state's budget. This paper reveals the facts and discloses the fables about how the state spent $34 billion in the 1980s, and it assesses how those facts will make budget cutting tough. The analysis is in three parts: (1) The Prudhoe Bay Ride; (2) Myths and Realities; and (3) Between a Rock and a Hard Place. One table and 10 figures outline the fiscal history of Alaska's oil-rich years and project its future.  (ALL)",

In the \"Basic\" program described in this paper, grades one, two, and three were combined to help alleviate some of the problems of a small rural school in Nevada. The program is based on the Early Learning Center (ELC) demonstration classroom at the University of Nevada, Reno. The goals of the Basic program are to meet the needs of the students and create a community of non-competitive learners. The primary outcome of the program is literacy. Students worked through cyclic levels of mastery, increasing learning levels by returning to similar materials and lessons, but processing information at increasingly more complex  cognitive levels. Similar assignments were given to all three grade levels in the class, with differential interpretation of student performance being made by the teacher. Curriculum was related to literature-based reading, process writing, manipulative math, and cooperative learning, with an emphasis on students' experiences. Teachers fostered social environments that emphasized peer help, self responsibility, and expectation of student success in social problem solving. The results of the programs suggest that students maintain a positive attitude toward the learning atmosphere and school and that they suffer no negative academic effects. Students' progress may be questionable, however, after they return to the traditional classroom setting. Appendices include teaching plans, examples  of student work, administrative viewpoint, outline of basic school curriculum, and budget considerations. (ALL)",

        "author":["Bill, Willard E."],
        "description":"This guide introduces concerns and problems resulting from the use and abuse of alcohol and drugs among American Indian youth and addresses intergenerational substance abuse effects. Alcohol abuse among American Indians and Alaska Natives is the most visible effect of their cultural disruption and disorganization. Alcoholism among Native Americans has reached epidemic proportions, and death rates associated with alcohol have tripled since the 1960s. While the Indian Health Service provides services to reservation American Indians, delivery of health care and prevention services for urban Indians and Alaska Natives is more problematic. At least eight theories attempt to explain Indian drinking behavior. Alcohol education must recognize that (1) most of the adult American Indian  population was raised in alcoholic settings, and (2) this population exhibits the characteristic behaviors of adult children of alcoholics (ACOAs). Therapy for ACOAs includes the resolution of delayed grief. Alcohol abuse prevention strategies for Indian youth should involve factual information, exercises aimed at changing attitudes, training in problem-solving skills and interpersonal communication skills, and positive social networks. This guide contains questions for discussion, tables of death rates by age and cause, lists of characteristics and needs of Native American at-risk students, hints for helping at-risk students, a summary of Washington laws concerning drug and alcohol use by minors, a bibliography of 20 related documents in the ERIC database, and directories of domestic  violence services and alcoholism treatment services in Washington and the Portland area.

        "description":"On August 22, 1986, the New Mexico State Board of Education adopted its first policy on Indian education. The policy seeks to address the unmet educational needs of Indian students, mandates quality education for all Indian students, and establishes the process for ensuring that aspirations and expectations of Indian parents and students for educational excellence are met. Earlier in the month, the State Department of Education and Highlands University sponsored a seminar entitled &quot;Quality Education in New Mexico.&quot; At that seminar, Indian people from across the state discussed and provided input into the policy statement. A clear consensus emerged. Scholastic problems include low test scores, high dropout rate, frequent absenteeism, high suicide rates, and poor performance at  advanced studies. Recommendations involve more stringent standards for teacher selection, cooperation among concerned agencies, increased commitment among all educators, standardized curricula and records, adapted courses to meet student needs, oversight of the activities of administrator, increased parental involvement, greater emphasis on learning English, incorporation of American Indian culture, increased financial support, student incentives, and support for adult education. This report includes the formal policy statement, statements by state and tribal officials, 41 recommendations proposed by 13 committees at the seminar, results of the seminar evaluation, and a list of conference participants.

        "description":"Inadequate public transportation in rural areas has long been a major impediment for rural residents' access to health care, jobs, and community activities and services. Particularly disadvantaged in transportation are the rural poor, elderly, and youth. This report highlights the benefits to be gained by passage of the Commission on Rural Resources' bill, which authorizes the integration of school buses and services into coordinated rural public transportation programs. The bill does not require school districts to participate in such programs, but only authorizes them to do so if they wish. The bill would allow school districts to: (1) rent or lease vehicles to a services coordinator or not-for-profit organization; (2) provide drivers to such organizations; (3) contract to  store, maintain, and repair vehicles owned by these organizations; and (4) contract with them to provide a portion of a coordinated rural public transportation program. The bill also requires that school districts be reimbursed for the full amount of costs and expenses incurred in leasing buses or providing services. The report addresses concerns about confusion to motorists, competition with private bus services, and loss of state transportation aid. It also describes existing demonstration programs and the potential benefits of such a system. (DHP)",

        "author":["Shapiro, Isaac"],
        "description":"Most of the nonmetropolitan poor live in a household with at least one worker. In 1987, 70% of nonmetro poor family heads who were not ill, disabled, or retired worked for at least part of the year, and 24% worked full time, year-round. The employed proportion of the poor was significantly larger in nonmetro than metro areas. Despite a lengthy economic recovery, poverty rates among nonmetro workers in 1987 were significantly higher than during the recovery of the late 1970s. Poverty rates for nonmetro working families were much higher than for metro working families. These patterns of poverty rates were similar in all sections of the country. About 66% of the nonmetro working poor were found in three occupational categories: services; farming, forestry, and fishing; and  operators, fabricators, and laborers. Factors contributing to increases in the nonmetro working poor include: (1) the relatively high nonmetro unemployment rate for this stage of the economic recovery; (2) the large numbers of &quot;discouraged workers&quot; and &quot;involuntarily part-time workers&quot; found in nonmetro areas; (3) decreases in rural wage rates, after adjustment for inflation; (4) relative concentration of nonmetro employment in declining industries; (5) inadequate education and skills; and (6) reductions in federal and state benefits and programs for low-income working families. A number of legislative proposals now before Congress would benefit the rural working poor. The principal linkage between this document and the field of education is provided by a two-page section on &quot;Employment  and Training Programs&quot; (p.49-52) and a single table (p.52) comparing Federal spending for such programs for FY 1981 and FY 1989.

        "description":"This study of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and contract secondary school administrators creates a BIA administrator profile and examines differences between Indian and non-Indian administrators. Two different instruments were mailed to 54 administrators. The first, with a return rate of 44%, was a questionnaire relating to administrative duties and activities. The second, with a return rate of 41%, was the Leadership Practices Inventory, a leadership style instrument. Both surveys were examined for demographic and ethnic differences. Eighty percent of the respondents were male with an average age of 40-45. The typical administrator had been a classroom teacher for 7.38 years before becoming a principal. The average term of service in the current school was 5.4 years.  Respondents' average length of service in administration was 11.71 years. The study found few differences between Native American and non-Indian administrators regarding daily activities or leadership style. The typical administrator arrives 40 minutes early for work and stays an hour late, maintaining high daily visibility in the cafeteria, teacher's lounge, and school halls. The data suggest that all BIA administrators are involved in activities and extracurricular events. Both groups tended to describe themselves as &quot;inspiring&quot; and &quot;modeling,&quot; while Indian principals tended to choose the word &quot;challenging.&quot; Conversely, however, all respondents scored only moderately on areas of staff collaboration, enabling subordinates, and recognizing employees when they achieve. Administrators  perceive themselves as instructional leaders, but they actually spend much of their time as managers or disciplinarians. The document suggests instructional leadership as an area for possible reform. (TES)",

        "author":["Matthews, Doris B."],
        "description":"This document synthesizes research findings to formulate a theory to guide relaxation training in educational settings, particularly rural schools. Young people experience many intense life events that require coping skills or relaxation. Family-related stress factors include instability in the home, lack of a support system, conflicting values, sibling rivalry, and family mobility. In school, children may experience stress related to academic achievement or social relationships. Community-based stressors include the technology explosion and world problems. For 5 years, researchers trained 10- to 18-year-old students in relaxation, using biofeedback, guided imagery, autogenics, and deep breathing. The resulting theory of relaxation holds that: (1) relaxation training decreases  arousal, with high-anxious persons more capable of change than low-anxious persons; (2) students evoke the relaxation response easily but have difficulty evoking arousal; (3) all training techniques are suitable, with cognitive methods more effective with extended practice; (4) practice creates an incremental effect; (5) personal training is more effective than cassette programs; and (6) biofeedback instrumentation enhances measurement of relaxation states. Relaxation training improved students' self-management skills, decreased state anxiety, increased girls' social interaction skills, improved self-concept, reduced test anxiety, and raised test scores and achievement. This document contains 136 references and suggestions for implementation of a system-wide stress management program.  (SV)",

State school policies do not specifically recognize the differences between urban and rural school districts. Although a few policies imply consideration for the rural nature of most of the state's school districts, none of the provisions have been funded. Since 1982, the state has been making an effort to promote a thorough and efficient system of free schools as mandated by Pauley vs. Bailey, a pioneering case and a catalyst for reform. Also known as the Recht decision, the ruling prescribed  the precise subjects to be taught, the number of minutes of instruction, and curriculum goals. Typically, students in rural counties begin the school day with a long bus ride, have unemployed parents who dropped out of school, receive special education services, score lower on achievement tests and have a greater chance of dropping out of school. School revenues are raised from property taxes; this presents a problem in rural counties with no commercial or business properties. When school districts are ranked by quartiles based on student density, the least dense quartile is shown to have the lowest average personal income: approximately five-eighths of the average personal income of the most dense quartile of districts. Findings of a 1988 Task Force indicated serious problems existing in  the structure and finance of the educational system and offered possible solutions.

While there are large metropolitan areas situated near Norfolk, Roanoke, Richmond, and Washington, D.C., the state is predominantly rural. Virginia school legislation does not specify policies for rural education different from those for urban and suburban education. A revised funding formula, however, was implemented in 1987, taking into account the higher than normal per-pupil instructional and transportation costs associated with population sparsity. The state-supported  system of distance learning is specifically designed to assist rural schools provide educational programs that they otherwise could not afford. The &quot;Standards of Quality&quot; are used to determine the minimum program of high quality education that must be offered by all school divisions. In general, most rural school students begin the day with a fairly long bus ride, may have parents who are unemployed or underemployed, are more likely to need special education services, score lower on achievement tests, are less likely to be classified as gifted than urban students, and are likely to have parents who did not graduate from high school or have only a high school education. Rural school districts differ from their urban counterparts by containing smaller numbers of schools and students and  having less adequate of funding. When school districts are ranked by quartiles based on student density, the least dense quartile is shown to have the lowest average personal income: approximately three-fifths of the average personal income of the most dense quartile of districts.

Tennessee school legislation does not specify policies for rural education different from those for urban or suburban education.

In 1988, a  group of 66 counties filed a lawsuit challenging the state's funding formula. The consequent court decision may radically change the foundation of educational aid in Tennessee.

        "description":"In Kentucky, 105 of 178 school districts, or 59%, are classified as rural. State law and administrative regulations presume that most school districts are both rural and isolated. The environment for rural schools in the state is heavily influenced by the fact that the majority of school districts are rural. Each school district must have a written plan for a program of school and community relations and provide a specified amount of school time to be spent on basic skills. Typically, rural students begin the day with a fairly long bus ride, may have parents who are unemployed or underemployed, are more likely to need special education services and less likely to be classified as gifted than urban students, and are likely to have parents who did not graduate from high school or  have only a high school education. The rural student is apt to do more poorly in school than urban students and value education less. Rural school districts in Kentucky differ from urban school districts not only in student achievement but also in the adequacy of their funding. When school districts are ranked by quartiles of student density, the lowest two quartiles (i.e., half the districts) are shown to have equally average personal income: approximately five-eighths of the average personal income of the most dense quartile of districts. The highly varying tax rates on properties and the unequal distribution of wealth provide very unequal funding for school districts. In 1989, the supreme court ruled that the entire system of precollegiate education was unconstitutional because of the  unequal educational opportunity. There has been a great deal of school consolidation in Kentucky's rural school districts, with virtually all feasible school consolidation having taken place.

While schools have begun to address the issue of underachievement, some community groups have implemented enrichment programs that focus on the affective domain--self-esteem, family values, and cultural pride. This digest describes and synthesizes the successful strategies of several community programs in Texas and southern California: Valued Youth Partnership Program (San Antonio), Youth Community Service program (Los Angeles), Project ONDA (Opportunities for Networking and Developing Aspirations) (Dallas), Pasadera (Stepping Stone) Program (San Antonio), National Hispanic Institute programs (Austin), Del Mar College's Prefreshman Engineering Program (Corpus Christi), the University  of Texas at El Paso's Mother-Daughter Program, and ADVANCE (San Antonio). These programs involve peer tutoring, adult mentors, training in leadership and communication skills, support groups, health promotion, child abuse prevention, and college experiences for high school students. These programs share many key features. In particular, they: (1) actively recruit students; (2) serve a small group of students; (3) direct personal attention at students; (4) focus on enrichment, not deficits; (5) target the affective domain; (6) validate the language and culture of students' homes; (7) provide support and role models using local resources; (8) facilitate other support needed to ensure attendance; and (9) celebrate students' accomplishments publicly.

        "description":"This digest links the development of listening comprehension to the emerging reading comprehension of young American Indian students, and suggests ways that teachers can use locally produced materials to enhance young students' emergent literacy. Reading comprehension is the key to literacy, and prior knowledge supports listening and reading comprehension. However, most commercial reading materials used in schools do not reflect American Indian students' exprience of the world. Since there are many culturally distinct American Indian groups, producing commercial &quot;Indian&quot; materials is not a viable alternative. Studies have shown, however, that culturally relevant instructional materials increased listening comprhension among American Indian primary students. Such findings indicate  the effectiveness of teachers' efforts to produce instructional materials locally. Such efforts might involve inviting community storytellers into the classroom and transcribing oral presentations for use as reading materials, or encouraging children to develop stories based on their own experiences. Teachers must also recognize the linguistic diversity of their students, who may use English as first language, second language, or dialect. Students' linguistic backgrounds must be considered when designing a language arts program. This digest contains 10 references. (SV)",

Thompson G. Stewart, D. Honeyman, and R. Wood, addresses possible solutions to the emerging problem of capital outlay financing, with special attention to facilities in rural areas. Construction and maintenance of school buildings have traditionally depended on local funding. But rural school districts, operating on some of the lowest revenue bases in the country, are often unsuccessful in raising property taxes to meet capital outlay needs. Also, the state-mandated reforms of recent years have placed an additional burden on local budgets, diverting possible resources from capital outlay financing. Recent  court rulings have linked capital outlay financing to the established legal premises of adequacy and equity, and have implied the need to provide poor school districts with additional outside funds. State aid for capital outlay has been instituted in 28 states, ranging from full state funding to state or local building authorities, which often seek to involve private enterprise. All forms of such state aid have disadvantages related to loss of local control. Strong partnerships between state education agencies and local education agencies are vital to countering such disadvantages. This digest contains 10 references. (SV)",

        "description":"This paper discusses trends and issues surrounding undocumented students in the United States. War, hope, political difficulties, and economic troubles propel immigrants into the country. Estimates range from 100,000 to 500,000 undocumented immigrants entering annually, almost one-fifth of whom are under age 15. Many undocumented children attend public schools. Issues for educators include the right to education for undocumented children, the right of immigration officials to enter the classroom, and children in detention. State laws say all school-aged immigrants are required to attend school without regard to citizenship. However, some immigrant students must receive permission from immigration officials to attend school, and that permission can be withdrawn. Education rights  are defined by the courts, federal education acts, and civil-rights legislation. Provisions of the Immigrant Reform and Control Act and the Transition Program for Refugee Children tie services to students' immigration status. Other federal programs do not. Court decisions also address detention center issues, language proficiency, equal educational opportunity, and educational access by undocumented migrant students. Schools are advised to be aware of students' rights and work toward an atmosphere that is hospitable to all immigrants. They are prohibited from discriminating against students based upon their immigration status or making inquiries that might expose that status. Recommendations for schools include staff training, preparation of information materials, and the development of  policies dealing with victimization or harassment of immigrant students. The document also includes a legal bibliography, a table of applicable court cases, and 14 references. (TES)",

Preliminary results of the interviews reveal that grade 5 students have reasonable declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge about science text and science reading but much growth is needed for them to become efficient, successful science readers. These results identify metacognitive dimensions regarding science text and science reading that would be strengthened by explicit instructions designed to improve  students' knowledge of the use of science text. Reciprocal teaching was also identified as a promising instructional strategy that provided the support required to develop self-appraisal skills.

Many have cited the results of international comparisons as cause for alarm and thus for the need to make fundamental changes in the educational system. With so much attention focused on the need for better mathematics and science education, it is important to understand the changing patterns in course taking in these fields. The purpose of this paper is to provide a descriptive summary of the changing trends in high school course taking in mathematics and science for students who graduated between 1969 and 1987. This analysis focuses specifically on gender and racial/ethnic group differences. The study compares the average number of  credits completed in mathematics and science classes for public school students based on high school transcripts collected in four national surveys. These surveys included the Educational Testing Service Study of Academic Prediction and Growth (1969); the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Force Experience: Youth Cohort (1975-1978 and 1979-1982); High School and Beyond (1982); and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Transcript Study (1987).

Data were collected using &quot;Contemporary Goals Survey&quot; (CGS) and &quot;Stages of Concern (SoC) instrument. The CGS data analysis indicated significant differences between pretest and posttest scores for seven of the eight item statements. A qualitative examination of SoC profiles indicated a shift away from the three lower (Awareness,  Informational, and Personal) and toward the three higher (Consequence, Collaboration, and Refocusing) Stages of Concern toward S-T-S instruction.

Eighty preservice teachers over two terms elected to complete one of two projects as part of their science methods course. The \"Discussions in Science\" (DiS) project used a science topic as the basis for discussions between teacher and child. The teachers analyzed children's thinking about sciences as well as variables affecting inquiry science teaching. The \"Mentorship Program\" (MP) project used a topic jointly selected by a middle school able learner and the teacher based on a mutual interest. These topics were generally in the social sciences and the project focused on  developing a presentation by the able learner. The Test of Science-Related Attitudes and Preferences and Understandings were adapted to measure attitudes toward science and inquiry teaching. Paired t-tests of pretest and posttest gain scores showed a significant increase in attitudes toward inquiry teaching in the DiS project and not in the MP project. An analysis of covariance holding pretest attitudes constant failed to show a significant difference. (Author/YP)",

This article describes a study where kinesthetic feedback was completely removed by giving students only visual replications of a motion situation. If simultaneity of perception is the important variable, then a video recreation of the motion event alongside a graph might be enough to help the students link the real event with the graph.

The two experimental dimensions were the type of laboratory experience (either VideoGraph or traditional manipulative methodology) and real motion event or not. The laboratory tasks required two hours. Two  parallel versions of the Test of Understanding Graphs-Kinematics were used for pretest and posttest. A two-way analysis of covariance was performed on the posttest scores with the pretest as the covariate. There was no significant main effects and no interaction, although the higher posttest scores were made by the VideoGraph students. A comparison of overall pre and posttest scores showed that learning had occurred in all the four groups. About 80% of college students preferred the VideoGraph technique. (YP)",

Students from grades 3, 4, and 5 in two rural elementary schools participated in the study. Students completed a pretest, a cognitive conflict laboratory activity and a posttest that measured qualitative and quantitative aspects of their understanding of temperature. The control group completed the activity in traditional dyads and the experimental group completed the activity in cooperative learning groups composed of four students. The experimental group was given laboratory worksheets that asked the group to first solve a qualitative problem and the quantitative problems that referred to the same type of measurement to create  cognitive conflict between the two representational systems related to temperature. Students were asked to compare their answers on the two problems. If their answers conflicted, they were told to decide which answer was correct and to carry out an experiment to prove their answer. No directions were given for control group students on the predictions or results, but they were asked to answer the questions on the laboratory activity sheet together. The results indicated that the conflict training was effective in changing students' concepts of temperature, but the cooperative learning groups were no more effective than the traditional dyads.

Forty-nine high school students enrolled in two sections of New York State Regents Chemistry classes at a suburban school participated in this study. The Misunderstandings Test about burning and chemical change, Students' Learning Strategies Questionnaire, Attitude toward Chemistry Questionnaire, and Differential Aptitude Tests were used to collect data. The Misunderstandings Test was used twice within an 8-month span;  students' responses from the two are discussed. Results demonstrated that students' performance on a misunderstandings pretest and students' learning approaches accounted for a statistically significant proportion of the variance on students' performance on the misunderstandings posttest. The results showed that students who identified themselves as meaningful learners performed better than rote learners on the misunderstandings posttest. (Author/YP)",

Increased self-efficacy and outcome expectancy beliefs were predicted antecedents to the behavior change. This study was designed to provide a valid and reliable measure of the teacher self-efficacy of preservice elementary science teachers. In order to do this, the Riggs (1988) Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument (STEBI) Form A was modified from an inservice orientation to measure the beliefs of elementary preservice teachers. Based upon Bandura's social learning theory, the two-sub scales of STEBI (Form B) measure constructs of self-efficacy and outcome expectancy with regard to science teaching and learning. Item and factor analyses  revealed that the scales are homogeneous and distinct, and the new form (Form B) is consistent with the previous form.

The first content course integrated chemistry with biology and emphasized the interdisciplinary nature of science. A companion methods course facilitated student's ability to use process skills and to apply the concepts in the content course. The treatment group had significant posttest gains for the cognitive  test, but the companion group did not.

Chemistry: (1) is perceived as difficult; (2) involves a multitude of facts; and (3) is not connected to reality. A curriculum with a simulation format has been developed to help Israeli nursing students cope with the obstacle of learning chemistry. It is enhanced by intensive written exercises and manipulative teaching aids. Examples include revival of a patient hurt in a traffic accident, and the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis by testing the pH of the blood. Analysis of open attitude questionnaires showed the development of more positive attitudes towards chemistry. The attitude change was attributed to the following: (1)  the curriculum applied principles considered as essential by health care professionals and educators; (2) the textbook was written in Hebrew, thus removing the psychological barrier against using English textbooks; and (3) the approach established a link between the abstract ideas presented by pure chemistry and the real, everyday life of the nursing students' future profession.

A recent increase in the diversity of student interests, academic abilities, attitudes, and vocational aspirations has generated formal evaluation and informal debate among biology teachers regarding the appropriateness of the present course. This study investigated the degree of satisfaction-dissatisfaction of the &quot;Web of Life&quot; course as indicated by 60 experienced teachers. The development of the Teachers' Perception and Opinion Questionnaire (TPOQ) was described. Nine categories measured by 50 items of the TPOQ were: (1) curriculum materials; (2) curriculum  content; (3) learning skills; (4) philosophy of the course; (5) assessment of student achievement; (6) tertiary entrance exam; (7) management; (8) teacher characteristics; and (9) student characteristics. Teachers' responses by categories and items were reported. The highest satisfaction was related to the curriculum package and the highest areas of dissatisfaction were related to the externally set examination, the current population of students, and the knowledge and skills of biology teachers. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving inquiry teaching and for developing an alternative course to cater for the diverse range of students. (YP)",

It details one of three parallel analyses conducted in a year-long study of language in the classrooms of four new biology teachers. The conceptual framework of the study predicted that when teaching unfamiliar subject matter, teachers would use a variety of discourse strategies to constrain student talk to a narrowly circumscribed topic domain. The paper includes the results of an utterance-by-utterance analysis of teacher and student talk in a 30-lesson sample of science instruction. Data are broken down by classroom activity for a number of measures, including duration of utterances, domination of the speaking floor by the teacher,  frequency of teacher questioning, cognitive level of teacher questions, and student verbal participation. When teaching unfamiliar topics, the four teachers in this study tended to talk more frequently and for longer periods of time, ask questions frequently, and rely heavily on low cognitive-level questions. The rate of student questions to the teacher was found to vary with the classroom activity. In common classroom communicative settings, student questions were less common when the teacher was teaching unfamiliar subject matter. The implications of these findings include a suggestion that teacher knowledge may be an important unconsidered variable in research on the cognitive level of questions and teacher wait-time.

This study revealed a small amount of environmental content and that this content was not presented from the &quot;Environmental  Perspective.&quot; Textbooks are negligent in their treatment of environmental issues and this negligence parallels the policies of the Ontario Ministry of Education as revealed in their published curriculum guidelines.

        "description":"Research in teacher education has shifted from an emphasis on teachers' behaviors to a focus on teachers' thinking. The purposes of this paper are to describe categories of beliefs held by preservice secondary science teachers, to describe how the preservice teachers planned lessons, and to discuss the influence of their beliefs on their planning. This paper draws on data from two studies of preservice teacher education. The informants for these studies were five preservice teachers enrolled in secondary science education. Data collection consisted of semi-structured, open-ended interviews, observations, and lesson plans written by the informants. The findings from both studies indicated that preservice teachers shared many common beliefs, possibly reflecting the influence of the  education classes. Most teachers placed importance on science processes and valued understanding over memorization of facts. The findings support the contention that beliefs are a dominant factor in influencing teachers' planning and that teacher educators may influence previous teachers' developing beliefs, or reinforce existing beliefs. It was recommended that science educators promote self-reflection among preservice science teachers. (CW)",

Researchers are analyzing the effects of reforms on education and many states have expanded their systems for assessing, monitoring, and reporting on schools, teachers, and equity. The Council of Chief State School Officers established the State Education Assessment Center in 1985 to coordinate the development, analysis, and use of state-level data and charged the Center with implementing an education indicators model for reporting state-by-state data. This report is a preliminary analysis of state-by-state data from 1988-89. Chapter 1 addresses the use of state  course enrollment as an indicator of curriculum in science and mathematics. Chapter 2 addresses the use of state data on teacher characteristics to analyze issues of teacher supply and demand. Analyses are provided on mathematics and science enrollments; science and mathematics teachers' age, sex, and race/ethnicity; and teacher certification. (CW)",

Data were collected from secondary science students enrolling in earth science (8th grade), biology (9th grade), physical science (10th grade), or chemistry (11th grade). Cause-effect relations were analyzed using the method of path analysis to test the direct effects of model variables specified in the theory of planned behavior. Results indicated that students' intention to enroll in a high school physics course was determined by their attitude toward enrollment and their degree of perceived behavioral control. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were formed as a result of specific beliefs students  held about enrolling in physics. Grade level and career goals were found to be instrumental in shaping student attitudes. Immediate family members were identified as major referents in the social support system for enrolling in physics. Course and extra-curricular conflicts and the fear of failure were shown to be the primary beliefs obstructing students' perception of control over physics enrollment. (Author/YP)",

Traditional socialization from a number of different sources educates girls and women to believe that these non-traditional careers are not available to them. Several previous researchers have shown that one socializing force in schools is the image of scientists in science textbooks. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between images of science careers and junior high school students' attitudes toward science occupations. Eight classes of students in grades 6 to 8 (n=211) were shown sex-biased collages of images. Four classes were shown pictures with a male bias, and the other four the opposite condition over 4  weeks in their science classes. Following treatment, students completed a questionnaire, a Draw-A-Scientist test, and a Q-sort of science occupations. It was shown that: (1) student background characteristics were significant predictors of Q-sort scores; (2) there were significant differences between the treatment groups; and (3) the treatment was more effective for the girls in the sample than for the boys. A questionnaire, a sample collage, and protocols for the Draw-A-Scientist Test and the Q-sort are included. (CW)",

Analyzed in this paper were the results of the limiting factor activities, and items which tested the concept of the relationship between photosynthesis and respiration. It was found that even though these students were familiar with the concept of limiting factors, they had  trouble applying it in everyday life; the students' understanding of the latter concept was as a gas exchange rather than as a biochemical process.

        "description":"Inservice education in many schools has shifted from the use of outside experts to the education of master teachers who serve as inside educators. The effectiveness of the use of master teachers has been demonstrated. To make this process more effective, there is a need to understand the dynamics that the master teachers confront when they take their university-based education and implement it with their peer teachers. Part of these dynamics are based on a perceived need for change in the existing program. This raises the question of whether the perceptions of need for change of master teachers and peer teachers match. This study used the Transactional Evaluation Technique to evaluate this match in one situation. Findings indicated that two areas need to be addressed: (1) lead  teachers need to recognize that their peers are not as critical of their program as they are themselves and therefore peer teachers may be more satisfied with the status quo; and (2) lead teachers must recognize that the other teachers are more apt to request easily used materials, e.g., audiovisuals, such as videotape. The latter point may be seen as an opportunity to encourage more creative approaches that use audiovisuals as springboards for further activity. A copy of the survey instrument is included. (CW)",

        "description":"A formidable national educational reform movement has developed, aimed at improving the cultural literacy of U.S. students. Ideas about the illiteracy of American students and the urgency of restoring the nation's cultural knowledge, if carried forward, have strong implications for the school curriculum at both the elementary and secondary levels and for the content of standardized achievement tests at all levels. This paper explores the core idea of cultural literacy as expounded by major proponents of the movement. Some of the conclusions reached are: (1) Teaching more cultural content in the schools is an attractive idea. (2) Cultural literacy is not an intellectual ability akin to reading literacy. (3) Formal education, culture, and literacy do play critical roles in modern  industrial society but perhaps not in the way formulated by E. D. Hirsch, Jr., in his best selling book, &quot;Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know&quot; (1987). (4) In spite of his protestations otherwise, Hirsch's position is politically conservative in several different ways. (5) The list of what every U.S. citizen must know (for example, Hirsch's list) is politically conservative in what it includes and excludes. (6) The view of culture presented is one in which an individual passively receives culture rather than actively creates it. (7) The view of what is wrong with the poor and powerless of society is that they are culturally deficient, according to Hirsch. (8) More culture content should be taught in the schools and it should be taught to all students. (9) Multiple choice,  factual recall tests are not the best way to assess humanities content. (10) Even though cultural literacy cannot possibly accomplish all the things claimed for it, the U.S. should continue to strive for more cultural literacy in the curriculum. The document includes an 80-item bibliography. (JB)",

The 5- to 6-week orientation training program is designed to expand the use of practical art activities as teaching vehicles linking education to culture and promoting unification through the understanding of diversity. Following the initial program, selected teachers participate in an in-depth course based on the work they have done in their individual schools. In addition, workshops are offered for elementary and secondary teachers that cover themes in music, drama, mime, and puppetry. The program encourages using arts and crafts as teaching media to raise the level of awareness about India's cultural heritage. The  Centre has developed resources on tribal, rural, and classical forms of Indian art and published a series of eight books on the arts of India. It also has compiled resource documents and directories on the arts, and has created a network of artists, teachers, and scholars. In addition, the Centre designs and disseminates cultural kits of recordings and, slides on the plastic and performing arts that are accompanied by a script with an audio tape/record explanation.

        "description":"The historic events of 1989 changed the political map of the world. Students and workers in China rose up to demand democracy. Democracy bloomed in Chile, Brazil, and other Latin American countries where freely elected governments replaced repressive rulers. Communist dictatorships in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Rumania were toppled and interim governments agreed to establish multi-party democracies, free elections, and constitutional protection of basic rights and freedoms. Each of these nations, which had lived for decades with empty promises and meaningless constitutions, must now build a new society. In order to create a durable democratic society, they must inform themselves about what constitutes a democracy, what constitutes a free society, and what  institutional constraints are necessary to create a free, democratic society. Furthermore, they must teach democracy in their schools, not just as an academic study, but as a way of life that influences student life, classroom discussions, the curriculum, and methods of teaching. Even democratic societies must teach young people what democracy is, how to participate in it, and what rights and responsibilities they have as citizens. This paper discusses the concept of democracy, the types of democracies (direct, representative, and constitutional), and ways that democracy can be taught in schools. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"Many reasons can be offered for teaching about Australia. The field of Australian studies offers many opportunities for U.S. teachers and students to critically analyze aspects of their own culture, for there are many experiences in the history of Australia that parallel the U.S. experience. Australia and the United States have strong ongoing economic, social, and political ties. A study of Australia reveals interesting interactions between an extremely old geological landscape and the evolution of its unique fauna and flora. The Aboriginal people in Australia have possibly the oldest indigenous culture still operating. Teaching about Australia can profitably be included in the curriculum from kindergarten to 12th grade as part of a global perspective in social studies education.  Teachers can begin with basic geography lessons to locate Australia on a world map, noting its size, major geographic features, climatic zones, demographic distribution, location of major cities, and state borders. A historical perspective can be used to enhance understanding of different cultures in Australia. The use of a range of Australian literature, art, films, and visual and oral primary source materials can be a useful entry into an understanding of the values and assumptions underlying Australian culture. A study of issues facing Australia today can enhance students' inquiry skills and enable them to form generalizations that may be useful in explaining issues facing the United States.

(2) What are some strategies for including women in social studies? (3) What resources are recommended for teachers and students? Textbook studies of the 1970s revealed limited coverage of women in the social studies, and the few references to women conveyed negative stereotypes rather than balanced and realistic portrayals of changing roles in modern society. Coverage of women in textbooks increased in the 1980s, but neither the quality nor quantity of these treatments was adequate. Suggestions offered for integrating women in the curriculum are: (1) In economics, study the inequalities of income distribution and investigate why these inequalities exist in  society. (2) In sociology, examine charges of sex discrimination in the United States and what these charges are based upon. (3) Political science classes can research significant court cases that have influenced women's rights in this country. (4) Geography, world history, and world studies can involve the analysis of the status of women in other countries and at other times.

        "description":"The Chinese university students who protested in Spring 1989 were concerned about inflation, shortages of goods and services, and pay inequities. They disliked corruption, bribery, and unfair favoritism, and wanted more press freedom and more independence for their student organizations. Most of all, they wanted more dialogue with aging leaders about their role in China's future. Low-paid or jobless city dwellers felt a common cause with protesting students. Farmers, who were far removed, adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward student protests. The leadership was split. Deng Xiaoping, outraged by the protests and alarmed that further unrest would wreck economic advances, wanted student protests crushed. Moderates, preferring reconciliation with students, were headed by Zhao  Ziyang, who counseled against violent suppression. On May 17, Deng won the Politburo Standing Committee vote for military suppression, and the students were bloodily evicted from the square on June 4. Fall 1989 university enrollments nationwide were cut 5 percent. All students had to attend political re-education classes. Faculty at Beijing University and elsewhere had to attend Communist political study sessions. The clash and the military put-down discredited the Party in student minds and hearts. The hopes that impelled intellectuals to support Communism were shattered. The urban population at least is disillusioned. Farmers, slower to change, will likely side ultimately with urban intellectuals moving toward democracy. (JB)",

        "description":"A review of the literature revealed that control (or placebo) vignettes are not used in numerous studies in all areas that employ vignette-based methodology, which is a serious methodological and theoretical flaw. The nature of this flaw and its methodological and theoretical importance is outlined in this paper, as well as procedures and a model for developing control vignettes. Two studies on the degree to which nurse professionals are perceived to be at fault when assaulted by patients are reported which employ control vignettes. In the first study, the use of control vignettes produced better and more objective validation of the assault vignettes than previously available in the literature. In the second study, female and male nurses were blamed as much for the incident that  occurred with the patient in the control vignette as they were in the severe assault vignette, but they were blamed more in the mild assault vignette than they were in either the control or severe assault vignette. Female nurses, however, were blamed more than male nurses for the incident in the control and severe assault vignette, but not in the mild assault vignette. These complex findings are shown to fit the non-linear elliptic umbilic model of catastrophe theory, and not the linear models and interpretations of these variables currently in the literature. These significant and important results would not have been found if control vignettes had not been used. (Author)",

Rural young women in home and school are conditioned to accept outdated role definitions and may be limited in career and life choices by restricted access to technology and their perception of the female role in technology. In 1988-89, a year long in-service training program was developed for Kansas teachers to enable them to provide gender equitable, quality computer education in upper elementary and middle school classrooms. Designed primarily for schools in rural areas, the classroom segment was divided into two sections: a primary computer content section using Logo Writer, database building, lesson plans involving software, the computer language BASIC, and telecommunications  software; the gender equity training section utilized the book, &quot;Neuter Computer&quot; (Sanders and Stone, 1986). An evaluation was conducted to assess the effects of the program on skills and attitudes of teachers and students. The results showed teachers had more equitable attitudes and female students showed increased use and enjoyment of the computer. (NL)",

        "description":"This examination of education in late antiquity looks at the variable definitions of literacy, the function of elite literacy as a scarce and highly valued commodity, and the nature of the relationship between the cultural elite and Christianity. A basic definition of a literate person is one who can read and write in his or her society's standard language but, in fact, various classes of literacy existed in antiquity, and literacy held a high place in the competition for esteem among the elite. Schools of grammar and rhetoric were exclusive in their social organization; there was no single system of primary and secondary schools, but different types of schools that served different population groups. Massive illiteracy existed among the public at large and the &quot;Schools of  Letters,&quot; which served this population and supposedly provided basic literacy, ranked low in prestige. The elite or &quot;Liberal Schools,&quot; insulated those who had access to them from the lower orders; their teachers received both higher fees and wider legal privileges than did others. Prior to the third century, Christians claimed that the culture of the &quot;letterati&quot; was symbolic of false values and showed no care for inner truth. However, after the fourth century, the opening up of the Christian community in the East meant that the literary culture came to be regarded as less of a divisive force; the Western church, on the other hand, still saw itself as an alien body in a dangerous environment.

Looking at nations that share a common British educational tradition, a study done in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe asked which topics and categories of cultural knowledge were essential for the development of a national cultural literacy. Another concern was whether one ethnic group or a mosaic of groups would be represented in the revised curriculum, and how African states could identify content for syllabuses that supported national unity in countries that were characterized by ethnic diversity. All four countries had centralized educational systems with national primary and secondary school curricula that were  considered the best indicators of what was taught in the schools. Using a process of content analysis, each syllabus topic was separated and recategorized into broad categories, and then into smaller ones. A chart of topics was developed by quantifying the attention the topic received in the syllabus, and then looking for major priorities, exceptions, and questions. Customs, beliefs, and government were found to be universal priorities, although the emphasis varied among countries. The study showed that there is considerable variance in the way social studies builds a national cultural literacy, and each country held different views on what common knowledge their youth should share.

Scholars predicted that when a critical mass of 30 to 35 percent women reached management level they would automatically be accepted; however, studies of Fortune 500 show this not to be true. Women were excluded by the rhetoric of male power codes because women communicated differently, because the perception existed they did not fit into the structure, and because women made men feel uncomfortable and anxious. Women entering certain discourse communities were automatically assigned specific behaviors that limited discourse. It was found in an  analysis of the Bell System and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company cases before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the entering position determined the future position, and women were precluded from discourse with upper echelon members of the community who promoted and gave recognition. Using military and sports jargon in professional communities created discourse codes that largely excluded women. This linguistic exclusion limited the ability of women to communicate their performances to the upper level corporate structure. (NL)",

        "description":"Recently there has been a growing concern about the decline in academic achievement among students as modern schools have moved to more non-academic functions. William Torrey Harris was an early education reformer whose ideas are now proving relevant to the problems currently facing education. Harris entered the field of education in the 1850s when the curriculum for the early years of schooling was limited to the &quot;three R's&quot; with mathematics and classical languages added later. The belief was that the purpose of school was to foster the development of reason and that required imparting universal ideas and principles. Harris became a member of the influential Committee of Ten in 1893. The Committee was responsible for the inclusion of modern subjects in the high school  curriculum. Harris believed the wisdom of Western civilization was divided into five branches: (1) arithmetic and mathematics, (2) geography, (3) history, (4) grammar, and (5) English literature. Harris felt that the purpose of schooling was to foster the development of reason and to impart universal ideas and principles instead of isolated, unrelated facts. He became president of the National Education Association in 1875, and was United States Commissioner of Education from 1889-1906. Harris was a founder of &quot;The Journal of Speculative Philosophy,&quot; the most important U.S. philosophy publication of its time. (NL)",

Using a theoretical model of the demand for schooling and the principle of compensating variations, this study calculated parental willingness to pay for new secondary schools in rural areas of Peru.

Whether used in general cultural literacy, lighthearted Trivial Pursuit, educational sixth grade social studies, or serious debates on world events, place names and their locations are assumed to be known. At the college level of world regional geography courses, five books with lists of place names are in print by geographers: Fuson; MacKinnon; Pontius and Woodward; DiLisio; and Stoltman. Those five sources plus place name lists by P.S. Anderson and from Hirsch reveal similarities and diversities in their content. A core list of place names is presented with several cross-classifications by region, type of geographic feature,  and grade level of students. The results reveal a logical progression of complexity that could assist geography educators to increase student learning and avoid duplication of efforts. There will never be complete agreement about any listing of the core geographical place names, but the presented lists are intended to stimulate discussion along constructive avenues. (Author)",

        "description":"A description is given of the development, implementation, and evaluation of the Curriculum Management System (CMS), a computer managed system that utilizes input from research findings on effective schools. The goals and objectives of instruction are clearly delineated and effectively communicated to students and their parents. Each student, teacher, and parent receives a computer generated plan of study every 2 weeks which specifies the goals, objectives, and learning activities to be used with each student. Each plan of study is individualized to accommodate the student's developmental level as determined by criterion referenced tests. As the scores of the criterion referenced tests are entered into the CMS, the system automatically builds a plan of study. The CMS encourages  high expectations for student achievement and makes it reasonable to have high expectations because each student is working on mastering content which is at the appropriate level. Parents receive highly detailed computer generated reports every 2 weeks informing them of the student's progress. Teachers are enabled to identify objectives which have or have not been mastered at an acceptable level for each student. (JD)",

A number of proposals are made concerning the future of daily physical education in schools. Two points in particular are emphasized. The first is that the quality and appropriateness of the research that has underpinned the establishment of daily physical education in Australia and other countries, and its bias towards fitness development, need to be questioned. The second is the need to move beyond innovations that rely solely on curriculum materials to create change and, instead, to incorporate these materials into a system that places at its center the professional development of teachers and emphasizes the reflective and critical practice of teaching physical  education.

        "description":"Pupil control (discipline) takes on different forms in different schools, and among different teachers in the same school. Pupil control has been described as existing along a continuum from humanistic to custodial. The prototype of the custodial orientation is the school that provides a rigid and highly controlled setting concerned primarily with the maintenance of order. The humanistic orientation, on the other hand, conceives of the school as an educational community in which the students learn through cooperative interaction and experience. Research studies have found that teacher-pupil control ideology is an accurate predictor of the tone or climate of the school. Humanism in teacher-pupil control ideology has been found to be significantly related to a desirable school  climate, while schools with a custodial orientation have been found to have teachers with low morale and low job and social needs satisfaction. It has also been found that the more custodial the orientation of the school, the lower the students' self-concept as learners. Besides pupil control ideology and pupil control behavior, two related school climate constructs are considered: open-closed and environmental robustness. (JD)",

The first, Cruikshank's Reflective Teaching Model, sees reflective teaching as the ability to analyze one's own teaching practices. Schon's \"Reflection in Action,\" on the other hand, argues that the professional practitioner is one who can think while acting and thus respond to the uncertainty, uniqueness, and conflict involved in the situations in which professionals practice. The third perspective toward reflective teacher education, the work of Zeichner, posits three levels of reflection: technical elements, situational and institutional contexts, and moral and ethical issues. The three models are described and compared, with references to other studies and theories on reflection. Teaching  strategies intended to facilitate the development of reflection are discussed. These strategies are seen as ways to promote critical inquiry among preservice teachers. (JD)",

The purpose of the research, therefore, is to assess AASCU institutions' compliance with selected NCATE criteria in categories II, III, and IV (World of Practice, Students, and Faculty) which relate to: (1) relationships with graduates, (2) admission, (3) monitoring progress, (4) completion of the program, (5) faculty qualifications and assignments, and (6) faculty load. Results show,  primarily, that few institutions (10 percent) have first-year assistance programs in place at the master's level, many institutions (22 percent) do nothing at the master's level to attract minority candidates, and institutions with student populations of less than 10,000 appear to have a serious faculty load problem.

Six regional centers are located across the state so that UNI can geographically touch all areas of the state.

During the tutoring period, the preservice teacher engages in inquiry about the student who is being tutored, the student's social and cultural contexts, and the school context. The teachers seek to understand the student's perception of school, teachers, parents, and other students. They are encouraged to learn as much as  possible from the students and to compare these learnings with their own life situations in a series of story telling protocols. Critical and reflective thinking about the contextual discrepancies between home and school is stimulated through seminar sessions, journal writings, and anecdotal records. (JD)",

A discussion of the elements within this context includes analyses of future economic factors, the need for enlightened citizens, and the educational context which includes both political and demographic factors. Consideration of the demographic factors brings up the point of the incipient teacher shortage in Canada and a discussion of what schools of education can and should or should not do in training future teachers. Dismissing the possibility of flooding the schools with inferior, hastily trained teachers, the point is made that educational technology opens possibilities for an innovative but  smaller teaching force to educate and motivate students. The availability of excellent educational television hardware is pointed out as one means for supporting and enhancing the teacher's work. (JD)",

The TOT project provided live direct observations via television broadcasts from classrooms located in five central Iowa public school districts. Twenty teachers, grades K-8, participated as broadcast teachers during the 3-year project. The remote control camera is operated by a faculty facilitator who helps to place the unedited observations into the perspective of the classroom proceedings. Begun in 1982, the project was expanded to include 20 classrooms from five school districts. Curriculum in the Department of Elementary Education  at Iowa State University has been significantly modified to infuse observation experiences into preservice teacher preparation. A course manual focuses on observation of nine teaching behaviors; students observe TOT during an associated lab course, Strategies Practicum, for examples of these behaviors. A pre- and post-observation interview with each classroom teacher emphasizes teacher diversity and grade level content. (JD)",

Students indicated that they believed they learned equal amounts in each class, but there was a significant difference in their perceptions of the instructor's knowledge.

In a separate study of first and second graders learning to jump rope, to use an overhand throw, and to strike with a paddle, similar results  were found. Students with Motor Process instruction acquired skills to a greater extent than did students with traditional instruction. The Motor Process group spent significantly more time on task and had a higher rate of repetition of skills. (JD)",

The development of adequate services for the disabled in Australia is influenced by the principles of normalization--the use of culturally valued means in order to enable, establish, and/or maintain valued social roles for people. It is appropriate, therefore, to evaluate client programs within a framework of these principles. This report outlines the instruments and methodology of a recent attempt to evaluate recreation programs in a large Australian nursing home and concludes with a need for caution on the application of universal evaluation instruments.

Participants in the study were 303 expert and 136 student teachers. Data were obtained by using the questionnaires, \"Situations\" and \"Sense of Efficacy.\" As expected, student teachers and expert teachers with a high sense of self-efficacy produced more confrontive and fewer permissive reaction-intentions than did student and expert teachers with a low sense of self-efficacy. In contrast to other studies in this area, however, expert and student teachers show no differences in the number of produced reaction-units.

Three epistemological attitudes regarding time were used as categories for the analysis of the interviews: (1) time can be influenced; (2) time can be seen as a problem; and (3) time can modify teaching plans. When time is influenced, the teacher acts upon it; when time becomes a problem or when it modifies the teaching plan, the teacher passively submits to time. Analysis of the interviews indicates that the teacher's attitude toward time seems to vary according to individual profiles without being necessarily connected to experience or professional competency. However, the expert teacher was found to have greater facility in managing instructional time.  In other words, expert teachers have a greater ability to improvise, modify the teaching plan, and use different rhythms as needed. Submission to time remains the most important feature for both novice and expert teachers. This finding indicates that set curricula and programs assume too much importance and are not based on teacher input about what can and cannot be accomplished in a given amount of time. Instructional design has forgotten the language of practice. Excerpts from some interviews are included. (AMH)",

Participants in the study were 129 college students randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. The theses of the study were that flow diagrams are a more effective presentation type for cyclical information than texts, and that each presentation type, when used in conjuction with instructive questions, will enhance the learning of verbal chains. Evaluation of comprehension tests following different types of presentations and questioning techniques indicated that flow diagrams were more effective  than texts in presenting this kind of information. Also, instructive questions did not enhance the learning effectiveness of the presentation type. No significant differences were found between males and females or between different college majors.

These sites differ in terms of community setting, socioeconomic characteristics of students, and grade levels taught. The sites provide an opportunity for student teachers to work in diverse settings. Six elementary schools chosen as clinical training sites represent urban and suburban systems. Two of the schools are racially balanced, located in middle-income areas, but also serving students from very low-income families. A third school is over 95 percent minority and located in a low middle-income residential area. The fourth is an inner city school, 100 percent minority, serving low-income students from public housing  projects. One suburban school is located in an affluent community, and the second serves a community ranging from low-middle to upper-middle socioeconomic status. Many student teachers complete experiences in two sites. This paper discusses three areas of the initiative: the factors contributing to establishing these clinical training sites, observed trends and preliminary findings, and perspectives on the model.

        "description":"The oral proficiency scale of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language (ACTFL) and the Educational Testing Service is reviewed as an instrument for measuring the levels of language proficiency for college undergraduates and high school students. The scale is a modification of the U.S. Government's Foreign Service Institute Scale, and its suitability for use in the schools has not been established. It is not clear to what extent the scale's progression reflects cognitive growth. However, the scale has been endorsed as part of the movement toward oral proficiency testing in the schools, a movement encouraged by the &quot;Guidelines&quot; of the ACTFL. It is contended here that it would be premature to discard the proficiency test altogether, but further research into its  applicability for school settings is necessary. The positive effects that the proficiency movement has had on teaching cannot be ignored, but there is no necessary link between: (1) use of the oral proficiency test and a focus on communicative language teaching; and (2) meaningful language use.

        "description":"During the Spring of 1989, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction field-tested a geometry proof performance assessment as a component of the High School End-of-Course Testing Program (EoC). The existing geometry EoC test consisted only of multiple-choice items. The performance assessment was added to the multiple-choice component to form a more &quot;authentic&quot; assessment of student performance. Focus was on determining the reliability of the scoring process and the cost of adding a performance assessment to the existing geometry test. The sample for the proofs and the comprehensive geometry multiple-choice test was over 43,000 students, who comprised the entire statewide enrollment in North Carolina in geometry classes. The separate 32-item proofs field test was  administered to 875 students. A high degree of consistency was found between the ratings assigned by two readers when perfect and adjacent agreement findings were analyzed. The estimated cost of conducting the performance assessment was 3.00 dollars per student (2.44 dollars for school year 1990). The educational significance of using this process for developing authentic assessment strategies is discussed. Eight tables contain study data. Appendices provide North Carolina geometry goals/objectives; rated samples of geometry proofs and the score scale; percentage of students receiving each score on the 1988-89 Geometry Proof Field Test; statistics for proof scores and grades and geometry proof focused-holistic score scale distribution; a summary of teacher assigned proof grades and  geometry proof scores; sample school system disaggregate report; and teacher survey data.

These include: (1) the approach of P. A. Games and J. F. Howell (1976); (2) C. W. Dunnett's C confidence interval (1980); and (3) Dunnett's T3 solution (1980). These procedures control the overall risk of a Type I error experimentwise at approximately the nominal significance level and have the best statistical power among alternative solutions. The two-stage multiple comparison procedures of Y. Hochberg and A. C. Tamhane (1987), and R. R. Wilcox (1987) are also discussed. These procedures and the Tukey-Kramer procedure were applied to data from a study of the effects of exercise on psychological and physiological variables  with a total of 36 subjects. Textbooks and a sample of research studies were reviewed to determine the most frequently taught and used multiple comparison procedures. This review indicates that most applied researchers are not aware of the alternative solutions when variances differ. It is suggested that the Games-Howell procedure will provide a valid test for most purposes and should be included in statistical methods textbooks and classes. Four tables present data from the application and the reviews. (SLD)",

        "description":"The use of a generative and evaluative computerized prompting framework to improve the teaching of writing skills was studied with 164 children in grades 6, 7, and 8 with high or low writing skills, who were randomly assigned to control or treatment groups. The treatment group received computer prompts, think sheet scaffolds, and expert modeling of writing prompts. Dimensional and holistic assessment of written products, internalization of writing control strategies as measured by the Index of Writing Awareness (IWA) (an instrument developed to measure cognition about writing), open-ended questions, and a prompt sort task failed to show any advantage from treatment. Students' holistic scores were, however, significantly correlated with their awareness of writing skills. Keystroke  analysis indicated that the availability of prompts seemed to lower the number of changes students made during the writing process. Differences in holistic performance, IWA performance, metacognitive guidance in writing, surface revisions, and repositioning within papers between grades 6 and 7 were not found between grades 7 and 8, suggesting that a developmental change had occurred between grades 6 and 7, and that procedural assistance may be most appropriate in grade 6.

        "description":"Teachers from six California school districts were interviewed about their attitudes regarding peer evaluation and the reasons behind those attitudes. Three of the districts were represented by a bargaining agent for the California Federation of Teachers (CFT) and three had California Teachers Association (CTA) representation. Chosen to represent a cross-section, 15 teachers from each district were interviewed; focus was on identifying teachers who might be expected to be active in their teacher unions and who might have influence on the views of their colleagues/peers. For each district and for each question from the semi-structured interview schedule, a mean response was computed. A mean for all districts and the standard deviation of those means were then calculated. The  district means were tested for significance differences from that composite mean. Results indicate that: teachers would be more open to peer review if the structure of evaluation was changed from the present structure; teachers represented by the CTA tended to be more distrustful of administration; professionalism is a real interest of many teachers, particularly those not nearing retirement; and opposition to peer review is no longer the monolith of years past. In general, when teachers have no access to peer evaluation, they tend to be opposed to the idea. Interview questions are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"A science laboratory skills performance assessment for elementary and secondary school science teachers in California, using a multi-methods approach, is described. Seven domains of teacher performance identified included: pedagogy, content, materials and equipment, management, knowledge of students, climate, and communication. Within each domain, between two and nine elements/categories of performance were identified. For each element, indicators that describe specific teacher knowledge, skills, and behaviors were written for use in assessing performance. Student behaviors that reflect teacher performance in certain areas were included as part of some indicators. Domains, elements, and indicators are the basis of the assessment. The primary data collection method used was  observation; other methods used include interviews and questionnaires. Selection and education of observers insures a contingent of experienced, well-trained evaluators. The 2-day training includes review of the evaluation technique; role play; and group review of procedures, guidelines, and videotapes of acceptable and unacceptable performance levels. Trainers assess each trainee on properly conducting a conference, using prompts and recording responses, recording evidence and notes properly for the observation, sorting the information by elements in a reasonable manner, making sound remarks and judgments based on the information, and filling in forms in a clear and complete manner.

Information was further gathered through telephone calls and a review of the instruments and supporting documents from the states. Commercial tests in use, particularly in middle schools, were examined. It was determined that state science assessments are not a driving force in directing the curriculum or  instructional practice toward the goals of science education reform. State assessments varied so widely that their effects on a national science direction were questionable. The content of the assessments was generally not consistent with the AAAS reform goals, and the process aspects of the standardized tests were weak to non-existent.

This instrument is to be used in a large, ongoing research project investigating the underpinnings of student study activities and effects on academic achievement. The computer-administered instrument used--the Study Activity Questionnaire (SAQ)--is based on hierarchical models of the cognitive processing and effort management activities involved in academic study. Item types associated with different levels and dimensions of cognitive and effort management hierarchies for routine study and test preparation study were constructed. The SAQ was administered, using a microcomputer, to 235 students enrolled in 14 general biology courses at 7 high schools  in the San Francisco Bay area. Results provide insights into the amount of time students engaged in study, allocation of study time, types of activities performed, and focus of cognitive activities. Data concerning students' engagement in the hierarchical study activities are encouraging. The patterns of responses reported for the routine context and the test preparation context were similar. However, the small differences that were found may be important to the extent that students change the character of their study practices in response to specific contextual factors, goals, purposes, or demands. It appears that the design of the SAQ and the microcomputer administration procedure have a great deal of potential for assessment and diagnostics.

Partitioning the error component into a person component, an item-person interaction component, and a random unexplained error component has the net effect of reducing the error variance and improving statistical prediction and classification efficiency. The specific goal of this study is to determine the possibility of using the Item and Person Analysis Rasch Model (IPARM) to correct a person's score to eliminate person disturbances. The United States Air Force Placement and Validation Examination was administered to 1,200 freshmen entering the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs; the French  language portion of the test was used. Test data were analyzed using IPARM to identify individual response disturbances and to estimate each person's true score. IPARM can assess item disturbances as well as person disturbances, but this study focused on the latter. Essentially, IPARM uses a person's total score to establish statistical expectancies for each item the individual attempted. Test result correlations with French grades and class rankings indicated that the IPARM-based corrections are useful for improvement of prediction and classification. (TJH)",

An expanded version of the Stanford Research Institute's cost model was used to fit a broad conceptualization that enabled school districts with differing accounting systems to follow a methodologically sound approach to costing a YRE program. Worksheets based on the model were input into a computer as a series of electronic spreadsheets. Six school districts in southern California piloted the model. Results indicate that the model worked and was adaptable to school districts' differing accounting systems, but that differences across school policies demanded redefinition of the original  assumptions of the model. Pilot data enabled researchers to validate the cost model and to derive a set of normative scenario assumptions. The model covered capital, operations, transition costs, special revenue, total costs and savings, student enrollment, and per pupil costs and savings.

Assumptions about the semiotic process of constructing, describing, and judging reality are examined in terms of the viability of the process in explicating a perception-based evaluation model. Models from which inspiration was drawn include R. W. Tyler's instructional objectives model; M. Provus' discrepancy model; the Context, Input, Process, and Product model; M. Scriven's Goal-Free model; and R. E. Stake's model of evaluation. Five core evaluation signs are analyzed in terms of a recently completed case study of perception-based evaluation of a cross-national cultural awareness training program funded by an international foundation. Finally, a semiotic analysis for evaluation studies is discussed in terms  of 13 Likert-scaled polemics. It is concluded that evaluation should be approached as both a native undertaking and an alien undertaking, and from an insider viewpoint and a disciplined outsider perspective. What is needed is a paradigm that negotiates major questions openly with all participants, gathers quantitative and qualitative scores of evidence, and applies standards or value criteria that are neither elitist from the perspective of the evaluator nor captured by the tacit agendas of the stakeholders.

        "description":"Two-stage sampling procedures for comparing two population means when variances are heterogeneous have been developed by D. G. Chapman (1950) and B. K. Ghosh (1975). Both procedures assume sampling from populations that are normally distributed. The present study reports on the effect that sampling from non-normal distributions has on Type I error rates, statistical power, and sample size requirements. Four factors were manipulated in the simulation study: (1) distribution shape; (2) degree of variance heterogeneity; (3) initial sample size; and (4) difference in population means. For each condition, 1,000 replications were performed, and the frequency of rejecting the null hypothesis was recorded. The results indicate that Ghosh's procedure is less sensitive to non-normal  distributions, but can be liberal when sampling from distributions that are skewed and have a small initial sample size. Average sample sizes needed remained constant across distribution shapes, but greater variability was found with heavy-tailed distributions. Moderate to large sample sizes at the first stage of sampling can reduce the overall total sample size needed and can minimize the inflated Type I error rate in situations where the sampled distributions are extremely non-normal.

        "description":"Concern over the validity of statistical tests performed on data that may not satisfy underlying assumptions has prompted methodological researchers to perform Monte Carlo studies for frequently used tests. Unfortunately, these studies appear to have had little impact on methodological practice. One reason is the lack of an overarching framework to guide the interpretation of Monte Carlo studies for the same test. Another is the impressionistic nature of these studies, which can lead different readers to different conclusions. These shortcomings can be addressed using quantitative methods of research synthesis (e.g., meta-analysis) to summarize the results of Monte Carlo studies for a statistical test. In this paper, these methods are applied to a sample of Monte Carlo studies of  the F-test in the oneway fixed-effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The present analyses were based on Monte Carlo studies reported in 21 out of 30 journal articles. The results provide empirical support for the robustness of the Type I error rate of the F-test to certain assumption violations. However, the Type I error rate of the F-test was noticeably affected by unequal variances, even when sample sizes were equal. Recommendations for using this test when certain assumptions are violated are made. Four data tables and one bar graph are included. (Author/TJH)",

These shortcomings can be addressed using meta-analytic methods to summarize the results of Monte Carlo studies. Summarizing Monte Carlo studies in this fashion will generate guidelines for the appropriate use of particular statistical tests under specific assumption violations, and will allow an evaluation  of the validity of the statistical results of previously published studies. This paper provides a methodological framework for, and an example of, quantitatively summarizing empirical Type I error and power values from Monte Carlo studies. The four-step summarization strategy covers problem formulation, data collection, data evaluation, and data analysis and interpretation. The example of a quantitative summary involves seven Monte Carlo studies of the parametric Bartlett test of the quality of independent variances. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"Recent trends in achievement test scores among elementary and secondary school students in Iowa are examined. Form 7 of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) was used to measure the achievement of students in grades 3 and 7; and Form X-7 of the Iowa Tests of Educational Development (ITED) was used for 11th graders. These grade levels were chosen because they correspond most closely to the age groups for which the disturbing results were received from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). ITBS scores of Iowa third and seventh graders in 1978-79 were compared with those of students in the same grades in 1984-85; ITED scores of 11th graders from 1979-80 and 1985-86 were likewise compared. At each grade level in each of the selected school years, data for over 5,000  students were analyzed. Findings of the study are somewhat at odds with those of the NAEP. Specifically, the Iowa study indicated that: (1) although increases in scores are generally greater for low-scoring students, high-scoring students in Iowa showed substantial improvements across the years; (2) no practical differences appeared in the changes in performance for higher-level versus lower-level skills; and (3) students' performance increased on all types of items. Discrepancies with the NAEP study may have resulted from typically higher achievement test scores by Iowa students, the general lack of uniformity of achievement score trends, and differences in data analysis. Twelve data tables are included. (TJH)",

The results provide support for the following three hypotheses: (1) disengagement adversely affects achievement; (2) procedural engagement has an attenuated relationship to achievement because its observable indicators conflate procedural and substantive engagement; and (3)  substantive engagement has a strong, positive effect on achievement. Features of substantively engaged instruction include authentic questions or questions that have no prespecified answers; uptake or the incorporation of previous answers into subsequent questions; and high-level teacher evaluation or teacher certification and incorporation of student responses in subsequent discussion. Each of these features is noteworthy because it involves reciprocal interaction and negotiation between students and teachers, which is said to be the hallmark of substantive engagement.

All subjects were Black or Hispanic and were about to enter grade 11. For problems involving solving simultaneous equations in two unknowns and distance-rate-time relationships, sets of problems were developed that varied in the symbolic form of the problem presented and of the response required. Approximately half of the problems were open-ended; the other half were multiple-choice. Data on teacher instructional methods came from the printed materials used by teachers, student notes, and interviews with  teachers. Results indicate that: (1) sole use of conventional symbolic representations provides a limited picture of students' problem-solving abilities; (2) students' difficulties in translating symbolic representations can be understood by systematically varying the symbolic form of problem and response required; (3) using alternative symbolic forms of the required response may be a good means of measuring students' conceptual understanding of mathematics; and (4) types of translation between symbolic forms during instruction did not seem to play a major role.

        "description":"Some of the frustrations inherent in trying to incorporate qualifications of statistical results into meta-analysis are reviewed, and some solutions are proposed to prevent the loss of information in meta-analytic reports. The validity of a meta-analysis depends on several factors, including the: thoroughness of the literature search; selection of studies for inclusion; appropriate coding and analysis of studies; and report format selected. The solution proposed to the problem of methodological quality is to include all selected studies and report an average effect size for the aggregate. The report on the meta-analysis then should be a qualitative, discursive argument rather than a simple statistic. Proposals for putting the \"but\" back in meta-analysis are: (1) assure that it is  not a substitute for qualitative review; (2) offer the reader information necessary to evaluate the validity of decisions made at the individual level; and (3) assure that qualifications of studies are not excluded from the analysis. A thorough quantitative review should include: a discursive review of each study; a report on how each effect size was calculated; the location of the summary statistics upon which each effect size was based; and a discussion of study limitations and the factors that affect validity of effect size.

Focus is on comparing aggregate impacts of State Bill (SB) 65 and of California Local Educational Reform Network (C-LERN) approaches to high school dropout reduction and prevention between 1985-86 and 1987-88. Four groups of California high schools are compared: schools that have received funding through the SB 65 Motivation and Maintenance program, schools that have contracted with Sage Analytics to become a part of the C-LERN process, a small group of schools that are both SB 65 and C-LERN schools, and a comparison group of schools that met the criteria for SB 65 participation but were not funded. All schools were among California's poorest, and  consistently score poorly in terms of both standardized tests and rates at which students leave school. The high schools in which SB 65 programs operate average about 53% Hispanic, 15% Black, and 18% White students. C-LERN programs operate in high schools that average about 35% Hispanic, 39% Black, and 6% White students. Of note was the apparent failure of schools that have instituted both C-LERN and SB 65 programs. Nevertheless, either program, adopted without the other, seems to have different but essentially positive effects on school dropout rates. An explanation for this outcome lies in conflicting sets of assumptions each program makes about school culture and organization. Fifteen data tables are included. (TJH)",

S. Shrauger and T. J. Schoeneman (1979) found no evidence for such agreement. In the present investigation, the Self Description Questionnaire III (SDQIII) was completed by 151 Australian and 941 Canadian university students and by significant others selected by students as the person in the world who knew them best. Self/other agreement on each of the 13 SDQIII scales was very high for Australians and Canadians. Guidelines for evaluating multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) data and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach strongly support convergent and discriminant validity. An important new  extension of the MTMM CFA approach to multistudy data showed that all parameter estimates were reasonably invariant (i.e., equal) for Australians and Canadians. This self/other agreement is much higher than found elsewhere and its replication across two continents dramatically refutes the Shrauger and Schoeneman conclusion. Critical features leading to this high self/other agreement appear to be the use of older subjects, multiple dimensions of self-concept based on instruments with strong psychometric properties, and significant others who know the subject very well.

        "description":"Factor analyses of student evaluations of teaching effectiveness were conducted for 24,158 courses at the University of Southern California and for each of 21 different subgroups derived from the total group. All classes evaluated by six or more students were included in the study. The subgroups were designed to differ in terms of instructor level (teaching assistants or regular faculty), course level (undergraduate or graduate), and academic discipline. The same 9 factors that the Student Evaluation of Educational Quality instrument was designed to measure were consistently identified in each of the 22 different factor analyses, and all factor structures were remarkably well-defined and consistent. Correlations between factor scores based on the total group factor analysis and  the 21 subgroup factor analyses were very high, and most were greater than 0.99. Because of the large number and diversity of classes in this study, the results provide stronger support for the generality of the factor structure underlying students' evaluations of teaching effectiveness than does any previous research. Five data tables are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"The purposes of the present investigation are to evaluate a new, adaptive procedure for assessing multiple dimensions of self-concept for children younger than 8 years and to examine related theoretical issues. The multidimensional, hierarchical structure of self-concept is well established for older children, but there is a paucity of research and appropriate instruments for very young children. A limited amount of research suggests that self-concept is poorly differentiated and that a general self-concept may not even exist. A sample of 501 students in kindergarten and first and second grades in Sydney (Australia) completed a variation of the Self-Description Questionnaire I (SDQI) using a new individual interview technique. At each grade level, confirmatory factor analyses  identified all eight SDQI scales, including the general self-concept scale. With increasing age, the fit of the eight-factor model improved, and the size of correlations among the eight SDQI scales decreased, implying that self-concept becomes more differentiated with age. The results demonstrate that appropriately measured self-concepts are much better differentiated for very young children than previously assumed. A 55-item list of references and seven data tables are included. (Author/TJH)",

In school districts associated with Fresno, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, and San Jose Unified School Districts, 7,475 students classified themselves as Asian, Pacific Islander, or Filipino. However, because only 5,821 of these students further classified themselves into one of the 10 aforementioned API subgroups, all analyses are based on the latter sample. Strong relationships were found between performance on the CAP reading and written  expression subtests and the following set of variables: (1) the generation in the United States to which they belong; (2) parents' education; (3) English fluency; and (4) hours spent on homework. Even when these variables were taken into account, there remained several large differences among and within ethnic groups on their performance in the different skill areas on the test. Results indicate that California API eighth graders are extremely diverse in their reading and written expression performance, a situation clearly related to variables such as ethnic-group membership, generation in the United States, English fluency, and skill area measured.

The field study data were analyzed to address measurement error, content coverage and reading load, and student motivation. A follow-up study used data from 361 community college freshmen and sophomore students who had taken the October 1989 or March 1990 paper-and-pencil version of  the CLAST but had not yet received their scores; these subjects were administered the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, as well as the CAT form of the CLAST. The follow-up study failed to replicate the difference in mean scores for the computer adaptive and paper-and-pencil versions of the reading test that were found in the preliminary analysis.

A comparison of scores on the 35 items to performance on a self-regulated performance task--the Voluntary Homework System (VHS), developed by B. W. Tuckman and T. L.

The latter scale correlated at 0.29  with VHS scores. A subsequent factor analysis of scores of a sample of 183 subjects from the same population on the 35-item scale yielded a single-factor structure and a condensed scale of 16 items with a reliability of 0.86.

Using a structured thematic apperception technique (the TEMAS Apperception Test of G. Costantino et al., 1988) to measure attention to pictorial stimuli depicting characters, events, settings, and covert psychological conflicts, a study was conducted with 163 normal Hispanic, Black, and White school-age children and 95 Hispanic, Black, and White child and adolescent outpatients with AD-HD. The AD-HD children were significantly more likely than were the normal children to omit information in the stimuli about characters, events,  settings, and psychological conflicts. Differences between the groups were large and persistent in the presence of structured inquiries by the test examiners. Results suggest the potential utility of structured thematic apperception techniques for the assessment of AD-HD to facilitate clinical (DSM-III-R) diagnosis and to invite closer scrutiny in carefully controlled validity studies.

LISREL programs were written for each of six models to be tested. The PC version of LISREL VII was used to estimate the models. Assessments of results were based on average parameter estimates for each model across replications, average chi-square value across replications, modification indices for errors of  omission, and t-values for errors of inclusion. Results indicate that minor misspecifications in LISREL measurement models in the LY matrix are the most problematic, particularly for compound errors.

The least discriminating options were deleted to create 3-option and 4-option test formats from the original 5-option per item test. Students were placed into ability groups using grade point average (GPA) cutoffs. The GPAs were the criterion for the validity coefficients. Significant differences were found between reliability coefficients for 3- and 5-option formats for low ability students. Non-significant differences were found between reliability coefficients for high or  average ability students. The optimum number of options across ability groups was three. None of the validity coefficients followed the trend expected. The results are part of the mounting evidence suggesting the efficacy of the 3-option item. Five tables present study data.

The procedures both maintain an experimentwise error rate at or below alpha, but differ in the manner in which they test the contrast with the largest observed difference. One approach proceeds directly to the test of the contrast with the largest difference at a reduced significance level. The other is a protected procedure, first evaluating the complete null hypothesis with an omnibus &quot;F&quot; test, and then proceeding to test the specific hypotheses at a more liberal significance level given that the complete null hypothesis has been rejected. Monte Carlo simulation results for three and four treatment groups indicate that the relative power  of the two procedures depends on the configuration of the treatment effects contained in all contrasts. Specifically, the unprotected test favors configurations with relatively small amounts of variability due to treatment effects, while the protected test has more power in cases with a relatively large amount of treatment variability.

In stepwise regression, variables are added or deleted from a model in sequence to produce a final &quot;good&quot; or &quot;best&quot; predictive model. Stepwise computer programs are discussed and four different variable selection strategies are described. These strategies include the forward method, backward method, forward stepwise method, and backward stepwise method. General and specific criticisms of the stepwise method in the literature are outlined, and misuses of the method are considered. Although most statisticians would agree that stepwise methods should not be used when an explanatory model is desired, it is common to see research articles where explanatory interpretations are given to a model that is called a&quot;prediction&quot; model. Stepwise methods should not be used to determine the number of variables in the final model. When model selection is being performed, the stepwise method can be helpful if: the initial choice of variables is conducted based on theory, the defaults are not used automatically, more than one run is done using different variable selection methods, and the final model is chosen through an intelligent process rather than automatically using the final model generated by the computer program. Three tables and outlines of the models described are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"The cognitive processes in a widely used, non-verbal test of analytic intelligence--the Raven Progressive Matrices Test (J. C. Raven, 1962)--were analyzed. The analysis determined which processes distinguished between higher-scoring and lower-scoring subjects and which processes were common to all subjects and all items on the test. The analysis was based on detailed performance characteristics on the Tower of Hanoi puzzle such as verbal protocols, eye fixation patterns, and errors. The theory was expressed as a pair of computer simulation models--FAIRAVEN and BETTERAVEN--that performed like the median or best subjects in the samples of 12 and 22 college students. The processing characteristic common to all subjects was an incremental, reiterative strategy for encoding and  inducing the regularities in each problem. The processes that distinguished among individuals were primarily the ability to induce abstract relations and the ability to manage dynamically a large set of problem-solving goals in working memory. Five sample test items, 3 tables, 12 figures, an appendix summarizing correct solutions by the models, and a 59-item list of references are included. (SLD)",

        "description":"Calibration, defined as the accuracy with which students can predict their own performance, was studied. The role of feedback in the development of calibration was examined, and questions of whether better calibration was associated with better performance and more efficient study were explored. Subjects were 136 college students in an introductory educational psychology class. Before each of four examinations, students were asked what percentage of the multiple-choice questions they expected to answer correctly and how long they had studied. After each examination, the students were asked how satisfied they were with their performance, the extent to which they attributed performance to stable or temporary causes, and how much they planned to study for the next test. Students  lowered their expectations somewhat over the semester, although they maintained about the same level of satisfaction and stability of attributions. They planned to study slightly less as the semester progressed. Feedback did improve calibration. Among students of the same age making the same course grade, those who were well calibrated had better grades on unit examinations. Better calibration was associated with more efficient study habits. Four tables present the results of the study. (SLD)",

A review of literature on effective school leadership identified 39 skill dimensions related to effective performance of school prinipals. Supervisor ratings were obtained for 583 principals (a 38.7% response rate) across the 39 skill dimensions and 10 State performance standards. Data analysis demonstrated that 37 of the skill dimensions had  significant positive correlations with the 10 measures of job performance. Fifteen dimensions had correlations above 0.6 with overall performance. Factor analysis suggested that the following constructs accounted for 61.4% of the variance: (1) instructional leadership; (2) interpersonal skills; (3) organizational commitment; and (4) personal drive and motivation. Chi square, correlational, and t-tests confirmed the universality of the 37 skill dimensions and four major constructs across the four moderator variables. More effective principals had higher ratings on the same 37 dimensions regardless of the situational factors. The rating sheets used are included. Three tables give information about the study and the factor analysis. Recommendations to enhance school leadership are made based  on the findings. (SLD)",

Portfolios are increasingly being considered in the assessment of master teachers, beginning teachers, and preservice teacher candidates. The research staff of the Stanford University Teacher Assessment Project designed a portfolio development process and guided/assisted the participants as they developed their portfolios. The 18 teachers were chosen to represent diversity in experience and work conditions among biology teachers. The unit plan, one element of the total portfolio, was rated by 16 raters from the research team and the teaching profession. Teachers who developed acceptable plans had a minimum of three types of evidence: (1) the instructional  sequence; (2) justification for inclusion of the topic in the syllabus; and (3) a reasoned or descriptive reflection about the successes and failures of the unit. The difference between acceptable and unacceptable plans was in the ability to reflect on the plan and its execution. The review made it clear that teachers can organize evidence of their skills, knowledge, and dispositions around a unit plan, and that raters can make judgments based on these plans. Five tables present information about the subjects. An appendix contains the biology teacher's portfolio construction kit. (SLD)",

After a brief description of the rating procedures, the raters, and the situated-performances designed by the TAP for assessment, this paper describes the considerations that different classes of raters (novices, experts, veterans, and masters) use in rating teacher performance. BioTAP, the biology component of the TAP, has developed two forms of performance assessments for high school biology teachers: (1) portfolios, and (2) simulation exercises. During the 1988-89 school year, 16 high school biology teachers completed portfolios and simulation exercises; subjects were selected to  represent a range of teaching experience. Sixteen teachers served as judges and rated the performance assessment activities. Among the other raters were a research biologist with little pedagogical knowledge and novices with no experience with TAP and/or teaching. Results indicate that raters interpreted teaching tasks in terms of their own backgrounds, with each class of raters bringing a specialized knowledge to the task. It seems that the most valid rating system would involve a multidisciplinary team of raters. (TJH)",

Disconnected youth are defined as those who have lost or never developed the traditional values of their communities, who do not participate in traditional social service programs, lack motivation to succeed, and consistently perform well below their potential. Disconnected youth are often dropouts, youth offenders, or teen parents, and are disproportionately represented among disadvantaged black youth. The model program, managed by the 70001 Training &amp; Employment Institute, was implemented in Birmingham (Alabama) and Dallas (Texas) between January 1987 and June 1988. The following program features are  outlined: (1) outreach and recruitment; (2) special assessment and intake; (3) individualized employability plans; (4) remedial education in basic skills; (5) motivational activities; and (6) employment training, placement, and follow-up. The following management features are emphasized: (1) dual supervisory structure divided between internal and external responsibilities; (2) volunteer advisory council comprised of community leaders; (3) small student to staff ratio (1 to 25); (4) ongoing staff training and technical assistance; and (5) commitments from local service providers. The demonstration exceeded its goals for enrollment and positive terminations and program costs were lower than those of JTPA. Suggestions for replication are included.

The following immigrant generational groups are examined: (1) immigrants (defined as those born in foreign countries of non-American parents); (2) children of immigrants (American-born with one or more foreign-born parent); and (3) natives (American-born of American-born parents). Statistical data were analyzed from a sample of 22,695 youth aged 14 to 24 drawn from the 1979 Current Population Survey comprised of 91 percent Whites, 1.7 percent Asians, and 7.4 percent Hispanics.  The following general patterns were observed: (1) children of immigrants attain more years of schooling than do immigrants; (2) attainment for Whites declines in the native as compared with the children of immigrant generations; (3) attainment for Asians appears to peak in the children of immigrant generation and to level off after that; (4) attainment for Hispanics increases with each generation, though gains slow down after the children of immigrant generation; and (4) Asians have the highest mean years of schooling attained and Hispanics have the lowest. None of the existing theories that attempt to explain the effects of immigrant status on school attainment provide a close fit with the findings of this analysis and further research is suggested to analyze what personal qualities,  motivational factors, and social circumstances lead to high attainment for each group.

        "description":"A comparison of the educational attainment of white natives and children of white immigrants in the United States for a 90-year period from 1890 to 1980 indicates that the higher achievement of the children of immigrants has been a general phenomenon over several decades. Natives are defined as American-born with American-born parents; children of immigrants have one or more foreign-born parent. Statistical data were analyzed from the United States Census. Due to variations in the collection of census data, only Caucasian students were analyzed. The following findings are reported: (1) the school enrollment of children of immigrants exceeded that of natives, although the separation narrowed between 1900 and 1970; (2) rates of educational attainment for both groups were similar in  1950 but the educational attainment of children of immigrants increased over time and at higher educational levels; and (3) children of immigrants tended to have higher acceleration rates and lower retention rates than natives, suggesting higher proportions of superior-achieving students among immigrants' children. These findings appear to cast doubt on theories of cultural discontinuity, and to suggest that the effects of cultural discontinuity may be more social than academic in nature. Educators and the general public do not appear to be aware of the high levels of educational attainment that have been characteristic of the children of white immigrants, a fact that has resulted in inappropriate educational policies and a research focus on the failures of immigrant children. A list of  45 references and 4 tables of statistical data are appended. (FMW)",

        "description":"The Bureau of Jewish Education, founded in 1910 as part of the Kehillah (Jewish Community) of New York City, had a seminal and lasting influence on the education of Jews in America. The New Jewish Educators trained at the Bureau stressed the cultural breadth and historical depth of Judaism while emphasizing that Jewish education was supplementary to and compatible with modern American public school education, a viewpoint that went unchallenged until the founding of the Orthodox and Hasidic day schools in the 1950s and 1960s. At the turn of the century, the two major waves of German and East European Jewish immigrants who were engaged in the process of assimilation into American culture feared the loss of Jewish religion and culture. The New Jewish Educators advanced a bicultural  alternative to total assimilation into the majority culture based on two separate school systems that would support a complementary Jewish culture and would attract and hold American Jewish youth. Between 1915 and 1938 Bureaus were started in many major cities and resulted in the founding of Hebrew Teachers Colleges in Chicago, Cleveland, Boston, and Baltimore to train modern professional Jewish educators. Forty-seven footnotes are included. (FMW)",

        "description":"This report is based on an ethnographic study of a multicultural \"college prep\" program catering to minority students. It was part of the elective bilingual education offering at a large urban high school, and recorded an 11-year history of successfully graduating Hispanic high school students and sending at least 65% of them on to college. The report briefly describes the study and the research site, the program, and the participants. A major portion of the paper contains an explanation and examples of strategies which became evident in the teacher's approach to motivating the students in the program and to raising their self-esteem. Redefining the image of self is the goal of strategies the teacher uses to help the students imagine success and have the confidence to pursue it.  This is accomplished by helping students in the following areas: (1) to be proud of their heritage; (2) to feel that their people can achieve success and reverse stereotypes; and (3) to develop adaptive behavior that will facilitate success in a new culture. The teacher helps the students redefine their self-image as learners and as communicators in the following ways: (1) by raising expectations and standards for academic and social performance; (2) by using positive language in clasroom interaction both to praise students for their successes as well as to correct mistakes; and (3) by giving them the opportunity to \"try on\" new images through role-playing. The teacher helps them redefine their concept of self as communicators through the director/actor approach. The teacher also uses a  director/actor approach to model language production and requires that students imitate the way he, as the \"expert,\" does it. The results of the study and the implication for the design of instruction in multicultural classrooms are discussed. (JS)",

Participant observation and other ethnographic research methods were used to produce descriptive data and subject it to critical analysis. The Partnership began in one elementary school in early 1987 and expanded to seven schools. The following summary findings are reported: (1) during the Initiation Phase, 1987/88, a larger structure under which the project was operating helped support the project and initiate it in three schools, but funding was not sufficient to extend the program to all eligible schools; (2) during the  Implementation Phase, 1988/89, external funding allowed the program to expand to all seven schools where collegial relationships were developed among participating teachers as well as among teachers and administrators; and (3) during the Continued Implementation Phase, 1989/90, longevity in the program, teacher factors, and school organization helped the three original schools cope best with district-level restrictions and strengthen their programs, while parent factors proved important in expanding the program in one school and maintaining the faltering program in another school. The program's overall ethos of collaboration and the goal of teacher ownership leading to institutionalization in the schools contributed to unexpected results, diversity of program operation in the seven  schools, and some differences as well as emerging similarities in goals identified by the college researcher and the school personnel. A list of 19 references and a chart illustrating selected characteristics of participating schools are appended. (FMW)",

All aspects of federal law and policy that deal with equal opportunity for racial and ethnic minorities, women and the elderly are investigated in the following areas: (1) administration of justice; (2) education; (3) employment rights; (4) health; (5) housing; (6) language rights; (7) minority business development; and (8) political rights. The rights of institutionalized persons and the rights of the disabled are treated in two separate sections. Each report focuses on the following major issues: (1) evidence of continuing inequality; (2) the role of the Federal Government in the development of proscriptions against discrimination as they existed in 1981; (3) the efforts of  the Reagan Administration to modify or change longstanding interpretations of key protection and enforcement policies; (4) the enforcement record of agencies responsible for compliance; (5) emerging policy questions; and (6) recommendations to strengthen enforcement. The report concludes that the campaigns by the Reagan Administration to repeal fundamental policies providing for broad coverage of civil rights laws and affirmative remedies by and large were unsuccessful. However, there is confusion about the federal commitment to equality of opportunity, and the elimination of effective enforcement programs has resulted in the denial of opportunity to many. The Bush Administration must reaffirm its commitment to equal opportunity, reinstate enforcement programs, and restore the public's  confidence in government's adherence to existing law. A total of 2,467 endnotes divided by chapter, information about the contributors, and a list of cases dealing with the civil rights of prisoners are appended. (FMW)",

The rate of violent crime committed against Hispanics each year surveyed is examined and compared to that for non-Hispanics. The demographic characteristics of the Hispanic population, based on the NCS, are presented. The following characteristics of Hispanic and non-Hispanic victims are described: (1) education; (2) occupation; (3) home ownership; and (4) location of household. Based on this information, and given the higher representation of Hispanics in high-crime-risk categories, when Hispanic and non-Hispanic victims with the same characteristics are compared, the Hispanics' higher overall rate of  criminal victimization often disappears. An analysis of the following aspects of crime against Hispanics is presented: (1) place where violent crimes occurred; (2) who committed them; (3) outcomes of violent crimes; and (4) whether they were single-offender or multiple-offender victimizations. The major finding from this analysis is that, compared to other groups, Hispanics are victimized particularly by robbery. A discussion of the methodology used by the NCS to collect data is included.

The following findings are presented concerning perpetrators of school violence: (1) students are the main perpetrators nationwide; and (2) in large cities the majority of perpetrators are strangers to the victims.

Relatively few neglected or abused children who have not been charged with any crime are assigned to state facilities; delinquent youth, who have been arrested and charged with a crime, are managed through another set of procedures in the juvenile justice system; and some youth under the age of 21, whose offenses or behavior warrant adult treatment, are adjudicated through the adult criminal justice system.  Correctional facilities may offer multiple services to inmates, such as education, training, and employment. Academic instruction in juvenile facilities may constitute a major portion of the inmate's day and is often individualized; adult facilities offer a wider range of voluntary programs and instructional techniques vary depending on the inmates' skill levels. One of the chief purposes of education for institutionalized youth is to prepare them for re-entry into non-institutionalized settings, but little information is available on outcomes. To be eligible for Chapter 1 services, an institutionalized youth must lack a high school diploma and be enrolled for at least 10 hours per week in an organized program of instruction supported by non-federal funds. Program evaluation research is  scant, the literature has little common focus, and findings are often not generalizable because of the limited scope of past studies.

One technique is to allow students to engage in pre-topic and post-topic writing.

The benefits of such a technique are that it sets students to thinking about the topic, helps to stimulate discussion, and allows the teacher to gauge the level of information in the class about the topic to be dealt with. This writing should be read but not graded by the instructor as that could stifle the free flow of expression. After a topic has been covered in class, students write again for ten minutes on the topic. They  consolidate and reinforce information and allow the instructor to clarify any misconceptions students may have. Other techniques discussed are \"sample\" essays and journal writing. Using writing in content classes provides an effective tool for both the teaching of writing and learning the content of geography. (SM)",

        "description":"Aside from the growth of world population itself, urbanization is the dominant demographic trend of the late twentieth century. The number of people living in cities increased from six hundred million in 1950 to over two billion in 1986. If this growth continues unabated, more than half of humanity will reside in urban areas shortly after the turn of the century. Resultant signs of urban stress now apparent around the world call into question the continuing expansion of cities. Land and water scarcity, inefficient energy use and waste disposal, and the resultant problems of pollution all contribute to the escalating ecological and economic costs of supporting modern cities. Accelerated urbanization in the Third World has spurred the concentration of political power within cities,  leading to policies that favor urban over rural areas. Now, mounting external debts are forcing Third World governments to scale back urban subsidies just as the demand for services multiplies. Today's urban areas, larger and more numerous than ever, have outgrown the capacity of natural and social systems to support them. One way of reaching a nation's optimum rural-urban balance would be for a market economy to play a more prominent role in economic development.

Written histories not only reflect the personal and professional interests of individual historians, they also relate to the larger priorities of the professional discipline they represent. Patterns of art education's professional development can be ascertained by an examination of the types of histories that are written. In this paper, a discussion of characteristics of professional maturity and of historical research maturity is followed by an analysis of art education historical articles published between the years 1958 and 1986 in two major journals, \"Art Education\" and \"Studies in Art Education.\" From a content analysis of the texts, the articles were tabulated in six categories: overviews, person-A,  reviews, program, person-B, and metahistory. Person-B is used to designate biographies that reveal a theme, make interpretations, or indicate significance; unlike person-A treatments, individuals are secondary. Metahistories examine historical research processes, assumptions and premises, or they may place written histories themselves in historical perspective. These two categories are indicators of disciplinary maturity. Findings showed increases in both categories over the time-span studied as well as increases in absolute numbers or art histories. These indications, however, need to be qualified by the continued increase of person-A biographies as well as the lack of multiple histories on given topics. References and five figures are appended.

The analyses described in this report use this socialization model as a basis for describing the relationship between childhood and early adult arts-related experiences and current arts-related leisure participation. Three basic areas are analyzed using data collected in the 1982 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA): (1) the patterns of socialization; (2) the relationship of socialization patterns to current participation in arts-related activities; and (3) the relationship of socialization patterns to the demand for increased participation in arts-related activities. The basic hypotheses of this analysis are: (1) that early arts-related  experiences are related to later arts-related participation, and (2) that those individuals with a greater number of youthful experiences are more likely to have higher current participation rates. These hypotheses are supported by results which show strong positive relationships between arts-related socialization experiences and current participation. Another part of the relationship between socialization and participation is introduced by examining the characteristics of individuals who do not exhibit the prevailing pattern of socialization. Finally, demands for increased participation and barriers to increased participation are examined in light of socialization experiences.

        "description":"An extensive study of humanities education in the nation's public schools, commissioned by the United States Congress, concludes that history, literature, and languages are inadequately taught, and most students fail to learn important knowledge about their shared past and culture. Data from a nation-wide survey reveal gross ignorance of major events, personalities, documents, and literary classics in Western civiliation. More than two-thirds of American 17-year-olds are unable to place the Civil War within the correct half-century or are unable to identify the Reformation or Magna Carta. In general, a long-standing purpose of U.S. public education--transmission of a common culture to all students--is in jeopardy. This study points to emphasis on process over content as the  fundamental deficiency in humanities education. Curriculum guides and textbooks emphasize practical skills at the expense of knowledge; processes in thinking and doing have a higher priority than subject matter. The content-poor curriculum of elementary and secondary schools is reinforced by teacher education programs that stress how to teach rather than what shall be taught. Recommendations for strengthening humanities education in public schools pertain to: (1) expansion of time allocated to the study of history, literature, and foreign languages; (2) improvement of textbook content; and (3) reform of teacher education programs to emphasize courses in subject areas of the humanities. There is a critical need to attend to what students learn as well as how they learn. Further, school  districts are called upon to invest less in mid-level administrators and more in paraprofessionals and aides who can relieve teachers of burdensome custodial and clerical tasks. The purposes are to provide teachers with more time to study, think, and plan and to enhance their authority and performance in the classroom. A six-page news release is appended and summarizes the main ideas and findings of this report on humanities education. (JP)",

Data were analyzed from studies of 53 beginning teachers located in six sites with a wide range of contextual characteristics. (Community variables included urban versus rural, socioeconomic status ranges of students, and per pupil expenditures.) The sites were in Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, and West Virginia. Three subjects from each site (N=18) supplied additional information via interviews conducted at the beginning of the  school year and after the winter break. The interview questions focused on what characteristic of the school or community made teaching particularly easy or difficult and in what ways teaching and students had been similar to or different from individual expectations. Findings offer profiles of the communities where the beginning teachers work, an understanding of the teachers, and evidence of the impact of community context on the teachers' classroom lives.

        "description":"The resumption of skilled performance following a period of no practice is often characterized by motor activity of a lower quality than that demonstrated prior to the rest period. This phenomenon, termed warm-up decrement, is usually brief, lasting for only a few trials or minutes of postrest practice. This study attempted to determine the effect of cognitive and behavioral warm-up activities on immediate and delayed postrest warm-up decrement in a softball batting task. It was predicted that practice immediately prior to postrest performance of a task having the same activity set as the criterion task should eliminate warm-up decrement on the criterion task. In addition, it was expected that warm-up decrement would be reduced or eliminated for subjects engaging in relevant task  imagery or in physiologically arousing activity at the end of the rest interval. Subjects were 40 female softball players, all judged to be very good batters. All subjects were administered Nideffer's Test of Attentional and Interpersonal Style and a Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (Marks, 1973). The experiment involved four stages: (1) 20 pretest batting trials; (2) 10 minutes of rest and reading followed by 5 minutes of a specified warm-up activity; (3) 10 batting trials; and (4) a 5-minute warm-up and 10 batting trials six months later. The results suggest support for the expected outcomes. (MT)",

Typically, teachers teach in the morning and are with IRT in the afternoon. Research time is paid for by the IRT to the school district, including benefits. The contributions teachers make to a research program change and improve as they become familiar with research agendas and requirements. Teachers have defined research programs in the areas of: (1) classroom  strategies; (2) integrating the teaching of language arts into the teaching of other subjects; (3) the design of empirical investigations; (4) the staying power of changes in teaching practice; and (5) replication of work across many school settings.

Specifically, mean displacements in the medial-lateral plane during five static balance tests were measured from a neutral starting position. Hypotheses of no significant difference between the scores of the two groups were tested for overall balance performance (equal mean vectors) and differences between group means. This report describes the testing instruments used and the test methodology and then illustrates the test positions for the five static balance tests. Descriptive statistical data obtained from the tests were computed on the subject group means on the  score determination of static balance performance and time-in-balance. Each of the hypotheses of no significant difference in static balance performance between the nonhandicapped and learning disabled subject groups was accepted. (JD)",

Questions focused on the type of support teachers must have in order to make changes in their instructional approach. Thirteen teachers in the San Francisco area were observed as they attempted to teach the same innovative program of instruction that required multiple, heterogeneous student groupings and a variety of materials. All classrooms contained a large percentage of Spanish-speaking and bilingual students, and in addition, several classrooms contained children who were recent immigrants from Asian countries. The program required teahers to learn a wide range of new behaviors and to work with students in small groups. It was hypothesized that  teachers would depend to a large extent on lateral communications between teachers and their assistants and others, and the quality of feedback received from consultants and supervisors. On a Management Systems Checklist, the teachers were asked to check routine and non-routine topics they discussed with their classroom assistants. School and district-level supportive supervisors were trained to observe teachers and to give feedback consistent with that given by the consultants. Data on teacher behaviors were based on observations by trained researchers. An analysis of resulting data indicated that after presenting an innovative instructional model and theory to teachers, staff developers should provide training that includes focused observations and targeted feedback.

Using the Teacher Performance Assessment Instruments (TPAI) developed by the Georgia Teacher Assessment Project, researchers at the Falk Laboratory School at the University of Pittsburgh have collected, over a 2-year period, both self-evaluation data and expert assessment data from 22 graduate interns in the Master of Arts in Teaching program and the master teachers to whom they were assigned. This study's purposes are to  report the relationships between the intern's self-evaluation and the master teacher's expert assessment and to determine whether the self-evaluation process revealed quantifiable growth in competency acquisition.

AFQT scores are computed by adding four subtest scores of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB): word knowledge, arithmetic reasoning, paragraph comprehension, and half of the numerical operations subtest. The validity of CAST's paper-and-pencil counterpart, the Enlistment Screening Test (EST), was also examined in this study, using a smaller sample of 688 applicants. Analyses indicated that both CAST and EST were good predictors of AFQT performance; correlations with AFQT  scores were .82 and .79, respectively. CAST scores accounted for 67 percent of AFQT validity and EST, 62 percent. Results also indicated that optimal efficiency was achieved with a CAST test length of 10 word knowledge items and 5 arithmetic reasoning items. Administration of the current CAST required 12 minutes. Small race and sex differences existed. Additional research was recommended in order to provide cutoff guidelines for recruiters in advising applicants on their predicted ASVAB success. (GDC)",

High- and low-ability subjects who had recently taken the GRE General Test were asked to &quot;think aloud&quot; as they worked through eight analogy items. These items varied factorially on the dimensions of vocabulary difficulty (easy vs. difficult), relationship difficulty (easy vs. difficult), and stem-key correspondence (independent vs. overlapping). A scoring system was developed that included three phases: (1) a cognitive process analysis; (2) a global description of the subjects' strategies; and (3) an evaluation of their performance. It was found that vocabulary and correspondence tended to have multiple effects on how subjects  solved analogies and affected whether they solved them correctly. On the other hand, relationship difficulty tended to affect whether or not subjects achieved correct solutions but not how they attained solutions. As expected, high-ability subjects tended to use higher-level or more sophisticated strategies more often than low-ability subjects. However, the use of higher-level strategies was common for both groups of subjects. The results are compared with those reported in the cognitive science literature. In addition, the implication of these results for test development and the usefulness of the protocol methodology are discussed. (Author/JAZ)",

This study investigated the performance of U.S. and non-U.S. citizens on the Subject Tests, and the relationship of selected English-proficiency-related background variables to the test performance of non-U.S. citizens. It was also concerned with exploring the hypothesis that foreign ESL examinees are likely to be more proficient at processing the discipline-specific content of GRE Subject Tests in their respective fields than in the verbal content of the GRE Verbal Test. Data were collected primarily from GRE files of all examinees who took the Subject Tests between October 1982 and September 1984, and who answered a question on citizenship status. Profiles of GRE Subject Test means  were developed for U.S. and non-U.S. examinees, generally, and in classifications that introduced some controls for differences in English language background linked to country of origin. Non-U.S. examinees generally had higher means than U.S. examinees on Subject Tests in Spanish, French, Music, Psychology, Mathematics, Computer Science, Chemistry, Physics, and Economics, and slightly lower means in Engineering and Sociology. U.S. citizens had clearly higher means in Geology, Biology, Education, Political Science, History, and Literature. A major implication of the findings is that scores on the GRE Subject Tests appear to be useful for assessing relative levels of subject-matter mastery for examinees differing widely in linguistic-cultural-educational background.

It is administered according to a strict schedule through the International and Special Center (I&amp;SC) testing program or at ad hoc intervals by institutional users as part of the TOEFL Institutional Testing Program (INST). This study investigated the patterns of test taking and score change for examinees who repeated the TOEFL in an International or I&amp;SC administration within 24 to 60 months after initial testing. Data for examinees who repeated TOEFL within 1 to 12 months following initial testing by institutions participating in the TOEFL INST were also analyzed. In both the I&amp;SC and INST samples, TOEFL repeaters  registered substantial average net gains in performance. Findings suggested that there may be differences among national-linguistic groups in typical rate of acquisition of proficiency in English. The magnitude of the average score changes found to be associated with test repetition for repeaters, combined with relatively strong differences among national-linguistic groups in both incidence of test repetition and mean score change, indicates that for purposes of summary reporting on TOEFL performance (e.g., in defining basic reference groups), it is important to specify the test-repetition status of the gorups of examinees involved.

Research is described which deals with children's causal attributions for their academic success or failure and with children's definitions of intelligence. Research suggests that the impact of children's beliefs varies as a function of the particular learning situation. In addition, children's beliefs about their abilities are not simply mirror reflections of their actual abilities or previous performances. Several studies are described which examine children's effort, performance, and causal attributions of ability and intelligence in a variety of situations. Three sex differences  emerged: (1) females exhibited less confidence in their ability to succeed in challenging tasks; (2) females exhibited less confidence in social studies and science tasks than in reading, language arts, and mathematics tasks which involve more feedback; and (3) females were likely to have decreasing mathematics confidence as they become older. Since some childhood beliefs are not adaptive, it is recommended that ways to encourage facilitative beliefs be found. (GDC)",

Respondents considered typical beginning elementary and secondary teachers, rather than teachers of special education, music, art, or physical education. Usable survey responses to the 26-item rating scale were returned by 229 teacher supervisors, 313 building principals, and 44 curriculum or instruction coordinators. Four hypotheses were examined. First, beginning teachers' needs and proficiencies are similar, indicating they are well trained in testing and evaluation competencies, specifically test construction and test score use. Second,  levels of training are equal for different grade levels and for rural, urban, or suburban schools. Third, testing competencies are as high or higher than teachers' reported subject knowledge, professional education competencies, and overall competencies. Fourth, supervisors and principals will agree on beginning teachers' needs, as well as on their proficiencies. Results indicated the following: (1) the teachers' proficiencies were inadequate to meet the job needs; (2) hypothesis 2 was supported; (3) hypothesis 3 was rejected; and (4) principals and supervisors agreed on teachers evaluation competency needs but disagreed on proficiencies.

These tasks were developed as prototypes for use in future national assessments, but the concepts measured and the innovative approaches used are equally suitable for classroom learning. This manual is designed for use by science and mathematics coordinators and teachers to share these techniques. To develop these hands-on activities, NAEP invited the views of science and mathematics educators and worked closely with members of the United Kingdom's Assessment of Performance Unit at Kings College, London University. Tasks were administered as group activities, station activities, and as complete experiments. About  1,000 third-, seventh-, and eleventh-grade students from 12 school districts across four regions of the country were assessed, with approximately 100-300 responses obtained for each task. Results showed that students responded to the tasks, and results conformed to expectations about basic developmental trends in thinking skills. In response to the pilot study, 11 tasks field-tested by NAEP were selected to show a range of possibilities for classroom and assessment use. Each task is presented by thinking skills necessary for successful student performance and the administration mode used by NAEP. Hierarchically arranged tasks are divided into the following sections: (1) classifying; (2) observing and making inferences; (3) formulating hypotheses; (4) interpreting data; (5) designing an  experiment, and (6) conducting a complete experiment. The presentation for each task includes a brief explanation of the activity, the student response sheet, a list of the equipment used, and one or more exemplary student responses. (LMO)",

        "description":"Magnet schools have become increasingly popular as alternatives to traditional curriculum offerings and as tools to promote voluntary desegregation in urban school districts. Most evaluations of magnet schools have been concerned with monitoring objectives and compliance with regulations. Few reports assess the impact of magnet curricula on student achievement. The evaluation of achievement in magnet programs cannot be interpreted when there are no comparisons of magnet students with nonmagnet students or with scores district-wide. The Austin (Texas) Independent School District implemented the Science Academy of Austin, a high school science, mathematics, and computer technology magnet program in 1985. At the end of the first year the tenth-grade magnet students' achievement  gains did not significantly out-gain their district-wide counterparts in science. Two reasons were hypothesized: (1) the Tests of Achievement and Proficiency (TAP) Science test did not address the curriculum taught to tenth-grade magnet students; and (2) the TAP Science test was not measuring what the test publishers said the test should measure. A factor analysis of the TAP Science test gave support to both hypotheses. Evaluators should examine their implicit assumptions about the appropriateness of using results of standardized tests to evaluate special programs. (BAE)",

        "description":"Ethnographic auditing is the application of ethnographic or anthropological concepts and methods to the appraisal of administrative controls over resources. Ethnographic auditing highlights the role of culture, subculture, values, rituals and physical environment in management in higher education. The ethnographic auditor measures the fiscal and operational backbone of an organization within its cultural content. Auditing is a formative evaluation of the management process in the educational institution. Auditing looks for manifestations of meaning, cognition, competence and quality. An auditor has access to all facets of the organization. The auditor evaluates management's functions and adds insight to the operational components of a department. Ethnographic auditing evaluates  management on a cultural level of analysis. The evaluator who combines the auditor's concern over resource control with ethnographic or qualitative methods is able to address the more penetrating management issues of higher education. Auditing a university on a cultural level requires attention to both specific practices and underlying systems. Two case studies of a university library and a chemistry department are presented to illustrate ethnographic auditing's contribution to the improvement of management. (BAE)",

Several activities were completed, including selective literature reviews of: (1) cognitive and psychometric research on reasoning; and (2) more general educational research on the role of reasoning in higher education. The two item types included in the current test (analytical reasoning and logical reasoning) were analyzed to determine more precisely the kinds of basic skills that underlie their solution. Based on these activities a summary was made of the major thinking and language skills that seem to be required for successful performance on the test. Two  major conclusions were reached: (1) although there is a considerable body of research on reasoning, thinking, and problem solving, there are few well-developed models or theories to guide the measurement of analytical ability; and (2) although reasoning, critical thinking, and other such processes are assumed to be requirements of successful academic performance, there is little documentation of the specific involvement of these skills in graduate education. Based on these general conclusions and other more specific findings, further work has been planned. A 10-page bibliography follows the report. A simulated solution process for one analytical reasoning item is appended. (Author/JAZ)",

        "description":"The two exploratory studies presented in this research report used multilevel data obtained in the 1983-84 National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) to investigate the relationship between minimum competency testing (MCT) programs and student reading proficiency. A &quot;school effects&quot; paradigm was used in Study 1 to assess the effect of a school-level MCT program after adjusting for students' age, sex, region of the country, family background, school-level composition, socioeconomic status, students' academic behaviors, school-level remedial program, and instructional dollars per pupil. Within-race/ethnic group analyses were conducted to investigate whether or not the effect of MCT programs on reading proficiency was similar for each race/ethnic group. The second study  examined the relationship between the type of state testing program and reading proficiency for each grade cohort after adjusting for students' age, sex, district and school-level SES variables, family background, and race. These studies demonstrate the limits and potential of using NAEP data to inform public policy issues. Appendices include (1) a description of the NAEP proficiency levels; (2) the coding procedures and listing of types of MCT programs by state; (3) a description of the NAEP variable &quot;size and type of community;&quot; and (4) nine pages of tables containing supportive data.

        "description":"The study compares three methods for establishing cut-off scores that effect a compromise between absolute cut-offs based on item difficulty and relative cut-offs based on expected passing rates. Each method coordinates these two types of information differently. The Beuk method obtains judges' estimates of an absolute cut-off and an expected passing rate, and constructs a cutting line whose slope is the ratio of the absolute and relative standard deviations and which passes through the point of mean absolute/relative cut-off. The judges can be either test-oriented or examinee-oriented depending on whether they show greater agreement (small standard deviations) on the absolute or relative cut-offs. The Hofstee method draws a cutting line through two extreme points: (1) maximum  cut-off, minimum failure point; and (2) minimum cut-off, maximum failure point. The DeGruijter method is similar to the Beuk method, but uses confidence estimates for the absolute and relative cut-offs to define a criterion ellipse. These methods were applied to two tests from a certification program. Judges rated item difficulty by the Angoff method and estimated a desirable passing rate. All three compromise methods brought the cut-off two points below the absolute level, in line with an acceptable passing rate. This study suggests that further research into all three of the compromise methods is needed. (LPG)",

        "description":"Since educational criticism aims to reeducate teachers' perception in order to improve or illuminate educational practices, the audience's role is particularly important. In many ways, the intended audience determines the evidence presented. The evaluator must write the criticism in language which is meaningful to the audience (for example researchers, teachers, or lay persons). Because the gap between the concerns and the language of teachers and researchers is so wide, the educational critic who writes for teachers must rethink his or her communication with the audience. Educational criticism differs from artistic criticism because the critic is not an aloof critic of a completed work; the sustained contact with teachers enhances collegiality rather than distance; and the  critic aims to instigate change. Criticism grounded in an individual teacher's concerns would detect nuances in progress and would reeducate the teacher's perceptions over the course of the visits. For a report on a teacher's skill deficiencies, the \"connoisseur/critic\" would consider the teacher's lived experience, the patterns of his or her practices, and the demands for action. (GDC)",

To evaluate student achievement in content areas with or without bilingual instruction, the BCC Pilot Project was implemented in 12 kindergarten classes in February, 1984. The schools were randomly assigned to either BCC or No-BCC instruction groups. Participants were Hispanic origin LEP kindergarteners. A test of general cognitive ability was administered at the beginning of the project. Content area and language skills  achievement tests were administered at the pretest (February) and posttest (May). Program implementation characteristics and school demographic data were also gathered for each school. Results showed no indication that either strategy led to higher student achievement. No significant differences were found between BCC and No-BCC groups in either English or Spanish health/safety achievement measures. In general, the BCC Pilot Project was implemented according to guidelines with respect to class size, teacher training and experience, and instructional materials. Conclusions should be interpreted cautiously because they were based only on a four-month period of project implementation.

The objective of SIP was to improve the academic achievement of students in basic skills, particularly in reading comprehensive and mathematics computation. This achievement was to be raised by implementing crucial school effectiveness factors such as a strong sense of mission, strong instructional leadership, high expectations for students and staff, frequent monitoring of pupil progress, a positive learning climate, sufficient opportunity for learning to take place and parent/community involvement in the  school program. Before and after the program, Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills were administered to measure student progress. A needs assessment survey was prepared, and locally constructed forms, surveys and checklists were used to collect the data. The results showed that students' changes in achievement were slightly greater than expected in reading comprehension, and growth in mathematics computation was substantial (25.8 percent more of the pupils at grade level after the program). Pupils from lower income families continued to score lower. Appendices include needs assessment survey factor profiles for elementary and middle schools, graphs of factor profiles for each level, comparison of various scores to the normal curve, chronology of inservice for SIP academy and schools,  inservice evaluation form, parent survey form, and parents survey analysis for combined middle schools and combined elementary schools.

        "description":"Several multivariate statistical methodologies have been proposed to ensure objective and quantitative evaluation of the multitrait-multimethod matrix. The paper examines the performance of confirmatory factor analysis and covariance component models. It is shown, both empirically and formally, that confirmatory factor analysis is not a reliable method for simultaneous estimation of trait and method factors. The poor performance is due to an inherent rotational indeterminacy common to all factor analytic models of trait and method effects. Covariance component analysis, on the other hand, shows a more parsimonious parameterization of general, trait, and method variation in the multitrait-multimethod matrix and is therefore typically unaffected by rotational indeterminacies. The  performance with 23 empirical multitrait-multimethod correlation matrices was also found satisfactory. (Author)",

Three studies are presented on individual differences in regulation-processes emerging from thinking aloud protocols. Protocols of good and weaker performing subjects were compared and related to test scores (impulsivity, intelligence, etc.). Furthermore, students were trained to change their regulation-processes. Training programs consisted of a combination of awareness-training and regulation-training. The subjects were 14, 10 and 6 students from a normal secondary school and two special secondary schools (for children with learning problems), respectively. The results showed some relations  between process-differences such as the quality and quantity of testing-processes, the breadth of orientation, on-line regulation and mind-orientation on the one hand and performance on the other hand. There were also influences of task difficulty on the process-data. Training appeared to be effective for only some of the students. Transfer effects failed to show up. (Author/BAE)",

        "description":"A consortium of Elliott , Rowan, and Morgan Counties (Kentucky) received a grant from the Kentucky Department of Education to demonstrate methods by which existing and future gifted and talented programs may be evaluated. A Multiattribute Utility Model was adopted, because the model avoids the pitfalls of an experimental method while providing decision makers with the information necessary to increase the impact these programs will have on gifted students and the community. The purpose of this project was to provide the basis by which continuous, systematic evaluation may become part of the Gifted and Talented Program. This method of program evaluation involves five steps: (1) identifying program goals; (2) weighting program goals; (3) soliciting prior estimates of goal  attainment; (4) measuring goal attainment of evaluated goals, including identification, availability, adequacy of staffing, adequacy of evaluative structures, time on activities, counseling, cognitive objectives, affective objectives, creativity objectives, non-participant perceptions and accelerated course credits; and (5) computing the final utility. Five tables and seven figures summarize evaluation data from the three counties. This evaluation project is a step in establishing an ongoing evaluation program in these three counties. The significance of the project is limited if the participants fail to use these results as a stepping stone to an ongoing evaluation system. Fourteen appendices include the instruments used in the evaluation. (BAE)",

        "description":"A total of 149 students enrolled in an undergraduate nursing research methods course participated in a study comparing three strategies for using formative evaluation (test feedback throughout a course) to predict students at risk of failure at summative evaluation (the final examination). Students took 12 weekly multiple-choice quizzes, which were graded and returned for self-study, and a final 60-item multiple-choice exam. Three 4-week quiz subtotals were the discriminating variables used to predict membership in three final-exam score categories: Group 1 (poor); Group 2 (fair); Group 3 (good). Separate discriminant analyses tested three patterns of assigning prior probabilities of group membership: (1) equal (each .333); (2) proportional to actual numbers of students in each  group; (3) weighted by setting cost of misclassifying poor students as three times more serious than cost of misclassifying fair or good students. A significant discriminant function emerged, and confirming previous results, effect size (a standardized measure of the discrepancy between performance and the overall mean) for poor students decreased over time, showing that they were \"closing the gap.\" Assigning probabilities proportional to cases gave best overall classification accuracy (53.02%), but Bayesian weighted adjustment best predicted students at risk of failure (82.1% correctly classified) while sacrificing some overall predictive power (42.95% correct).

        "description":"This report illustrates one way in which the technologies of testing might combine with cognitive science techniques to help steer instruction. Steering testing is brief diagnostic testing that steers, or individualizes, the course of instruction. Steering testing uses simple heuristics for reasoning about the level of a student's competence in a particular subskill and intelligently manufactures practice opportunities that will be especially revealing about the student's current competences. Theoretically, steering testing should permit a partly logical constraining of diagnosis and should be based on a representation of the knowledge needed to exercise the skill it purports to measure. Four types of knowledge, involved in dealing with a student, need clarification when  designing computer systems for steering testing: (1) domain expertise; (2) curriculum knowledge; (3) planning knowledge; and (4) treatment knowledge. In addition, a student model, a knowledge structure specifying which subskills a student is thought to know or to not know, is embedded in the curricular goal structure of the system. When a diagnosis is needed, the student model is examined to identify areas of competence about which more information is needed. These areas represent constraints on the type of test item that will be informative. Once the constraints are posted, an intelligent item generator constructs test items that satisfy them. To illustrate these ideas, an intelligent computer-based tutor, with a problem solving mode, that teaches basic electrical principles is  discussed. (BS)",

A further breakdown of the number of references made to the value professional culture revealed 66% referred to the academic workplace. Body of knowledge statements varied in content but agreed on importance of developing research competence and cognitive skills in students. Professional culture statements gave priority to faculty research, with little reference to practice. Results highlighted team leader influence, with the most thorough leaders emphasizing quality assessment and program consultation.

The necessary data were collected from 25 schools which were in the HPLSP program since its beginning and from 25 comparable control schools. The number of students receiving free and reduced lunches, used as a guideline in the selection of high priority locations, was also used for the selection of control schools. Results showed that payment incentive had a positive  but short term effect on staff retention and reduced teacher vacancy rates. No significant differences in attendance rates were found between high priority and control schools. The staff considered the program worthwhile. While they suggested a higher stipend, their main concerns were the improvement of working conditions, the reduction of student discipline problems, and the improvement of administrative/teacher relations.

The main objective of the projects was to improve students' writing skills by increasing the amount of writing which students did and the amount of individualized writing aid they received.

Quantative data on students' writing performance and attitudes were collected through pre- and posttests. Results showed that WANDAH projects made significant contributions to educational productivity (greater goal achievement without decreasing student teacher ratios). The quantity of writing instruction and the amount of student writing increased. The quality of students' writing and their attitudes towards writing on the computer improved as well.

Three groups responded to the Suicide Probability Scale (Cull &amp; Gill, 1982): (1) a normative group from San Antonio, Texas; (2) psychiatric inpatients; (3) persons who had made a potentially lethal suicide attempt in the last 48 hours. Of 1,158 respondents, a stratified sample of 100 profiles was analyzed by the POSAC-I (Partial Order Scalogram Analysis with  Base Coordinates) scaling program, a computer program from the Guttman-Lingoes series for portraying partial order relations in a two-dimensional space. A subset of items (7, 24, 25, 30, 32) representing intrapersonal behaviors, derived from the primacy-of-environment facet, yielded a solution with .93 goodness-of-fit. Spatial regions discriminated suicidal and nonsuicidal groups, but did not separate normals from psychiatric patients. There was no typical suicide profile; scalograms showed qualitative heterogeneity of suicide attempters, not evident from total scores alone. Affective expressions of hopelessness and despair and cognitive planning of means were orthogonal dimensions of suicide risk. Numerous figures aid in conveying method and results. (LPG)",

Results compared: (1) overlap in items selected; (2) exam information curves; (3) accuracy of decisions resulting from use of the exams. Optimal exams typically provided three to four times more information near the  cutoff scores than exams constructed by the random method.

This final report of an evaluation deals primarily with issues of the validity and the utility of the MAC. To ascertain validity of the MAC, the performance of candidates was correlated with their subsequent job performance. The data analysis of the results revealed that the validity correlations were positive and statistically significant. The evaluation noted: (1) inter-rater reliability was high; (2) the validity correlations were substantially higher than those generally produced by the interview method; (3) the validity correlations compared favorably with assessment  centers; and (4) there is evidence that the validity correlations are still rising. Thus, it was concluded that the MAC does predict job performance. To investigate whether the resources allocated to the MAC are a worthwhile investment in the improvement of the selection process, the evaluation compared the results of the present to the former process. The results revealed that the interview MAC selection process is not superior to the interview-only process.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to develop a single procedure for comparing population variances which could be used for distribution forms. Bootstrap methodology was used to estimate the variability of the sample variance statistic when the population distribution was normal, platykurtic and leptokurtic. The data for the study were generated and analyzed using the Statistical Analysis System computing package. The bootstrap estimates of variability underestimated the theoretical variance value, and the mean square error of the estimated variance was small for both the normal and platykurtic distributions, but large for the leptokurtic distribution. The F-ratio and chi-square test statistics were computed for comparing the variability of two populations using the bootstrap  estimates of variance. Observed Type I error rates within two standard errors of the nominal significance level were obtained only when the population distribution was platykurtic. The study concluded that in the case of sample variance the bootstrap methodology could provide some indication of sample accuracy but the degree of accuracy would depend on the distribution form.

        "description":"This study tests several explanations for discrepant results in an earlier study (Cook et al., 1985) which presented a partial pre-calibration method for equating new editions of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) to the same scale as older editions. In contrast to full pre-calibration, which seeks to equate all items from two or more editions, the partial method designates a subset of items to serve as an equating section; both methods rely on item response theory (IRT) and employ LOGIST to achieve calibration. Several verbal and mathematics equatings selected from the larger study were subjected to further tests. Estimation error of item parameters was small; instead, the source of difficulty rested with the IRT characteristic curve transformations, which failed to adequately  equate the series of calibrations runs to the same scale. Possible differences in ability levels at different test administrations could not account for the discrepant equatings. Finally, the study identified items that functioned differently (DIF items) in the two groups used for equating and calibration. Eliminating these items from the partial pre-calibrations runs, however, did not improve the equatings significantly. Figures depict the calibration designs, item response functions, and other results. (LPG)",

        "description":"In order to determine the effectiveness of multidimensional scaling (MDS) in recovering the dimensionality of a set of dichotomously-scored items, data were simulated in one, two, and three dimensions for a variety of correlations with the underlying latent trait. Similarity matrices were constructed from these data using three margin-sensitive and three margin-free coefficients and used as input to MDS. Stress (S1), S1 by dimension plots, and plots of the scaled items were examined to determine the effect of varying the magnitude and pattern of correlations. The results suggested that items with similar patterns of correlations tend to cluster together, that distance from the center of a cluster is a function of the amount of random error in the item, and that as the number of  latent traits underlying the data increases, the dimensionality of the representational space increases. Cluster analysis using MDS coordinates is suggested to isolate homogeneous sets of items, whereas consideration of the S1 coefficient is recommended to determine the number of latent traits in the data.

Fifty responses were received, primarily from school districts of over 30,000 students. The official with primary responsibility for enrollment projections was commonly employed in the department of planning or management information services, research and evaluation, or student accounting. Principals and other administrators also had input into the process. Two-thirds of the respondents aimed for a district-wide enrollment projection error  rate of one percent or less. Error rates for individuals grades and for time periods beyond one year were higher. The data were primarily used for budgeting, personnel planning, building utilization, transportation, and capital improvement planning. Two approaches were generally used: (1) projection, using historical data on birth and enrollment trends; and (2) prediction, which combines this data with other variables thought to influence enrollment, often using a multiple regression equation.

Participant observation and interviews were used to generate 688 statements reflecting students' perceptions of the educational climate. Based on the research literature and judgments categorizing the statements, 14 dimensions were then defined. Further pretesting, factor analysis, cluster analysis, and judgments by faculty and students resulted in the 49-items Inventory of University Classroom Environment (IUCE), containing seven dimensions; cohesiveness,  satisfaction, personalization, task orientation, innovation, evaluation, and classroom management. Both an idealized and a real version were developed. Internal consistency reliability estimates were acceptable for each subscale, ranging from .7768 to .8349. Intercorrelations, analysis of variance between the classrooms, and stepwise discriminant analysis were also performed. It was concluded that the instrument's validity was supported with respect to test reliability, discriminant validity, and ability to differentiate between classrooms and among students. These results could be used to improve teacher training (The IUCE is appended). (GDC)",

Participants included 139, male and female, undergraduate general studies and education majors. Consistent with social influence theory, four videotaped counselor role conditions (non-expert, not-attractive, non-trustworthy, and not-deficient) were created. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of the four counseling roles and to rate the counselor on each of six commonly-used counselor effectiveness instruments, three drawn from social influence theory and three from other theoretical viewpoints. High concurrent validity was found for social influence instruments, however high discriminant validity coefficients between the expertness, attractiveness, and  trustworthiness subscales indicates that these subscales may not measure distinct constructs. Also, considerable construct overlap was found between social influence and comparison instruments. Social influence instruments discriminated between the counselor role conditions as might be expected based on social influence theory. Implications for measurement of counselor effectiveness were discussed. (Author)",

The results indicated the range of a response scale may not have much bearing on the seventh grade  students' sense of comfort with the instrument. Providing neutral or undecided positions appears to increase rates of response and the reliability of the survey data. The range of a wide response scale does not seem to intimidate the seventh grade students, but they feel more comfortable when presented with specifically labelled points along that scale. (BAE)",

Both newcomers and established residents with Latin American origins are included in three levels of inquiry: (1) a study of beliefs and perceptions about disease and the practices followed in the management of illness; (2) the identification of levels of stress by socio-cultural characteristics; and (3) the examination of patterns of conflict resolution. A main theme of the research is the pattern of adaptation shown by these immigrants as they enter the United States and begin to experience problems in communication, poverty, and work in the urban context. These stress-provoking problems lead to adaptive strategies which are interwoven with concepts and meanings from many ideologies.  Latino responses to stress and to American health services give insight into the changing values of immigrants and the kinds of questions with which health personnel must deal in their roles as agents of these changes. Data are presented in nine chapters as follows: (1) How It Happened: Perspectives of the Anthropologist; (2) Latin American Popular Medicine and the Study of Stress; (3) Entry and Settlement of the Immigrants; (4) Patterns of Work; (5) Symptoms of Illness and Cross-Cultural Communication; (6) Syndromes of Illness and Popular Medicine; (7) The Health Opinion Survey and Measurement of Stress; (8) \"Controlarse\" and the Problems of Life; and (9) Latin American Immigrants Transform Society.

Sixteen local field sites were selected to provide a reasonable cross section of the nation. A number of conventional conceptions of the role and character of the nonprofit sector and of the operation of the nation's human service delivery system are inaccurate. For example, the nonprofit sector is far larger, and plays a far more important role in the delivery of human  services than most analyses of the American welfare state would suggest. Findings also challenged conventional ideas about (1) an inherent conflict between nonprofit organizations and government; (2) the American \"welfare state\"; and (3) the financial base of the nonprofit sector. The study also questions the orientation of the \"charitable\" sector by documenting its relatively limited focus on the poor and its growing reliance on fee-paying customers. (LHW)",

        "description":"This report summarizes findings of the Los Angeles Unified School District's third annual Basic Activities Survey (BAS), held in spring 1985. The BAS measures opinions of certificated staff, classified staff, and parents concerning the district's performance in the areas of curriculum, teaching methods, and instructional materials. The sample included all types of schools from all eight regions of the school district, levels prekindergarten through grade 12. Among the results were the following: (1) certificated staff, classified staff, and parents rated their own school's program more favorably than the district's program; (2) parents gave higher ratings to the district program than did the staff; (3) all three groups agreed on the importance of teaching general academic skills;  (4) staff strongly approved upgraded standards for homework, attendance, and discipline; and (5) teachers were only moderately satisfied with the instructional support they received from administrators and district/regional offices. Findings of follow-up surveys of certificated and classified staff are included. The report discusses how the 1985 Parent BAS results compare with findings of national polls. Based on survey results, recommendations are made for continued district improvement and growth. Appendices provide tables with survey results, information on sample selection, and copies of survey instruments. (PS)",

This after-school homework assistance and tutoring program for students in grades 7 through 12 was begun in 1980 by the Urban League of Portland. The goal of the WMYLC is to help students achieve academic success and become self-directed learners. Instruction is individualized, serving mostly regular students though some have moderate or significant learning problems. A major concern of the program is shaping behavior and study habits. Findings showed that the program appeared to provide an educationally worthwhile experience for students. Two critical factors that slowed the development of the program were cost of materials and marketing of the  program to schools. Long-term effects of the project cannot yet be gauged. The report provides recommendations for improving the program. Appendices provide copies of the following: (1) monthly reports; (2) WMYLC intake and referral forms; (3) tutorial progress report worksheets; (4) a memorandum on recent developments at WMYLC; (5) a WMYLC newsletter; and (6) a bibliography.

The report answers the following five questions: (1) Who are the special needs children in Washington's schools? (2) What special program services are available to students with special educational needs? (3) Are these programs reaching the different segments of the special needs student population? (4) Are all of the needs of these students being met effectively? and (5) How are the special program services provided to those students who qualify for them? The following findings are discussed: (1) there is no single adequate definition of special needs  students; (2) most special programs concentrate their efforts in the early elementary grades; (3) most special programs are successful in improving the education of special needs students; (4) the pull-out model is the primary method of special program service delivery; (5) districts are trying to coordinate their special program resources; and (6) undesirable consequences of these coordination and integration efforts may penalize students with special educational needs. Three recommendations for quality education for at-risk students are discussed. (PS)",

This report describes the types of cases that come under the jurisdiction of the Special Counsel in the Department of Justice. The Act applies to regular, repeated, and intentional activities of discrimination, and was added to the Immigration Act because of legislators' fears that  employers would use the other provisions of the Act to discriminate against anyone &quot;foreign-looking.&quot; (PS)",

        "description":"The Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) was developed to evaluate the study and learning behavior of urban Black and Hispanic students in ways not measured by existing study skills instruments. The instrument attempts to deal effectively with &quot;non-intellectual&quot; factors identified previously as having an impact on study and learning behavior. In a preliminary stage, the SAQ consisted of 140 5-point Likert scale items. Of these, 76 were devoted to Task Skills, 41 to Cognitions, and 23 to Affect. This version of the SAQ was administered to 681 Black and Hispanic freshmen in two New York City and one New Haven, Connecticut high school. Then, the item set was reduced by selecting out items correlated with criterion and validity measures, the remaining items were factor analyzed to  develop scales, and, finally, an independent subsample was taken to test the predictive power of the scales derived through factor analysis. Overall, the questionnaire showed that some meaningful non-intellective, non-skill contributors to minority student academic performance can be empirically identified. These data suggest three avenues for further research: (1) given the surprising strength of non-intellective factors, discouragement with school and the evaluation of the school self are areas deserving more attention; (2) approaches to developing alternative instrumentation in this area must proceed carefully in the use of validity criteria; and (3) assessment of items which can discriminate between the mid-range performers and high- and low-level performers would also be of great  importance.

        "description":"Study skills research has progressed within the past ten years from primary concern with overt and observable study behaviors to an examination of cognitive and motivational processes underlying student learning and achievement outcomes. However, there is still need for a more comprehensive approach which integrates the behavioral, cognitive and motivational perspectives. The importance of students' feelings in motivating behavior cannot be ignored, but as yet no instrument has integrated the question of students' emotional involvement in what they are studying. A group of educational psychologists has been developing the Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), which would be a complete study instrument, one that includes motivational as well as behavioral and cognitive dimensions.  The SAQ avoids use of the words &quot;skill&quot; and &quot;study&quot; because these terms suggest something that is readily observed. The SAQ has been tested on a sample of black students and is intended to assess values especially important among blacks, including self-esteem, performance attribution, and anxiety. (KH)",

This report evaluates SDP, which attempts to strengthen student academic and social skills in low income, predominantly minority schools. SDP has three components: intervention, training, and evaluation research. The program recognizes that the complex problem of inner-city, minority group schools have evolved because families of children from the lowest socioeconomic strata of society experience more stress than other families. In addition, educators are not trained to bring student development to the needed level. SDP tries to  improve teaching and learning by addressing the underlying development and management issues in a school and focusing on two goals: (1) improving students' psychological adjustment and skills; and (2) improving the school climate. The intervention process consists of four components: (1) the mental health team, which provides guidance for the other three; (2) the school governance and management body; (3) the parents program; and (4) the curriculum and staff development program. This document provides a description of the SDP, including its historical evolution, intervention components and functions, training strategies and research findings. (PS)",

The process was introduced in the school system in summer 1985 to improve effectiveness of schools that could not be integrated because of their geographical isolation and whose student makeup was more than 90 percent black. The report describes study design, method, and analysis findings. The first section of analysis describes the implementation process, without critical review, based on consensus from interview responses and on documents. The second part analyzes responses to interview items and presents individuals' perceptions of various aspects of the process. Interviewees were  district and school level staff, and parents. Generally the process was perceived as working well. It appeared to be achieving its goals to some extent. Some doubts were expressed on whether the process itself was bringing about the noted positive changes, whether it was interacting with other variables to produce change, or whether it was having any effect at all. Most respondents agreed that without the process the noted positive changes probably would not have occurred. The strongest effect of the process in schools seemed to be on teacher morale, followed by school climate. Student behavior and achievement are seen to have been positively affected as well, but to a lesser extent. Included is an appendix with lists of interview responses. (PS)",

The most frequently mentioned obstacle to the achievement of SDP goals was a general resistance to change among the school staff. The  second most frequently mentioned obstacle was a perception that procedures and expectations were unclear. The report also discusses study design, method, and analysis.

The report is based on: a review of 100 major welfare studies completed since 1975; interviews with Federal, State, and local welfare officials; the results of the General Accounting Office's (GAO) welfare work; and an analysis of the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation data. The report focuses on questions concerning: (1) benefit targeting and adequacy (whom should welfare serve and how much should recipients get?); (2) system complexity (what form should benefits take, and how should benefits be funded and delivered?); (3) work incentives versus dependency; and (4) impact on the family unit. Several important problems identified are the following: (1)  confusion over whether welfare should provide for demonstrated needs or strive to eradicate poverty altogether; (2) complexity, high cost, and inefficiency of the existing program; and (3) while it has not been proved that receipt of welfare is a major disincentive to work, welfare appears to have done little to encourage work. Research does not support the view that welfare encourages two-parent families to break up, or that unmarried women have children in order to become eligible. Three appendices include a discussion of welfare evolution and reform efforts; selected summary information for all household units in the United States for September, 1983; and a list of GAO welfare reports issued, 1980-1987.

The study analyzed achievement differences over a 3-year period among White, Black and Hispanic students who attended three different types of elementary schools in the Chicago Public Schools system that have racially mixed student enrollments: desegregated schools, integrated schools, and magnet schools. Findings suggest no real difference among schooltype on reading achievement gain. Race appears to be significantly related to achievement gain only in the fourth grade cohort. Hispanic students gained at about the same rate as white students in all three cohorts. On the whole, minority students had lower gains in the desegregated schools. Group differences that are established early  in school or before school diminish as students progress through school. Although groups of students who have initial advantages retain them, no one schooltype gives any one group of students a special advantage or disadvantage. Learning opportunities appear to be equal in the schooltypes and for all students. The report includes charts and tables with statistical results and a list of references. (PS)",

Working cooperatively with other groups, this advocacy organization has developed a model for putting effective schools research into practice. The Effective Schools Model has been accepted for use by the New Orleans Public Schools. The model includes methods for improving instruction, increasing parent involvement, developing staff competence, and evaluating and documenting the program. Other ongoing projects are: (1) a special summer program which has improved children's reading skills and teachers' classroom skills; and (2) a project which brings innovative uses of microcomputers to minority children. The shared educational philosophy of these programs is  that poverty and discrimination are not insurmountable barriers; poor and minority children can and will be well educated. Information is provided about the supporters, directors and staff of the organization. (VM)",

In 1979, a total of 544 questionnaires were secured. The longitudinal nature of the study means that the educational and occupational information gathered on the same children at grade school age, high school age, and young adulthood can be used to trace the developmental transition of youth and how this relates to their initial achievements in the world beyond high school. The following are among the findings discussed: (1) educational plans are a better  index of the children's status aspirations than are occupational plans; (2) in elementary school a very high percentage of pupils aspire to a college degree; (3) by high school age, the proportion aspiring to graduate from college drops considerably; (4) over 30 personal, demographic, or parenting factors are associated with the educational goals of children and youth; (5) there is a marked discrepancy between the educational aspirations of the respondents and their actual educational attainments when they are studied as young adults; and (6) as children, respondents did not have diversified social networks of significant others.

In elaborating on those flaws, the report first describes five models of how to instruct children who do not speak English.

Undeveloped societies tend to have highly inegalitarian distribution functions. The development process accelerates this tendency by rewarding wealthy segments of the population that are in a position to invest in the growing economy. Finally, in advanced stages of development, bureaucratic and political structures may reach a point where egalitarian changes in the distributive process can be effected. Education leads to development and increased wealth in the society, but since education enriches individuals, it increases inequality. Three basic areas are explored to test a model relating economic development, education, and inequality: (1) level of economic development; (2)  level of educational development; and (3) diversity of economic structures. Using a variety of educational and income statistics, and a measure of development, a Gini index was generated for each of 144 nations. In general, the data support the expected relationship. However, when the sample is divided into three groups based on GNP per capita, this relationship is only seen in advanced developed and undeveloped nations. In developing nations, increasing educational levels are related to increasing wealth, but not to increasing inequality. (MCK)",

This paper describes and explains the characteristics of DTP and examines its effects on university extension. In addition, it outlines the kind of hardware, software, and skills needed and costs; describes new activities and products related to DTP; and examines extension functions likely to be impinged upon by DTP. Because DTP does not require users to embed complicated commands in text to produce certain printing effects, it can be used by individuals who do not have extensive training in word processing or computing. Not all of the effects of DTP are positive, however. DTP brings with it the potential for good-looking, but poor-quality or  unnecessary publications. Although visually attractive, justified text can actually impair the legibility of many instructional materials and thereby reduce their effectiveness. On the other hand, the capability of mixing graphics and text easily is likely to be a boon to educators. Word processing, advertising, the publication of bulletins and newsletters, the development and production of distance education print materials, and the printing of signs are among the many university extension functions that will likely be made easier by DTP. Besides empowering university extension, DTP will also challenge administrators and graphic artists to develop and maintain a consistent organizational visual image for their university extension programs. (Appendixes include sample DTP materials and  lists and descriptions of additional readings on DTP, DTP software, and typical hardware required for DTP.) (MN)",

Ad hoc priority decision-making, the practice of having management set priorities (the &quot;top down&quot; model), general staff discussion (the &quot;consensus&quot; model), and rank order priority setting are examined. The next  section describes the subsequent phases of the implementation of the priority-setting process. Data analysis and the role of management (the search for staff agreement, the reflection of staff opinion, and implementation of staff priorities) are discussed. Appendixes include a portion of the matched-pair, forced-choice questionnaire used in the first application of the process and the resultant Thurstone scale; the complete matched-pair, forced-choice questionnaire used in the second application and resultant Thurstone scale; the questionnaire used to collect percentages assigned by staff to program areas; circle graphs and variance plots of the percentage results; and management's representation of the results.

        "description":"This technical paper is one of three produced by a large-scale effort aimed at implementing a new approach to measuring productivity, and using that approach to assess the impact of feedback, goal setting, and incentives on productivity. The productivity measurement system was developed for five units in the maintenance and supply areas at an Air Force base. The productivity measures derived from the system were used as the basis for formal feedback reports given to the units monthly for five months. After this, goal setting was added to the feedback for five months. Incumbents and supervisors of the five units jointly set goals each month. Finally, incentives were added to the feedback and goal setting. The results showed the approach to be a very effective method of  productivity measurement and enhancement. Using the feedback produced by the system resulted in an average gain in productivity of 50 percent over baseline across the five units. When goal setting was added, the mean increase was 75 percent over baseline. When incentives were added to that, the mean increase was 76 percent over baseline. The positive effects lasted over time and continued after the departure of the research team. It was concluded that feedback increased productivity substantially, goal setting increased productivity further, and incentives did not add anything to this. The productivity measurement system and resulting feedback and goal setting systems show great promise for future Air Force use. (KC)",

        "description":"Parent Express is a series of 15 eight-page booklets for expectant and new parents. The booklets, which are keyed to the baby's age, are mailed to recipients monthly in sequence from the third trimester of pregnancy through the baby's first birthday. The booklets were originally developed by the Cooperative Extension Human Relations staff at the University of California for teenage and low-income parents. This report presents results of a study of the use of Parent Express by teenage mothers and its impact on their parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The content of the booklets focuses on information that has been shown to be predictive of good parenting. The effectiveness of the booklets was evaluated in a comparative study in which 70 mothers received the booklets  and a comparable control group of 85 mothers did not. A comparison of the pre- and posttest interviews with mothers in each of the groups indicated that compared with the control group mothers, study group mothers were significantly more likely to (1) report using magazines and pamphlets as sources of parenting information during their baby's first year; (2) report a desire for additional parenting information; (3) believe that mothers have a marked influence over their baby's intelligence and self-confidence; and (4) receive not-at-risk scores on the Home Screening Questionnaire, a standardized instrument that is used to screen for infants' developmental delays due to inadequate parenting or environmental influences.

Background information was obtained and questionnaires were sent to the 365 students who had taken all or some of the telecommunications technology courses. Responses were received from 115 former students. The average age of respondents was 30 years when enrolled in the program; about one-fourth were female. The study found the  following: (1) 57 percent of the respondents are currently employed in the telecommunications industry--an increase of 58 percent over the number of respondents who were working in the industry before entering the program; (2) about one-half of the respondents said they completed one or more industry training courses after leaving Skyline College; (3) 64 percent of respondents felt that they received an employable skill and 59 percent said the program resulted in improved job mobility; (4) 51 percent said they had received job placement assistance--they were especially appreciative of the job fair; (5) former students said they learned best by hands-on laboratory courses, then demonstration and lecture, and they thought more hands-on experience was needed; and (6) respondents would have  liked to have a variety of other technical courses, especially courses in switching theory, managing a telecommunications system, and microwave technology.

        "description":"To assess the extent to which the results of implementation studies relating to elementary and secondary schools were generalizable to vocational education contexts, a study of two specific curriculum innovations in vocational education was undertaken in Western Australia. It was designed to yield information about the context of curriculum implementation in vocational education, to identify implementation strategies currently being used, and to make an assessment of their effectiveness. Case study methods were used to allow for the indepth analysis of the two curriculum implementation attempts: a modular system of apprenticeship training in the electrical trades and a pre-apprenticeship training course in plumbing. These methods were supplemented by use of a standardized  questionnaire. The study found that for lecturers in the electrical area, concerns focused predominantly on the demands of the innovation on individuals and on changing the innovation, whereas for lecturers in the plumbing area, concerns were focused on increasing the impact of the innovation on students and finding effective ways to work as a group. It was clear that the plumbing pre-apprenticeship course was much more clearly defined than the electrical apprenticeship course. The study concluded that successful implementation characterized by concern for the impact of the innovation on students is related to the following factors: (1) explicitness of the innovation in the mind of the users; (2) the provisions of feedback mechanisms for all participants; and (3) active user participation  in decision making. Attention to these factors could aid in vocational education curriculum implementation efforts. (KC)",

As jobs are increasingly exported overseas, the United States faces a major problem in revitalization of its economy. Occupational education has a major role in the revitalization of the country's economy through the upgrading of the training and retraining of a more productive work force. Two areas where occupational education curriculum can directly contribute to build a new competitive economy are through increasing achievement in basic skills and through instruction of students in understanding and use of human systems innovation in work environments. Development of human capital is the critical factor in rebuilding a competitive economy. (Author/YLB)",

        "description":"More than 90 surveys conducted during the past 40 years covering a variety of disabling conditions and employers' concerns regarding workers with these conditions were reviewed. The goal of this review is to identify, develop, test, and disseminate interventions for rehabilitation practitioners to use in job development and placement. The review focused on employer perspectives on resources to facilitate the employment of workers with disabilities (referral and recruitment, accommodation, and staff training resources), the influence of federal contracts and labor unions, career initiation and establishment, career maintenance and advancement, and employer characteristics. It culminated in a series of recommendations for action on the part of rehabilitation practitioners,  policymakers, and workers with disabilities. The review revealed that employers are much like the general population in that they have had and continue to have reservations about workers with disabilities despite the available evidence that disabled individuals make valuable, competent employees. Although employers do appear to be aware of the differences in persons with varying disabilities and do seem, to some extent, to assess different employees' abilities differently, it appears that stereotypes persist. This seemed especially true in the case of severe physical disabilities, mental illness, and mental retardation. It appeared that there are few hard and fast rules that can readily be applied to job development and the job placement of persons with disabilities.

        "description":"One in seven New Zealanders is now 60 or older, and by the turn of the century the figure is expected to be one in five. Based on the admittedly incomplete information that is available, the majority of elderly New Zealanders live in their own homes, do not experience excessive financial hardships, and are not physically or mentally disabled. However, it is important to remember that, as is the case of New Zealand's population as a whole, the elderly are not a racially, socially, or ethnically homogeneous group with one set of needs, behaviors, abilities, and aspirations. This report is divided into two sections. The first gives background on demographic trends, both world-wide and in New Zealand, and the second initially focuses attention on educational provisions for older  adults in New Zealand. A study of the nature, extent, and demand for educational courses and activities for elderly persons in New Zealand indicated that 132 of the organizations and institutions surveyed were involved in continuing education at the time of the survey. Of these, one in four was providing specific educational programs and activities for elderly persons. Four in five reported that elderly persons participate in and account for between 2 and 10 percent of the enrollments in other courses and activities provided. They show a particular interest in general studies courses, art and craft activities, and physical education programs. Only one in four of the organizations and institutions surveyed reported a demand for specific courses and activities for elderly persons.  (MN)",

        "description":"This document offers the best available answers to questions frequently asked about vocational education by policymakers in vocational education at the state and local level. It is divided into two sections. The first section contains 15 frequently asked questions about vocational education effects and practices, each of which is followed by a brief answer and a short discussion. The responses integrate pertinent study findings from the literature that reflect the best knowledge of what current research says. Studies selected for review include (1) all relevant work conducted at the National Center, (2) other studies completed using large databases, and (3) journal articles and other original research identified across various reviews of literature. The questions refer to  occupations of vocational graduates; earnings; effect of vocational education on employability skills development; job satisfaction; employer satisfaction with vocational education students; and the effect of vocational education participation on students' achievements in basic skills, school retention, further education and training, and development of values, self-esteem, and citizenship behavior. Other questions focus on minority groups and special population participation, employer benefits, use of occupational projections in planning vocational education programs, evaluation criteria for vocational programs, effectiveness of career guidance and counseling, and the effect of part-time work. The second section addresses some questions that still need answers regarding the aggregate  effects on vocational education and administrative policies and practices. A list of references is provided. (YLB)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the economic development challenge to vocational education. It begins with an overview of the dynamic processes of technological change and industrial development and their implications for jobs and training. Several issues are then raised regarding planning, implementation, and evaluation of vocational education programs as they seek to facilitate state and local economic development. Four specific topics are addressed that highlight the importance of making critical distinctions between short-term and long-term economic development: (1) future skill surpluses, (2) customized training, (3) jobs in branch plants versus indigenous new firms, and (4) serving new skills at the expense of the old. Thereafter, the paper poses important research questions that  should be addressed in the national assessment of vocational education. The 10 issues are categorized by three major areas: the responsiveness of vocational education to changing labor market needs, balancing short-term and longer-term development objectives, and vocational education and the education and training network. The final section comments on a case study research approach to generate answers to these questions. A six-page reference list concludes the document. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study examined the individual, demographic, and significant vocational trait-factors associated with curriculum selection by students enrolled in vocational courses in Louisiana high schools. The study was intended to result in model information (in the form of baseline profiles of individuals by curriculum and geographic area) that vocational teachers could use to strengthen vocational programs. The Vocational Interest Checklist and the Bennett Mechanical Comprehension, Minnesota Clerical, and Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire tests were used to gather data for the profiles. The study sample consisted of students (mostly between 15 and 18 years old) enrolled in business, home economics, agriculture, industrial arts, and drafting programs. Almost 20 percent of the sample  indicated modeling as their preferred occupation, with performing dancer being the second most popular choice (in three of the four geographical locations examined). Students enrolled in an agriculture program were the most consistent in identifying choices closely related to their field of study. Students living in the southeastern part of the state scored significantly higher on the Bennett Mechanical Comprehension Test than did those in other parts of the state, and students from the southwestern portion of the state outscored their counterparts on the verbal section of the Minnesota Clerical Test, whereas students from the northwestern part of the state scored highest on the numerical section. In both cases students in business courses received the highest scores. Ethnic background  and socioeconomic status did not appear significant. Only tentative conclusions could be drawn from the scores on the personality test. (MN)",

The purpose was to determine the impact and future of high technology in Louisiana. Information was obtained from 68 Louisiana manufacturing industries by mailed questionnaire. Data indicated that 45 industries were involved in high tech. A majority of the industries were involved in high technology through the use of Computer-Aided Drafting (CAD) Equipment; they becamne involved in high technology as a method to increase production. Information was collected on types of computer hardware and software packages, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) equipment and software packages, CAD equipment and software packages, and industrial robots used. When Louisiana industries  recruited for high technology positions, most required either a B.S. in engineering or industrial technology. More internal or in-house training and vendor training were needed by industry to implement high technology. A future high tech educational requirement by industry was projected for trained individuals, preferably in the area of CAD. Most industries anticipated one to five new positions. Important CAD competencies were use and understanding of terminology and application of basic drafting techniques, important CNC competencies were knowledge of machining processes and familiarity with hardware and operation, and robot safety was viewed as very important.

The instructional approach was based on students' English proficiency. Students with the least English proficiency were taught primarily in Spanish; students with greater proficiency were taught in English. In addition to English as a second language, native language arts, and bilingual content-area instruction, all students were enrolled in classes in keyboarding conducted in English and Spanish. Supportive services were also offered to program participants. Program objectives were assessed in English language development (Criterion  Referenced English Syntax Test--CREST and the Regents Competency Test--RCT in reading), work study/work readiness skills (staff-developed examination), and attendance (school and program records). A quantitative analysis of students' achievement data indicated that program objectives were met. Program students mastered an average of 1.8 CREST objectives per month in the fall and 2.3 in the spring; demonstrated statistically significant gains on the RCT and in work study/work readiness skills; and had significantly higher attendance.

It assesses these laws against the perspective of benefits realized from such mandates in other nations. Chapter one is an introduction; chapter two provides background on seat belt installation in U.S. vehicles, introduction of belt use laws, and what is required to produce a large change in U.S. fatalities. Chapter three examines two issues involved in assessing the effects of the countermeasure: the effectiveness of seat belts in reducing injury if worn and the effectiveness of seat belt laws in ameliorating casualties in the targeted population. Chapter four is a review of findings from Australia, Sweden, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The following information is  presented for each country: belt wearing rates, enforcement, publicity, and casualty reduction. It is found that high rates of belt use have been achieved and apparently sustained over significant time periods. Chapter five discusses the U.S. seat belt laws--belt wearing rates, enforcement, publicity, and casualty reduction. Chapter six focuses on certain differences between the other nations and the United States that may be relevant to a discussion of why seat belt programs of foreign countries are more successful.

It examines the likely reasons for the success of eight of the projects and discusses the policy implications of the eight case studies. Of these eight projects only one (the job training project in Bartlesville, Oklahoma) failed to show a link between the services provided and higher wage and placement levels. In the case of the other seven projects, placement wages were generally higher than the average wages for listings and placements available through the local employment service, and the participants who received classroom skill training or on-the-job training generally obtained employment related to their training. Factors  associated with positive training outcomes included extensive knowledge of local labor markets; individualized counseling and assessment with assistance tailored to specific workers; competent, rigorous interventions; and personal support and persistent follow-up to ensure program completion. Of the remaining seven programs, those in Akron, Ohio, and Suffolk County, New York, relied almost exclusively on placement-related activities. The programs in Joliet, Illinois, and Tacoma, Washington, placed particular emphasis on classroom training. The projects in Everett, Washington; Beaumont, Texas; and Santa Cruz, California, revolved around a combination of services that were planned on the basis of individualized assessments. (MN)",

        "description":"It is difficult to compare the United States and European Community (EC) agricultural sectors for several reasons. For one thing, the European community is an economic association of 12 independent nations, each of which has its own national methods of data collection and statistical presentation. The problem of comparing the two sectors is further complicated by differences in measurement techniques and the limited availability of data for certain years and locations. Agriculture in the EC involves more people than agriculture in the United States. U.S. farms are larger and fewer than EC farms (9.8 million farms averaging 42 acres each in the EC versus 2.3 million U.S. farms averaging 438 acres each). EC agriculture contributes a larger share of gross domestic product (GDP) than  in the United States, but the U.S. per capita contribution to GDP of those employed in agriculture is larger. Incomes in agriculture have decreased and become more variable in both sectors, and in both areas agriculture's contribution to GDP has not grown as fast as the general economy. The EC has just passed the United States as the world's largest agricultural exporter, and it is also a market for one-fourth of the United States' agricultural exports. The costs of supporting agriculture prices and agriculture stocks have risen rapidly in both areas, thereby leading to pressure to examine policy reforms on both sides of the Atlantic. (MN)",

USDA committees evaluated the economic potential for converting land based on physical characteristics of the soil; size and location of land parcels; type of effort required for conversion; and commodity prices, production costs, and land conversion costs for 1981. High potential land required evidence that similar land had been converted to crop use during 1979-82; medium potential land did not. Converted high potential land would increase cropland area by 8 percent over the 421 million cropland acres inventoried in 1982. The cropland base would increase  36 percent if both high and medium potential land were converted, but soil erosion could increase by just over 1 billion tons annually, nearly 20 percent above 1982. If only high potential lands were converted, the erosion increase could be only about 4 percent. Less favorable cost/price relationships for crop production since 1982, several provisions in the 1985 farm act, and change in the U.S. tax code will all tend to discourage conversions. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Mandatory restrictions on agricultural production continue to be suggested as an alternative policy for reducing price-depressing surplus production, increasing farm income, and cutting farm program costs. A mandatory production control program (MPCP) can be implemented through two methods: (1) acreage allotments, which restrict individual farmers as to the number of acres that they could plant for a particular crop, and (2) marketing quotas, by which individual farmers would be restricted as to the amount of the product that they could sell to others. Both types of production controls would depend on an estimated, government-specified level of national production. Enforcing controls on production would be a problem. An MPCP would result in trade-offs between various sectors of  the economy: farmers, natural resources, consumers, agribusiness, and the Federal Treasury. Although the incomes of farmers would increase in the short term, the gains might later be offset by production inefficiencies and rising consumer prices. Improving one sector could cause changes in another sector that could offset the improvement. The concept of mandatory production controls was rejected during the debate over the 1985 Food Security Act. However, high costs of the Act, continued financial stress for some farmers, and limited expansion of exports have renewed interest in revising the current law to include mandatory restrictions. Such restrictions would benefit certain sectors of the economy but hurt others. (KC)",

The productivity measures derived from the system were used as a basis for monthly feedback to the units for a period of five months. Afterward, goal setting was added to the feedback for five months. Finally, incentives were added to the feedback and goal setting. A field test of the new measurement system showed it to be a very effective method of measuring and enhancing productivity. The system was implemented effectively, unit personnel were cooperative in developing and using it, and it showed good psychometric characteristics. Compared with the baseline period, the feedback that was produced by the system resulted in an average productivity gain  of 50 percent during feedback, 75 percent during feedback plus goal setting, and 76 during the phase in which incentives were combined with the feedback and goal setting procedures. The positive effects obtained during the field test lasted over time and continued after the research team departed. It was concluded that the system worked well because it provided a single index of productivity along with subindices, was well accepted by unit personnel, proved to be a valid measure of productivity, allowed unit personnel to focus on common objectives, and increased motivation.

Through the training process, the project also aimed at forging a strong working relationship among collaborating groups whose personnel were being trained. To achieve these goals, project staff worked on site with representatives of parent advocacy groups, community organizations, and junior high school special education units. Over the course of three years, the project trained more than 150 parent educators from a cross-section of schools and local organizations in 11 community school districts in New York City. The training included a seminar and practicum. Throughout the project, special attention was  devoted to developing parent-trainer leadership and advocacy skills. The project was evaluated in terms of its effect on trainees, parents, and their children. The extensive evaluations indicated that project participants developed competencies in the following areas: career education, advocacy, and group process.

Data were obtained from superintendents and occupational education directors from 16 Nevada school districts, the Nevada Girls' Training Center, and Nevada Youth Training Center. It was determined that it cost 52 percent more to provide educational services to the occupational student than to the academic student. The student-teacher ratio was 12:1 for occupational education versus 17:1 for academic education. The per-student average teacher's salary was $2,197.23 for occupational education compared with $1,590.86 for academic education. The statewide average amount expended on consumable student supplies was $200.49 for each occupational student versus $70.16 for each academic student.  Occupational education equipment costs $145.88 per student per year compared with $32.45 per academic education student. Maintenance and repair costs averaged $87.89 per occupational student versus $43.00 per academic education student. Because of the higher costs associated with providing occupational education services, it was recommended that a differential funding formula be adopted and that the distributive school fund be increased so as to meet these differential costs in a consistent and equitable manner. Appendixes include data comparing various program costs and suggested procedures for use in determining occupational and academic education unduplicated enrollments for a cost comparison study.

The express purpose of the study was to develop an information base upon which teacher educators and administrators could design pre- and inservice teacher education curricula. The survey questionnaire was mailed to 209 industrial technology teachers throughout the state. A total of 128 (61 percent) were eventually returned. The teachers reported using a total of 257 computers, with plans to purchase an additional 117 in the near future. Most of the computers now used belong to the Apple family, and most of those surveyed plan to continue using the brand. Most computers were located in a computer or industrial technology lab. Other  locations included the main office, library, drawing room, chemistry lab, composition lab, typing room, or math and science rooms. The areas of drafting and graphic arts had the most software available. Robotics, construction/woodworking, and manufacturing were the areas in which the greatest desire for software was expressed. Funding and availability of hardware were identified as the greatest barriers to infusing computer instruction into industrial technology programs. It was concluded that teachers would benefit most from workshops covering basic computer literacy and computer use skills, criteria for selecting computers for an industrial technology program, use of available software and authoring systems to develop customized courseware, and special applications related to industrial  technology (including robotics and computer-aided design and manufacturing).

The study was based on data from the sophomore cohort of the High School and Beyond database (a longitudinal, nationally representative sample of approximately 27,000 students who were sophomores in 1980 and seniors in 1982) and information obtained from interviews with representatives of nine dropout prevention programs that were identified as exemplary by their respective state departments of education. It was concluded that dropout prevention programs should have a committed staff, use a variety of integrated strategies, be individualized in a nontraditional environment, share a strong vocational job-related emphasis, and have a  strong counseling component. They should also have an early warning and follow through system to be able to identify potential dropouts and ensure that they remain in school. Care must be taken to expend resources on those students who would actually become dropouts if no intervention were to occur. The school environment should be kept as free as possible of absenteeism, robbery, and substance abuse; however, excessive preoccupation with such concerns is commonly associated with high dropout rates. Dropout-prone students need extensive career exploration experiences and should be encouraged to participate in vocational programs in a meaningful way. Parents should be better informed about vocational offerings, and existing rules governing entry into vocational education should be reviewed  and evaluated on an individual basis. It is especially important that work study programs have logical or operational ties with students' overall goals. (MN)",

Research findings indicate that successful programs share the following characteristics: longer-term efforts as opposed to short-term, intensive preemployment counseling, a combination of training and academic assistance,  emphasis on basic academic skills, self-paced or staff-intensive training, and collaborative relationships with other agencies and programs. Examples of successful intervention programs include Youth Chance in San Francisco, the Adult Education Dropout Project of Kansas City, and the Career Intern Program (an alternative high school program) that was originally established in Philadelphia. Employment and educational opportunities for dropouts could be enhanced by guaranteeing continuous funding as long as programs demonstrate success, creating a point system for increased financial rewards for programs with successful recruitment and retention records, and encouraging programs to develop linkages with community-based organizations.

        "description":"Evaluating the effectiveness of career guidance programs is a complex process, and few comprehensive models for evaluating such programs exist. Evaluation of career guidance programs has been hampered by the myth that program outcomes are uniform and monolithic. Findings from studies of attribute treatment interactions have revealed only a few obvious attributes that appear to interact with differential treatments (including such obvious variables as gender, ethnic/racial group, and chronological age). Where interactions have been found, they have been complex with barely significant effects or are confounded with main effects, which makes them difficult to interpret. Substituting person-oriented parameters for attribute treatment interactions changes the &quot;inverted&quot; pyramid of  policy, program, and person to a &quot;verted&quot; pyramid with the person at the apex, program at the intermediate point, and policy at the base or foundation. This person-oriented approach to evaluating career guidance programs can be implemented through reverse programming. The conceptual framework of reverse programming encompasses three topics: career by objectives, a systems approach to career counseling, and evaluation models and methods. A systems approach to career guidance is possible because of the quick data processing that is attainable by using synchronized computer and peripheral technology. (MN)",

        "description":"Postsecondary instructional dynamics is a complex process in which inputs (student characteristics and expectations, resources, and faculty characteristics and preparation) are converted through the educational process (instruction strategies, models, and techniques as well as supportive services) into outputs (outcomes and benefits of instruction to students and faculty that are identifiable through assessment). Through feedback, outputs from one period of time are transmitted back to inputs for a later time. Together with a context for instruction (which includes such factors as new and continuing students, faculty, and interest groups), these dimensions of postsecondary education interact with one another to form the process of instructional dynamics. As the demand for  accountability and academic reform on the part of two-year postsecondary institutions increases, instructors and administrators will need to turn their attention to the major problems and issues in instructional dynamics, including student participation, attributes, learning styles, intellectual development and capacities for critical thought; assessment of student outcomes; comparative studies about teaching and learning across the curricula now found in two-year colleges; research to determine what factors in instructor career preparation will improve student learning; the relationship between student learning needs and expectation; organizational structures and management practices that might result in more active learning; and the impact of technology on two-year college teaching  practices and on access to information and development of literacy.

The vast differences between different CBOs make it impossible to draw definitive, generalizable conclusions about them. It appears, however, that partnerships between school systems and CBOs (particularly in the area of prevocational education and supportive services) can reattract to the system people who might otherwise have given up and can provide disadvantaged youth and adults the fundamental and basic skills needed to succeed in secondary and postsecondary programs. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act has laid the foundation and provided the funding for new  partnerships between CBOs and vocational education. Technical barriers to coordination can be overcome by adopting longer-range planning horizons, face-to-face meetings between vocational educators and CBO staff (to eliminate false stereotypes), developing suitable accountability procedures, and contracting with CBOs that have demonstrated the ability to manage and account for funds. A variety of program models are possible, including vocational orientation and counseling, remedial education, career education in an alternative high school setting, employment and work experience programs, and combined/comprehensive programs. (Models of 10 exemplary programs and sources of information about specific CBOs are appended.) (MN)",

Data were collected from the following sources: mail surveys of staff in the state agencies responsible for administering the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act and JTPA (72 percent response), telephone interviews with the directors of these agencies (99 percent response) and with the chairpersons of the councils established by the acts (90 percent response), and site visits to 9 states and 26 service delivery areas. The overall conclusion is that although many JTPA program clients are receiving instruction in public vocational education programs, such instruction is not the result of joint planning. Rather,  JTPA officials decide the kinds of training to be provided, and public vocational education institutions are often selected to provide the training. The exception is programs funded under the JTPA 8 percent set-aside. Joint planning in the development of these particular arrangements is the rule rather than the exception because the legislation governing the programs requires cooperative agreements. Federal, state, and local policymakers appear to have several options that could foster increased cooperation between vocational education and JTPA.

Family sexual communication and the quality of general family communication are two variables that seem to be related to aspects of adolescent sexuality. To examine this issue, college students (N=95) and their parents were administered the Attitudes Toward Sexuality Scale, the Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale, and questions about sexual activity and contraceptive use. Parent-child communication about sex was measured by having subjects indicate the extent to which nine sexual topics had been discussed in the family. Findings showed that for female subjects, there was a relationship between parent-child communication about sex and similarity in sexual attitudes  of mothers and daughters. For males in the high communication groups, there was a similarity between their attitudes and those of both their mothers and their fathers. The quality of family communication in general was not significantly related to parent-child communication about sex. The results support the view that parents of late adolescents are still capable of exerting influence over their children in the area of sexuality. Whether this influence comes from direct communication about sexuality, or from the quality of the parent-child relationship in general seems to depend on whether similarity in sexual attitudes or sexual behavior is being measured.

The present study attempted to determine whether this relationship was present in college students who were living away from home. Ohio State University main and regional campus students (N=355) and their parents completed questionnaires which measured sexual attitudes, sexual knowledge, sexual behavior, and amount of family communication about sex. Regardless of whether they lived at home or not, and regardless of which campus they attended, the students in this study exhibited the same pattern of attitude similarity that had been found in the past.  Students in high communication families had attitudes which were more similar to those of their parents than did the students in the low communication group, regardless of proximity to parents or campus attended. While this study supports the view that parent-child communication about sex is related to adolescents' sexual values, it does not lend much support to the idea that family decisions about sexuality result in less adolescent sexual activity or in a greater use of effective contraception.

The background of the National Drug Policy Board created by a presidential executive order in March, 1987, is outlined and recent board changes are explained. The two coordinating groups within the new policy board structure, the Drug Enforcement Coordinating Group and the Drug Prevention and Health Coordinating Group, are described and subcommittees for each group are listed. The section on recent drug policy achievements  highlights a number of significant drug law enforcement activities of the board. Areas discussed, among others, include investigation and prosecution, cocaine seizures, international programs, and the federal prison situation in regard to drug offenses. Progress in creating drug-free federal workplaces, drug-free private sector workplaces, and drug-free schools is also discussed. The Administration's strong opposition to the &quot;Drug Czar&quot; bill is emphasized and several reasons to reject the bill are given. (NB)",

        "description":"Because Area Agencies on Aging are increasingly required to perform case management functions for older adults, it is important to understand the patterns of need among persons of different racial or ethnic backgrounds as well as the general knowledgeability of persons about what sources are available to them. A conceptual framework was designed to examine the flow of services to older blacks and whites with respect to participation in and knowledge about available community sources of assistance for instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Data were obtained from 1,100 older adults in Arkansas. Survey questions dealt with four IADLs: (1) the need for help with yardwork; (2) the need for help getting to places beyond walking distance; (3) the ability to prepare meals; and  (4) the ability to perform personal care chores. An analytical model was employed to describe the various branching of older adults into service users and nonusers, and the sources of aid which they used or were aware of to assist with IADL functions. Differences between blacks and whites appeared to be minimal with respect to general needs for services and the number who accessed agency services. Both blacks and whites were found to be more likely to use informal than formal sources of help. The elderly blacks were less likely than whites to know of sources of assistance. (Eight data tables are included.) (NB)",

Feelings of burden experienced by an adult daughter, however, may interfere with the nature of her relationship with her aging mother and may have a potentially deleterious effect on the mother. To test this hypothesis, a study was undertaken which examined the impact of two brief interventions on 37 middle-aged women and 24 of their elderly mothers. After mothers and daughters completed initial questionnaires measuring filial behavior and relationship satisfaction, daughters were assigned to either: (1) a cognitive-behavioral presentation designed to reduce the daughter's unrealistic feelings of responsibility; (2) a supportive-educational presentation designed to increase the  daughter's awareness of her mother's needs; or (3) a waiting list control group. Following the interventions, mothers and daughters completed a modified version of the initially-completed questionnaire and reported any changes in the mother-daughter relationship or in the mother's well-being. The cognitive-behavioral procedure was found to be more effective than either the supportive-educational procedure or the no-treatment control condition in reducing the daughter's burden, improving the mother-daughter relationship, and decreasing the mother's loneliness. This study provides support for a social exchange perspective for understanding the quality of the mother-daughter relationship in later life. (NB)",

A program was designed to train nursing home residents to serve as peer counselors for newly-admitted residents in an effort to provide social support for new residents, facilitate new residents' adjustment to institutionalized living, and provide current residents with a meaningful volunteer role. Six male and 24 female nursing home residents volunteered for the study. Fifteen residents received peer counselor training and 15 residents served as controls. Recipients of the peer counseling services were 15 newly-admitted residents. Another 15 new admissions served  as controls. The appearance of the 30 volunteer residents was rated by a staff member at the start of training and again 4 weeks after completion of training. An occupational therapist rated the social adjustment and physical functioning of the 30 new admissions at time of admission and again 2 months later. Empirical and anecdotal evidence indicated that peer counselor trainees and new residents who received counseling improved somewhat on measures of social functioning when compared to controls. These findings highlight the need for further attempts to understand and promote social support and social competence among institutionalized elderly adults. (NB)",

To explore this issue, a study was conducted which compared the mother-daughter relationships of 15 employed and 22 unemployed married women whose elderly mothers were widowed. Daughters completed a questionnaire on filial behavior, filial role strain, and relationship quality; rated the amount of assistance they gave to their mothers; rated role strain; and completed a modified version of Bengtson's Affectual Solidarity Scale. Twenty-four of the 37 elderly mothers also completed the Affectual Solidarity Scale and rated  their current level of happiness. The results indicated that, compared to unemployed daughters, the full time employed daughters had significantly worse filial relationships, scored lower on the Affectual Solidarity Scale, and scored higher on measures of role strain and role demand overload. Compared to mothers of unemployed women, the mothers of employed women also reported lower affectual solidarity and somewhat lower scores on self-perceived happiness. (Author/NB)",

A role theory perspective was used to examine how women's competing obligations and conflicting filial norms can affect their relationships with their elderly mothers. The degree to which a daughter's perceived role strain was related to both the affectional quality of her relationship with her elderly mother and her elderly mother's psychological well-being was examined in 40 middle-aged women and 24 of their elderly mothers. Daughters completed a questionnaire on filial behavior, filial role strain, and relationship quality; rated the amount of assistance they gave their mothers; rated role conflict and role  overload; and completed Bengston's Affectual Solidarity Scale. The 24 mothers completed a modified version of the Affectual Solidarity Scale and rated their current levels of happiness and loneliness. The results revealed that, compared to daughters who reported low levels of role strain, daughters who reported greater role strain had poorer quality mother-daughter relationships from the perspective of both daughter and mother, and their mothers had lower psychological well-being.

One factor that could influence an employer's evaluation of an applicant is the knowledge of that applicant's salary on his or her present job. A study was conducted to determine the influence of an applicant's present salary on the evaluation of his or her qualifications and suitability for hire. Undergraduate business majors (N=80) rated four applicant resumes, each for a different job. Each subject rated two male applicants and two female applicants with either high or low present salary. Subjects evaluated applicants' qualifications and hirability, and awarded a starting salary. The results indicated that, compared to high  present-salary applicants, low present-salary applicants were offered less starting salary for all jobs, and were rated as less qualified for engineer and advertising manager jobs. For the engineer job, low present-salary applicants were regarded as less likely than high salary applicants to be successful, and were less likely to be hired. These findings imply a potential for perpetuating sex discrimination and an earning differential between men and women. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Previous justice research has used exchange situations, which involve expectations of reciprocity with no special responsibility for another's welfare, to compare the relative importance of procedural (fairness of rules and processes involved in reaching outcomes) and distributive (fairness of outcomes) fairness. Since differences were found as a function of social context, it was hypothesized that as the social context of an allocation moves from exchange to communal relationships, which involve feeling a special responsibility for another person's needs, the relative importance of procedural fairness will increase. To examine this issue, a simulation procedure involving a communal relationship was used. College students (N=114), high school students (N=120), and junior high  school students (N=120), read a scenario in which parents allocated money to their teenage children, and then completed a questionnaire. Procedural and distributive justice were manipulated in a 2 x 3 factorial design; eight dependent measures of social and affective responses were examined. The results revealed that procedural justice accounted for significantly more variance than did distributive justice on all eight dependent variables. These findings differed from previous findings in exchange situations, suggesting that as allocator-recipient relations become closer, or more communal, procedural fairness becomes increasingly more important than distributive fairness.

Russ and Alexander (1984) found significant sex differences in their research on justice, such that women responded more positively to overreward or more negatively to underreward than did men. Since the Russ and Alexander study used an exchange situation, a study was conducted to determine whether similar effects would occur in a communal situation. Male (N=169) and female (N=184) junior high school, high school, and college students read a scenario in which parents allocated money to their teenage children. There were three equity conditions: overreward, underreward, and just reward. After reading the scenario,  subjects completed a questionnaire which included the key dependent variable of perceived fairness of the allocated reward. The results revealed a significant sex x inequity interaction on the measure of perceived fairness. Female subjects perceived overreward as being fairer, and underreward as being more unfair, than did male subjects. These results in a communal situation replicated Russ and Alexander's exchange situation results and are congruent with Gilligan's hypothesis about male-female moral ideologies. (Author/NB)",

The expectation that computer skills will be necessary in a subject's future occupation varied as a function of sex role.

A sizeable minority of delinquents, however, has been shown to reason at age-appropriate levels. This study examined issues related to those juvenile delinquents who were mature in moral reasoning in terms of Kohlberg's (1983) theory of sociomoral development. Incarcerated delinquents (N=43) with age-appropriate moral reasoning (Kohlberg's Stage 3) were compared with incarcerated delinquents (N=42) delayed in moral reasoning and with nondelinquents (N=35) with age-appropriate moral reasoning. All subjects completed the Sociomoral Reflection Measure, Johnson's Values Questionnaire, a shortened version of  the Personal Values Questionnaire, the Quick Word Test, and a measure of socioeconomic status. In addition, the delinquent subjects also completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). The results revealed that both delinquent groups evidenced a greater acceptance of antisocial behavior and values than did nondelinquents. Both delayed and mature delinquent groups also demonstrated much psychopathology. However, mature delinquents evidenced MMPI scores reflecting more internalizing pathology than did delayed delinquents. This internalizing pathology may reflect the anxiety or guilt resulting from the strain between mature moral structure and antisocial behavior or a parallel between sociomoral structures and personality/psychopathology.

To explore this relationship, a study was conducted, in partial replication of earlier studies, using the strategy choice paradigm for paired-associate learning (PAL) on a metamemory questionnaire. Metamemory subtests were administered to second graders (N=66) at the beginning of each session. Three PAL trials followed with each list comprising 10 known pairs presented over one study-test trial. The first two trials familiarized subjects with an effective sentence elaboration strategy and an ineffective rote repetition strategy. In the third trial, Choice, subjects freely selected a learning strategy. The results revealed  that Elaborators (N=44) on the Choice-trial learned three times more material than did Repeaters (N=22). The metamemorial knowledge of Elaborators concerning the acquisition process was significantly greater than that of Repeaters, while scores on metamemory subtests related to retrieval processes were comparable for Elaborators and Repeaters. These results suggest that a fair test of the metamemory-memory connection requires an explicit definition of the metamemory construct in terms of its functional relation to either acquisition or retrieval skills, and that effective tests of the metamemory-memory connection require the maintenance or transfer of elaborative strategies rather than the spontaneous use of familiar learning strategies.

Volume I contains information on the dimensions of the nonsupport problem in the United States, stressing that of the 8.7 million women who were caring for children in fatherless homes in 1983, only 58% had court orders or agreements to receive child support and that one-half of those mothers received only partial or no payment in spite of the agreements. The Child Support Enforcement program, established in 1975 as Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act, is also described. Child Support Enforcement program goals are listed as: (1) ensuring that children are supported by their parents; (2) fostering family responsibility; and (3) reducing the costs of welfare to taxpayers. The  enactment of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 is discussed and the amendments' key provisions are highlighted in graphic form in the areas of mandated program techniques, federal income tax refund offset, research and demonstration, program improvements, and audit. Progress in child support enforcement from 1975 through 1985 is summarized and current initiatives of the Office of Child Support Enforcement are discussed which include state compliance with the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984, private sector involvement, interstate enforcement, state child support enforcement automated systems, and a public awareness campaign.

Chapter III deals with overall dropout rates and variations by race/ethnicity and sex. Chapters IV through VII all deal with particular sets of influences on the dropout rate: chapter IV covers socioeconomic and other family background factors; chapter V examines locational and economic factors; chapter VI looks at school factors and  educational experiences; and chapter VII considers certain student behaviors and choices. Each of these chapters presents both descriptive statistics on the dropout rates associated with different values of the variables in question and estimates from multivariate models of net effects of the variables on the probability of dropping out. Each chapter also presents separate results for the six race/ethnicity-sex groups defined by classifying students as male or female and as White, Black, or Hispanic, as well as results for all groups combined.

This study investigated the effects of parental nurturance and the use of permissive, authoritarian, and authoritative parental discipline upon the self-esteem of college students. College students (N=335) completed a demographic information sheet and five questionnaires designed to measure parental nurturance, parental discipline, and self-esteem. The results revealed that parental nurturance of both the mother and father were more strongly correlated with self-esteem than were the parental discipline variables. While the use of authoritarian and authoritative discipline significantly correlated with  self-esteem, regression analyses revealed that their effects upon self-esteem were primarily due to their influence upon parental nurturance. The six variables that correlated significantly with self-esteem were mother's nurturance, father's nurturance, mother's authoritarianism, mother's authoritativeness, father's authoritarianism, and father's authoritativeness. The familial variables of parental nurturance and parental discipline were more strongly correlated with the self-esteem of females than with the self-esteem of males. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Practicing counselors are often working in settings that do not include regularly-assigned supervisors. In the absence of regular supervision, today's counselors must meet mounting demands for accountability by demonstrating competence and expressing professional autonomy. When a difficult situation arises with a given client, what can and should the counselor do? In a supervised situation, the supervisor actively supports the assessment-action-evaluation process. In a self-supervised situation the assessment, action, and evaluation processes are self-initiated and self-maintained. A self-supervision model represents these processes in a continuous loop. The assessment process determines the direction of needed change; the self-action part involves attempts at direct change,  including changing the environment and the consequences of certain behaviors; and the evaluation of the action step provides feedback to subsequent self-assessment thereby modeling an on-going process without a beginning or end. This self-supervision process combining self-awareness, self-action, and self-evaluation helps a counselor to avoid the professional pitfall of burnout. (Author/ABL)",

Sex education is about character; in a sex education course issues of right and wrong should occupy center stage. In too may cases, however, sex education in American classrooms is a destructive experience. Statistics such as the number of teenage pregnancies illustrate how boys and girls are mistreating one another sexually. Many sex education courses offer the illusion of action, relaying only technical information and possible outcomes\" are devoid of moral content. This kind of teaching displays a conscious aversion to making moral distinctions; it encourages students not to make the \"right\"  decision, but the \"comfortable\" decision. Most American parents value postponing sex and raising children in the context of marriage. Despite this fact, some say that teenage sex is such a pervasive reality that there is nothing to be done but to make sure that students are supplied with contraceptives. But schools are supposed to be better and to point to a better way. Research has shown sexual behavior to be connected to self-perception and experience has shown that values are teachable. Students must learn that sexual activity involves men and women in all their complexity; in fact, sex may be among the most value-loaded of human activities. Sex education courses should: (1) teach children sexual restraint; (2) teach that sex is not simply a physical act; (3) speak of sex within  marriage; and (4) welcome parents and other adults as allies. Finally, it is crucial that sex education teachers offer examples of good character, by the way they act and by the ideals and convictions they must be willing to articulate to students. (ABL)",

The importance of peer relations in treatment settings suggests a need for an objective assessment of these relations. Sociometric procedures were used to study the peer relationships of adolescents in a 15-bed residential treatment program, in an attempt to determine whether social status could be reliably assessed in this peer group and whether it could be predicted from measures collected prior to admission. Positive and negative nominations were collected weekly for adolescents (N=63). The results indicated good week-to-week stability for social acceptance, rejection, and social preference. Social impact was not reliable. Social acceptance, rejection, and social  preference, as established during the initial week, were predictive of corresponding scores throughout the duration of admission. The Child Behavior Profile was completed by a parent of each adolescent prior to admission and significantly predicted social acceptance and social preference established later in the clinical milieu. These findings support the use of sociometric procedures in clinical settings and suggest a persuasive influence of the peer milieu in residential treatment. (Author/NB)",

It is based on a survey conducted of the 50 states and the District of Columbia to determine what information was available about the extent of child abuse and neglect, and to learn what resources and services exist to prevent and treat child abuse. Findings are reported which reveal that: (1) reports of child abuse are rising, particularly of child sexual abuse and child neglect; (2) reported cases are becoming more serious and complex; (3) economic hardships of families are a primary contributor to abuse; (4) cuts in federal aid have resulted in inadequate public resources to address child abuse; and  (5) state child protective service systems are strained and staff are overburdened. The report notes that it is possible to prevent and treat child abuse with a variety of cost-effective programs and that states are placing greater emphasis on prevention. Chapter I focuses on reports of child abuse and neglect. Chapter II examines resources available to states for child protection and child welfare services. Chapter III looks at how states investigate reports and provide services. Chapter IV deals with effective programs and recent initiatives. Chapter V presents state fact sheets of survey responses.

This essential philosophy is termed \"participatory management\" in business environments and provides a framework in a university setting for establishing a program involving considerable money, staff commitment and effort, institutional backing, and business and industry support. Such student involvment and support is being fostered in the Cooperative Education program in the University of Georgia's Cooperative Education program. Cooperative education is a structured educational plan alternating periods of work with periods of academic study to help students identify career goals, relate them to their academic achievements, and develop skills systematically in both areas. The  cooperative Education staff has worked to support and encourage a student initiated and maintained network called The Co-op Club. The Co-op Club's input in program planning and development is providing necessary administrative, creative, and evaluative input to broaden and strengthen the Cooperative Education program campus and community wide, all of which indicates that the effort involved to initiate and support this type of organization is worthwhile.

        "description":"In recent years thousands of minority persons who were previously denied access to primarily white, U.S. institutions of higher education have enrolled in them. Many institutions initiated special programs designed to compensate for academic skill problems observed in some of these new students. The effect of these programs on student retention is an important area of concern, but in the 1980s some researchers have avoided the special program issue by demonstrating that one can identify, through a set of noncognitive variables, which minority students are likely to remain in college through graduation. Some of these variables, such as positive self-concept, realistic self-appraisal and the ability to delay gratification, have been recognized for a long time. Others, such as  understanding and dealing with racism, and preference for long-term over short-term goals also have important academic consequences. A workshop has been developed to train counselors, advisors, teachers, and other personnel in higher education to make diagnostic referrals for minority students using noncognitive variables. Workshop participants review case materials and do simulated interviews. They are given information on interviewing and identifying student behaviors associated with each noncognitive variable. Results from participants' evaluations indicated that they understood the noncognitive variables and could identify them from written materials and interviews. (ABL)",

        "description":"In some communities, alcohol becomes a part of socialization early in life. In one such community, softball for women has become a popular pastime. Twenty-seven of 48 teams in the community were sponsored by local taverns, bars, or restaurants where alcohol was served. Teams sponsored by taverns were encouraged to meet at the taverns before or after a game. To examine the relationship between sports and alcohol, 183 female softball players, coaches, and staff completed a questionnaire on alcohol-related concerns. The results revealed that, compared to women on teams with other sponsors, women on alcohol distributor and tavern sponsored teams were more likely to agree that drinking was encouraged, that beer and softball went together, that teams go to the bar after the game  regardless of game outcome, and that coaches seldom address the effect of drinking on quality of play. These findings suggest a relationship between team sponsorship and the attitudes of female recreational softball team members. Future studies might examine the same issues among male players. (NB)",

Subjects, 11 students enrolled in a community college technical training program in welding, were given training sessions that provided practice in metacognitive methods through reciprocal teaching and four comprehension monitoring/regulating techniques--self-questioning, summarizing, predicting, and critical evaluation of text. During each intervention session, they were required to read a 1,000- to 1,500-word passage of expository technical prose. At the end of each session, subjects answered evaluation questions on a different 500-word passage of similar readability in another technical content area.  Both a pretest and posttest were administered. The pretest mean ranked the group in the lowest three percent of college freshman, but the posttest mean was nearly double the pretest mean, placing the group in the lower quartile. Findings suggest that, although substantial growth in achievement was indicated, lack of a control group left no basis for comparison. Findings also suggest that the average achievement of the subjects on the pretest was low enough to indicate that regression to the mean contributed substantially to posttest improvement.

Responses from 181 two-year colleges with developmental programs showed that 31.5% used computers in reading classes or labs, 10% used computers for classroom management, and 40% did not use computers. More than half of the institutions using computers had five or fewer units.

Although 71 different software  packages were cited (with many developed locally), only four--Comprehension Power, The Speed Reader, Plato, and Word Attack--were cited with any frequency. Software was used most prevalently in remedial reading courses, followed by speed reading, vocabulary development, study skills, and combined reading and writing courses. The major trends indicated are that computer use in reading instruction appears to be increasing, with a wide variety of software in use, mostly on Apple computers, and used most commonly to provide drill and practice with tutoring.

Participants were 64 white, lower middle class first grade students selected from five classrooms (all with basal instruction programs) in two communities. The children were paired by word recognition scores, each member reading alternate versions of the same four stories over a two-week period. They were tested for comprehension and for oral reading miscues. In comprehension, subjects with high word recognition scores profited from changes in the revised versions, while low word recognition subjects were not affected. Students reading the rewritten version  answered a majority of questions correctly more often, suggesting that reduced dependence on pictures and natural language conventions facilitated inference, coordination of different parts of the text, and a greater use of expectations based on natural language in top-down processing of the texts. Analysis of oral reading miscues indicated that while the rewritten versions had no significant effect on rate of reading or word miscues, they reduced the proportion of graphically based miscues for high word recognition subjects, who consistently produced fewer punctuation miscues, suggesting that the rewritten texts were more in keeping with expectations children derive from naturally occurring language patterns.

Du Bois and published for 2 years, from 1920 to 1921, was a radical departure from traditional children's publications. It challenged the &quot;selective tradition&quot; in children's literature that negatively depicted Afro-Americans and Afro-American culture. It offered poems, stories, informative articles, and advice that portrayed Black children as intelligent, attractive, clean, and virtuous. Readers were apprised of the history and achievements of Blacks in articles about Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman, and Black children around the country were recognized for academic achievement. Additionally, to counteract the effect of drawings in other children's literature that showed  Blacks with unattractive and exaggerated features, the drawings for &quot;The Brownies' Book&quot; showed Blacks as being attractive and having a wide range of physical characteristics and skin tones. Readers were taught to treat others with fairness, equality, and assertiveness, and poems and stories often emphasized kindness and perseverance. In a monthly column called &quot;The Judge,&quot; young readers were given guidance that would enable them to interact with others with self-confidence and tolerance. The magazine was overtly political, stressing racial solidarity and racial equality, and it seems to have inspired many Blacks to challenge the status quo. Letters from readers reflect the uplifting and inspirational quality of the magazine, indicating that it fulfilled DuBois' hopes that &quot;The Brownie  Book&quot; would create &quot;refined colored youngsters.&quot; (JC)",

        "description":"Although evidence is accumulating that the major reading difficulty dyslexics experience involves decoding and recognizing printed words, it is not clear that all dyslexics read poorly for the same reasons. A study investigated dyslexic children between 7 and 14 years of age to see if their reading errors and patterns of performance would enable them to be classified into subgroups. Forty-nine dyslexic children in grades 2 to 8 completed reaction time tasks which tested visual matching, sound and category matching, and word recognition. As control, a group of 58 normal readers in grades 1 to 8 also completed the tasks. Results grouped the dyslexic children into four types of severe reading deficiency: (1) decoding, (2) lexical access, (3) both decoding and lexical access, and (4)  visual processing. A second study tested whether the subgroups showed deficits on non-reading tasks that would relate systematically to their area of reading difficulty. Subjects were 46 dyslexics and a comparable group of non-dyslexics who attempted tasks in rhyming, category matching, sound deletion, nonsense word decoding, picture matching, and picture copying. Most dyslexics in all four subgroups had difficulty with decoding nonsense words and sound deletion tasks; no group had difficulty with picture naming; the decoding group was deficient in rhyming; the lexical deficit group was deficient in category matching; the multiple deficits group had trouble with rhyming and category matching; and the visual deficits had difficulty with picture copying. While the study suggests that it may  be fruitful to subdivide dyslexics based on area of difficulty, the results also show that dyslexics have certain characteristics in common. Possibly, dyslexics do not stay statically in one category, but change through time from the combined group to exhibiting a single deficit. (SKC)",

Readability levels of the content area textbooks were calculated using the Fry Readability Formula and Graph. Results indicated that the readability levels of the eight textbooks were above the mean reading score of the students tested. Findings suggested that the students would experience difficulty with their texts and would need teacher assistance as they read. Findings also suggested that reading strategies--such as SQ3R,  reading with a definite purpose, and asking questions while reading--should be taught, and that guided reading lessons should be tried.

        "description":"Noting that skills and knowledge taught in schools have become abstracted from their uses in the world, this paper clarifies some of the implications for the nature of the knowledge that students acquire through a proposal for the retooling of apprenticeship methods for the teaching and learning of cognitive skills. The paper specifically proposes the development of a new cognitive apprenticeship to teach students the thinking and problem-solving skills involved in school subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics. The first section of the paper, after discussing key shortcomings in current curricular and pedagogical practices, presents some of the structural features of traditional apprenticeship, detailing what would be required to adapt these characteristics to the  teaching and learning of cognitive skills. The central section of the paper considers three recently developed pedagogical models that exemplify aspects of apprenticeship methods in teaching thinking and reasoning skills. The section notes that these methods--A. S. Palincsar and A. L. Brown's reciprocal reading teaching, M. Scardamalia and C. Bereiter's procedural facilitation of writing, and A. H. Schoenfeld's method for teaching mathematical problem solving--appear to develop successfully not only the cognitive, but also the metacognitive, skills required for true expertise. The final section organizes ideas on the purposes and characteristics of successful teaching into a general framework for the design of learning &quot;environments,&quot; including the content being taught, pedagogical  methods employed, sequencing of learning activities, and the sociology of learning--emphasizing how cognitive apprenticeship goes beyond the techniques of traditional apprenticeship.

        "author":["Anderson, Richard C.",
          "And Others"],
        "description":"A pervasive finding from research on teaching and classroom learning is that a low rate of error on classroom tasks is associated with large year to year gains in achievement, particularly for reading in the primary grades. The finding of a negative relationship between error rate, especially rate of oral reading errors, and gains in reading achievement is generally interpreted to mean that a low rate of error is on the causal path to growth in reading. However, this relationship may be an epiphenomenon: (1) error rate on classroom tasks is a good measure of children's level of reading development, (2) standardized tests and other one-shot assessment instruments are always imperfect measures of reading level, and (3) error rate correlates negatively with end-of-year achievement  because it provides additional and more reliable information, beyond that contained in previous test scores, about children's reading ability. Findings from a microanalytic study of third-grade reading lessons confirmed that oral reading errors can have a positive influence on children's comprehension. Errors facilitated comprehension of nonturntakers when task norms emphasized accurate oral reading, but not when norms emphasized story understanding. According to the positive influence theory, an oral reading error followed by feedback fits the pattern of tension followed by resolution shown by other research to improve learning and memory. When the task is accurate oral reading, a failure to read fluently produces tension, which increases attention and instigates deeper processing or a  greater &quot;effort after meaning.&quot; (A table, figure and references are included.)

        "author":["Blanchard, Harry E."],
        "description":"A study tested the hypothesis that the time it takes for information to be analyzed by the reader is sometimes delayed because concurrent comprehension processes are still occupied with analyzing previous information (the variable utilization time hypothesis). During fixations (when the eye rests during reading), visual information, at some point, is passed on to higher-level mental processors, such that the reader's comprehension of the text is furthered by the information. This is referred to as the time of utilization. Previous research showed that the time of utilization varies, occurring sometimes early, sometimes late, in the fixation. The method of determining the time of utilization used in previous experiments was combined with a manipulation of comprehension difficulty.  The comprehension manipulation involved varying the distance between a pronoun and its referent, which has been shown to cause delayed processing effects. Subjects were college students or graduates with normal uncorrected vision, who read the text using a machine that recorded their eye movements during reading. The desired effects were not obtained in this experiment; thus the variable utilization time hypothesis could not be properly tested. Perhaps properties of the pronouns &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; made them easy to process regardless of distance from their referents, or discourse properties of the text involving focus change could have skewed the results.

        "author":["King, Debra Ann",

        "description":"Because analogical reasoning plays a major role in content area reading comprehension, teachers should learn to teach analogy-solving skills and to identify the kinds of difficulties some elementary students will have in solving them. Analogies are statements of relationships wherein one term is similar to another term. Relationships in analogy problems include association, purpose, cause and effect, part to whole, part to part, action to object, object to action, synonym, antonym, place, degree, characteristic, sequence, grammatical, and numerical. Terms in analogies may be verbal or nonverbal (including numbers and figures), and there are many different forms in which the questions may appear. Solving analogies teaches students to think clearly and discriminate relevant from  irrelevant material, skills which are useful in many subject areas. Teachers must carefully model analogy solving, because if students misapply strategies for solving analogies or are too novel or creative in their reasoning, they will perform poorly on tests of inference skills. Teachers should (1) show students the kinds of relationships analogies include, (2) acquaint them with the forms and types of analogies they may encounter, (3) guide them through exercises, (4) monitor their practicing, (5) encourage them to form their own analogies in the context of their reading, and (6) devise activities which promote the principal abilities that underlie intelligent behavior. This will help students do well on standardized tests and reason with more cognitive sophistication. (An appendix  listing principal abilities underlying intelligent behavior and a reference section conclude the document.) (SKC)",

Subjects--age/grade matched and reading ability matched groups of poor and normal readers in grades two and six--were given tests of phonemic segmentation and alphabetic mapping ability and then randomly assigned to one of five different treatment conditions: (1) a name familiarization condition; (2) a phoneme segmentation/alphabetic mapping condition; (3) an &quot;eclectic&quot; condition with both types of  instruction; (4) a control condition with both the learning and transfer tasks; and (5) a control condition with only a transfer task. All subjects were then administered an alternate form of a phoneme segmentation test used as the pretest. Findings showed that the poor readers performed significantly below the normal readers on both the pretest and the posttest of phonemic segmentation ability. Findings also showed that poor readers at both grade levels performed significantly below the normal readers on the free recall subtest of response acquisition and on the picture-syllable subtest of response acquisition. Results indicated that both name retrieval and alphabetic mapping are important determinants of skill in word identification and that deficiencies in either skill will cause  reading disability.

        "description":"Intended for reading teachers and teacher educators, this book provides an analysis of 12 fallacious beliefs thought to be responsible for the perpetuation of ineffective and inappropriate approaches to reading instruction. The introduction looks at the dangers of the myths that underlie reading instruction, discusses how the myths arise out of an apparently historical opposition to phonics instruction, and touches on the goals of the book. The next 12 chapters examine the myths (and research refuting them) which are as follows: (1) phonics hinders comprehension, (2) unpredictable spelling invalidates phonics, (3) reading is based on \"sight words,\" (4) reading is best taught in sentences, (5) oral language test scores equal reading readiness, (6) word length makes no difference,  (7) instruction should match students' preferred learning modalities (visual or aural orientation), (8) letter names are unimportant, (9) dictionary syllabication is needed, (10) reading tests should be replaced by oral reading miscue analysis (ORMA), (11) subvocalization is bad, and (12) oral reading is dangerous. The next chapter discusses why the myths of reading instruction prevail, citing such factors as publishers and writers of basal readers; prejudice and lack of knowledge about phonics, opposition to phonics from teachers' organizations, and the underuse of research findings. The last chapter argues that the compulsion to dispel the myths must come from forces the reading establishment opposes: a national commission on literacy, merit pay for teachers, an educational voucher  system, and private sector training of teachers.

This corpus of contextual data demonstrated that student-teacher interactions were a critical influence on the nature of academic writing produced by the students. Analysis of these interactions revealed (1) that teachers' views of relationships between language and learning in their respective disciplines strongly influence the nature of  writing in their classrooms; (2) that cultural, academic, and discipline-specific traditions frequently cause dissonance between teachers' pedagogical ideals and the writing they assign; and (3) that students' academic writing reflects the conflict between these first two findings.

Inquiries were sent to press associations to identify publishers who served as public officials, and five publisher/public officials were selected for interview. Additionally, the newspapers they published were examined, and 75 of their readers were polled for their reactions to the newspapers and their publishers. Results showed varied responses from major newspapers, ranging from those who discouraged such  activity for fear of conflict of interest, to one who encouraged its editors/publishers to remain active in such community affairs. Results of reader questionnaires suggest that most disagree in principle with editors holding public office, but many do not object to their own newspaper editors doing so. Results from the five interviews suggest that some editor/public officials become printers of &quot;good news&quot; newspapers, using them for community morale boosting. Others are more like the fiery libertarians of the nineteenth century, using their newspapers to attack political opponents. A third style is the editor/official whose newspaper is bland and not thought-provoking. (JC)",

        "description":"In the interest of applying reader response theory to journalism this paper posits that readers of newspapers, like readers of literature, take an active role in making meaning from the articles they read, rather than passively accepting news as a finished, static product. Additionally, it proposes that journalism textbooks pay little attention to the role of the reader, hence affecting the way future journalists will write. Specific areas addressed in the paper are: (1) the news as narrative, which discusses two views of the structure of news stories; (2)audience approaches in cultural studies, which offers various notions of how audiences go about interpreting news articles; (3)literary reader response theories; (4) inter-media differences, which examines the differences in  roles of readers of literature and viewers of film and television; (5) the role of readers in journalism textbooks; and (6) \"New Journalism\" as metalanguage. The paper concludes that by incorporating reader response theory in journalism education, and changing the way journalists think, they may come to understand how readers differ from one another, how they differ from reporters, and how reporters and readers together make meaning, while the study of the linguistic and conceptual forms used by real people to give meaning to their situations would offer journalists new rhetorical tools.

        "description":"Since the 1974 Supreme Court dicta in &quot;Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,&quot; many courts have held that statement of opinion is constitutionally protected. However, statements that appear to be opinion based on undisclosed facts or knowledge not generally known to the public can be an exception. For instance, courts have protected specific unfavorable restaurant and book reviews, but refused to protect as opinion a statement by the owner of a baseball team, reported in a newspaper, that the club's former general manager was a &quot;despicable human being.&quot; This presents a problem for the media, which may be impeded in debating issues of public concern for fear that the opinions they publish, which had formerly been protected under fair comment, may not be qualified for legal protection. The  Restatement of Torts in 1977 attempted to distinguish between &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;mixed&quot; opinions, and a later torts hornbook posited &quot;deductive,&quot;&quot;evaluative,&quot; and &quot;informational&quot; opinions. Courts have also taken the possibility of intended malice and &quot;rhetorical hyperbole&quot; into account. To protect the right to debate issues of public concern, courts should consider merging the ideas of Judge Robinson's dissent in &quot;Ollman v. Evans&quot; and the Supreme Court's opinion in &quot;Philadelphia Newspapers v. Hepps,&quot; and protect any comments, without consideration of whether they are fact or opinion, that cannot be proven false. (Four pages of footnotes are included.) (JC)",

        "description":"Contrary to the prevailing view that 1952 was the year of the first nationally televised political conventions, only 32 states had TV stations at that time; nor did the term &quot;TV candidate&quot; originate in the Kennedy (1960) or Nixon (1968) campaigns. In fact, it is Dwight Eisenhower and the campaign of 1956 that deserve this recognition. Contemporary journals, memoirs, and live interviews with members of each party's presidential campaign show that Eisenhower's 1956 election committee was the first to make television the primary component in a presidential campaign, substituting live TV appeals for campaign travel because of the president's ill health. The Republican convention innovated technology and production styles such as on-the-floor interviews, split screens, on-screen vote  totals, and teleprompters. Abandoning the traditional whistle stop strategy in favor of select airplane appearances in politically crucial locales, Eisenhower relied on television to achieve blanket exposure. In contrast to the Republicans, Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate, viewed the medium as a necessary evil, used grass-roots campaigning, neglected television strategies, and faltered during TV appearances. Although television's effect on the election outcome cannot be assessed, post-election studies indicate that TV enhanced Eisenhower's image, particularly that of his health, while Stevenson bemoaned the impossibility of making issues during a media influenced campaign. Campaign participants in both parties used their 1956 experience with television in later elections. This  and other findings suggest that the 1956 campaign had greater impact on mass media history than previously recognized. (JG)",

        "description":"Evaluation of freshman English programs is a process involving recursive steps, such as planning which elements to review, securing resources to carry out the review, actually reviewing the planned elements, and providing written reports to decision-makers. The four elements of an educational program--contexts, input, process, and product--cohere tightly, and all important elements in an educational program may have to be improved for significant change to occur. A professional evaluator of English programs plans the intensity of the review and is involved in deciding how to respond to the political-practical circumstances impinging on the review. An evaluator also needs substantial financial resources, a year or more of time, help from a committee, consultations with other  professionals, secretarial services, and research and editorial assistance. Although not everyone agrees on the goals of an English program, an evaluator will describe the goals or contexts as they appear on the basis of documents, interviews, and observations. It is crucial that evaluators review human and non-human resources in most English programs. A comparison of a program's courses and sections with those of typical programs can be made, and if discrepancies exist, a formal report should suggest alternative procedures. Expert information on the evaluation elements of teaching-learning and achievements is readily available. Professional evaluators' insights can help make the process of evaluation fair, efficient, and thorough. (References are appended.) (NKA)",

        "description":"Several aspects of the history of religious broadcasting are examined in this paper. First, the paper provides an informative review of scholarly treatments of the history of religious broadcasting in the United States, tracing the evolution from early broadcasts of simple church services to today's evangelical paid-time programming. The paper then traces recent developments in the structure of religious television, and identifies three major trends: (1) the growth of high-energy, entertaining evangelical presentations; (2) the adoption of the broadcast/cable network system; and (3) the adaptation of traditionally secular television formats to the religious task. Next, the paper describes the viewership of religious television via a review of pertinent research literature,  identifying a shift away from the stereotypical older, female viewer. The potential social effects of religious television are then explored, with primary emphasis on three areas which have garnered great criticism: the impact of religious television viewing on church attendance, the purported negative impact of religious television solicitations on church contributions, and the role of politics in religious television. Finally, the paper provides a brief description of an original investigation which examined the availability and scope of religious television in the United States. Throughout, a trend toward blurring the line between religious and secular telecasting is noted. (Author/SKC)",

Results showed that most teachers used a textbook to teach about constitutional rights, most were dissatisfied with it, but many were willing to use supplemental materials for the unit. Most teachers indicated that their students today rated higher in their  support for traditional American institutions but lower in their understanding of them. Students' critical thinking skills were rated lower than those of students 5 to 10 years ago by 47.9% of the teachers surveyed. Most teachers, particularly journalism teachers, felt their beliefs about constitutional rights differed from those of students, administrators, and parents, but came closer to agreeing with the beliefs of national professional organizations. To ensure understanding and tolerant citizens, treatment of the First Amendment in textbooks must be improved, supplemental materials concerning constitutional rights must be made available to teachers, and more time must be spent on the subject in the classroom.

A readership survey of the November 1, 1985 issue of the Richmond (Virginia) &quot;News Leader&quot; was combined with a content analysis of that issue. In the survey, the 514 respondents indicated whether they had read or noticed each of the 203 items in that issue of the newspaper. The subsequent content analysis of the issue classified each of the news items on 15 content dimensions. The results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that the front  page of a section is the key variable in predicting readership for all news items in the paper for both age groups.

It was hypothesized (1) that education would have a positive effect on public affairs energy knowledge and energy issue relationships, (2) that education would have a positive impact on public affairs media and energy media use, and on public affairs knowledge, and (3) that energy issue salience would be positively related to energy issue relationships and public affairs mass media use. Subjects, 650 randomly selected homeowners in a Wisconsin community, completed telephone interviews over a period of three years. Results indicated  that education did have an impact on public affairs energy knowledge, but that energy media were used more evenly across higher and less educated subjects. Energy issue salience was positively related to energy issue relationships and public affairs mass media use. Findings suggested that information campaigns about energy and other complex issues need to take into account different patterns of media use and knowledge gain related to social status, particularly education. Energy communication media seem to be used equally by the more or less educated, although knowledge about energy is most consistently related to reading of newspaper energy stories by the more educated, and to viewing televised energy commercials among the less educated.

Herbert Altschull's assertion that mass media content reflects the ideology of those who finance the media. The paper notes that Altschull's theory accounts for the between-nation effects predicted by broad-scale sociological theories such as hegemony or the mass manipulative model, and shows that the theory also can explain the null effects which may result from studies looking for hegemonic effects. The first major section of the paper shows how the existing literature on media content can be analyzed according to five hierarchical levels of analysis related to Altschull's economic theory: (1)  content accurately reflects social reality, (2) content is a function of media routines, (3) content is influenced by journalists' socialization and attitudes, (4) content results from social and institutional forces working on it, and (5) content is a function of ideological positions and a tool of the status quo. The second section outlines assumptions and theoretical statements resulting from this synthesis on the influence of funding source on content and other variables. The concluding section suggests that researchers integrate the five theoretical approaches into an economic model that explains media content as the product of a more complex set of ideological forces held by those who fund the media.

A study of six freshman composition students and five writers experienced with computer writing examined how each used hard copy printouts of their compositions to supplement their evaluation of their work. Over a four-month period, the writers kept logs of their writing, noting when they made hard copy printouts, why, and what troubles they experienced with evaluating their compositions. Results initially suggested that the subjects used printouts (1) to check formatting (2) to proofread (3) to read the text to reorganize it, and (4) to read the text critically. Further study  suggested that paper copy printouts were used differently when the tasks were either familiar or &quot;knowledge forming,&quot; or long or short. Final results suggested that short, familiar tasks were easier to evaluate on the screen than long, knowledge forming ones. The findings of the study suggest that computer researchers may wish to work with software developers to alleviate difficulties with reading on computer screens, and that composition teachers working with students may wish to point out the dangers of relying completely on evaluating on-line and the benefits of hard copy evaluation.

        "description":"Since visual knowledge of the specialties within graphics and photography is difficult to pinpoint because it is nonverbal and intuitive, graphics educators fall back on teaching technical expertise--the procedures and equipment used for newspapers, magazines, and television stations. For centuries visual knowledge was the realm of the unlettered, the communication system for the ignorant, and only in the modern era has meaning been found for the term \"visual literacy.\" By 1920, Roger Fry had proposed that all art could be seen as essentially an arrangement of shapes, lines, and colors--a concept that formed the basis for formalist criticism, now pervasive in the thought and teaching of almost all things visual. While a visual language was emerging in art, the older definition  (art as storytelling) persisted in the popular mind and was adopted in the early seventies by the \"visual literacy\" movement in education. However, reading pictures is not exactly like reading language. The definition of visual literacy might include recognition of the value of visual experience. Instead of seeing only symbols and their hidden meanings, the adult eye might be trained to see their textures and patterns and to know enough of the formal elements to interpret ordinary visual images. Higher forms of visual literacy might include the principles of design, such as unity and proportion, derived from classical theories of aesthetics. Graphics instructors sometimes confuse technical computer skills with real visual knowledge, but intuitive aspects of visual knowledge could be  explored in the computerized studio. This applied arts approach draws on theoretical developments of art and on the applied nature of professional and technical education. (Footnotes and references are appended.) (NKA)",

        "description":"To clarify numerous points of contention surrounding Elizabeth Noelle-Neumann's spiral of silence theory, according to which individuals' media-influenced perception of their congruence or incongruence with dominant opinion determines their willingness to speak out in public, a study examined the relationship between opinion expression, perceived congruence, and several other variables. A telephone survey of opinions on the abortion issue among 432 residents of Madison, Wisconsin, tested the significance of the following factors in the relationship between opinion and expression: (1) individual's perception of the &quot;dominant&quot; opinion both nationally and locally; (2) demographic factors, including political party affiliation; (3) personal knowledge about the issue; (4) personal  issue involvement; and (5) previous behavior toward the issue. Multiple regression was used to assess the relative contribution of all of the above factors in predicting willingness to speak out. The results provided only limited support for the spiral of silence theory. The resulting data showed a greater willingness among members of a minority opinion subgroup to publicly express their opinions than was previously recognized, with issue involvement emerging as a consistently significant predictor. The influence of local opinion appeared to be less compelling than the perceived national opinion. The results suggest that the situation in which an individual is supposed to express his or her opinion, the nature of the issue, demographic and psychographic characteristics of the individual,  perceptions of majority opinion, and the salience of opinions of other groups, are also significant conditions which should be integrated into future models of opinion expression.

The first section of the book provides an overview of the three theories, specifically their assumptions and rhetorics. The main chapters cover the following topics: (1) the nineteenth-century background, on the formation of the English department and the subsequent relationship of rhetoric and poetic; (2) the growth of the discipline (1900-1920), including the formation of the National Council of Teachers of English, the appearance of the major schools of rhetoric,  the efficiency movement, graduate education in rhetoric, undergraduate courses and the Great War; (3) the influence of progressive education (1920-1940), including the writing program and current-traditional rhetoric, liberal culture, and expressionistic and social rhetoric; (4) the communication emphasis (1940-1960), including the communications course, the founding of the Conference on College Composition and Communication, literature and composition, linguistics and composition, and the revival of rhetoric; and (5) the renaissance of rhetoric and major rhetorical approaches (1960-1975), including contemporary theories based on the three epistemic categories. A final chapter briefly surveys developments through 1987. (JG)",

The paper encourages small-group peer discussion to ensure that every draft of every assignment has a real audience on the same level as the writer, as well as to engender a relaxed atmosphere in the classroom. The first section of the paper offers students (1) a framework for writing illustrated by improvisation of a metaphor; (2) an experience involving the basic processes that students can identify with and use for a model; (3) examples of universal audiences; (4) a series of stories  about potential relationships to audiences; and (5) positive motivation to learn a new and effective strategy for generating audiences of their own choosing. Stating that, in using the identification strategy for generating new audiences, the writer will learn to take three distinctive points of view--his own, the audience's, and that of a director watching the interaction between writer and audience, the central section of the paper identifies and explains the steps necessary to accomplish this. The final section of the paper provides examples of the kinds of activities that teachers can practice with their students to initiate useful audience strategies. (References are attached.) (NKA)",

Following an introduction on the memorization/cognition camps in spelling research, the paper discusses current, but less effective, classroom practices, such as studying lists of &quot;demon&quot; words, writing words several times, using inappropriate word lists, studying homonyms, and sentence dictation. The paper then examines research based practices, including invented spelling, and discusses four goals that focus on the purposes of learning strategies to improve spelling. Next, the paper presents eight effective instructional strategies: (1) using self-corrected tests  and a study strategy, (2) using word lists, (3) relating spelling instruction to writing activities, (4) keeping formal spelling lessons to optimum length, (5) using typewriters and the &quot;Imagetics&quot; machine, (6) using games for spelling instruction, (7) using computers for spelling improvement, and (8) using standardized test formats.

Classroom instructional settings can be full of discovery and learning if teachers provide many prewriting opportunities that allow children to discover opportunities for writing. These experiences should cut across the curriculum and include writing, speaking, drawing, and listening to encourage children to make the best of both their imagination and their knowledge. Important tasks for teachers are helping students learn when to use knowledge and when to use imagination, when to talk, and when to listen. For example, children can be allowed to engage in many different kinds of handwriting activities, such as informal, personal, creative, and  letter writing. Such activities can be used to teach children about appropriate choices--answering abstract questions can take concrete form; personal questions can stimulate creative responses; spontaneous events can inspire writing about classroom surroundings; the experiences of others (such as parents) can inspire children to live vicariously; and everyday experiences can provide endless themes for writing. Teachers should also be aware that varied writing topics require wider audiences, and provide children with outlets for writing for others.

A second section suggests implications of this model for classroom instruction, followed by a section providing information on how to find out more about the Perry model. A fourth  section looks at the Toulmin model of cognitive development, which is characterized by a six-step system of rational argumentation, and how the model may be applied in the classroom.

The importance of the reader's part in literature is first demonstrated, noting that attention must be paid to who the readers are, their expectations of the text, and the choices they make as they read. The digest next differentiates between the efferent stance, in which the reader is primarily concerned with what he or she will carry away as information from the text, and the aesthetic stance, in which the reader focuses primarily upon the experience lived through during the reading. The digest notes that efferent stance is appropriate when seeking information,  while the aesthetic stance is useful when the reader wishes to experience the full emotional, aesthetic, and intellectual experiences afforded by the text. Uses of transactional theory in teaching are then discussed, emphasizing the following principles: (1) the &quot;poem&quot; is within the reader, (2) primary responses should be considered, (3) the classroom atmosphere should be cooperative, (4) the conception of literary knowledge will be expanded, and (5) transactional analysis is related to other literary studies. The most salient principles of instruction are also outlined, including: response; giving ideas time to crystallize; and opening up the discussion to the topics of self, text, and others. (SKC)",

Following an introduction to the critical thinking movement, the digest assesses the impact of critical-thinking inflected developmental psychology on composition studies. The digest notes the increasing attention paid in composition textbooks and rhetorical theories to mental attitudes and emotional dispositions that foster or impede critical thinking and to the application of stage-developmental  criteria of critical thinking (such as the progression from egocentricity to reciprocity and from conventional to autonomous thought, and the acquisition of the ability to reason back and forth between concrete and abstract, personal and impersonal, literal and hypothetical). The digest builds the case that literature study--because it relies on the capacities of criticism, dialogue, perception of multiple viewpoints, synthesis and reasoning--has always developed and facilitated the mental dispositions currently emphasized in critical thinking circles. Finally, to attest to the educational importance of humanistic letters, the digest cites research concluding that cognitive development requires a substantial body of specific knowledge and suggests that in this light critical thinking can  rejuvenate the English profession.

        "description":"Dialogue journals are recommended in this digest for teachers who want to involve every student in a literacy practice that unites reading and writing and encourages thinking and reflection. The digest first explains that dialogue journals are useful because they use writing as a genuine means of communication between student and teacher. Dialogue journals then are defined as bound composition books in which each student carries on a private conversation with the teacher for an extended time. The history of these journals, which were first developed by a sixth grade teacher in California, is detailed, and sample teacher-student exchanges are also provided. The digest next explicates some of the benefits of dialogue journals to students: (1) they create a one-to-one relationship  between student and teacher in which both academic and personal concerns are discussed; (2) they provide opportunities to use newly acquired reading and writing skills; (3) they allow students to engage in reflection about experiences and to think about adult problems, choices, and ideas; (4) they give students a chance to engage in natural uses of different kinds of writing--narration, description, argumentation, even poetry; and (5) they let students read a personalized text, that is, the teacher's responses. Benefits of dialogue journals for young children, less proficient writers, and ESL students are also discussed, together with a brief justification for the time required for teachers to respond to each student. Twelve references are appended. (SKC)",

        "description":"Investigative journalists long have had an adversarial relationship with powerful institutions and those in public office, stemming from the &quot;righteously indignant&quot; reporters of the early nineteenth century penny presses who guarded the interests of the public. Currently, investigative journalists are in a difficult position if they have to report news of moral transgressions, while remaining morally neutral. When documenting transgressions, they tend to circumvent the problem by (1) citing the law, (2) citing codes of conduct, (3) citing experts, or (4) appealing to common sense. Yet all news, how objective it purports to be on its &quot;surface level&quot; is inherently linked to morals because the subject(s) of the story have crossed some moral boundary, identified by the reporter.  Hence reporters in their role as &quot;watchdogs&quot; not only reflect the moral norms of society but actively fashion and legitimate the very consensus they ostensibly only convey. However, because investigative journalists select from a limited range of dominant moral standards, accept these standards uncritically, and present them &quot;objectively,&quot; they can evade responsibility for contributing to the definition and legitimation of what usually appears to be an &quot;independent&quot; moral order. The values journalists espouse in the &quot;deep level&quot; of their stories only become apparent in a historical and cultural treatment of news. (Seven endnotes and 46 references are included.)

        "author":["Burd, Gene"],
        "description":"Exploring the idea that urban culture has changed food sharing practices and, in effect, produced a cultural &quot;advertisement&quot; in the marketing and selling of the fast food franchise, this paper discusses the commercial replication of community and the communion of food sharing in this new fast food culture. Following an introduction that addresses the concerns and alarms raised in much popular literature and by some academic researchers on the changing American culture, the paper explores the notion of &quot;eating as communication,&quot; and how family patterns created a market for fast food. The paper then examines changes in urban food use patterns that began with the threat of urban decentralization, growing out of the hegemony of the automobile and the opening up of the interstate  highway system in the late 1950s. The paper also considers fast food demographics and presents company officials' descriptions of several fast food chains, along with special techniques or themes that appear in their advertising to convince the whole family to eat together in their restaurants. The fact that fast food establishments have frequently been the focus of urban crime and violence, despite their open, clean, and safe image, is then explored, followed by some thoughts on the future of the fast food culture in American life. The paper closes with a brief thematic summary, emphasizing that to study both the messages of advertisements and the medium of fast food yields more about communication and community than would a separate study of either.

The first section looks at the impetus for such a pre-practice course, and notes that previous education majors had encountered a gap between the theories they had learned in their college classes and the problems they faced as student teachers. This section goes on to describe the belief of the English department and professional and governmental organizations that such teacher inadequacies were contributing to high rates of attrition and illiteracy. The second section describes the course design and applications, emphasizing student  experience in specially selected high school classrooms and team-teaching of the education course by high school teachers who have graduated from the Boston Writing Project and by English Department faculty. This section stresses the heavy reading load and the hands-on application of theory to the classroom. A final section suggests implications for the course and notes the importance of cooperation between the high school teachers and the college faculty, the need for a greater role for the Boston Writing Project, and the need for the course to have a more direct connection to experts in specialized areas of literacy.

        "description":"To demonstrate that peer evaluation is an appropriate means of improving written composition, particularly in terms of audience and goal orientation, the use of peer evaluation as a teaching method is discussed and then the connection between peer evaluation and audience awareness is drawn. Based on observation of Dutch 17-year-old students, the following reasons for having students' written work evaluated by the writers' peers were adduced: (1) students learn more about writing, (2) students are better at judging audience orientation, (3) students are better at telling each other what is good and what is bad, (4) students make multiple and analytical evaluation possible, (5) peer evaluation leads to increased writing frequency, and (6) peer evaluation means immediate feedback.  Both educational theory and communication theory support these observations, as does research done in Holland on the effect of peer evaluation, which has shown that students are as effective as teachers in evaluating peer writing. Other studies have shown neither positive nor negative effects of peer evaluation, perhaps because they measured inappropriate aspects of written composition ability. A proposed set of experiments examining the influence of peer evaluation on goal orientation, audience orientation, and news value will better reflect the benefits of peer evaluation. Because the peer audience is both immediate and &quot;real,&quot; students will be more aware of their audience and the metacognitive aspects of their writing will be enhanced.

Teaching strategies offered in the first section of the booklet are designed to stimulate language exploration with such activities as examining the subjectivity of magazine news reports, inventing new words and definitions, preparing and presenting consumer reports, and compiling books of family lore and local history. Activities in the second section are designed to stimulate an appreciation and understanding of classical and contemporary literature, and to suggest techniques for introducing literary works to students. Specific activities in this section can be used to help students  understand the importance of the oral history of Beowulf, predict what might happen next in a novel, analyze an author's style, compose letters based on Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock,\" write an additional episode for H. G. Wells's time traveler, and develop conversations about a novel read out of class. Activities in the third section, intended to help students improve the conception and clarity of their prose through prewriting and writing, include writing an operating manual for a household device, analyzing the interactions of writing response groups, practicing descriptive techniques using thesauri, journals and personal scrapbooks, and writing the most trite, cliched story possible.

        "description":"To learn more about how people read literary texts, with a view to improving the way literature is taught in schools, a study examined the extent to which the reading of literature is affected by variations in readers, texts, and situations. Subjects, 12 skilled (faculty) readers and 96 novice (undergraduate) readers, read a short story, either in its original version or in a version in which textual &quot;evaluations&quot; (figurative language) had been replaced by nonevaluative phrases. Participants read the story in conjunction with one of two orienting tasks, a plot-related question to induce &quot;story-driven&quot; reading or a frame-related question to induce &quot;point-driven&quot; reading. Results indicated that readers of evaluated text tended to prefer phrases containing discourse evaluations to a  greater extent than readers of paraphrased text preferred the corresponding phrases. Results also indicated that what readers found most striking in a literary text was influenced by characteristics of the text--in this case, its evaluative structure. However, readers' sensitivity to evaluative language was modified by the situation in which the reading occurred, oral or silent. Other results indicated that readers given the frame question were in greater disagreement about the story than were the readers given the plot question. The effect of the frame task was to make the undergraduates' responses more closely resemble those of the faculty readers. Findings direct attention to the possibility of point-driven literature instruction. (A table of evaluative sentences and their  corresponding paraphrases and references are attached.) (NKA)",

Work dependency is a structural variable that influences individual information processing needs, while response satisfaction is a relational variable pertaining to the communication climate of organizations. For Study One, conducted in the first few months of operation of a retail store, employees completed a scale developed by Jablin (1978). Study Two, carried out in a consumer goods warehouse, measured variables traditionally examined in the framework of the International Communication Association audit. The results of Study One established a link between satisfactory supervisory relationships and variables dealing with supervisor understanding and  getting the information needed to perform one's job. In Study Two, overall communication satisfaction was strongly related to the need for information from specific others. The results of both studies emphasized the importance of horizontal communication relationships for response satisfaction, and taken together revealed the complex interrelationship between two variables which are embedded in the overarching theories of systems and human relations.

It first examines the informal curriculum, listing statistics on children's exposure to the mass media; noting that children remember advertising slogans from childhood television shows better than memorized facts from school; and describing inaccurate views of the world the media instill in young people. The second section focuses on the formal curriculum, stressing the lack of high school and grade school instruction about the mass media--even courses on journalism are technically rather than  ethically oriented. University level efforts at ethics instruction are covered in the third section, recognizing both the encouraging increase in ethics and mass communication courses and the discouraging lack of graduate studies in these fields. Counterbalancing guidelines--that parents must stress the unreal nature of television programs and advertisements and that advertisers and the government must take their responsibility for the informal curriculum seriously--are introduced in the fourth section. The fifth section presents qualitative guidelines for the formal curriculum, aiming for understanding of self, other cultures, other professions, and all periods of history. A concluding section reiterates the value of ethics--it enables humans to think, know, express, and act.  (SKC)",

        "description":"Expectancy effects--the unconscious shaping of receiver behavior by signalling sender expectations--while recognized in science, have not been documented extensively from a communication perspective, nor are nonverbal aspects of expectancy effects fully known. Expectancy is a function of three elements, the sender's predisposition (including stereotypes), reinforcement (including nonverbal rewards and punishments), and correspondence bias (where the sender assumes that the receiver's behavior confirms the sender's expectations). Expectancies can be observed in the following instances of media politics: (1) when voters project stereotypical idealizations of the candidates, which are fulfilled when the televised candidate generates nonverbal actions congruent with these  expectations (e.g. the public desire or expectation of a folksy president is answered by Carter washing his socks in a motel room); (2) when politicians reinforce a preconception held by the public, (e.g., by acting on the belief that public opinion is more important than policy, thereby increasing the importance of the public opinion variable); or (3) when pollsters, by having an expectation of what a correct answer should be, word their questions or send nonverbal cues in ways that signal the proper response to questions. These examples show that nonverbal variables seem to have a significant impact on generating stereotypes (which results in a false disposition), and nonverbal variables also play a key role in the reinforcement step of expectancies. Appendixes include an outline of  strategies for control of experimenter expectancy effects and procedures for generating experimenter expectancies. (JG)",

        "description":"Noting that breaking off romantic relationships can be traumatic even when the end is welcome, this paper describes the strategies and stages of relationship termination and suggests ways for instructors of oral interpretation and/or interpersonal communication classes to illustrate such relational decay. The first section deals with relationship termination strategies, identifying M. J. Cody's five general strategies: behavioral de-escalation, identity management, justification, de-escalation, and positive tone. Examples of statements made by persons using each termination strategy are included, but not examples of specific situations. The second part of the paper looks at M. L. Knapp's five stages of relationship decay: differentiation, circumscription, stagnation, avoidance,  and termination. The paper notes that stages are said to be useful, but as with the strategy list, a lack of specific examples reveals a need for something more. In the third section, oral interpretation of literature is suggested as a means for providing students with concrete examples of the relationship termination strategies and stages. Passages suggested come from novels, poems, and plays such as: &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (Wilde); &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; (Hardy); &quot;Candida&quot; (Shaw); &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (Albee); &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (Goldman) and &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (Waugh). The paper indicates stages and strategies exemplified in each passage, and suggests that performing these scenes in communication classrooms will facilitate lively discussion and encourage the  examination of the complexities of real life relationships experiencing termination.

        "description":"Even though television scholar Herbert Zettl singlehandedly created the term &quot;television aesthetics&quot; by proclaiming that TV is an art, television studies are still excluded from the respectable divisions and disciplines of knowledge. Television is considered the epitome of mass culture/kitsch, and the very idea of a TV &quot;masterpiece,&quot; for example, is improbable. &quot;Television theory&quot; would be a preferable label for a field of study that has been developing in isolated strands since the 1930s, and which can be divided into roughly four stages: (1) through the early 1950s--the main theoretical question was whether TV is itself an art or merely a &quot;transmission device&quot; for the other arts; (2) early 1950s to early 1960s--the Golden Age of TV proved that its dramatic form can be  artistically powerful; (3) early 1960s to early 1970s--TV penetration into American homes reached 99% by the 1970s; and (4) early 1970s to the present--video art and low-cost technology proliferated. Marshall McLuhan noted that most thinking about a new medium is done in terms of old media. As television theory develops, new concepts of what TV is, how it got to be that way, why it remains that way, and how and why to change it, will be formulated. (Footnotes, a very extensive chronological bibliography of works related to television theory, and a comprehensive list of production books and dissertations are appended.) (NKA)",

        "description":"To make introducing logic to college students in speech and expository writing classes more interesting, letters to the editor can be used to teach logical fallacies. Letters to the editor are particularly useful because they give students a sense of the community they live in (issues, concerns, and the spectrum of opinion), they are easily available, they contain obvious logical fallacies, and they stimulate lively and interesting class discussions. To use these letters in class, the teacher first introduces the syllogism and why fallacies should be avoided. Some of the most prevalent types of fallacies are then introduced, and these fallacies are located in a sample letter to the editor. Some types of fallacies, such as ad hominem and hasty generalizations are easy for students  to locate, while others, such as begging the question fallacies, are more subtle and thus more difficult to discern. Using letters to the editor teaches students that many people who express opinions openly in local newspapers do so on the basis of little knowledge, and that the credibility factor in writing is crucial--one logical flaw can ruin any argument. In addition, creative teachers can arrange several assignments around letters to the editor, including group projects, analytical papers, rebuttal writing and preparing speeches. (Four examples of letters to the editor and analysis for logical fallacies are included.) (SKC)",

        "description":"The most extensive use of dream imagery in popular culture occurs in the visual arts, and in the past five years it has become evident that music video (a semi-narrative hybrid of film and television) is the most dreamlike media product of all. The rampant depiction and implication of dreams and media fantasies in music video are often strongly encouraged by the lyrics and soundtrack, formal requirements. Song lyrics, sometimes fragmented and rarely telling a coherent story, encourage elliptical video narratives, arbitrary and/or unrealistic settings, and direct address to the camera. The visuals often imply that the singer is thinking or dreaming the soundtrack. An informal analysis yields several key nonverbal indicators of dream in pop records, such as whispering, frequency  filter effects, echo, reverberation, tremolo, sounds played backwards, a tendency to take liberties with rhythm, instrumental improvisation, and sometimes a background drone effect. The theory of dream imagery and mediation aids in explaining some of the more mysterious features of several popular videos, such as (1) \"Shame\" (Motels), (2) \"Don't Come Around Here No More\" (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers), (3) \"Heaven\" (Bryan Adams), (4) \"Undercover of the Night\" (Rolling Stones), and (5) \"Good Lovin'\" (Young Rascals).

Subjects, 237 well-to-do male and female adults living in a large multicultural city on the West Coast and self-identified as to ethnic group, responded to an instrument administered by trained interviewers. Results indicated that Blacks were more likely than other ethnic groups to interact with strangers, and that Asians were the least likely. The four groups did not differ in their reasons for interaction with strangers,  which included interest, companionship and help, but rather in their reasons for not interacting, which included shyness and enculturation. Results also indicated that Whites and Hispanics were more likely to communicate with strangers at parties, on vacation, or at bars, but Blacks were more likely to interact with strangers in public places such as stores, the street, and public transportation. As expected, each ethnic group was likely to feel more comfortable communicating with strangers of like ethnicity except for Asians, who were neither more nor less likely to communicate with Asian strangers. Findings suggest that Blacks delineate an outgoing profile, while the Asian profile is reserved and cautious. (A table of data is included, and references are appended.) (NKA)",

The introduction describes the current lack of speaking and listening instruction in American schools, and defines five functions of language: controlling, feeling, informing, ritualizing, and imagining. The second section deals with the need for oral communication skills in society, pointing out that oral skills are vital for success in many careers from police work to corporate board rooms, and that oral communication training can also be of benefit at home. The  inadequacy of current high school students' oral communication training is highlighted in the third section, while the fourth section recommends practices and behavioral objectives for an overall oral communication program within the categories of (1) specific communication competence skills, (2) awareness of when standard and nonstandard English are appropriate, (3) key curriculum guidelines, (4) ideal learning environment, and (5) teacher training requirements. In the fifth section, characteristics of a strong oral communication program are enumerated, and it is stressed that oral skills activities must be part of the curriculum, appropriate for grade level, reinforced by teachers, and reinforced outside of class as well.

        "description":"The novel &quot;The Women's Room,&quot; by Marilyn French, deserves an audience both because of the timely feminist issues it addresses and because of its formal experimentation with points of view. An interpretive theatre version of the story was performed twice in 1982-83, using a script adapted from the novel, and a modified chamber theatre format (based on oral interpretation/interpreters theatre). Three actors played Mira, the main character, in terms of her emotional side, her intellectual side, and her past self. Another actor read the parts of men in Mira's life, and a fifth portrayed the women in her life. The script stressed narration over dialogue, and contained the parts of the novel that focused on two themes; how popular culture shapes the women's character, and that society  values women primarily to the extent that they are legitimized by males. Because interpretive theatre demands imagination from the audience, the sets were simple. Two rear projection screens showed slides at various points to establish cultural contexts for the narration and dialogue, and to show how popular culture affect sex roles. Repetition was used to strengthen the slide images. Other themes that tied the production together were the color red, and roses. This presentation of live performance linked with mass media demonstrated aesthetically the interconnectedness of personal, political, and cultural elements. (Two pages of notes are appended.)

Specifically, the report describes alternative strategies used to organize and manage three important instructional functions--curriculum, staff development, and supervision and evaluation. The first chapter considers issues related to managing and implementing new curricula. Curriculum reforms are not accomplished without conflict and resistance, often partially resolved by teacher and principal turnover. To &quot;sell&quot; the reforms requires staff education and training and a cautious implementation approach. Chapter 2 discusses issues  and concerns related to staff-driven and standardized staff development programs. One difficulty, besides scarce resources, is the determination of the districts to separate development and evaluation functions. The third chapter treats evaluation and supervision, focusing on two major areas: testing programs and supervision and evaluation procedures. The report recommends careful development of criterion-referenced tests and thorough training of staff members using them. Problems with testing programs and supervision and evaluation systems are thoroughly discussed. Administrators' tendency to rely on formative, rather than summative, evaluation is noted. Appended is a directory of participating school districts. (MLH)",

This paper attempts a preliminary study of school-based management, which shifts some budgetary decision-making authority from the central office to individual schools. Although many academic specialties have explored decentralization of public services, there is a dearth of empirical research on school-based management. After exploring theoretical perspectives and research questions, particularly the work of Milton Friedman, Henry Mintzberg, and Herbert Simon, this paper discusses two reasons for decentralization in educational organizations: increased accountability and efficiency. Two Canadian school districts, Edmonton Public Schools (Alberta) and Langley School  District (British Columbia) were studied to determine the structure, decision-making flexibility, accountability, and efficiency of school-based management. Results showed both districts to be considerably decentralized organizationally, if not politically. A high level of decision-making flexibility and a fair amount of accountability seem to have been achieved. The greatest impact was on the principal, who enjoys decentralization and is perceived as more powerful. Teacher satisfaction is moderately positive. Efficiency appears to have improved, as evidenced in increased levels of service and higher student and parent satisfaction. Further research is needed to substantiate these results. Included is a bibliography of 46 references. (MLH)",

        "description":"To determine if women or men have lower aspiration levels for school administrative positions, male and female administrative certificate holders were asked for their ultimate career goal. The most frequent response was superintendent (36 percent), followed by elementary principal, out of education, and professor (12 percent for each choice). The next anticipated job was out of education (21 percent), superintendent (17 percent), elementary principal (15 percent), secondary principal (13 percent), and assistant superintendent (12 percent). The ultimate goal would be sought in 4.9 years with the next job move in 2.7 years. The choice of ultimate career goal is influenced by aspirant-incumbent position, possession of a doctorate, age of children, and gender. Gender differences,  however, disappear for all but those holding the superintendent certificate, when the analysis is by gender and certificate held. In addition to the variables mentioned thus far, age and marital status also influence choice of the next anticipated position. Implications of the study for assisting women to gain administrative positions are suggested for state departments, universities, school boards, and professional organizations. Two reference pages and appendices of data conclude the report. (Author/CJH)",

Forty-one students; 14 clinical instructors; and 5 classroom instructors in nursing, dentistry, and physiotherapy participated in the study. Observations of clinical teaching; questionnaires completed by clinical students; and interviews with physiotherapy students, clinical instructors, and classroom instructors  provided the data. The results revealed that neither instructors nor students were generally preoccupied with the use of objectives; sequencing, or organization, was a chief concern; the instructional methods were effectively and consistently employed; the materials were discipline-specific; and student evaluation was a concern. A course for clinical instructors, videotaped analyses, and instructional design segments contributed by participants confirmed the relevance of each element. More research is required to advance from descriptive models toward a theory of clinical instruction. (RG)",

According to the literature, seat belts are one of many alternative and interdependent safety devices built into buses. Consequently, this report addresses three specific issues: (1) seat belts in new buses, (2) seat belts compared to other safety features, and (3) retrofitting existing buses with seat belts. Regarding the first issue, information falls into three categories: (1) active research (crash simulation studies), (2) investigations (examination of real accident statistics), and (3) discussions by local and state agencies. The studies and  testimony provide inconclusive evidence regarding safety benefits and problems of equipping school buses with seat belts. Installing seat belts on new buses or buying seat-belt-equipped buses are the best options. Many newer features mandatory since 1977 (additional riveting, strengthened roofs, shatter-proof windows, and compartmentalization) have greater potential than seat belts for preventing accident injuries. Concerning the third issue, results show that prestandard buses should not be fitted with seat belts. This report recommends replacing all 230 of Montgomery County Schools' older buses immediately. One exhibit showing an analysis of costs over a 30-month period is included. (MLH)",

          "Ginsberg, Rick"],
        "description":"Educational reform commissions and their reports can be traced back to the massive expansion of public schools during the 1890s. The reports of reform commissions over the years follow the same format: problems are identified, experts are selected to examine them, and improvement proposals are recommended. This report examines 14 national studies over nine decades from the 1890s to the 1980s. Four factors are common to the reform-by-commission process: (1) longevity, (2) generality of recommendations, (3) weak implementation strategies, and (4) limited direct impact of findings and recommendations on school system and classroom behavior. This paper explores these factors and attempts to understand the reform commission phenomenon. The persistence of national commissions cannot be  explained in terms of diagnostic and prescriptive effectiveness based on a rational, scientific method. An alternative view stressing the symbolic character of organizational behavior and commission activity as a tribal ceremony is equally difficult to substantiate. A third alternative (bringing together both rational/prescriptive and symbolic/ceremonial elements) is &quot;trickle down&quot; reform, analogous to supply side economics. This approach sanctifies the control and authority of local actors (educators, parents, and the public) and directs them to certain elements in curriculum, instruction, or organization needing improvement. In this view, the commission reform process becomes an act of faith predicated upon pronouncements made with enough strength and drama to survive in spirit, if not  letter, the filtering outcomes of trickle down. Commissions do not change schools; local educators and parents are the true reformers. Forty-eight references conclude the document. (MLH)",

        "description":"This 20-month study describes an elementary school principal, John Meyer, and examines his leadership behaviors. From an effective schools perspective, the principal is seen as the white knight who \"saves\" the children by providing an effective school. John Meyer is known as a \"turnaround\" principal who came to Garvin School (located in a Missouri school district that had once served a predominantly white population but whose racial composition began to change in 1967) and transformed it from the \"armpit of the district\" to a good school. When this educator arrived, low student achievement, nonexistent discipline, and poor staff morale were the norm. Realizing that tackling all problems at once would yield minimal results, Meyer approached instructional improvement in four  phases: discipline, achievement, attitude, and personnel. The paper details Meyer's approach, based on high expectations, a \"good feeling\" atmosphere, and close supervision. Next Meyer's leadership techniques are discussed, especially his organizational and communication skills. Meyer's approach exemplifies T. J. Sergiovanni's model of leadership based on five forces: technical, human, substantive, symbolic, and cultural. In this model, which refutes the assumption that any person trained in good management and human relations can lead an organization, the first three forces are esssential for a competent organization, and the last two are necessary for excellence. The present study provides a large database for assessing and validating Sergiovanni's leadership model. (MLH)",

        "description":"This paper identifies two broad types of \"critical\" ethnographic research. One type attempts to empower social actors by providing emic-oriented accounts which tend to emphasize the integrity of their constructs, thus laying the groundwork for a redistribution of social power. The other type attempts to combine analysis of phenomenal, micro-level experience with macro-level structural influences on schooling. The paper shows how these trends are relevant to research in educational administration through combining a structural approach which stresses the allocative function of schools and Willis' (1977) framework for understanding practitioner ideology through an analysis of the official, pragmatic, and cultural levels of institutional life.

        "description":"The Renewed Primary School project in Belgium is analyzed in this paper in terms of organizational response to a large-scale innovation, which is characterized by its multidimensionality, by the large number of participating schools, and by a complex support structure. Section 2 of the report presents an elaborated description of these characteristics. As local organizations, schools react differently to project implementation. From 1981-85, local organizational reactions were analyzed and four general types of local innovation policy emphases were distinguished: planning, interaction, risk avoidance, and cooptation. The nature of the local innovation policy influences the degree of implementation of project innovation goals. Data in section 3 illustrate the relationship between  policy type and degree of implementation. The report analyzes the importance research has given to exploring the complex relationship between the local innovation policy and the degree of implementation. In the search to understand why some schools change successfully and others do not, recent attention is focusing on differences in local school context as an explanation for sporadic positive outcomes. Such examination is recommended to improve administrators' and researchers' understanding of conditions under which change initiatives succeed and fail. (CJH)",

(2) Given particular developments in European society and the nature of primary research data, what should schools be like in the year 2001? (3) What steps are being taken in research and development to answer these questions? Because such fundamental questions have no easy answers, this discussion is limited to reflections based on educational research and development experiences in various Western European countries. Section 2 of the report analyzes characteristics of large-scale innovation projects in education. The context of school improvement is discussed, and the meaning of school improvement is interpreted. To provide an  illustration to the second research question, the report's third section explores specific tasks facing schools in 2001 by referring to Belgium's comprehensive Renewed Primary School project. The processes involved in study of the large-scale innovation project are deliberated. The final section focuses on research and development questions that should be considered in the next decade. Methodological approaches to emerging complex research issues include design of long-term follow-up studies and use of multiple data sources. Twenty references conclude the report. (CJH)",

        "description":"The general meaning of research data drawn from study of school improvement programs creates the opportunity for sound theory building. By emphasizing the principal's role in policy development, this paper analyzes the characteristics of large-scale educational innovation projects and their explanatory foundations. Belgium's comprehensive Renewed Primary School project involving 275 schools illustrates the link between theory and practice. Vaguely formulated project goals encourage differing innovative configurations among schools, which are additionally influenced by the principal's role. Interviews with teachers from 24 schools revealed 4 types of local innovation policy emphasis: planning, interaction, risk avoidance, and cooptation. Each school's level of implementation was  assessed from teaching activities data and project ratings. Analysis indicates that principals intervene differently in schools with a high level of implementation compared to schools with a low level of implementation. The search for the relationship between interventions and implementation involves locating an underlying explanatory factor that &quot;creates meaning.&quot; Perceiving leadership as a language game suggests that language is the vehicle conveying meaning. Understanding the interconnections between explanatory factors provides a conceptual basis for prediction and for action-oriented studies because research and practice are linked--and are testable--through mutual feedback.

        "description":"Using personnel files provided by New York's state education department, this study examines and compares teacher retention rates in relation to region and gender from 1974 through 1984 in school districts using alternative practices of internal salary distribution. A total of 57 school districts from 2 regions of the state were included in the study, 15 districts were from a rural, 4-county region and 42 were from a suburban county outside New York City. Each region's districts were categorized according to changes during 1974-84 in relative attractiveness of salaries offered entry level (maximum 3 years experience), mid-career (9-11 years district experience), and senior teachers (minimum 17 years district experience). Although data reveal positive correlations between district  retention rates and salary improvements in both regions, regional and gender-related differences exist in teacher labor market behavior. In the wealthier, suburban region, districts that have improved the attractiveness of salaries paid to mid-career teachers have the highest retention rates, whereas the highest retention rates in the rural region are among districts experiencing little change in their salaries' relative attractiveness. Analysis of gender-related differences in labor market behavior indicates that female teachers are more responsive to salary improvements that males, particularly male teachers in rural districts. A two-page reference list and seven data tables are appended. (Author/CJH)",

        "description":"A study was done to determine whether administrator salaries in 14 Ohio school districts were a reflection of administrator responsibilities or of length of service, and to find what factors accounted for salary differentials. Although previous research suggests factors for assigning value to administrative positions, traditional salary structures are generally continued, resulting in unequal salaries. The Position Description Questionnaire gathered data from 293 administrators in the following areas: accountability and impact of decision making; responsibilities for students, staff, and budget; percentage of decisions cleared with the superior; knowledge and experience; public involvement; and demography. The questionnaire was revised, tested on 54 administrators of the  instigating district, and given to the administrators of the other 13 districts. The results revealed that (1) daily salaries did not significantly differentiate between administrator salaries; (2) personal background, professional background characteristics, and characteristics of the present position accounted for the variations in salary; and (3) gender was an important determinant of salary. A school district's compensation program should reflect what is valued about each position; unequal salaries based on gender should be avoided; and future adjustments in salary structure should show a concern for equity.

        "description":"This monograph focuses on the implementation process that has been a concern of school jurisdictions since the teacher evaluation policy became mandatory in Alberta, Canada, in 1985. Research has shown that school systems are adept at developing written policy but much less successful at putting that policy into effective operation. This overview of implementation emphasizes those structures, activities, and procedures that have enhanced implementation and those that may militate against success. This study will examine how the successful implementation of new policies in school jurisdictions may be influenced by factors such as: (1) the roles played by key participants in the process; (2) the perceptions of professional staff with respect to the &quot;real&quot; purposes of any new  policy, as opposed to stated purposes; (3) the discrepancies that develop between stated purposes and evolving practices; (4) the extent to which key participants understand how change occurs in school systems; (5) the influence of constraints such as time and resources; (6) the actual implementation strategies that are employed; and (7) and the amount and type of training that is provided. An example of an inservice training model that was successfully adopted in a school system is presented in table form. The report concludes with recommendations about training that evolves by professional growth and attention to important professional concerns. (CJH)",

An introduction explains that district personnel management functions include determining need and selection, assignment, and orientation of new staff members, and that procedures and policies should be consistent with state and federal requirements (model policies are presented in the appropriate places in this publication). Sections covering recruitment and selection offer current data and recommendations for local programs, including recruitment techniques for small districts and building principals. The section on selection policy contains three subtopics:  determining need, position description rationale, and filling vacancies. Areas considered in regard to vacancies include equal opportunity, vacancy announcements, gathering applicants' data, interviews, selection measures, assignment and certification, including certificate endorsements and certificate filing rules. In a separate section, personnel file regulations are described and a brief summary points out that recruitment and selection methods should be equitable, collaborative in decision making, reflect clearly formulated policies, and be continuously evaluated. Suggestions concerning assignment orientation are presented in selections from university educators and a citizens advisory committee. Recent findings about beginning teachers' problems and ways for districts to assist are  briefly presented, and conclusions emphasize that employee selection is the beginning of personal and professional growth, which is the essential ingredient for continued improvement in the ability to educate children.

        "description":"Adversarial collective bargaining often leads to lingering resentments. Collaborative bargaining, conversely, is a problem-solving approach to contract negotiations based on common interests and mutual respect. It is estimated that at least 500 school districts nationwide incorporate major elements of the collaborative approach in their collective bargaining. Elements that help to foster cooperation are trust and respect for colleagues. For school districts to incorporate collaborative bargaining in their negotiations, they should: obtain information and resources about what others using this approach have done; attend courses or workshops; and establish joint committees to work on school problems.

After a brief summary of education in Nigeria since independence (1960), the paper looks at problems identified in special education and at Section 8, that portion of the National Policy on Education (1977) that provides policy direction for special education. Problems resulting from cultural influences on special education are identified (e.g., the low level of parental literacy and the superstitions and taboos of ethnic cultures). The section on socioeconomic influences contrasts conditions in developed and developing nations, notes current economic problems (oil glut and low per capita income), and a lack of funding  for special education. Political influences (including corruption, mismanagement, and electoral violence and fraud) are also cited as problems which impede the development of an orderly system of special education. Among ten recommendations offered are the following: There should be &quot;uncontaminated&quot; free appropriate public education. Procedural safeguards should be inculcated into Section 8 of the National Policy on Education. The federal government should give strict guidelines to state and local governments. Teacher training should be strengthened. Excessive politicalization of social, economic, and educational decisions should be minimized. (DB)",

The report is organized according to the eight steps of curriculum adaptation used by the projects to develop their adapted materials: (1) develop a learner  characteristics profile; (2) determine teachers' instructional needs; (3) analyze textbook and compare with needs of learners and teachers to determine areas requiring modification; (4) determine specific modifications to be made; (5) develop goals and objectives for the adaptations; (6) implement ongoing formative evaluation; (7) select and train teachers for field testing; and (8) produce prototype, evaluate, and revise to develop final product.

A general lack of definitional consensus, as well as lack of agreement on eligibility criteria, were reported. Some variant of the seriously emotionally disturbed (SED) label was used by almost two-thirds of the states, despite indications that both research literature and teacher training programs prefer the BD label. Twelve states reported using the definition prescribed in Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. Clear and carefully  articulated exit criteria were developed by only 17 states (39%). A considerable variety of methods used for referral, evaluation, and program placement were reported. Although multidisciplinary staffing is one of several procedural safeguards contained in Public Law 94-142, it is required by only 77% of the 48 states that provide procedural guidelines. Effective programming for the BD/ED population will continue to be thwarted until professional consensus is obtained in the areas of definition and program eligiblity. (JW)",

Observations, interviews, file searches, and parent surveys were used to obtain multidimensional descriptions of ECSE programs, including outreach, screening, and referral practices. Two outcomes of screening were used as benchmarks for comparing programs: the percentage of eligible preschoolers screened (participation rate); and the percentage of screened children referred for further developmental assessment (referral rate). Results indicated that screening and referral practices varied considerably among programs, although few practices consistently influenced screening outcomes. Participation rates were clearly  related to school district size and the accessibility of screening to the public. Referral rates were most obviously influenced by screening purposes, second-level referral decisions, separate speech/language referral criteria, and subjective judgment. Relationships among community agencies influenced both participation and referral rates. Considerations and guidelines are presented for evaluation and improvement of ECSE screening programs.

In general, programs reported that the main objective of diagnostic assessment is to ascertain the child's eligibility for special education services. Programs tended to focus on identifying children who were mildly handicapped, as more severely handicapped children had already been identified and were being served by other programs. Referrals for diagnostic assessment came from a variety of sources, including the Preschool Screening program, physicians, parents, and community agencies. All programs had  structured screening programs that refer children to the diagnostic assessment process. A state-mandated formation of interagency collaboration committees was being implemented in all programs to promote interagency collaboration, exchange of information and service delivery, and to reduce duplication of services. All programs also included some sort of parent involvement. Assessments varied among the programs, ranging from a minimum of one hour to a more extensive 6-week diagnostic placement. The number of personnel involved in the diagnostic assessment process ranged from 3 to 8 among programs. Variation in the use of diagnostic assessment techniques was evident. (CB)",

The program was developed to supplement the &quot;Let's Be Social&quot; preschool program. The home program allows parents a choice in the amount and type of teaching activities they undertake by presenting three teaching options: home lessons (discussion of skills taught at school); coincidental teaching (helping children use a skill when naturally occurring opportunities arise); and home rehearsals (helping children practice a skill in a role-playing situation). Instructions for each activity are contained on one page and activities may take from 1 to 15 minutes. A 2-hour workshop gives parents the training needed to use the  program. Two methods of encouraging and monitoring parental involvement have been evaluated. In the first system, a home training visit was followed by weekly telephone calls and parents returned a monthly form reporting on program use. In the second system, parents received one unit weekly along with a simple checklist to return. Parents in both systems rated the program as beneficial but parents using the unit-per-week system did more teaching. Sample activity sheets for developing sharing behaviors are appended. (DB)",

        "description":"The research project investigated whether expert system tools have become sophisticated enough to be applied efficiently to problems in special education. (Expert systems are a development of artificial intelligence that combines the computer's capacity for storing specialized knowledge with a general set of rules intended to replicate the decision-making process of a human expert.) To assess the feasibility of the technology, a series of prototypes was developed, in which a range of expert system development software tools and hardware systems was used. These prototype systems, which sampled administrative assessment and instructional problems, addressed: (1) classification of students as learning disabled; (2) classification of students as behaviorally disturbed; (3)  classification of students as intellectually handicapped; (4) classification of students as having articulation problems requiring special education; (5) advice to teachers planning specific procedures to deal with behavior problems (Behavior Consultant); and (6) development of a second opinion of the appropriateness of the decision-making process used in the development of Individualized Education Programs (Mandate Consultant). Additional data are presented on the two prototypes that were taken through more extensive development and field testing. It was concluded that a need for the technology exists in special education and that it is possible to develop practical expert systems with the tools and research and development resources presently available. Nine appendixes comprising the  bulk of the document are concerned with expert systems in relation to such topics as: (1) individual education program planning; (2) diagnosing, classifying, and treating learning disabled students; and (3) evaluating the development of such systems in education.

(Expert systems are a development of artificial intelligence that combines the computer's capacity for storing specialized knowledge with a general set of rules intended to replicate the decision-making process of a human expert.) This expert system was designed as a tool for administrators of special education programs. The project utilized a four-stage product development approach: (1) product definition; (2) product design; (3) prototype development; and (4) validation of product  performance. The validation consisted of a summative evaluation designed to assess whether the expert system accurately emulated the knowledge of experienced educators. It was found that conclusions produced by consultations using Mandate Consultant generally matched the conclusions of the &quot;better&quot; human experts and exceeded the conclusions of the majority of human experts.

        "description":"The report describes the first 3 years of the Homecoming Project, which was designed to return disabled students in regional special education programs to regular classes in 26 local Vermont schools. Fifty-eight such students (of whom 45% were moderately or severely handicapped) were transitioned into regular classes and 19 other students at risk for such placement were maintained in regular education environments. The program model stresses &quot;shared ownership&quot; among regular and special educators and makes use of a local planning team and the consultative services of education specialists. The first chapter provides an overview of the project followed by a chapter which discusses essential ingredients for successful implementation of the model including administrative and  instructional staff commitment, team process, and planning. Fifteen steps in the team planning process are outlined in the third chapter. The next chapter looks at the cooperative teaming process, stressing the need to develop positive interdependence, practice collaborative skills, and monitor and discuss team member performance. Characteristics of the educational specialist and three consultation models are discussed next. The final chapter identifies issues related to implementation of the Homecoming model including reasons for local school placement. Among six appendixes are a parent inventory and a survival skills checklist. (DB)",

Two introductory papers examined demographic changes (D. Zeller) and &quot;cultural pluralism&quot; versus the &quot;melting pot&quot; idea (L. Baca). Remaining papers focus on cultural differences and parent programs with the following cultural emphases and authors: Asian (C. Yano), Hispanic (G. Rodriguez-Eagar), Pacific--Guam (F.

The presenter panel and discussion are summarized. A final summary lists 10 recommendations for reaching out to families of other cultures such as approaching each individual as an individual, knowing about the culture before approaching a family, viewing each culture as &quot;good and working,&quot; and thinking in terms of cultural differences rather than cultural barriers.

Japanese-speaking college students and American English-speaking teachers of English as a foreign language were informally questioned about food preferences, with their comments surreptitiously recorded for analysis. Results indicated that, on the surface, there are no significant differences between the Japanese and American English way of agreeing and disagreeing. When questions about food preferences were phrased in a certain way in either language, they seemed to encourage agreement. Japanese speakers did appear to be a little more indirect in stating food preferences, perhaps because they were more concerned about not offending their conversational  partners. The issue of agreement and disagreement in these two languages is very complex, and assumptions should not be made too quickly concerning possible universality. (CB)",

Subjects rated 61 requests in four different situations (differing in terms of addressee level and interrogative, declarative, and imperative forms) according to their level of politeness and frequency of occurrence in natural situations. In all situations, the size of the request was small and the familiarity was low. Requests varied linguistically in the use of verb forms, models, tenses, moods, and tags. Results indicated that the perceptions of all subjects were generally similar. However, Japanese students in the United States perceived requests as being more polite than  did Japanese students in Japan. The politeness ratings of Americans and Japanese students in Japan showed the greatest difference, and Americans and Japanese participants in the United States were the most similar. Detailed analysis of findings is presented and 16 hypotheses are tested in terms of situations and politeness, interrogatives, declaratives, imperatives, tense, requests with modals, positively and negatively worded requests, negative politeness, and frequency of use of requests.

The multiple fronting characteristics of Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian differ in terms of the following positions and behaviors: extraction from embedded questions; clitic placement and other indications of constituent status; and word order. Multiple extraction allows the movement of multiple WH words out of an embedded clause. In Bulgarian all WH words in a multiple question must move to a higher clause but only if the question is non-interrogative; in Serbo-Croatian only one WH word can be extracted from a clause. The position of clitics ( i.e. object pronouns) relative to WH words must come after the whole WH word sequence in Bulgarian; in Serbo-Croatian  the clitics follow the first WH word and may not come after the group. Adverbs, parentheticals, and various particles can also split the WH word order sequence in Serbo-Croatian but not in Bulgarian. WH words in Bulgarian occur in a relatively fixed order; for example, nominative case precedes accusative. In Serbo-Croatian, the order of the fronted WH words appears to be entirely free; for example, the accusative and nominative can occur in either order. The varying properties of Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian WH words divide other Slavic languages into two major clusters; for instance, Romanian shares the relevant properties of Bulgarian, while Polish and Czech follow the Serbo-Croatian pattern.

The investigation included interviews with officials of relevant state and federal agencies, reviews of state reports and pertinent studies, and collection of statistical information from the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Topics addressed include: number of LEP students in the United States; concentration of LEP students of particular language minority groups by school districts within each state; number of LEP students served by Title VII and Non-Title VII funds; extent to which native language is used in transitional bilingual education programs; the minimum number of LEP students required for provision of  bilingual education; and states' estimation of the number of years students remain in programs for LEP children. Results indicated that there are approximately 1.2 to 1.7 million LEP students in the United States. English was used predominantly for instruction in programs designed to serve LEP students. Most LEP students spent 2 to 4 years in a transitional program. (CB)",

        "description":"Grammatical theories that rely exclusively on the categorical nature of constituents to determine their syntactic behavior encounter problems when dealing with cleft construction. The ungrammaticality of such constructions is indeed syntactic in nature and can be shown to derive from a general principle of universal grammar (UG), restricting the range of null operators that partake in cleft construction. Theoretical assumptions underlying the clefting phenomena are reviewed, followed by a demonstration of the plausibility of a descriptive generalization concerning cleftability stated in terms of Theta Theory (Chomsky, 1981). Several apparent counterexamples to that generalization are considered which are shown to fall out of other modules of the grammar developed within the  Government Binding framework. The question of why such a generalization should hold is addressed through deeper insight into the characteristics of the null operator involved in the clefting construction. A constraint is formulated regarding the range of null operators. It is proposed that this Null Operator Generalization be extended to all base-generated empty categories, a hypothesis which is shown to rightly predict the distribution of predicate clitics in French.

The role of the American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) Proficiency Guidelines with respect to video and CALL is also discussed, and avenues are proposed for using video and CALL appropriately in the classroom. A brief look is taken at upcoming technology. The advantages brought about by the new media are more than offset by the curricular problems they create. The positive trends that will counteract potential problems include these: that (1) the ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines will unify the curriculum; (2) the media will take up  their respective niches in the curriculum and teachers will rely on them for specific tasks; (3) publishers will continue to provide methodological information and expand it to include curricular information; and (4) new technologies will add more functioning power to video and CALL, eventually merging the two into a powerful teaching tool.

A philosophical contrast between the terms of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) and computer-assisted language learning (CALL) precedes a discussion of current approaches to grammar, including pedagogical attitudes toward grammar in general, how current software represents those attitudes, and ongoing efforts to improve error analysis and feedback within that CAI paradigm. A psycholinguistic (rather than a linguistic) perspective is suggested as a different way of thinking about possible solutions to theoretical and pedagogical problems. This notion is developed into a framework for the design of CALL grammar  materials that address the problems of error analysis and feedback from this psycholinguistic perspective. Implications of the psycholinguistic approach for classroom practice and for related research in mediated second-language learning are discussed. (CB)",

It was found that nearly 40% of both men and women in the CPS reported undertaking training to improve current job skills. For a given 2-year period in the NLS, the fractions of young men, career women, and mature men reporting some training were about 30%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. For all three groups, the  employer was the single most important source of training. Only 11% of the disadvantaged sample reported some training over a similar time interval, with a relatively low proportion getting training from company sources.

While the major factor in the enrollment increases since 1978 has been higher enrollment rates for 18- to 24-year-olds, another factor has been increased enrollment by women, particularly those 25 years old and older. Implications for the future include the fact that enrollment rates for women 25 years old and older may decline as more women attend college prior to the age of 25. In addition, the enrollment rate for 18- to  24-year-olds may decline as higher proportions of college-age persons come from groups with traditionally lower college-going rates. Therefore, while enrollments have remained high in the early 1980s, a decline in the late 1980s and the early 1990s may occur. Trends in enrollment are reported by gender, age, age by gender, and race/ethnicity (White, Black, and Hispanic). Information on college enrollment estimation and the reliability of estimates is appended. (SW)",

An additional college designated as the &quot;ideal&quot; was incorporated into the students' choice set in order to operationalize the ideal point preference model. Students also evaluated the colleges on a set of 18 characteristics that influence college choice. Factor analysis was used  to reduce the 18 variables to a subset of four factors identified as: academic standards and reputation, religious emphasis and paternalism, social opportunity, and expensive and inconvenient. An ALSCAL multidimensional scaling algorithm was applied to the data and the output was a spatial representation of the colleges that reflects the competitive images students hold of these colleges and their relationship to an ideal.

Using multivariate discriminant analysis, institutions attended were predicted using the following independent variables: Scholastic Aptitude Test verbal and mathematics scores, high school grade point average (GPA), and cumulative GPA. The analysis was performed for all students and for gender and minority status groups. For the sample of 187,923 students, it was possible to accurately predict college choice for 15% of the students, 16% for black females, 16% for black males, 14% for white females, and 17% for white males.  The total structure coefficient from the discriminant analysis were similar across the five analyses. The findings support the conclusion that for students in general, institutional choice exhibits similar patterns across minority status and gender groupings. (SW)",

The policy increases the price of college through increased tuition, while at the same time targeting sufficient financial aid to ensure educational opportunity for financially needy students. In practical terms, this &quot;market rationalization model&quot; (higher tuitions offset with higher financial aid) may enhance educational opportunity more effectively than the traditional low tuition model. This policy may also become the most reasonable way to sustain quality in an area of limited resources and increasing demand for postsecondary education. In philosophical terms, the model makes sense because it focuses limited public funds on students who most need  financial assistance and charges a reasonable price for a service (education) that clearly has substantial value to the consumer. The precept behind the market rationalization model is that the public is best served by policies that strengthen market forces in consumer decision making. In Minnesota enrollments have not declined since enactment of this financial policy in 1983. (SW)",

Surveys of faculty attitudes indicate generally positive views on the impact of student ratings on instructional improvement, and provide no support for the claim that student ratings have led to increased use of traditional teacher-centered instruction. Field experiments provide clear evidence that feedback from student ratings produces improvement in perceived teaching effectiveness, particularly if student feedback is supplemented by expert consultation. There is evidence that introducing student ratings in an academic unit can produce  significant longitudinal improvement in teaching, particularly if ratings are used in salary, tenure, and promotion decisions. It is argued that, innovation is more common today than it was prior to the advent of student ratings and that highly rated teachers are more likely to use nontraditional methods than are teachers receiving lower ratings.

Of concern were three projects undertaken collaboratively between a four-year state college in Massachusetts and the local public schools during a 2-year period. The In-service Project provided opportunities for teachers and administrators to have consultants' help with curricular concerns. The Writing Project involved research on whether fourth and fifth grade students' writing ability could be improved through the acquisition and use of word processing skills. The third project, Databus, is a mobile computer laboratory that circulates among rural schools to provide instruction in the educational application of computers. Descriptive data were gathered  through questionnaires, surveys, interviews of teachers, students, administrators, and the writing samples of fourth graders. Findings are presented along with five recommendations including: a joint assessment of public school needs and ability of the college/university to respond to the latter must occur prior to design; representatives of all collaborative parties must agree on project goals, work plan, implementation, and evaluation in the developmental stage of the proposal; the Education Department and/or other relevant college departments must be prepared to give faculty members either additional stipends and/or load credits; the public schools must prepare its staff regarding the projected administrative and instructional impact of the upcoming project; and the college/university  must be committed to the collaborative ideal and provide financial support if necessary.

The 18 experts and 17 novices were presented with 32 short case histories each presented on three slides: a portrait of a patient, a patient chart containing the previous disease history, and a slide with the present complaint. Because of the sequential nature by which patient data became available during a clinical interview, contextual information is expected to be important in the initial hypotheses. Differences in the number of correct diagnoses were predicted for the two groups, if experts used the contextual information,  implicitly provided by picture and patient chart, in a more elaborate way. If this prediction was true, it would show in the amount of information explicitly recalled. The data confirmed these predictions. The experts produced 50% more correct hypotheses as compared to the novices and were able to reproduce a larger amount of relevant contextual information. In addition, a high correlation between problem-solving and recall measures was found only for the expert group. (Author/SW)",

The noncognitive dimensions on the NCQ are: self-confidence, realistic self-appraisal, especially regarding academic abilities, community service, knowledge in a field, leadership experiences related to cultural background, preference for long-range goals, understanding racism, and having a strong support person. Different noncognitive variables were significant predictors  of college grade point average (GPA) and persistence across the 8 semesters. Self-confidence and availability of a strong support person consistently predicted GPA. Persistence as found to be related to an aggregate of variables, but understanding racism and community service consistently predicted persistence. This finding suggests that GPA is related to individual variables while persistence may require an additional adjustment to environmental variables. (Author/SW)",

In the decade of the 1980s, both nations reached saturation in the labor market and underwent changes in the demand for university-trained workers. Kenya needed highly trained personnel to replace expatriates following the end of colonization. Poland needed highly trained personnel in its change to a socialistic, industrialized nation. Within the last decade both nations have met that need, but in the meantime universities in both nations have continued to pour forth graduates who have continued to find employment (usually within the government) but not always at the level for which they were trained. One alternative to the policy of both Kenya  and Poland of absorbing university graduates is to permit market forces to operate. It is suggested that trying to plan for higher education on the basis of labor needs has serious limitations. Opportunity is needed to allow youth, education leaders, and government officials to change direction in response to unpredictable market changes. (SW)",

Letters of inquiry were sent to 45 universities with faculty openings in educational administration during 1983-1984; 33 universities responded. The vitae of 25 faculty members who were hired were reviewed, along with comments provided by the search committee chairpersons. Findings include: (1) the majority (20 of 25) of individuals hired were men; (2) the average age of incoming faculty was 37 years old, with a range from 27  to 59 years old; (3) only 8 of the 25 newly hired faculty members were relocating from one university to another; (4) there was a near even split between faculty with Ed.D. degrees and faculty with the Ph.D. degree; (5) no single institution was responsible for the academic training of most new professors (i.e., the professors came from a number of schools); and (6) in only two cases were faculty members hired by institutions from which they had received their doctorates.

Findings include: individual gifts of $5,000 or more made up about one-fifth of all gifts, but accounted for 94.8% of individuals' total support of colleges and universities; donors of large gifts to the colleges and universities focused their giving on single institutions, while donors to the participating independent colleges tended to make gifts to more  than one institution; higher education is a high priority for donors of gifts of $5,000 or more; individuals with household adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 or more accounted for only 10.4% of the donors, but their contributions accounted for 61.9% of the total amount given to the colleges and universities.

The rationale for faculty participation is related to increased employee satisfaction and performance; faculty also tend to afford legitimacy and to fully cooperate in the implementation of only those policies they have helped formulate. Academic senates are useful mechanisms but are more influential at research universities or elite liberal arts colleges than at other institutions. Historically, faculty have had the broadest role in curricular and faculty personnel matters, but there are increased roles in institutional planning and administrator selection and  evaluation as well. Involvement in budgeting and retrenchment has been limited. Administrators can focus energies on four elements: strengthening collegial foundations of decision making; shaping the consultative framework; increasing the availability of information; and facilitating group deliberation.

The debate centers on six basic issues: who consults, whether it is increasing, whether faculty are shirking university responsibilities, whether they are exploiting consulting opportunities, whether they are motivated to consult primarily by economic reasons, and whether most institutional policies and procedures are adequate for governing such activity.

Current program reviews have also been designed to aid in decision making about resource reallocation and program discontinuance. Most academic program reviews draw on one or more of several formal evaluation models: goal-based, responsive, decision-making, or connoisseurship models. The underlying objective of quality is defined by four different perspectives: the reputational view, the resources view, the outcomes view, and the value-added view. Most institutions assess quality by adopting aspects of all four views. The continued existence and growth of  program review processes suggest that the efforts are supported and that the results can be beneficial, but more systematic study of their effects is needed.

        "description":"Faced with scarce resources and environmental uncertainty in the past decade, colleges and universities have experimented with different modes of academic staffing, most of which are attempts to preserve or create more flexible policies and practices. In spite of tenure systems in operation at 94% of all four year colleges, institutions have at least four major opportunities to reduce expenditures or to reallocate personnel: (1) position control (the decision to create a position or hire replacements); (2) the decision about the type of appointment to be made; (3) the decision to reduce the rate at which tenure-track faculty receive tenure; and (4) the decision to increase the number of tenured faculty leaving the institution (including post-tenure review). The effectiveness of  these four reallocation strategies must be evaluated in terms of the content and impact of budget cuts, the strengths and weaknesses of various devices for reduction and reallocation, and consultation processes. Institutions can become more flexible by adopting in the aggregate of all these practices and policies and matching them with a 3- to 5-year perspective. (LB)",

Gender issues in student aid policy include: loan burdens of women in light of the data that women generally earn lower salaries than men; women's loan default rate and their rate of bankruptcy; the award of merit scholarships to males and females; the unmet financial need under current student aid policies for single women with children because of their classification as independent students; barriers to working women in corporate benefit programs that  pay tuition; child care as a cost of attending college; contradictory policies in public welfare and student aid programs; participation of low-income females in the Guaranteed Student Loan Program; the contributions to college costs that women's parents make compared to men's parents; and award of research assistantships to women compared to men.

Consideration is given to: the effects of stress on learning, the value of feedback and control, the importance of the interaction between faculty and students, the value of stress awareness, and what students can do. When given properly, feedback can encourage positive stress that motivates students to action and discourages the negative stress that inhibits action. Specific steps by which teachers can give effective feedback include: helping students know where they stand, providing written comments on students' work, testing often enough, and arranging personal meetings with students. Ways that teachers can improve their relationships with students and enhance students' learning  include: providing structure at the onset of a course, encouraging class participation, getting to know students by name, and mobilizing student tutors and study groups. Students can reduce stress by improving their study habits, managing time wisely, learning positive self-talk, learning how to relax, and joining a student support group. A need exists to identify factors that influence the helpfulness of information in reducing stress. (SW)",

Post-tenure evaluation is not in opposition to the principle of tenure and to policy statements about tenure issued by the American Association of University Professors, provided that the evaluation is not used as grounds for dismissal and that any recommended dismissal is subject to normal academic due process. Those who support the process view it as a formative way to reinforce faculty growth and improve instruction. Some proponents also suggest its usefulness in decisions about merit pay, promotion, and dismissal for cause. Criticisms of the process include the view that it will devalue rigorous pretenure  evaluation and will erode collegial relationships. Before starting a post-tenure review process, colleges should: clearly articulate the purpose of the evaluation; involve faculty in the design of the plan and make sure faculty and administrators agree about specifics; emphasize flexibility and individualization; and link faculty development and rewards and post-tenure evaluation.

Over time these functions have expanded and participation in carrying out functions has become more active. For instance, the teaching role of the library media specialist is a dramatic and far-reaching extension of the traditional function of reference and information services. Another trend is a disparity in perceptions of the role of library media specialists between members of the profession and others, as well as between the professional literature and actual practice. New technologies, the information explosion, and recent emphasis on lifetime learning are contributing to the importance of modern school media specialists in education,  and a definable role is emerging that is responsive to a changing world even though it is based on traditional functions. This role includes: (1) collection management based on a unified media concept; (2) promotion of literacy and guidance in the use of media; (3) teaching information skills for an information society; (4) acting as a change agent in the schools through awareness of new technology and consultation on curriculum and instructional design; and (5) assuming information management responsibilities beyond the walls of the centralized library media facility.

Because 1985 was the first year states reported funding provided to the handicapped, some reports combined projects for the blind and physically handicapped and for the handicapped, and it was not possible to determine the funding provided to each separately for other states. A review of the nine state reports indicates that the predominance of effort by libraries in serving the handicapped patron has been toward the hearing impaired. Problems noted in serving the hearing impaired included lack of ability to communicate with the deaf,  lack of technology to provide services to the deaf, and lack of resource materials necessary to provide full service; however, steps being taken to overcome these difficulties were also reported.

        "description":"The recent increased awareness of the importance to our economy of innovation and the development of new technologies has been coupled with the crafting of new legislation to increase the level of intellectual property protection available to innovators. Because one of the key methods of encouraging the efficient use of intellectual property is through licensing, it is crucial that our laws not unnecessarily discourage such licensing. Bills seeking to foster procompetitive licensing arrangements such as H.R. 557 and S. 438, as well as administration proposals such as those included in Title III of H.R. 1155 and S. 539, are intended to reassure American firms that the licensing of intellectual property will not receive hasty and harsh treatment under antitrust laws. H.R. 557  assures that only licensing arrangements proven to be anticompetitive will be held unlawful, while H.R. 1155 goes further to clarify and reform the doctrine of patent misuse and to clarify laws governing license challenges to patent validity. This legislation would strike a better balance between the rights of the patent owner and the rights of the licensee and give them greater freedom to negotiate terms that suit their needs, thus reducing the uncertainties that may now be deterring procompetitive licensing.

The study also tested whether or not significant correlations exist between the students' demographic characteristics and the use/nonuse of library areas, materials, and services. Data were collected by means of self-administered questionnaires completed by 646 students out of a systematically selected sample of 922 students exiting the library during one day of normal hours of library  operation. Although a demographic profile was developed from descriptive study data, analysis of independent and dependent variables indicated that relationships among variables were statistically weak and therefore of limited predictive usefulness. It is suggested that a future survey include both users and nonusers as well as incorporating evaluation variables. Appendices include the survey questionnaire, a listing of descriptive statistics, a graph depicting the frequency distribution of the time at which respondents exited the library, and 30 tables of multiple regression analysis of demographic variables.

It consists of 11 different programs and 10 distinct components, each specially developed for a distinct student group. Although each BI program is different, all 11 are based on the principles that information is formally structured according to subject hierarchies, the student body is heterogeneous, and instruction is most effectively presented at the student's time of need (i.e., course-integrated). A six-point taxonomy of information skills listed in ascending order of cognitive demand or research sophistication, from physical orientation to understanding the idiosyncracies of  access tools and materials within specific disciplines, has also been designed to guide the development of the program. A description of a specific program offered for the basic writer, Pre-Research Skills Instruction (PRSI), provides an example of a controlled research exercise designed by librarians and writing instructors to provide basic writers with a successful initial research experience. Appendices include &quot;Keystones of Bibliographic Information: Hierarchical Structure of Information&quot;; a listing of PRSI research topics; a PRSI subject bibliography; a bibliographic instruction checklist for the classroom teacher; and a seven-item bibliography of material related to librarian-English instructor cooperation.

An example of such cooperation is the Business Partner Program begun in 1983 by Auraria Library in Denver, Colorado, which allows participating firms to receive company library cards as well as discounts on certain fee-based services in return for donating a specified amount of money to the library. Businesses such as those using the Auraria Library that seek information to enhance economic development opportunities generally rely on information from a combination of  personal experience and insight, talking to colleagues or competitors, and publicly available knowledge. A key service that academic libraries can provide for businesses is access to such information, both in terms of physical access to research collections and intellectual access to people with expertise in the structure of information sources. Given the need for such access, it makes economic as well as philanthropic sense for companies to help fund academic centers that can provide these required resources and services. (KM)",

Academic libraries serving teacher education programs will most strongly feel the effects of the transformation of teacher education from an undergraduate to a graduate program, changes in the content of and balance between the academic and field experience components, and the increased professional autonomy of the teacher. Libraries must prepare to meet the demands of these new education students by providing a collaborative model for integrating information access skills into the curriculum and contributing to the professional  autonomy of the teacher through shared expertise in information access, materials evaluation and analysis, and curriculum design. The adoption of a proactive position by academic librarians towards the integration of information access, materials analysis, and instructional design skills in the academic and clinical curriculum, and the willingness to work with faculty in strengthening resources for teacher education and providing a collegial model will encourage the development of the professional teacher.

Moving beyond the practice of using reserve material, lectures, and textbooks predominant in most college teaching today would be a step towards producing independent learners more likely to use the wide range of materials available through campus libraries. However, a campus statement of educational philosophy and strong institutional leadership are necessary to bridge the gap between the classroom and library and incorporate the library as a vital part of the undergraduate experience. The high value of library-based instruction can be shown through an examination of the generally accepted characteristics of quality  learning/teaching experiences, which indicates that library-based instruction encompasses the important learning elements of being an imitation of reality, being active rather than passive, being individualized, providing for a variety of learning styles, being up-to-date, and providing a nonthreatening environment. Only when classroom instructors and librarians cooperate in library-based learning, however, can such learning experiences be structured and implemented so as to achieve the best results. Successful programs that have already closed the gap between the library and the classroom may serve as models of quality undergraduate education in the information society. (KM)",

As librarians have realized the benefit of using computer systems to perform traditional tasks and the installation of systems has become relatively routine, library activities have shifted to encompass the operation of sophisticated computer systems, creating a conceptual gap between how libraries and librarians perceive themselves and how they are perceived by their campuses. With the introduction of the Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC), the gap has widened dramatically, as librarians have pioneered the creation of  systems to deliver useful, interactive, computer-based services directly to end users. As the experience of the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries illustrates, the ability of the OPAC to deliver information in real time to remote locations, access off-campus databases, provide multiple access points to information, and function as a general-purpose information utility has radically changed the model of libraries and their relationships to their clientele. Academic institutions must recognize these changes and ensure that they are implemented to provide maximum benefits to libraries, students, education, and research. (KM)",

Following introductory comments, the report examines the increasing importance of a trained workforce, explains general themes appearing in training delivery systems, and discusses the impact of a heightened emphasis on training in manufacturing on the relationship between an individual firm and the public school system. Next,  the report offers a rationale for Michigan community colleges playing a major role in training for new technologies, highlighting the reliance of community colleges on local support, the location of the 29 institutions in major industrial areas, and the importance of industrial training in computer-based manufacturing for the economic survival of the manufacturing base of Michigan's economy. The next section looks at issues for the educational community raised by the emphasis on training, considering the impact on mission, different constituencies to be trained, barriers to the development of Michigan community colleges as a major center of training in programmable automation technologies, and the need for an appropriate balance between public and private roles in training. Next, the  report looks at training issues for the state, directing a series of recommendations at state authorities. Finally, concluding comments point to the need for improved relations between education and industry and increased business and labor involvement. (EJV)",

The purposes of this survey were to investigate the training needs of Michigan automobile suppliers, with particular emphasis on how they met their training requirements in computer numerical control (CNC), computer-aided design (CAD), and statistical process control (SPC); to determine the future training needs of these companies; and to assess the general health of the automobile supplier industry in Michigan. Study findings, based on responses from 202 firms, included the following: (1) of the three technologies, SPC was the most commonly used by Michigan automobile suppliers, followed by CNC  and CAD; (2) 44% of the firms that utilized CNC equipment used it for only 10% of their machining operations, and 88% used it for less than 40% of their operations; (3) 47% of the firms that utilized SPC used it for 70% or more of their activities; (4) there was a tendency in all three technologies to use training provided by vendors and private training companies; (5) most workers in all technologies received less than 40 hours of formal training; and (6) the fact that the system of vendor training in advanced technologies was dependent upon the skills brought to the training by the workers may be related to the respondents' desire for schools to emphasize the basic skills that would give employees the ability to learn the specific tasks associated with each technology.

        "description":"A variety of marketing strategies can be used to maintain and increase community college enrollments. First, marketing research can be conducted to find out about the college's real and perceived image; to get a clearer picture of the lifestyles, attitudes, and interests of its clientele; and to target adult groups who are seeking educational and employment skills and who might not have been previously targeted as potential enrollees. Potential target groups include professionals employed part-time who are often offered incentives including tuition reimbursement or compensatory time by their employers; the older nontraditional student who may need special counseling services to make a formal educational commitment; and high school seniors who may be encouraged to attend college  by various types of articulation agreements between the high school and college. Along with the new and expanded audiences, different site locations (e.g., hospitals, fire stations, shopping malls, and libraries) should be considered as a way of attracting potential clients. Administrators should also review the possibility of giving coupons, discount offers, gift certificates, or play/concert tickets as bonus incentives to encourage enrollment. A publicity theme, reflecting the institution's mission and specific program, should also be highlighted in a coordinated public relations approach. Action, leadership, and institutional commitment are essential to break the boundaries in the competition for students in the coming years. (AYC)",

        "author":["Thoren, Daniel"],
        "description":"Reducing class size is an important step in promoting effective learning, but reducing a class from 35 to 15 students alone will not produce the desired results if faculty do not alter their teaching styles. Students must be empowered through teaching techniques that utilize writing, recitation, reaction papers, case studies, peer group pressure, small group and individual student responsibility, and peer instruction. The instructor must be a specially trained facilitator rather than a lecturer relying on tests and textbooks. The General Education curriculum is a logical target for introducing small classes in a community college because these courses seek to develop students' skills in inquiry and communication, and are required of all students. Financing a smaller classes plan  would require faculty and administrators to agree to the following conditions: (1) all faculty in the general education curriculum volunteer to participate in the small class teaching plan and in workshops to maximize teaching effectiveness; (2) participating faculty agree to teach six sections of 15 students rather than five sections of 35 students with no additional compensation; (3) scheduling will allow participating faculty a four-day work week; (4) a project team will be established to meet weekly with faculty and discuss problems; and (5) to handle the overload of students, instructors wishing to teach five sections in the traditional lecture/question method will have class sections increased from 35 to 45 students. Since smaller classes increase retention, they can help defer the  costs of expanding the smaller class format. To test the success of a small class project, institutions should measure classroom learning, retention rates, and the financial implications of the new plan. A model schedule matrix and small class financial plan is appended. (PAA)",

        "description":"In order to provide the best management model for the effective and efficient operation of community colleges, it is useful to look briefly at management theories. The three principle theories in use in corporate management are: (1) theory X, involving an autocratic supervisor allowing for minimal group influence; (2) theory Y, in which supervisory style is democratic allowing for a considerable degree of group decision making; and (3) theory Z, which may be called \"pure\" democracy, allowing for total group decision making and placing the supervisor in a rotational role with staff. Community college functioning contains elements of all three theories; for example, a department chair has a leadership role, and yet is part of a consensus body. While most business organizations are  goal oriented, colleges tend to be more vague about their particular goals, giving them an unusual flexibility. Furthermore, the professional orientation of university faculty tends to undercut traditional norms of bureaucracy. Thus, a specific theory termed \"organized anarchy\" has been used to describe the functioning of colleges. The term derives from the combined elements of \"the academic bureaucracy\" (leader as hero), the \"university as a political system\" (leader as negotiator), and the \"university collegium\" (leader as first among equals). In fact, these theories mesh closely with X, Y, and Z, respectively. It seems that effective and efficient operation of community colleges should involve an eclectic meshing of various elements and models. (PAA)",

        "description":"With the growing demands placed upon post-secondary institutions for a renewal and restructuring of values and priorities at a time when available resources are decreasing, the importance of planning becomes increasingly apparent. Strategic planning in particular, which deals with the mission, goals, values and resource allocation of the college, which focuses on the process rather than the product, and which assumes a dynamic and constantly evolving education system, has become the critical planning approach for the future of the community college. Recognizing the importance of strategic planning, the New Jersey Chancellor for Higher Education required each county college to develop a strategic plan as a component of Challenge Grant applications. An analysis of master plans  developed by 12 of New Jersey's community colleges reveals that all of the plans show remarkably similar concerns. The 1985-90 master plan for Union County College, however, stands out as an exemplary planning document. Developed with extensive faculty participation, the plan is organized into several components, including institutional background, mission and goals, county demographics, student body, a faculty and staff profile, a review of institutional resources, and a plan of action focusing on ten &quot;initiatives&quot; in the areas of recruitment and articulation; curriculum and staff development; linking the humanities and the technologies; linkages with business and industry; high technology; life-long learning; developmental studies; urban initiatives; facilities initiatives; and  finances.

Critical thinking is a skill which most educators expect their students to master, but, unlike reading, writing, or programming, critical thinking is viewed as something which one discovers for oneself. The best students do seem to acquire critical thinking skills without explicit instruction, but many students require more explanation and coaching. Many current attempts to teach critical thinking, including unstructured Piagetian thinking exercises, the Socratic  method, and structured courses focusing on either domain-specific skills or general skills to be applied across the curriculum, have not produced the desired result. Various research models, focusing on artificial intelligence; comparisons of expert and novice information processing; logical biases responsible for some systematic errors in logic; and the self-referent effect, offer insight into the complicated process of human thought. Using these insights, a program, course, or technique may be developed for testing. (AYC)",

        "author":["Helman, Sanford"],
        "description":"New Jersey's community colleges started in the late 1960s in the more populous, relatively well-financed counties. Of the original group of faculty members, many were drawn from high schools with several years of teaching experience, others had practical business experience in their field of expertise, and still others were recruited out of graduate schools. Each college must decide for itself what to do about the fact that its faculty is growing older and will be retiring within a few years. Options include recruiting business people who have opted for early retirement or older professors from the university; instituting phased retirement programs whereby faculty teach less and are paid less; offering generous buyouts to encourage early retirement; and hiring novice teachers and  teaching them to teach effectively. In order to increase the pool of new talent, recruiters will have to go to other English-speaking countries (e.g., Ireland and possibly Canada) and utilize their surplus of graduate students. The problem of incremental aging of the faculty can be looked at in terms of physical manifestations (e.g., faculty who can no longer walk up stairs with ease) and intangible manifestations (e.g., faculty who are losing the inner motivation to teach). Colleges must take action to deal with both types of difficulties. (AYC)",

        "author":["Maganzini, Anne"],
        "description":"With declining enrollments projected for the next decade and program discontinuance and retrenchment already a reality at many campuses, the retraining of tenured faculty to teach in a new discipline has been a critical issue for both faculty and administrators. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the courts offer different interpretations of what constitutes fiscal exigency as the grounds for the dismissal of tenured faculty, and slightly different positions on whether a tenured faculty member is entitled to retraining. The AAUP suggests that retraining take place when program discontinuance occurs for educational considerations and not because of financial necessity, while the courts have not considered retraining a right under any circumstances.  Several factors support these policies: (1) the discontinuance of particular programs may have less negative consequences than the more generalized loss of vitality that could occur from across-the-board dismissals of junior faculty; (2) retraining a faculty member for one or two semesters cannot give the instructor the discipline expertise of a novice instructor training for years in that field; (3) a faculty member teaching out of his/her area of expertise out of necessity may suffer a lack of motivation; (4) the academic vitality of a college depends on a mix of younger and older, junior and senior faculty and the teaching qualifications of instructors; and (5) sabbatical leaves are being alloted more and more frequently for retraining, rather than the equally important scholarly  growth and development. Dealing effectively with retraining and retrenchment requires strong leadership on the part of the college president and equally strong leadership and participation by the college faculty in academic program review, budget analysis, and, ultimately, declaring a state of fiscal exigency.

A study was conducted to develop a test anxiety questionnaire for student nurses in order to identify test anxiety. A 40-item, self-report questionaire was developed by two panels of experts composed of nursing faculty at Los Angeles Valley College (LAVC) and was deemed appropriate by the panel for the identification of test anxiety. The final draft of the questionnaire was administered twice to 50 second-year nursing students at LAVC in a test/retest procedure. The results indicated that there were 15 students (30%) in the \"Low Anxiety\" range, 25 students (50%) in the \"Moderately Low Anxiety\" range, 10 students (20%) in  the \"Moderately High Anxiety\" range, and no students in the \"High Anxiety\" range. The expert panels agreed that the questionnaire did possess face validity, and that the statistical analysis of the data indicated a strong positive correlation and reliability of the questionnaire. It was recommended that: (1) the study should be shared with the entire nursing faculty, the dean of vocational education, and the district office; (2) the questionnaire should be retested by all the nursing students; (3) the nursing students should critique the questionnaire for clarity; and (4) information on the identification and treatment modalities on test anxiety should be given to the entire nursing faculty.

        "description":"Customarily, several parent figures rear black infants. The effects of this practice on infant-parent attachments have not been studied even though they provide the chance to test the attachment theory contention that infants form a primary attachment when several attachment figures are available. To study this issue, 21 male and 16 female black 12-month-olds from nonindigent families, their mothers, father figures and a stranger were videotaped in a 13-episode separation-reunion session. Infant behaviors rated were proximity seeking, contact maintaining, contact resisting, avoidance, distress at parents' leavings, exploration and sociability with a stranger. Infant-mother and infant-father behaviors were found indistinguishable, suggesting there was no single, primary  infant-parent attachment. Moreover, infants were responsive to parents' whereabouts on only one attachment behavior measure. Girls were distressed when alone with the stranger, but boys were not. Exploration, however, was a clear indicator of parents' and the stranger's presence; it was greatest when both parents were present and least when the infant and stranger were alone. The results reveal that two parent figures have equivalent effects on the attachment, sociability, and exploratory behaviors of 12-month-old black infants in a laboratory setting, and have distinctive effects on exploratory behavior.

This neglect is justified by an unvalidated hypothesis, namely that the physical environment must be mediated by social parameters in order to influence development. Two studies were conducted to test that hypothesis. Subjects in both studies were 12-month-old infants. Physical and social environment codes, based on direct home observation, were taken from the Purdue Home Stimulation Inventory. The outcome variable of the first study was that of language development, while that of the second was infant mastery motivation. In both studies, hierarchical regression was used to assess whether unique predictive variance was  associated with either the physical or social environments. Results indicated that when social environment codes were entered first, the physical environment codes still maintained their predictive power. In contrast, when physical environment codes were entered first, the predictive power of the social environment codes dropped to nonsignificance. These results are contrary to the hypothesis that the physical environment must be mediated by the social environment, and suggest that neglecting the study of physical environment influences cannot be justified empirically.

        "description":"Age, specific emotion, and linguistic modality (verbal vs. non-verbal) were predicted to affect knowledge of emotion in young preschoolers (N = 45, mean age = 40.7 mos). Prosocial response to emotion and knowledge of emotion were also predicted to be related, given naturalistic observation and the use of contextually valid emotion knowledge measures. Results indicated that older subjects scored higher on the puppet measure of understanding of emotions elicited by different situations, as well as on ability to verbally label the emotions happy, sad, and angry. Non-verbal labeling of emotion scores was higher than that of verbal scores; these non-verbal scores actually showed a ceiling effect at later age ranges. Knowledge of situations eliciting happy emotion was greater than that  for anger or fear. For a subset of the above subjects (N = 21), knowledge of situations eliciting happy emotions predicted prosocial reactions to positive emotion, whereas overall knowledge of both positive and negative emotions predicted prosocial reaction to negative emotion during free play. These results substantially replicated previous findings on knowledge of emotions, but with a younger sample. Further, the linkage between knowledge of emotion and prosocial behavior stand as partial confirmation of several theories of empathy. (Author)",

        "description":"This study investigates how the psychological and social processes of children participating in an instructional program in critical thinking become engaged as children incorporate cultural and sex-typed information into the development of specific cognitive skills. Forty boys and girls randomly selected from four fifth-grade classes at two elementary schools participated in the study. The children were administered pre- and post-measures that assessed cognitive skill development in a structured task and in a novel task. In addition, data on instructional practices, curricular materials concerning thinking skills, and students' communicative competence in pre- and post-interviews were collected for qualitative analysis. Cognitive skill development appeared to be developmental and  learned. Students in both schools gained significantly in measures of cognitive skill development. However, students who were enrolled in the intervention school had better and more developed skills than those in the nonintervention school. The researchers hypothesized that boys and girls may be encouraged to develop, select, and apply cognitive skills differently according to situational demands and constraints. These data show that boys and girls are differentially exposed to teaching strategies aimed at the production of intelligent behavior. Pre- and post-measures indicate that boys and girls differ in their application of cognitive skills during different tasks. (Author/PCB)",

Age (5 or 7), verbal ability (PPVT-R score) and home viewing history were examined as predictors of visual attention. There were no age differences, but PPVT-R scores were positively related to attention. Attention was positively related to a history of viewing informative programs for children and negatively related to a history of viewing adult programs. The results were interpreted as showing that children who live in families with heavy diets of general television programs learn habits of inattention because the television becomes a constant background to family life and because the children are frequently exposed to programming  that is beyond their level of comprehension, particularly if their general verbal ability is relatively low. By contrast, children who view informative programs extensively learn habits of paying attention from a diet of programming that is tailored to their levels of comprehension. (Author)",

        "description":"The use of parent training programs to aid parents has long been regarded as a fundamental technique for remediation of child rearing problems. What is open to question is what types of programs best serve what types of individuals. The parent training program (Early Intervention Program) evaluated here is distinguished for two reasons: (1) it emphasizes differential social reinforcement as the training model, and (2) it uses parents who have graduated from the program as trainers. A total of 158 mothers and their children began the program; 95 mother-child dyads completed it. Excluding those who moved away or were referred elsewhere, 68% of the participants completed the program. This rate of completion compares favorably with rates from other programs. The characteristics found  to be related to program completion included ethnic group membership, socio-economic and marital status, and maternal education. Other variables such as child age and level of cooperation at intake were associated with the length of the training. The observational data revealed that as a result of involvement in the program, mothers learned to selectively attend to their children's compliant behavior and the children became significantly more cooperative (from 62% cooperative in baseline sessions to 94% cooperative after completion). It is argued that trainers need to identify the optimal characteristics of subjects in order to anticipate and curtail the dropout rate and prevent slow completion of training. (Author/BG)",

All subjects who were eliminated from the study due to distress in the unfamiliar environment were with non-siblings at the time.

The purpose of the present study was to provide a synthesis of these two studies and to demonstrate the patterns of their interrelationships. Thirty-two sibling pairs (with siblings aged 14 months and 3-4 years) and their mothers were observed for the quality of the sibling relationship and references by mothers or children to the baby's feelings and thoughts; the older child's caregiving and perspective-taking skills were also measured. Mother references to the child about feelings were associated with child references to the mother, thus  supporting Dunn and Kendrick. Child references to the baby, but not mother-child references to each other, were associated with a positive sibling relationship. An association between preschooler's skill at adopting another's perspective and caretaking of the distressed infant (Stewart & Marvin, 1984) was not replicated. However, a positive association was found between caretaking and the baby's distress. Child references to the baby about feelings and thoughts, rather than mother-child references to each other about the baby, were associated with positive sibling behaviors in the Strange Situation and perspective-taking. Results are discussed within a family systems framework. Consideration of the baby's role in defining the nature of family relationships is presented.  (Author/PCB)",

Previous studies which have investigated young children's metaphorical ability have often encouraged young children to make judgments of similarity which rely almost exclusively on visually apparent perceptual qualities such as shape and color. This study was concerned with whether children were also capable of understanding metaphorical similarities based on implicit, not visually apparent functional and causal resemblances as well as explicit visually apparent perceptual resemblances providing that the concepts involved were familiar to the children. The results of this study indicate that all children, regardless  of age, were able to recognize and explain more metaphorical similarities in pictures than in words. Therefore it appears that the mental operations required for metaphorical comprehension become available to children sometime before the age of 3. In contrast to other studies that have indicated that young children are cognitively limited to abstracting similar perceptual features between items from different categories, this study indicates that preschool children are able to give highly appropriate explanations for connecting functionally and causally related metaphors.

Twenty-two 8- to 11-year-old students took two 25-hour LOGO courses. Half of the students were taught debugging in the context of a LOGO graphics course first and then a LOGO list-processing course. The other half were taught debugging in the same two  mini-courses, but in the reverse order. The performance of children taking tests in the first mini-course was compared with the performance of children taking the same tests in the second mini-course. Assessments of students' debugging skills revealed that the debugging strategies learned from explicit instruction in the first computer programming mini-course had a positive impact on children's debugging in both new programming and nonprogramming situations.

An effective policy must reconcile the following three primary issues: (1) the historical rift between the educational and custodial models of early childhood education; (2) conflicts between the elementary school and early childhood education communities over purposes, methods, and control; and (3) the necessary trade-offs between costs of programs and their quality. Legislators are in a unique position at this time to examine these issues in order to formulate early childhood policies and enact legislation for new programs. (PCB)",

Televised classes permitting live teacher/student interaction via satellite communication systems and regular telephone lines provide equity and increase quality of educational opportunity, provide access to subject matter experts/career role models not available in local communities, provide interaction with students in other schools, increase access to information/instructional resources, offer opportunities for staff development/inservice training, and increase school/community linkages. Four interactive instructional television satellite systems currently operate in  the United States: the TI-IN Network from San Antonio, Texas, Oklahoma State University's Arts and Sciences Teleconferencing Service, Utah State Department of Education's system, and Eastern Washington University's Telecommunication Project. The rapid growth of these four satellite networks has generated interest by many state officials in statewide satellite networks. Kentucky and Missouri are the first states to establish networks to broadcast elementary/secondary, staff development, college credit, adult education, and community education courses. Characteristics of the satellite systems are described and addresses for further information about the systems are provided. (LFL)",

Among rural strengths cited were easy access to public officials, neighborliness, opportunities to participate in local government,  and a growing number of rural advocacy units in state government. Weaknesses included reluctance by many to acknowledge the existence of serious social problems in rural communities, untrained local justices, and urban-oriented regulations. Policy suggestions dealt with mandatory social sensitivity and awareness training for rural police and justices, permissive legislation allowing for a single organizational unit to provide all human services within a county or counties, and establishment of executive and legislative bodies with responsibility for rural concerns at the state level.

        "description":"The retention rate for rural teachers has historically been low, often with loss of two or more teachers per school year in some areas. Recently, a surplus of teachers has relieved this problem, but a predicted shortage will aggravate the situation. A survey of rural teachers was conducted in 1980 in British Columbia to try to find a reason for poor retention. The results of this and other studies were used to develop a training program for rural teachers at a rural campus in British Columbia. Students were required to live within the rural community while gathering data for the early field experience (EFE) course, which were then used to familiarize them with the issues and expectations faced by teachers employed in a rural community, including demographics, power structure  dynamics, resources, and sociological factors. Experience of the program's graduates indicates a high level of success in both obtaining employment and realizing job satisfaction. Due to fiscal cutbacks, the program is no longer operating in British Columbia, though there is hope that it may be reconsidered for future funding. Through the description of the research and the EFE program, it is hoped others may benefit from what has been learned about rural teacher retention and one experiment to reverse the historical trend.

Information indicated that the count of LEP students was growing (3,042 in 1985-86), especially in kindergarten and first grade. Services provided to LEP students include transitional bilingual education and English as a second language (ESL). Bilingual/ESL certified teachers provided services to both Hispanic and Vietnamese students. Although the supply of certified teachers was increasing, staffing did not always match needs. Bilingual aides were assigned to assist with program implementation, but were not cost  effective when compared with increases in student achievement. Since all LEP students could not be tested in English, English achievement could not be measured accurately; however, it appeared the AISD's bilingual/ESL program was helping LEP students' proficiency. Spanish-speaking LEP students remained below the national average, but were improving. Vietnamese students achieved above the national average in mathematics and language and were closing the gap in reading. Instructional remedies must be sought, however, to prevent gains of less than 1 grade equivalent per year for Spanish LEP students in grades 2 and 4. (JMM)",

        "description":"Nineteen papers and a keynote address which were prepared for presentation at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota are presented. Numerous intergovernmental issues associated with the current economic crisis in rural America are analyzed and a series of innovative policy responses are identified for consideration by Federal, State and local governments. These papers expand on the complement reports prepared by the Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations given at other hearings, and are grouped under eight broad topics: infrastructure needs in rural America--Federal, State and local responses; rural America beyond the farm--the problems of undiversified economies; economic development strategies for rual America--local responses;  deregulation and rural communities--what the future holds; alternative service delivery--how it can help rural communities; foreign trade, the balance of payments, and rural economics--where the dollars have gone; economic development strategies for rural America--State and Federal responses; and, health care--the problem of access in rural America. Graphs, charts, maps, and statistical data are included in some of the papers. (JMM)",

        "description":"Case studies are used to illustrate issues in the identification of gifted and talented American Indian children and the development of appropriate programs that respond to individual needs and cultural values. Emphasis is placed on the identification of students who do not manifest their high intellectual and creative abilities in ways accepted or recognized by the dominant culture and who are therefore excluded from appropriate educational opportunities. Chapter 1 presents a definition of giftedness which places responsibility for identification of gifted children on the shoulders of the cultural community. Chapter 2 reviews checklists, observations, tests, and other indices used in the identification of gifted children and stresses the need for the use of a variety of  identification measures used in combination. Selected identification measures are examined for cultural bias. Chapters 3 and 4 describe the Native American Gifted Program model including curriculum, culturally relevant activities, and development of the Native American Special Abilities Profile which identifies those abilities valued by the cultural community--Klallam and Suquamish families with children in the North Kitsap School District, Washington. Appendices define terms in gifted education and list 43 tests which have been used successfully to identify and evaluate gifted potential for American Indian students. (JHZ)",

The unique aspects of rural schools should be used to develop defensible community-based programs. General gifted education procedures, such as developing peer groups and psychologically secure environments, should be followed, but grouping provisions from larger urban settings are not generally appropriate. Curricula for gifted students should be modified in terms of rate of progress, control of content, and type of content. These content changes, as well as changes in instructional formats, may be accomplished or supported using modern technological means, particularly computers. When the local program requires it, teachers or students  may be transported to off-campus locations to meet program goals. Support activities may be provided out of school, but these activities should be in addition to a regular education program for gifted students. (JHZ)",

This guide was developed to be used by educators and citizens concerned with the role of consumers in the generation of hazardous wastes. It examines several products in terms of their potential for producing hazardous wastes. These include such common objects as fishing line, plastic bags, frisbees, and paper bags. The document urges citizens to learn more about the industrial processes that transform raw materials into the products we use, and, if it is found that a product generates hazardous waste, the consumer should ask several questions. These include: (1) Do I really need this product at all? (2) Should I substitute  another product for this one? (3) Can I use less of this product, or use it less frequently? (4) How will I use this product? and (5) Where will this product ultimately end up? Each of these questions is discussed and options for individual decision making are presented. Also contained in the guide are a glossary of terms and an annotated bibliography of other information and resources. (TW)",

The purpose of this elementary instructional guide is to introduce and develop in students a sense of responsibility toward animals. The teaching activities in the guide are based on nine concepts. These are: (1) many kinds of animals are pets; (2) humans must care for pets; (3) pets need proper health care; (4) more pets are born than there are homes for; (5) there are many kinds of farm animals; (6) humans must care for farm animals; (7) there are many kinds of wild animals; (8) humans must protect the homes of wild animals; and (9) wild animals that are not protected may become endangered or extinct. The objectives for each lesson are based on one or more of  these concepts. Following the objective(s) is a list of materials needed to teach the activities in the lesson. The activities tend to be interdisciplinary in nature and have a hands-on orientation. Ideas for bulletin boards are included, along with reproducible worksheets for many of the activities. (TW)",

        "description":"It is generally accepted that mathematical reasoning, like language acquisition, is part of normal cognitive development. This paper proposes that other variables must be considered when explaining the differences in the acquisition of mathematical reasoning skills in young children. Considered is some of the evidence that suggests that certain patterns of affective and motivational characteristics relate to the quality of children's mathematical thinking; this includes not only such thinking as measured by academic achievement tests, but also strategies individuals use to obtain their answers. Also discussed is the nature of certain patterns of affective, motivational, or personal characteristics that are related to, yet go beyond, the development of purely cognitive  differences. Based on the observation of videotapes of teachers and young children engaged in mathematical activities, it is suggested that different types of non-cognitive behaviors are associated with the development of certain kinds of mathematical thinking. The results indicated a difference between learners who were classified as pro-mathematical thinkers with those categorized as anti-mathematical thinkers. (TW)",

Instead of gazing at student discourse, seeing it as a product to be weighed, marked for what separates it from an ideal concept of &quot;the Paper,&quot; and kept or thrown overboard, would it not be more profitable to keep the focus on  the student paper-as-Thou--as the expressive extension of the self that Michel de Montaigne's model implies it is?

She pioneered the use of film in the English classroom, was ahead of her time in emphasizing writing processes in relation to learning, advocated writing across the curriculum, and introduced the practice of publishing student writing. Sheridan committed her professional life to working with colleagues to help students in English classes become active inquirers. Furthermore, she saw the English language arts, in all their interdependent, interactive modes, as forces to  enable students to learn about, to question, and to work toward the betterment of their society and their world. In every period of her 60-year career Marion Sheridan championed creativity in the secondary classroom, advocating the study of literature and of writing. She also underscored the role of teachers as taking on the complex and tremendous responsibility of organizing their learning environments to enable all this to happen. (KEH)",

Students' grades, evaluations of teachers, teacher certification, and curriculum reveal domination by ideology and standards belonging to other epistemologies.

        "description":"Theories of taste are efforts to understand the processes of signification by which cultural forms take on meaning, and how subjects are inserted into such processes. One of these theories is the notion of &quot;taste cultures,&quot; set forth by Herbert Gans in the 1960s and continued by George Lewis into the 1980s. A taste culture is an aggregate of similar people making similar choices. A struggle is implied, which is resolved in the democratic free market, but class and education are the key determinants of membership in taste cultures. Another theory is the more structural approach of French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. In his view, taste, which is assumed to be based upon free choice, is, in fact, a reflection of social class. While it appears that class-based distinctions of taste  are breaking down, domination by upper classes has become more complex and insidious. What is needed is the kind of analysis which would enable conceptions of taste to transcend the boundaries of those previous models which relied exclusively on audience analysis and which theorized solely through metaphors of the market and of structures.

        "description":"On college campuses today, the debate rages over whether self-restraint and tolerance for nonconformity is overriding a need to protect certain individuals and groups from objectionable speech. Some administrators, students, and alumni wish to prevent &quot;bad speech&quot; in the form of expressions of racism, sexism, and the like. Advocates for limiting &quot;bad speech&quot; argue that such expressions do not deserve first amendment protection because the messages cause irreparable harm and are meant to do so. Some researchers argue that the right to privacy which has been identified within the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment can limit sexist-racist-hate speech, but the Supreme Court's integrationist reading of the clause contradicts such a view. More speech, not less, is  needed to break down the walls of classification, educate others, and provide for equality. Banning hate speech creates an exception to the first amendment which denigrates its meaning. Equality in the pursuit of education will come from a lively discussion of cultural differences, historical happenings, and contemporary uses of language. To force students to refrain from using certain words would deny an opportunity to explore the meaning of equality and understanding, which a tolerant society must not allow.

        "description":"In response to tighter school budgets and improved technology, a two-way interactive video was successfully used to provide an alternative &quot;delivery system&quot; for forensic competition. Two university sites were selected to organize and host an interactive video speech and debate tournament for area high school students. The program was completed quickly and efficiently. The speaking order in the individual events moved from hearing all the contestants from one site to all the contestants at the other site. Managers at each site were able to communicate with each other between speeches and at the end of the rounds via telephone. The judges' rankings and ratings were also communicated over the telephone, and a FAX machine transmitted the overall result sheets between sites. Managers'  noted less physical strain at this tournament compared with regular tournaments, primarily because the interactive video setting took place in one room and minimized the normal &quot;housekeeping&quot; items. Moreover, the tournament managers were able to observe the students in actual competition, a benefit usually only experienced by debate coaches. This type of forensic tournament appears to hold great potential as a supplement to traditional tournament schedules.

        "description":"There is evidence that the technical sphere of argument has been elevated generally at the expense of the public sphere, and specifically to the detriment of the public's ability to understand and participate in the formation and administration of public policy. Oversight of regulatory agencies by all three branches of the government holds the potential for public criticism of technically-based decisions. In practice, however, structural and procedural obstacles appear to exclude meaningful public participation. Successful public involvement in administrative agency decision making can involve &quot;playing by the rules&quot; of institutionalized access or &quot;changing the rules.&quot; Either way, organization into a group with a strong public voice and with access to expertise is necessary.  Public groups must possess sufficient foresight into the implications of proposed administrative changes and must be in a position to appeal to governmental oversight forums. The adversarial nature of the judicial system makes it the best apparent forum for public challenges to administrative rulemaking. It is the role of communication scholars to continue exploration of the structural and discursive barriers to public education and participation in the public policy process. Scholars must also explore means of placing the public voice on a level of parity with the technical sphere. (Twenty-seven references are attached.) (SG)",

Three types of research can be classified: content, effect, and correlation. Content analysis was the most popular. Even though various types of TV programs were studied, each research study investigated only one type of program and/or commercial at a time. Most researchers used children as their respondents. The results from 15 research studies in this analysis supported the notion that there was significant sex-role stereotyping in television content, and viewers were likely to perceive and be able to recall such behavior. However, four studies done in the 1980s showed contradictory findings which may reflect a slowly changing trend for women in American  society.

The study was based on the philosophy that if forensics programs have changed, more than likely they have changed in terms of what activities are offered to students, and therefore, of how the program is administered. Surveys were mailed to 374 forensics program administrators at colleges and universities in the United States and 155 completed surveys were returned for a response rate of 44%. Results indicated that nearly half of the programs that currently offer only individual events used to offer debate as well. Thus, in the last 5 years, many schools have had to make choices regarding the direction  of their program, and most directors seem to have selected individual events as the activity that they will continue to sponsor. The number of debate-only schools has remained relatively stable over the past 5 years, as have the number of schools with both debate and individual events programs. Survey results suggest that as long as the individual events and debate programs have adequate resources, their existence in the forensics community will continue to be fairly stable.

Speech courses, then, should deal foremost with propositional approaches, thereby eliminating some degree of artificiality from the speaking situation and offering an inventional methodology that is more scientific. Using a problem solving approach, speakers can determine all the questions which they could ask in order to collect data to arrive at a thesis. From the data they may then, on a topics basis,  select that which they must give to an audience to gain further adherence to a thesis.

        "description":"Unlike the criticism of the literary arts and the spoken word, rhetoric, television criticism is in its infancy. The styles suggested for television criticism have primarily been drawn from modern drama, literature and semiotics. Today, television critics of the scholarly sort are looking at a variety of styles to see if they can tell their students more about the medium of television (cinematic criticism, content analysis, linguistics, phenomenalism, and phenomenology). However, in order to comprehend television, the critics need not concern themselves completely with modern approaches to television criticism; instead, it may prove just as beneficial to reexamine the classical Greek legacy, starting with Homer and concluding with the rise of Rome. The Hellenic heritage has been  incorporated into every aspect of Western thought. In America, speech communication and English seem to have benefited the most from this connection. Television, because of its technological armor, appears to have been impregnable by any form of criticism outside this era. Classical dramatic criticism can be recommended as a viable style to criticize television because of its influence from the dawn of Western Civilization to the present. The philosophers Plato and Aristotle can be placed in juxtaposition as thesis and antithesis, followed by the tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides and concluding with the comedian Aristophanes. Afterwards, the classical Greek model can be applied to television programming, particularly that of the theatrical genre. In this manner, television  can benefit from classical dramatic criticism.

Historicity, the science of writing history, can be used by the television critic in order to critique national and international broadcasting. Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics worldwide, like the rest of humanity, are attempting to improve their lives. Mass communication has not kept pace with the new reality of these people: their needs are not met. The United Nations (UN) Summit is an important communication event; this UN effort might inspire the mass media to bring more relevant information. Unfortunately, the masses trust television, but they are not equipped to interpret it. Course work  in American colleges and universities is needed to train critics in historicity and other stylology. When students who are properly trained work in the field, valuable, correct feedback can be given to government and to private and public groups involved in message formation. Critics can alert the audience to discrepancies in the reportage of broadcasting through the use of historicity and other stylology. Broadcasting can be made to change its course in order to become more meaningful to the world it serves. International scholars can also use historicity when using television as a source to adequately abstract television's reality. (fifteen references are attached.) (MG)",

Learning community students synthesize knowledge and information from a spectrum of different points of view, concentrate on dialogue and collaborative learning with their instructors and peers, and experience the dominant functional uses of communication in daily life. The general goal of the learning community is to provide a holistic structure through which students can synthesize different subject areas and/or courses and give coherence to their general learning  experience. Distinctive features of learning communities include: common themes, a sense of purpose, reduced isolation of faculty members from one another and from students, relating of faculty members to one another as specialists and educators, continuity and integration in the curriculum, and group identity and cohesion. Learning communities also encourage greater intellectual interaction between students, between students and faculty, and between faculty members. Interaction is active and vocal in a learning community setting, not limited to the often mechanical and routinized interaction of traditional lectures, term papers, and examinations.

        "description":"As part of the Speech Communication Association (SCA) 1990 Summer Conference on Communication Competency Assessment held in Denver, Colorado, one work group worked on the development of a speech performance evaluation form and/or process grounded in and driven by the competency paradigm. Prior to and during the conference, the group developed a description of a manual for in-class speech evaluation at the college sophomore level to be used for both the evaluation of public speaking skills in the classroom, and pre- (testing out) and/or post- (exit) assessment of speaking performance. At the conference, eight competencies regarding public speaking were identified, and performance criteria/standards by which each competency could be evaluated were articluated. Following the  conference, a pilot speech evaluation form was developed, utilizing the eight competencies and attendant criteria. That instrument and criteria presently are being refined, and appropriate reliability and validity testing is planned. It is the intention of the work group to develop a manual for speech evaluation grounded in the communication competency literature and containing, among other components, &quot;The Competent Speaker&quot; evaluation form. That manual will be submitted to the Educational Policies Board for SCA approval and distribution. (Three tables of data are included; 27 references and 2 appendixes containing the SCA resolution and a description of the eight public speaking competencies and standards/criteria for assessment are also provided.

        "description":"In 1987, the Ohio Department of Education enacted a new policy requiring all school districts to plan and implement programs designed to provide support to newly hired professional educators. The mandate's intent was to ensure that inexperienced teachers, counselors, social workers, psychologists, supervisors, or administrators hired to work in Ohio school districts would have access to conditions creating a supportive environment for succeeding at their new jobs. This paper discusses the support systems available to supervisors, vocational education directors, and administrators. The Entry Year Standard also requires the designation of experienced school administrators to serve as career guides or mentors for beginning administrators. Two primary issues underlie this standard's  enactment: (1) a perceived need for new administrators to enter the field; and (2) recognition that many realities facing new administrators must be learned on the job. A primary task of the Ohio LEAD (Leadership in Educational Administration Development) Center is to develop implementation strategies for local school systems. The LEAD Center's work on the Entry Year Standard has revolved around two tasks: developing a &quot;Resource Guide&quot; to help program implementors and providing training concerning the mentoring concept. A brief overview of resource guide contents is provided. An appendix presents the Ohio Entry Year Standard. (MLH)",

If educational values should be determined by those responsible for children's education--particularly their parents and teachers--then process must be provided for these people to articulate their values by creating a school community. The school's constituents (administrators, teachers, students, and parents) can form this community by: (1) adopting a core of educational values; (2) transforming these values into goals and acting on them; and (3) establishing associations with one another to enhance goal  achievement. The school community can unleash the family's power to boost the academic development of children, provide a safety net of support for children of negligent or disadvantaged parents, and energize teachers in their dedication to explicit aims. This document not only explores the school community meaning and the educational values on which it is premised, it also details the means by which it is created and sustained. The Franklin Elementary School Community's constitution is appended. (27 references) (KM)",

        "description":"Most people understand the importance of school choice when it comes to higher educational opportunities, but until the 1990s, those very people did not understand the importance of school choice at the elementary and secondary level frequently because they felt they had no choice. The school choice movement, which started in Minnesota but which has begun to sweep across the nation, highlights both the importance and the availability of school choice. When combined with the large number of relocating corporate employees who have a choice regarding their place of residence and those that have a choice of private schools, the school choice issue becomes an important one for corporate human resource professionals. The results of thousands of parent responses to SchoolMatch family  profile questionnaires indicate that parents do not necessarily look for \"biggest\" and \"best\" when given a chance to choose their children's schools. In fact, few parents want their children in the most academically rigorous school or the one with the highest test scores; instead, they want their children in an environment that allows each child to excel. The questionnaire results show that parents prefer school systems in which teacher salaries are competitive but not necessarily among the highest. Further, family-oriented communities appear to be important to parents. (KM)",

Since elected officials govern by public consent gained from trust, a responsible communications program is based on willingness to do business in the light of day. Schools must be able to communicate the difficult news as well as the positive news. The first two chapters of this guide address various avenues open to districts eager to tell their stories and gain community willingness to work long hours without high pay. school visits, or through civic activities, including board member speeches and regular board meetings. School-site public relations goals can be accomplished through neighborhood coffees, newsletters, and open houses and fundraisers.  Chapter 3 explains the new &quot;media elite&quot;; once composed of anti-intellectual working-class people, the media ranks are now filled with liberal, well-educated eastern suburbanites. Reporters resemble teachers in their professional commitment and willingness to work long hours without high pay. Chapter 4 is premised on the idea that good public relations policy helps reporters do their job by choosing a stance midway between control and openness. Extensive advice is given concerning effective board/media communication. Chapter 5 provides tips for writing news releases, appearing on television, using the phone, and holding press conferences. The final three chapters cover crisis communications, the fine art of complaining, and board/public information officer relations. (MLH)",

Competing reform strategies are described, specifically, the human resources approach and the structural, political, free market, and school culture models. Aiming to link reform success to school culture and symbolic leadership concepts, the book describes organizational cultures or subcultures within the greater society and presents evidence connecting organizational culture to productivity in business and schools. Next, a description is given of how the principal shapes a school culture by fulfilling five roles: those of symbol, potter, poet, actor, and healer. Following this,  the book presents five case studies of school leadership in school settings that varied according to principal incumbency, school characteristics, student abilities, and organizational history. Finally, commonalities in the leaders' tactics are summarized and discussed. Each of the principals described identified what was important, selected compatible teachers, dealt successfully with conflict, set a consistent example, told illustrative stories, and used ceremonies, tradition, rituals, and symbols to display the school's common values. The book concludes with some action guidelines, with the caveat that these will prove inadequate unless accompanied by an unquenchable desire and commitment to build cultures that support and create excellence. Included are 51 references and a classified,  annotated bibliography of 25 books and articles. (MLH)",

The text of the bill is given in full. It begins with Congress's finding that: (1) public school teachers are currently spending more time on regulatory paperwork; (2) many teachers have noted a decrease in available fiscal resources for education since 1980; (3) state-by-state data are lacking regarding compliance effects; and (4) student achievement would be improved if teachers had more time to teach and local education agencies had more resources to direct into the classroom. The purpose of the act is stated next; it is to require the Secretary of Education to assess the states and identify the new legal, regulatory, and  organizational requirements affecting each state's educational practices so that informed decisions may be made regarding regulatory requirements detracting from student achievement. Also explained are specific issues for analysis and specifications for preparing a report to Congress. Positive testimony for the bill was given by representatives of the National School Boards Association, the American Association of School Administrators, the National Education Association, and the National Governors' Association.

Accountability is critical to this approach; a school system cannot ask school staff to accept responsibility for results without involving them in the decision-making process. In New York City, school-based planning as an administrative approach has been an important component of Basic School Staffing (BSS), a large-scale program introduced in 1987-88. This report fulfills a BSS evaluation requirement and serves as a research base for introducing SBM/SDM into the city's public schools. After providing some historical background and linking program  development to effective schools research and strategies to serve disadvantaged students, the report addresses four major issues bearing directly on SBM/SDM projects: the teacher's voice; district/central leadership; parent/community involvement; and mission. Conclusions are then drawn about decision-making effectiveness. Recommended guidelines for implementing shared decision making are also provided. (232 references) (MLH)",

        "description":"Educational Options Programs are special (New York City) high school programs centered around various career areas. Students must apply to these high schools or programs to attend. During 1987-88, the admissions policy was revised to increase program access. The revised policy mandated that half of each entering class (9th and 10th graders) would be randomly selected by computer, and the other half selected by the school. Reading requirements were also altered. The Office of Research, Evaluation, and Assessment (OREA) conducted a study examining the continuing progress in 1988-89 of the Educational Options students first admitted under the revised admissions policy during their second year of high school. This report reviews the achievement of randomly assigned and  school-selected students, noting patterns continuing from the first to the second program year. The report also presents results of a survey that sampled the attitudes of school personnel administering the Educational Options programs. Findings showed that dropout rates for both student groups were well below the citywide average. Transfer rates were higher than dropout rates for both groups. Selected students maintained higher attendance and mathematics achievement rates than did the random group. Considerable variations in achievement patterns were observed across the city. Options program staff's initial apprehensions regarding randomly assigned students' performance were generally not supported by the data. An appendix with data tables is included. (MLH)",

        "description":"A decade ago, the business community began to pursue tentative, new relationships with schools; the focus was on long-term educational improvement, frequently targeted to core academic subjects. Now partnerships are everywhere, involving thousands of schools and hundreds of thousands of local people. This essay discusses the resources brought to schools by school-business partnerships and assesses these partnerships' magnitude and dependability. Straightforward discussion of dollars and forecasts is impossible, since most schools, districts, and business partners seem to operate with little concern for tracking the dollar figures for donated services. One estimate shows that corporate gifts through partnerships amount to less than 0.5 percent of total school expenditures. When  gifts (both tax-deductible and nondeducted contributions) are considered, the amount improves, but is unlikely to increase in the future. The total pool of business giving has hovered around 1 percent of pretax net income for 40 years. Fortunately, in many cooperative transactions, no dollars change hands. Since the 1960s, a &quot;new corporate philanthropy&quot; has emerged that accepts a large measure of community responsibility as good business and good citizenship. Two potential benefits have emerged: (1) advocacy for increased financial support for schools; and (2) efforts to increase public confidence in schools and to link schools with the local economic development that will increase the tax base and secure greater tax support without increasing the individual tax burden.

        "description":"Prepared to assist teachers who are using the case in class discussion, this case study describes a suburban, college-preparatory high school located in the pseudonymously named &quot;Northwood,&quot; a midwestern &quot;rust belt&quot; city characterized by rapidly shifting demographics and a growing commercial tax base. Although the city is now 25 percent black, another newer high school remains predominantly white. Over the past 15 years, Northwood High has shifted from 70 percent white to 70 percent black and other minorities. Although black students are economically similar to the Jewish families they have replaced, teachers found them culturally different and behaviorally challenging. Morale was at its worst when Principal Don Hawley arrived; a reformer at heart, he immediately initiated two  new programs: a Positive Peer Influence (PPI) program that broadened students' role in improving discipline and a participatory decision-making program that gave teachers responsibility for policy. The Faculty Senate has proved a mixed blessing. Some teachers find it too formal or too disruptive; others appreciate having more say. Teachers are positive concerning the PPI and other human relations innovations and evince a caring attitude toward students. Teachers are divided about the disciplinary system: while most feel it works pretty well, a few feel that the teacher's position has been undermined by the school's student empowerment focus. Almost no teachers have voluntarily left during the past decade. An appendix provides descriptions of additional school characteristics. Case  teaching notes are also appended. (MLH)",

        "description":"Despite many responses to the dropout problem, it remains unclear which school strategies are successful with at-risk students. State initiatives are well intentioned, but have certain limitations. Criteria such as local accountability, school-by-school regeneration and reform, longitudinal strategies, and horizontal coordination are needed. This paper describes the Annie E. Casey Foundation's New Futures Initiative, a project drawing on these criteria to help communities assist their at-risk youth. Community partnerships were created in five cities (Dayton, Ohio; Lawrence, Massachusetts; Little Rock, Arkansas; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Savannah, Georgia) to bring about improved school achievement, reduced dropout and teen pregnancy rates, and increased young adult  employment. The paper focuses only on the educational aspects of the initiative. In each city, the heart of New Futures is a &quot;community collaborative&quot; charged with planning, coordinating, and implementing specific youth-serving programs. Governed by broadly representative boards, these &quot;collaboratives&quot; are empowered with the political authority to plan and execute policy. Cities will assess their plan's success through a set of 10 outcome indicators stipulated by the Casey Foundation. It is too early to know whether the specific activities generated by New Futures will constitute systemic reforms that enhance the educational outcomes of most students at risk. Certain questions have already arisen concerning the collaboratives' ability to represent more than the traditional power elite, to  bring about systemic change, and to effect a reform agenda generated outside the schools. As an experiment, however, New Futures contains documents that could lead to the development of a broad commitment to the welfare of all children in the five participating cities, especially in their approach to issues of ownership and involvement.

        "description":"A frequently cited explanation for women's underrepresentation in educational administration is the incongruence between traditional administrative role stereotypes and gender stereotypes. However, this paper posits that certain educational and demographic trends may influence school administrator roles to become less stereotypically masculine. Simultaneously, substantial numbers of administrative openings are anticipated, and significant numbers of women are securing administrative credentials. These forces may combine to increase women's representation in school administration. This paper aims to: (1) discuss the nature of sex role stereotyping in administrator selection; (2) describe educational reform and student demographic trends that may reshape school administrators'  roles; (3) describe certain demographic trends involving school personnel that may increase women's educational leadership opportunities; and (4) discuss how these trends and patterns may combine to influence greater representation of women in school administration. The 1980s educational reform movement has spawned numerous changes (including site-based management, teacher empowerment, instructional leadership, and school effectiveness efforts) that may significantly alter the image of schools and school leadership. By the late 1990s, enrollment figures for school-aged children will approximate those of the early 1970s. This trend and the problems of a changing student population suggest a need for a different type of administrator--an &quot;instructional physician,&quot; rather than an &quot;executive  manager&quot; or &quot;coach.&quot; The weakening of the dissonance between administrator role stereotypes and female stereotypes at a time of increasing educational leadership opportunities should see more women in administrative positions.

Of 63 questionnaires mailed out, 58 (92.1 percent) were returned and used in the database. When the superintendents rated various board-superintendent relationships, the highest rating generally was trust. However, these same superintendents rated their own boards' trust in them much lower. Whereas they rated the boards' confidence in the superintendents' fiscal competence as more important than curriculum competence, they felt their own boards had more confidence in their  curriculum abilities than in finance. Also, the boards' confidence was significantly related to the boards' and superintendents' attending state meetings and going to restaurants together. Superintendents communicated to the board through the board president, and boards relied on the president for this communication. The first-year superintendents surveyed seemed satisfied with their career choice and job security. Included are 12 tables. (Nine references) (Author/MLH)",

This paper addresses pragmatic concerns about definitions and policy questions related to educational finance. Interdistrict choice, emphasizing families' right to choose among existing public schools, raises questions regarding transportation and facilities planning responsibilities, Chapter 1 funding, and information distribution costs. Second-chance programs, which extend interdistrict choice and postsecondary options to at-risk youth through alternative programs, can face the same financial problems as interdistrict plans where inequities already exist or where the state share of per pupil expenditure is low. &quot;Hard&quot; state funding should support alternative schools and their staff  development and training costs. Controlled choice plans, requiring all families to choose a school within the district, do not involve funding transfers between districts or systems, but may require the reallocation of funding between schools. Extra costs include transportation, parent information, planning, technical assistance, and staff development. Intradistrict choice plans based on teacher-initiated schools have high startup costs and raise administrative control questions. Magnet schools, aiming at school improvement through special resources, require additional costs for transportation, improved facilities, special programs, and additional staff and staff development. Finally, postsecondary options for upper division high school students raise equity and equal access concerns. (11  references) (MLH)",

The study summarized in this paper explores demographic, relational, and operational characteristics of mentor dyads in both formal programs and informal pairings of aspiring and practicing administrators with more experienced administrators. Using multiple data collection methods (data comparisons, demographics analysis, and structured interviews), two populations were studied--40 pairs of practicing and prospective administrators participating in a statewide formal mentorship program and a stratified random sample of administrators pursuing naturally evolving mentoring relationships. Characteristics of formal and informal  mentorships were found to be similar to mentorships in other occupations, though relational characteristics were the controlling factors in establishing a successful mentorship dyad. Traits of trust, mutual respect, openness, commitment, and friendship were reported as the most critical relational factors. Most dyads in both populations stressed professional aspects of their relationship over personal aspects. Where choice of partner existed, formal mentorships were rated as more successful than formal arrangements without choice. Informal mentorships, built on choice from the beginning, were rated more highly than the formal mentorships. Clearly, formal mentorships can benefit both mentors and proteges. Six aspects of successful formal programs are recommended. Six tables present survey  data. (11 references) (MLH)",

        "description":"A survey of Oregon school administrators explored the relationships among demographic characteristics, school building and school district constraints, and leadership impact. Methodology involved a mailed survey of 420 administrators, which yielded 319 responses, or a 70 percent response rate, and in-depth personal interviews with 144 respondents. Findings indicated a similarity of opinions shared among school administrators across different situations and identified the emergence of an occupational culture that stresses leadership. When other factors were controlled, district constraints and leadership impact were found to be inversely related. Superintendents, however, reported fewer feelings of constraint and more belief in their administrative impact than other  administrators. A recommendation is made for further research on superintendents to integrate the study of traits and contingencies into school leadership theory. Three statistical tables are included.

        "description":"This paper examines the relationship between demands for site-based management and restructuring as they bear on recent theory and research on power in organizations. It also defines and describes the new face of power in the schools--facilitative power, power exercised through, rather than over, subordinates. The bulk of the paper consists of an attempt to show how power sharing is already in place in many current school activities. Six programs that encourage facilitative power are described: the Individual Educational Program in special education; the consultant teacher model, increasingly a component of special education delivery systems; peer consultation; cooperative learning; thematic, multidisciplinary curricula in which staff members work a specific curricular theme into  the school activities; and community/alternative schools, which take curricular themes much further. These programs are discussed in relation to four characteristics of facilitative power: resource management, human resource utilization, supervision, and networking. Conclusions are that many school administrators already possess facilitative skills and knowledge and that the potential of a restructuring plan can be measured by its effect on administrators' ability to utilize facilitative power. One table accompanies the document. (45 references) (LMI)",

A questionnaire mailed to 225 administrators in 25 junior high schools yielded 211 responses, a 93 percent response rate. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 respondents. Findings indicate that role conflict and role ambiguity are separate constructs and have different sources. Role conflict stems from contradictory external and internal demands, a heavy workload, and incompatible school subcultures and is more likely to reduce job dissatisfaction and increase somatic complaints. Role ambiguity is created by inadequate communication, administrative inexperience, frequent personnel changes,  and organizational growth. A conclusion is that Chinese cultural norms appear to amplify role stress. Two tables and one figure are included. (26 references) (LMI)",

Power as a \"system of facilitation,\" in contrast to power as a \"system of authority\" is explored and related to educational administration practices. The educational trends of clinical supervision and individualized programming within special education are analyzed to illustrate how the redefinition of power as a facilitative system presents a viable alternative paradigm. Characteristics of facilitative power include increased autonomy and decision making of professional staff, encouragement of innovative problem-solving approaches, and reduction of the centrality of the administrator role. Professional power generated by a system of facilitation, or power through others, is distinguished from formal authority,  or power over others. A conclusion is that professional power is most effective in truly professional settings, of which individual autonomy is a primary element. (44 references) (LMI)",

Based on the thesis that individual educational leadership is a myth derived from misconceptions about social institutions and from the failure of the institution of education to value intellect, the paper demonstrates that these shortcomings stem from the power relationships in schools and the educational system. Following the analysis of Michel Foucault, the suggestion is made that not only is intellect devalued by schools, but it is the central subject of true education. Because learning entails collaboration, the concept of the individual organizational leader may obscure the relationships that promote or constrain the development of intellect as the legitimate objective of learning.  The observation is made that teachers may be more likely to exercise leadership, as defined in this essay, than school managers. (87 references) (LMI)",

        "description":"The effects of state policy on school restructuring efforts are examined in this report. Three main sections present a review of restructuring concepts, a process to determine state policy effects on school restructuring, and application of this process to applied learning in six states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Methodology involved a statutory review and interviews with state representatives. Findings indicate that different starting points influence the ways in which schools attempt to restructure, and that combinations of some laws may hinder active learning. However, most state policies tend to permit restructuring if district support for individual school efforts exists. Respondents believed that state-level policy makers  strongly influence assessment and curriculum decisions, while district and local policy makers affect instructional strategies and student learning goals. Recommendations are made for the development of coherent goals, emphasis on successes, and publicizing the intent and flexibility of state policies, especially those providing incentives for innovation. Appendices include examples of restructuring efforts and information about state legislation and active learning. (LMI)",

          "Goldman, Paul"],
        "description":"The concept of power, fundamental to understanding human interactions and institutions, remains puzzling, elusive, theoretically complex, and largely unexamined by practitioners. A school restructuring agenda that purportedly changes power relationships in schools is being proposed and tested throughout the country. Basic questions are being asked about top-down power, and terms such as &quot;power sharing,&quot;&quot;empowerment,&quot; and &quot;site-based management&quot; embody hopes and expectations for improving school performance. These discussions rarely consider the underlying assumptions affecting power relationships among the practitioner/actors involved in decision-making. Attempting to reconsider the dominant sociological theories explaining power in schools, this paper argues that facilitative  power, an alternative to traditional (authoritarian) interpretations of power in organizations, more accurately describes how power is exercised in school settings. Facilitative, interactive power has become increasingly common in settings where no single individual or role commands decision-making control without dependence on expert knowledge and cooperation among colleagues. Facilitative power enlarges decision-making and encourages nonstandardized approaches to problem-solving. Specific examples include the individualized educational program process in special education and current clinical supervision practices. These demonstrate the limitations of traditional power concepts and the usefulness of facilitation for capturing the essential nature of interactions among principals and  both professional and nonprofessional staff.

        "author":["Goldman, Paul"],
        "description":"Despite recent efforts to overhaul teacher training and redesign the American teacher, reform advocates acknowledge that not enough is known about predicting education work force outcomes or their effects on classroom results. Lack of a strong conceptual background and a rigorous practice teaching experience handicaps beginning teachers and provides an inadequate foundation for subsequent career development. Teacher education reform may have gained political momentum more quickly than a research base could be developed. However, this paper suggests that insights and propositions are available from the literature and that applications of social science theories and research on professional, occupational, and organizational socialization will improve our understanding of teacher  socialization. To understand the organizational context of high school teacher socialization, one must examine the reciprocal relationship between training and employing organizations and the effects that departmental knowledge and social organization may have on the ways teachers learn their craft over a period of years or even decades. The virtually continuous interaction between the institution of occupational orientation (the university) and the institution of organizational socialization (the school) is accomplished through publications, special partnerships, and a continual influx of newly graduated teachers. Departmental knowledge bases exhibit broad, substantial differences in the development of occupational communities affecting teacher socialization. (33 references)  (MLH)",

        "description":"Although education professionals are major stakeholders in administrative reform, the emerging debate about administrator training has involved the elites--representatives of professional associations, leaders in large or rich districts, state regulators, colleges of education, and departments of educational administration. Previous literature reports little about administrators' interpretations of the issues engaging the elite. This paper discusses the results of a study exploring administrators' perceptions concerning their recruitment and training, their postcertification professional development, and the effectiveness of past and present training in preparing administrators to solve current and future problems. Self-administered questionnaires were mailed to 420 members of  Oregon's professional association. The sample was stratified by region, district size, gender, and position. The response rate was 70 percent; 75 percent of respondents agreed to be contacted for face-to-face interviews. Most administrators felt ambivalent about formal schooling and wished they had more direct, hands-on training. Also, they felt that certification and professional development programs were offered at inconvenient times and often provided irrelevant training activities. The data on Oregon's school administrators reflects consensus on attitudes, but describes enormous variation in individual and organizational experiences not attributable to demographic differences. Some speculative impressions concerning these variations are presented. (30 references) (MLH)",

Chapter 1 introduces the report, outlining recent changes in the gifted education program, controversy over the development of gifted education programs, and the socially constructed nature of giftedness. Chapter 2 deals with performance of gifted students in grades 5, 6, 8, and 9. Strong performances were exhibited in writing, while performance was not as impressive in the arithmetic domain. Students appeared to value intellectual effort and resisted the pull toward academic mediocrity. Chapter 3 presents the results of a survey of 202 parents, 107 teachers, and 26 people  who were both parents and teachers. The survey identified respondents' views on issues in gifted education, characteristics of gifted students, and quality of gifted programs. Chapter 4 reports on visits to GATE (Gifted and Talented Education) classes in both congregated and integrated settings. Discussion of the school visits is organized around the topics of leadership and school philosophy, student activities and behavior, programming, selection and monitoring, and the importance of the arts. A concluding chapter makes overall observations and suggestions. Appendices contain example assessment tasks and scoring keys, summary statistics, and a copy of the survey questionnaire. (JDD)",

The new way of thinking stresses supporting individuals, families, and communities. A new perspective on policy is offered, along with an overview of the history of services to people with  developmental disabilities. Educational services from preschool to adult vocational programs are described. A section on new living options discusses returning people to communities, developing alternatives to regional centers, and establishing more individualized settings. Alternative approaches to traditional job placement involve rehabilitation services, developmental achievement centers, and integrated employment opportunities. A final section examines mechanisms needed to support the new vision (federal funding reforms, alternatives to institutional care, and promotion of individualized options) and notes what Minnesotans can do to support the vision, as consumers and parents, policymakers, professionals, citizens, and communities.

Services most frequently received were occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy. Of the 1,164 children transferred or demitted from DAC programs, the largest percentage entered special education programs in the public school. The number of children's programs continued to decline as local education agencies increased coverage of those services.

        "description":"A survey was conducted of 101 day training and habilitation services in Minnesota serving adults with developmental disabilities. The survey gathered information on age of clients, level of functioning, additional disabilities, place of residence, length of placement, vocational activities, integration, supervision, length of time at the same job site, and reasons for job termination. Twenty-six programs serving children in 1987 were also surveyed; only one program was still serving children in 1988, as the state had mandated that services be administered by local school districts. Financial results are analyzed in terms of revenues, expenditures, per diems, and licensed capacity. Results of the survey indicated that the number of adults served increased from 1986 to 1988. The  number of persons with severe or profound levels of mental retardation continued to increase. The number of persons in vocational activities increased since 1986, especially for community-based vocational activities (CBVA). Persons working in center-based vocational activities showed decreased earnings from 1987 to 1988, while persons in CBVA showed marked growth in number of hours worked and wages earned. The percentage of persons in integrated settings increased to 48.1% from 43.1% in 1987. (JDD)",

Key strategies identified include: (1) setting specific benchmarks or objectives for converting the existing system to one more oriented to providing training and employment in integrated settings; (2) setting a cap or moratorium on expenditures for sheltered work, work activity, adult day programs, and related services; (3) appropriating new state dollars earmarked for supported employment and reallocating current public dollars; (4)  establishing segmented or sequential financing arrangements; (5) pooling dollars from several sources; (6) targeting efforts to make maximum use of provisions under existing public programs such as Supplemental Security Income and the Job Training Partnership Act; (7) establishing state and local interagency agreements; and (8) creating an entity supported by all key state agencies to provide training, technical assistance, and related activities. Each of these strategies is discussed, along with examples from selected states. Possible next steps for Minnesota are explored, and a list of 26 references is included. (JDD)",

The executive summary provides a definition of disability, incidence figures, and figures for costs to society of failing to help the disabled. Findings are reported in the areas of information dissemination, funding, and research and development. Findings include the following: (1) there is currently no systematic effort in Minnesota to gather information about existing technologies and their applications or to disseminate it; (2) there is no site where people with disabilities can  have access to equipment for the purpose of assessing its potential applications; and (3) state agency definitions of such terms as &quot;medical necessity&quot; are unnecessarily restrictive and prevent or delay appropriate use of technology. Eleven recommendations include the establishment of an ongoing Advisory Board on Technology for People with Disabilities; provision of technology related training to professionals serving these people; and a requirement that public agencies and private insurance carriers expand their definition of medical necessity.

        "description":"Project CREATE was a 4-year federally funded research program which sought to determine ways in which computer technology could improve the education of learning-disabled students. Early work on the project centered on the development of a theoretical and conceptual foundation; a hierarchical conceptual model was constructed that related school performance in reading to underlying cognitive processing skills, perceptual enabling skills, and neuromuscular vision skills. Two California school districts were involved in the project: the Fremont Union High School District and the Cupertino Union School District. A software selection and evaluation tool (included in Appendix B) was developed, several adaptive software handbooks were produced, and two software programs were created  (TurboScan and Wordsworth). Elementary students who received the TurboScan software treatment improved in their ability to rapidly discriminate critical features associated with character and word recognition, and demonstrated better reading skills. Secondary students who received the Wordsworth software treatment for cognitive processing development improved in their ability to recognize literal facts and details in narrative text and, to some extent, to make inferences. Student-machine interface conditions that acted as barriers to effective study were identified, and a facilitating interface was designed. An appendix contains scope and sequence information.

The tool is predicated upon family members and professionals working together as a team. The tool includes functional curricular content designed to extend or supplement general  education curriculum. The model conceptualizes functional activities and skills as belonging to one of three general categories: cross-environmental activities, environment-specific activities, and sensory learning skills. This manual for the sixth version of COACH describes assumptions upon which the tool is based, provides background information and general directions for administering the assessment, offers samples of completed forms, and provides a blank form.

The subjects were divided into two groups: one with mobility impairments and one with general health impairments. Areas examined included health, finances, work, living arrangements, recreation, mobility, communication, self-care, and socialization. Significant differences were found between: (1) adolescents with mobility impairments and their parents regarding whether they would have health problems as adults; (2) adolescents in each group and their parents regarding whether they expect to have children; (3) adolescents in each group and their parents regarding whether or not they had  knowledge of financial programs and/or agencies. Seventy-five percent of the adolescents felt that they could fully support themselves as adults, while only 33% of the mothers of general health-impaired adolescents and 67% of the mothers of mobility-impaired adolescents felt so. Compared to the general health-impaired adolescents, more adolescents with mobility impairments and their mothers identified a need for special living arrangements as adults. Future normal employment was agreed upon by adolescents and their mothers. (40 references) (JDD)",

        "description":"At-risk children's acquisition of reading skills can be accelerated if they are provided with more and better instruction than is given their peers who seem to acquire reading rather easily. One aspect of better instruction is a coherent curriculum plan that provides learners with sets of activities that link together and foster learning. Children who participate in remedial and special education programs often are confronted with a fragmented reading curriculum, though they are the very learners who most benefit from a coherent curriculum plan. Remedial and special education programs should build upon, extend, reinforce, and balance the classroom lessons. Coherent curriculum plans identify the reading/language arts curriculum from which all children will work, create  opportunities for the development of \"shared knowledge\" among all professional staff, and foster a collaborative planning and teaching environment. A strategy is offered that leads to development of coherent curriculum plans, to be applied by either the classroom teacher or a specialist teacher. A sample format for 1 week of lessons coordinated between classroom and remedial instruction is appended to the article.

What is expected of creativity is non-conformity, violation of rules, and challenges to accepted convention. Words may be used to activate possible contexts. Most textbook sentence examples do not excite the imagination, but when their potential is exploited, they can take on the character of literature, adding lexis a little at a time and shaping context. Classroom procedures to exploit the potential of the sentence might include combining randomly selected sentences to stimulate manipulation of structures, arranging sentences with little apparent contextual possibility into a narrative, or asking students to supply expressions to  make connections between semantically diverse sentences. In this way, students can be guided into fashioning fiction from what at first appears to be a list of random and unrelated sentences. Poetry can also be produced by this means. (MSE)",

In the second year class, it was observed that the teacher emphasized introduction of the circumstances of the story, the story's phases, and the conclusion, with little attention accorded to students'  cultural differences. In the third year, the following differences in the instruction emerged: more reading and less listening practice, and more attention to the story's narrative dimension. In the fourth year, emphasis was placed on persuasive discourse concerning violence at school, the closest reference yet to cultural divisions among students. In the fifth year class, the task was a critical analysis of a film, still focusing on argumentation. Writing errors that the teacher noted were also analyzed. The unfinished study will continue with analysis of materials used by the teachers. (MSE)",

The second chapter examines bilingual program content by subject area, and describes how the requirements of the core curriculum interact with the special needs of the LEP student. Chapter 3 details one possible organizing scheme for large-scale bilingual programs, i.e., the transitional bilingual education program, and focuses on key  questions in classroom-level planning. In the fourth chapter, essential elements for effective program support are discussed, including a staff of trained professionals who believe in and act on the assumption that every student can do well in school, and appropriate instructional materials, parental involvement, and periodic program evaluation. The final chapter reviews the key elements of program design and provides a checklist for planners. (MSE)",

        "description":"A discussion of Paulo Freire's contemporary pedagogy looks at the philosophy underlying the approach in the context of traditional educational philosophy. Freire's pedagogy of the oppressed, Liberatory Learning, which was originally developed as a reponse to illiteracy among Brazilian peasants, also holds significance for other culture and contexts as a model of learning for developing literacy and enabling individuals to understand, respond to, and to some degree control the circumstances and directions of their lives. The history of the approach's development is chronicled and the method examined in writing and English-as-a-Second-Language programs in U.S. universities. It is then proposed that Liberatory Learning is a re-working of fundamental principles regarding learning for  Freire's specific goals, using methods usually reserved for literate, responsible learners such as Greek scholars and graduate-level business students: dialogue, student engagement, and reflection and response. It is argued that the responsibility and action Freire hopes to inspire among the illiterate, through literacy and authority, parallel the learning processes characterizing the Socratic method, Dewey's experimentalism, and the Harvard Business School case method. Illustrations and further comparisons are offered. A brief bibliography is included. (MSE)",

It was hypothesized that difficulty in removing the initial consonant from the vowel with which it coarticulates is due not only to perceptual immaturity but also, and primarily, to undeveloped metaphonological abilities only acquired with literacy. Results indicate that the literate subjects did not completely succeed in erasing initial consonants, and none of the groups succeeded in completely erasing the initial vowel. Semi-literates performed poorly, confirming non-mastery of phoneme-grapheme correspondence rules. Error patterns suggest that (1) illiterate and  semi-literate subjects could not properly follow instructions and were compelled to seek the word's meaning, the goal in natural communication; and (2) repetitions and perseverations indicate only the shallowest physical decoding (echoic response). It is concluded that while the results do not fully confirm the hypothesis, they demonstrate the effect of mastering the alphabetic code on the ability to adhere to the instructions and to the decontextualized acoustic signal.

The purpose of this paper is to show that a small-scale test development project can be successfully developed using relatively limited resources, inexpensive computer software, and expertise that can be reasonably acquired by second language teachers. Experiences in developing, piloting, and validating two small-scale standardized tests, the Canadian Test of English for Scholars and Trainees and the Summer Language Bursary Program Placement Test are used as illustrations.  Standardized tests are defined, and the process of developing standardized measures is outlined. Applications of classical test theory and item response theory in this context are explained, including the use of sample-free calibration, test-free person measurement, goodness-of-fit measures, and multiple reliability. The role of informed judgment as an adjunct to statistical analyses in test development is also discussed. A brief bibliography is included. (MSE)",

First, research on the degree of consciousness in pragmatic learning and on consciousness and principles of language learning is reviewed. Three distinctions are examined: conscious perception versus subliminal influence in learning; explicit versus implicit learning; and intentional versus incidental learning. Anecdotal and empirical evidence that the research findings are relevant for the learning of first- and second-language pragmatics is assessed. Further evidence for the generalization of principles  of pragmatics and discourse is also discussed. It is concluded that data from experimental psychology clearly support the following hypotheses: (1) attention to input is a necessary condition for any learning; and (2) what must be attended to is not input in general, but whatever features of the input play a role in the system to be learned. For learning of second language pragmatics, attention to linguistic forms, functional meanings, and relevant contextual features is required. (MSE)",

        "description":"The work of researchers, theorists, and practitioners suggests that to facilitate academic success for college-level students of English as a Second Language (ESL), attention must focus on, but not be limited to, the following areas: (1) students need to become &quot;acquirers,&quot; not just &quot;learners,&quot; of the second language; (2) students need to develop into &quot;second language writers&quot; who can use writing for discovery and creation of meaning; and (3) opportunities to write for multiple audiences, to become participants in the academic and discourse communities, and to acquire the relevant knowledge that accompanies membership, must be provided. Each of these objectives is substantial, and all are interdependent. Sheltered English classes as commonly conceived may not be the most  effective response to these needs. The Writing Across the Curriculum movement offers a pedagogy that may help ensure that sheltered classes achieve their potential. Two significant features include: (1) the premise that writing expressively about academic content is a powerful method of making a subject the student's own and integrating it into his knowledge structure; and (2) recognition that the Writing Across the Curriculum movement is keyed to an element that is strongly linked to any meaningful academic change--extensive faculty development. Incorporating these principles into the already linguistically enhanced sheltered classes can provide powerfully meaningful educational experiences for ESL students. (MSE)",

An evaluation of the program's first year focuses on the extent to which students began to acquire  scientific ways of talking and reasoning. Data are both quantitative and qualitative, drawn from problem-solving protocols administered individually in interviews at the beginning and end of the 1988-89 school year. Students were in a combined 7th-8th grade self-contained bilingual classroom (n=20) and in a basic skills program within a large high school bilingual program (n=22).

The dilemmas and issues students met grew directly from their own scientific activity, which encompassed many aspects of authentic scientific inquiry.

In particular, the investigation analyzed the ways in which a model of scientific inquiry was interpreted in the classrooms and the effects of those interpretations on both science and literacy practices. The investigation focused on how the model and the teachers' goals interacted to produce, even within the same classroom, different interpretations of science, which in turn influenced the forms and functions of literacy in the classroom. In both classrooms, the model effectively transformed the kinds of  science and literacy practiced from traditional worksheet-based exercises to authentic, communicative, sense-making practices through very different processes. The two case studies are based on the first year of a multiyear project, Cheche Konnen (meaning &quot;search for knowledge in Hawiian Creole&quot;), in which researchers and teachers are collaborating to develop an investigation-based approach to science for language minority students. Sources of data include classroom observation, audio- and videotapes of classroom activity, teacher-researcher meeting notes, teacher interviews, and teacher- and student-produced texts.

Subjects were 16 beginning, 12 intermediate, and 4 advanced students. After an initial month-long observation period, the following hypotheses were formed: (1) learners do not readily initiate greetings; and (2) most learners may respond to a greeting but may not elaborate. The hypotheses were then tested using data obtained from a series of elicitation tasks using verbal and written role-plays. For each role-play, the number of turns taken in greetings were counted. Results suggest that learners of Kiswahili lack the pragmatics of Kiswahili greetings even though they know the different forms of greetings required. Apparently, most learners regarded the language  class and instructors' offices, the settings for the role-play tasks, as no different from other classes or instructors' offices and came to them with the semantic formulas and pragmatics of their native language. In addition, pragmatic performance did not always correlate with grammatical competence; learners at different levels were at different stages of pragmatic development. Further research on creating an environment more conducive to target language use, native speaker greeting behaviors, and individual differences in pragmatic performance is recommended. (MSE)",

A full evening's broadcast of television commercials from China, Japan, Korea, and the United States formed the research sample for this study, and the resulting data supported both hypotheses. American  television commercials employed stronger suggestions and far more imperatives than Asian commercials.

Finally, an evaluation study of the opinions and attitudes of some Singapore teachers and pupils towards the teaching and learning of spoken English is briefly summarized. It is concluded that the evaluation of speaking  in secondary schools is clearly linked with the evaluation and valuing of spoken language by all teachers and by the school system itself.

This, if true, may be the result of various factors. Although teachers believe that they alter their teaching strategies for different class sizes, this may not be the case. More likely is the possibility that classroom lessons themselves are not significant determinants of the achievement of learners. Some research has indicated that students perceive classroom lessons to be inadequate or even a hindrance to the learning process, and tend to compensate for this by pursing extra-classroom learning or educational activities. While additional research on the effect of class size is needed to confirm this hypothesis, especially for language education,  these observations point to the need for research on language learners study habits to see if relatively successful learners spend more time learning out of class than do less successful learners.

Many different methods of \"globalizing\" education may be employed. Several techniques are detailed including: the creation of a \"cultural  island\" in the classroom, the use of various media, simulation of other cultures, and the use of informative cartoons.

        "description":"The stories in this collection result from a class activity in an English-as-a-Second-Language course at Prague Institute of Chemical Technology (Czechoslovakia). The students, most in their third or fourth year of postsecondary education, had all studied English previously but primarily as an academic exercise, and had had little contact with native speakers of English. Students were asked to share personal stories or anecdotes of their own experiences. Triggers used to stimulate student writing included snapshots and sketches and ideas from a text on lifestory writing. The stories included here are a sampling of the classroom activities' results. Teachers are encouraged to look at the stories as examples of language learner communication, despite idiomatic and syntactic flaws.  Language specialists are urged to examine unusual English usage and evidence of interference. (MSE)",

        "description":"This study documented English acquisition by a group of Hmong adult immigrants over a period of one year, and explored the factors that appeared to be affecting their progress. Based on three measures (a test of listening comprehension, communication, fluency, reading, and writing; a pictured English vocabulary recognition test; and a written English vocabulary test), it was found that learning was taking place, slowly, 2 to 4 years after arrival in the United States. Individuals' relative positions within the group with regard to English proficiency remained much the same over time. Both the individuals' experiences before arrival and their current activities were found to be highly correlated with English proficiency. Analyses indicate that certain background characteristics,  especially proficiency in reading Hmong, age, and amount of education received before immigration, are strong predictors of English proficiency. As additional data are analyzed, particular attention will be paid to the apparently strong role played by literacy in Hmong, and to the pervasive interaction between literacy and language acquisitions.

The report is based on students' responses to a survey of: racial attitudes and opinions; satisfaction with the institution they attend; academic and social climate on campus; factors they believe are important in choosing a college; and factors important in recruiting minority students. Evidence in the study suggests that a student's race may not be the major factor in determining his or her opinion or perception about campus climate. Opinions or perceptions were more often determined by the student's membership in the minority or majority group on campus and, to a  lesser extent, by the type of institution he/she attends. Only in the area of recruiting did there appear to be a strong divergence of opinion along racial lines. Black students placed more importance on information they received from college recruiters than did white students. Overall, students seemed to be open-minded toward relations between the races. Many white students did not believe that black students should receive special considerations because of their minority status. (JDD)",

The researcher, as participant-observer, had access to all bargaining sessions and to both union and administration caucuses. Although bargaining is often considered a rational process, this case illuminated the processes and outcomes of negotiation under conditions of loose coupling and bounded rationality. Negotiations showed the three major characteristics of organized anarchies, and had outcomes more symbolic than instrumental. People bargained to get what they wanted, but also bargained so that they wanted what they got; attitudes followed as well as preceded behavior, and although the bargaining was in part goal-directed, goals were also  bargain-directed. Bargaining did not affect institutional operations, but it did help participants arrive at more consistent interpretations of institutional life. Includes 17 references. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"A study of college faculty stressors attempted to address limitations in previous research by extending the variables measured to include both on- and off-campus sources of stress and by testing the implicit assumption that all faculty perceive the same dimensions of stress, albeit at different levels. Data were drawn from a 1989-90 national survey of 93,479 full-time faculty in 400 institutions. From this total, 51,574 usable responses were received, a number which was later refined down to 35,478 full time faculty and 392 institutions. This total was then divided into 8 groups, from each of which a random sample of 491 was drawn yielding a final sample size for this study of 3,928. Faculty variables considered include tenure, sex, race (white or non-white), institutional  selectivity (low, medium, high), and sector (private, public, non-sectarian, Catholic, Protestant, and two- and four-year). Results indicate that different groups of tenured faculty perceive varying levels and dimensions of stress. The largest differences across groups were found in &quot;subtle discrimination.&quot; It was also found that men and women perceive household responsibility stress similarly, although men express it less frequently. Methodological implications for stress research are considered. The findings' implications for institutional policy include differential faculty development emphases and a need for increased and more creative institutional efforts at stress reduction.

Six collegiate styles or orientations were identified: social-political activist, post-collegiate, libertarian, creative, recognized authority, and traditional academic. Analysis indicated that the student body had a wide variety of collegiate styles, with no single style  dominating. Distribution of the different styles appears to have changed over time, and student behavior appears to be consistent within each style. Students with some styles showed significant change in attitudes during the college experience and some others showed little change during that period. Concerns about compartmentalization in college life and underuse of college resources are discussed. Includes nine references. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study investigated: (1) the degree of land grant institution involvement in economic development activity, defined in terms of 17 selected cooperative research and technology exchange activities; (2) changes in selected academic policies (patents, consulting, conflict of interest, conflict of commitment, and extra compensation); and (3) the factors responsible for encouraging or discouraging increased institutional involvement in economic development activity. It was hypothesized that size of operating budget, geographic region, and differences between historically black and other institutions would account for significant differences in level of involvement in economic development. Data were drawn from two surveys of the chief academic officers of the 71 United States land  grant colleges and universities; missing and supplemental data were obtained from a reference publication. As of the time of preparation of this paper, neither data gathering nor analysis are yet complete, but results so far indicate increased institutional involvement in these institutions, which have a somewhat common charter mission emphasizing public service. However, the range of responses indicates that factors influencing such involvement varies considerably. Additional research, particularly regarding the possible link between increased involvement and expanded funding, is recommended. Includes 25 references. (MSE)",

The model is viewed as three-dimensional, composed of the structural or organizational aspect, the contextual dimension, and the conventional sequence of public policy process. The structural dimension consists of units and the forces and linkages occurring between them. Contextual factors include five variables: (1) powers of the state board; (2) state officials' attitudes toward higher education; (3) the state budget situation; (4) the historic  relationship between the state and higher education; and (5) the state's political mood. The public policy process includes problem-structuring, policy formation, implementation, and evaluation. Development and refinement of the model is continuing, with the objective of providing a useful and valid conceptual framework for the study and comparison of policy-making for state systems of higher education.

Data were gathered during a year-long examination of institutional conditions associated with student involvement in out-of-class learning opportunities at 14 colleges and universities (Iowa State University; Miami University, Ohio; Stanford University, California; University of California-Davis; Berea College, Kentucky; Earlham College, Indiana; Grinnell College, Iowa; Evergreen State College, Washington; University of Alabama--Birmingham; University of Louisville, Kentucky; University of North Carolina-Charlotte; Wichita State University, Kansas; Mount Holyoke College,  Massachusetts; and Xavier University of Louisiana) of three types: small residential, large residential, and urban. About 1,300 staff, alumni, and trustees were interviewed and 3,603 undergraduate students were surveyed. Four conclusions are drawn: (1) the small residential college environments were associated with patterns of student learning that differed appreciably from both types of larger institution; (2) for students at large institutions, one's peers seem to be as important to student learning as faculty; (3) a cumulative index of learning obfuscates the diverse patterns of learning and the influence of different environmental characteristics on learning; and (4) surrogate indices of institutional culture seem to be associated with student learning but in ways that are difficult  to explain.

        "description":"A study evaluated the potential of professionalization strategies for enhancing the occupation of development officers, particularly in higher education. Based on the strength (high or low of the individual's commitment to two variables, namely, the occupation (cosmopolitanism) and the institution (localism), four recognizable development types are identified: the professional, marked by high loyalty to both the institution and the occupation; the careerist (sometimes called a &quot;migrant worker&quot;) marked by loyalty to the occupation above the institution; the placebound worker, having little loyalty to either the occupation or the institution; and the booster, marked by high loyalty to the institution and minimum identification with the occupation. Three theoretical perspectives on  professionalization in general, from the 1950s to the present, are described: functional, pluralist power, and institutional. Goals, strategies, and tactics commonly used in the professionalization process are discussed, including development of a knowledge base, instilling of a service orientation, organization of national and regional associations, construction of codes of ethics, and introduction of certification, licensing, and accreditation. The benefits and costs of professional skill development and of establishing a theoretical and research base for this and other professions are assessed. It is concluded that while development officers are concerned about their professional image, there appears to be little interest in developing the theory and research base for fund-raising as a  mature profession.

Data on respondents' highest degree and its content area were also gathered. Questions about degree content included assessment of: (1) the usefulness of its content to administrators; (2) the necessity of an administrative internship as part of the doctoral program; and (3) the importance of 10 typical courses (budget and finance, college teaching, community and junior colleges, college curriculum, evaluation, history of higher education, law, organization  and governance, state and federal policy-making, student development). Respondents were also asked to rank a higher education doctorate in comparison with a doctorate in an academic discipline as the qualifying credential for three administrative positions: student affairs or institutional management; academic affairs administration; and institutional presidency. Results show the programs' training is frequently perceived as useful both by those with higher education doctorates and those with doctorates in academic disciplines. However, a higher education doctorate is not required for most administrative positions and may not be viewed as the best credential for certain positions. Includes 17 references. (MSE)",

A survey of 8,130 faculty members teaching in 5 major institutional categories was conducted between November 1987, and January 1988; of this total 3,972 replied, for a response rate of 48.9 percent. Analysis of results indicated that the transmission of facts, principles, and  theories were the major instructional goals. Slightly less important was the demonstration of intellectual, artistic, or scientific process. The faculty also agreed that they alone should determine course content and pace. The assumptions about undergraduate students were positive: the students were seen as being able to think on their own, hardworking, and well-motivated. Differences of opinion usually split across institutional lines, with faculty at research and doctoral institutions less interested than faculty in comprehensive and community colleges in emphasizing non-intellectual instructional goals such as developing or improving the students' social and economic conditions, or engaging in formal modes of individualized instruction.

        "description":"An interpretive analysis is presented based on a comparative case study of the relationships between college and university faculty and their presidents in 32 institutions of higher education. Data were collected through interviews during campus visits in 1986-87. The study divided the institutions into six different groups, and looked for patterns of similarities and differences in these groups. Additionally, the study was designed so that half were new presidents (appointed between 1984 and 1986) and half were experienced presidents (appointed between 1965 and 1981). Data collected from the study showed that 75% of the newly appointed presidents, and only 25% of the presidents with longer terms of office, enjoyed strong faculty support. When recently appointed presidents were  compared with those who were in office longer, it was shown that failed presidents were those who most frequently lost faculty support early in their tenures, while exemplary presidents retained faculty support throughout their terms in office. In the case of some presidents, described as Modal Presidents, faculty support gradually eroded over time. It was hypothesized that approximately half of all presidents are of the modal type, one quarter are failed presidents, and one quarter are exemplary presidents. Contains 31 references. (GLR)",

Analysis was done according to the paradigm schema of Burrell and Moran (1979) and revealed that the bulk of journal literature was functionalist (that is, that it is based on realist, positivist, determinist, and nomothetic approaches to social science). No examples of the radical humanist paradigm were found, and only a few radical structuralist studies (combination of functionalist  and radical humanist paradigms) appeared. Thirty articles made use of at least one assumption of radical sociology in the form of conflict, domination, contradiction, emancipation, and deprivation, but no assumptions of radical change were present in the journal literature. There was complete lack of research in the interpretive paradigm (basically functionlist but more nominalist, anti-positivist, voluntarist, and idiographic in its approach to social science). The results indicated that higher education knowledge is dominated by the assumptions of objective social science and the sociology of regulation (functionalism). The knowledge base is thus incomplete because of the unwillingness to explore the new world of alternative paradigms. Contains 78 references. (GLR)",

Females generally reported a stronger relationship between their careers and academic majors, which held across a diverse number of  academic major fields. Fine Arts majors reported a high degree of perceived utility for their field, as opposed to alumni majoring in home economics and community service, who rated their field's utility as low. Alumni in social science majors reported low ratings in all three categories, whereas majors in professional areas (computer science, engineering, business, education) had consistently high ratings in all categories.

        "description":"This paper explores the impact of feminist scholarship on the professions of education and business, and looks critically at the assumptions on which the study of professionalism has been based. The paper begins with a feminist critique of professionalism, based on characteristics of professions and gender theory. Feminist theory is applied to education, focusing on research, textbooks, curriculum, gender bias, and efforts to empower teachers and students. Feminist critiques of research on teaching and learning are examined, using gender as a theoretical framework through which to critique male-dominated theories, reconceptualize teaching and learning, and restructure the educational system. Feminist scholarship on business is then addressed, and its limitation to the liberal  perspective is noted. Three kinds of critiques are explored: research examining gender as a regulator of individuals' activity according to their biological sex, research on the cult of true womanhood as opposed to the cult of rationality, and research on the changing character of American business. It is concluded that as feminists begin to question the professionalism paradigm and to subject it to gender analysis, models can be built that are more sensitive to women as professionals and that can eliminate the dualisms that categorize women differently from their male colleagues.

Evidence for the study was derived from institutional survey data (142 institutions in 10 states); documents; on-site visits (South Carolina only); observations of interactions and operational procedures; and interviews with state policymakers, higher education officials, and institutional administrators. Analysis indicated the following: (1) strategic planning was evident in South Carolina educational institutions focusing on quality and equity improvement and coping with change; (2) strategies encouraging equity, access, and retention issues are implemented among the faculty and staff; (3) the most effective institutional initiatives  in promoting minority student access and achievement were those using minority counselors and recruiters and those providing minority financial support; and (4) cutbacks in state funding are being acutely felt in equity programs.

        "description":"The study attempted to determine liberal arts college faculty perceptions of their careers and professional needs and specific strategies for enhancing faculty job satisfaction in their roles as teachers, scholars, and members of different disciplinary groups. A total of 9,204 full time faculty at 142 participating colleges, all of them undergraduate institutions with enrollments under 3,000, were surveyed, and 4,271 responded for a response rate of 46%. Of this number 3,922 reported a faculty rank of assistant, associate, or full professor (ranks of lecturer, instructor, emeritus professor, or &quot;other&quot; were not included). Analysis of responses involved placing faculty members into one of four groups depending on their disciplinary identification, i.e., whether the discipline was  considered hard (mathematics, biology, etc.) or soft (music, philosophy, etc.), and whether they were pure or applied disciplines. Analysis indicated that faculty perceptions among all groups regarding the college's prestige and security, as well as the opportunity to be creative, were significant factors in job satisfaction. However, the degree to which each was seen as important to job satisfaction varied, sometimes significantly, between disciplinary groups. The study's results suggested that the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic job characteristics relate significantly to satisfaction, and therefore, an increased awareness of these characteristics and needs can assist members of the professoriate in exerting more control over the design and operation of their work environment.

        "description":"Case studies of two colleges of very different financial status are contrasted to illustrate principles of leadership during both good economic times and difficult times. Visits and interviews at four prospering colleges and four colleges under financial stress were conducted to determine the financial state of each college and the role of leadership in its subjective construction. The goal was to discover what Erickson (1986) refers to as &quot;concrete universals,&quot; arrived at by studying a specific case in great detail and then comparing it with other cases studied in equally great detail; and these universals were embodied in the two pseudonymous institutions, Arcadia College (financially sound) and Industrial College (in financial decline) that are the subjects of this paper. The  first person account of visits to the two colleges are organized around the following leadership aspects: complexity in role--delimiting considerations; self (the college president) in role; defining and attending to financial stress; communicating about finances; thinking about stability and growth; and speculating about the future. The observations and emerging propositions of this paper are organized in terms of: the creation of financial realities; the creation of financial stress; the reduction of financial stress; the merging of complexity and commitment; and communication and learning. Among conclusions are that the faculty may feel financial stress regardless of a college's objective financial state, and that leaders may moderate this stress by crafting their communication,  including their non-verbal communicative acts, with care. The study also notes that a college's financial resources are part of the college's culture. Includes 42 references. (DB)",

Surveys from 327 (NIACC) transfer students were analyzed and 17 hypotheses were tested. The NIACC transfer students showed no significant differences compared to other students in several areas, among them: (1) cumulative semester credit hours; (2) student satisfaction; (3) grade point average upon graduation from a baccalaureate-granting institution; and (4) satisfaction about their preparation for the work place and as individuals,  family members, or citizens. Additionally, it was found that a high percentage of NIACC students persisted to complete a four-year degree, the quantity of semester hours earned at the community college had little or no relation to student outcomes, and the length of community college attendance was not detrimental to selected student outcomes. Considerations for future transfer student research are provided. An appendix details survey results and lists study hypotheses. Contains 10 references. (GLR)",

Studies indicate that while other higher education enrollments were declining, most community/junior colleges were rising, and within that population of students, there was an increasing percentage of minority and non-traditional students. Studies also reveal the average community college student to be a non-traditional student (female) who is 28 years old, comes from a middle to lower socioeconomic background, and attends part-time. The effects of  college on the non-traditional students are similar to the effects on traditional students in that there may be a break from family and local community as well as a tendency to develop an independence of spirit. Also, increased personal tempo, self-esteem, and confidence seem to be more easily attained within a community college environment. Variables such as intelligence, socioeconomic status, size and type of community of residence, size of family, race, and religion, still influence college choice and enrollment plans for all students.

        "description":"This paper presents data from a 1989 survey of 48 state higher education executive officers regarding the use of fiscal enhancement programs as a strategy to influence higher education performance. The paper reports on the purposes and objectives most often funded through specific incentives, and on the key advantages and disadvantages of this budget tool. Guidelines for structuring or evaluating such programs are suggested. It was found that 32 states had established enhancement programs which could be classified as categorical programs, competitive programs, or incentive programs. While overall budget conditions have led to reduced dollars being channeled to campuses through enhancement programs, the number of programs and the degree of commitment on the part of states to use  enhancement funding techniques is increasing. The purposes most often served by incentive programs were economic growth, technology transfer, and applied research. Advantages of the use of enhancement programs are that they make state policy concrete through the mechanism of the budget, are based on performance indicators, reward and encourage meaningful institutional differentiation, and work as change strategies. Among disadvantages are that these programs emphasize short-term goals over long-term planning and distract public attention away from the necessity to adequately fund the base budget. A postscript discusses the formative and summative uses of incentive program results. (16 references) (JDD)",

The study examined conceptual similarities for each theory to explain departure decisions and examined how both theoretical frameworks enhanced the understanding of the processes affecting departure decisions when tested simultaneously on the persistence criterion. A longitudinal research design was used, and the student population was drawn from the fall 1988 entering freshman class of a large southwestern comprehensive urban institution. An initial survey and a follow-up survey yielded 466 useable responses. The Student Attrition Model accounted for 44% of the variance observed in Persistence and for 60.3% of the  variance observed in Intent to Persist. The Student Integration Model accounted for 38% of the variance observed in Persistence and for 36% of the variance observed in Intent to Persist. The Student Integration Model appeared to be more robust when judged in terms of the number of hypotheses validated. While results were largely supportive for both the Student Integration Model and the Student Attrition Model, findings indicated that a considerable amount of overlap between the two theories existed.

This paper presents a research model for understanding the transfer function and transfer performance at the level of the college. The model discusses the community college in terms of its capacity for institutionalizing functions and its overall functional effectiveness in adapting to environmental conditions. The model posits that effective levels of transfer function institutionalization and institutional adaptability relate to high transfer performance. Sixty community colleges will be assessed for the extent to which certain environmental elements influence their transfer performance. The assessment will evaluate such external environmental elements as proximity of senior  institutions and local economic conditions, and such institutional elements as percentage of full-time students and tuition and fees. Second, 6 of the 60 colleges with high and low transfer rates will be compared by the way they have institutionalized the transfer functions through their organizational climates and adaptive capacities. By using an organized approach in intitutional transfer research, investigators will be able to identify critical variables affecting transfer effectiveness and can monitor changes in these variables over time.

Interviews were conducted with seven undergraduate-to-doctoral level teachers who were teaching a particular course for the first time. Detailed findings are presented from one case as an example of the teacher's view of the purpose of the course, the design of student tasks, and the thinking that accompanied the process. Across the seven participants, three themes emerged: (1) task systems were designed to engage students with course content in a  thoughtful way throughout the semester and to allow them to synthesize that course content at the end of the semester; (2) learning through doing emerged as an implied instructional theory; and (3) task design served as a mirror of the way students are expected to think in the discipline. These three themes yielded two major conclusions: (1) academic tasks provide the vehicle for knowledge transformation, so that the course content can be comprehensible to students, and (2) through academic tasks students perform the activities necessary for assimilating and comprehending course material.

The study focused on the activities of lenders that purchase Stafford loans in the secondary market. Ten major loan holders in the three main kinds of secondary markets for student loans were studied: (1) commercial banks (Chase Manhattan Bank and Wachovia Bank and Trust Company); (2) the federally chartered secondary market (the Student Loan Marketing Association); and (3) state-level agencies or institutions in California, Colorado, Indiana, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Virginia as well as the New England  Education Loan Marketing Corporation which serves four states. The study found that annual after-tax rates of return varied considerably during fiscal year 1985-88 among and within the institutions. The Student Loan Marketing Association, the two commercial banks, and the Indiana agency were profitable during each of the 4 years. Profit variations were due primarily to differences in the lenders' financing, servicing, operating, and other costs. The 1986 subsidy reductions had little effect on lenders' revenues.

Among the findings were the following: (1) of all the financial aid supplied to undergraduates, the Federal Government supplied 62%; (2) postsecondary institutions were the second largest suppliers of student financial aid, supplying 21%; (3) among aided undergraduates, a larger proportion of borrowers was found among those in higher than in lower income brackets; (4) 36% of aided undergraduates received Pell  grants in their aid awards, with 5% receiving Pell grants alone; (5) 42% of aided undergraduates received Guaranteed Student Loans, with 11% receiving these loans alone; and (6) students who attended private, for-profit institutions were more likely to be aided than those who attended a private, not-for-profit institutions, who, in turn were more likely to be aided than those who attended public institutions. The report contains 54 tables, 3 figures, 12 references, and a glossary. Four appendixes include detailed tables, technical notes, components of the grants only award and all aid awards by source and type of aid. (JDD)",

The study also tested an explanatory model of institutional effectiveness that considers the effects of finances as well as institutional characteristics, and identifies the structural elements underlying institutional performance on student outcomes (represented by an Educational Progress variable, which is a composite of freshman grade point average, sophomore retention, and graduation rates). Findings showed that consumer price was positively and  significantly correlated with 27 variables representing institutional quality. Higher priced institutions generally performed better with respect to Educational Progress, though 31% of the institutions ran counter to expectations, with some of the lower priced colleges outperforming some of the higher priced colleges, and with some of the higher priced colleges showing poor performance. Certain specific institutional characteristics, especially academic enrichment programs and student activities, may be more effective than others in promoting student educational progress. Other factors, such as the percentage of full-time faculty, were found to hinder student attainment. (154 references.) (JDD)",

        "description":"This report on the professoriate in American higher education explores how the use of faculty time is rewarded and, especially, what activities of the professoriate are most highly prized. Changes in the work of higher education institutions through the years--its movement from teaching to service and then research, are noted, as are conflicts resulting from institutions attempting to achieve competing goals. Concern is raised regarding the emphasis on research and publication for academic advancement. Four general views of scholarship are proposed: discovery, integration, application, and teaching. Institutions are encouraged to stress their unique qualities and strengths, and to reconsider the narrowness of the faculty reward system. The report's seven chapters have the  following titles: &quot;Scholarship over Time&quot;; &quot;Enlarging the Perspective&quot;; &quot;A Mosaic of Talent&quot;; &quot;The Creativity Contract&quot;; &quot;The Campuses: Diversity with Dignity&quot;; &quot;A New Generation of Scholars&quot;; and &quot;Scholarship and Community.&quot; An appendix provides results of a 1989 national survey of faculty which addressed attitudes toward factors facilitating promotion and tenure, personal job satisfaction, and other job characteristics. Also provided in appendixes are chapter by chapter technical notes and a key to the Carnegie Classifications. Approximately 100 references are included. (DB)",

An ideal process for instructional improvement based on these findings is described. Contains 68 references. (DB)",

Such information may then be used in various strategic planning stages including scenario development, institutional mission and goals identification, evaluation of internal institutional strengths and weaknesses, selection of appropriate alternative strategies, and post-planning monitoring and control operations. Environmental scanning also provides professional development by helping to maintain a leadership team's awareness of current research, viewpoints, and trends. Costs and benefits of scanning are discussed, and the relationship between environmental scanning and  strategic planning is described. Scanning activities of three diverse institutions of higher education--a community college (DuPage County Community College, Glen Ellyn, Illinois), a land grant institution (University of Georgia), and a major urban university (University of Akron, Ohio)--are identified.

The survey included 195 recent graduates, 269 existing students, and 207 faculty and professional advisors. The study found that 70.8% of students were satisfied or very satisfied with the academic advising services provided. Students felt, however, that there was little effort from advisors or faculty to get to know them as individuals. Based on research that student-faculty interaction has a stronger relationship to student satisfaction with the college experience than any other student or institutional characteristic, it is concluded that ways to encourage greater personal contact between  faculty and students should be found.

        "description":"The setting for this study was a basic education component of a summer youth program designed to increase chances of high risk adolescents, mostly minorities, whose ages ranged from 14-18, to experience more positive academic and employment outcomes. The instructional program used in both experimental and control classrooms emphasized mastery learning of a selected set of mathematics and reading/language arts objectives. Pretests and posttests based on the objectives were developed using the Academic Instructional Measurement System. Of the four sites used, only one was the experimental site where the mastery learning program was implemented using the microcomputer. Quantitative assessment of the experimental program was provided by comparing the effect sizes of the experimental  group with the effect sizes of the remaining three sites. Observations were made of the instruction given in the experimental classroom as well as one of the other program sites. The results provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of mastery learning techniques with high risk and minority students. Students at each location made sizeable gains in both mathematics and reading/language arts during a fairly short time period. Although the quantitative results did not show the computer setting to be more effective than the non-computer setting, the qualitative analyses of these two settings revealed educational benefits for high risk students in the computer environment that may not be reflected in a measure of academic achievement. These students demonstrated an increased sense of  social integration and bonding, factors that may help to reduce dropout. (16 references) (GL)",

This paper outlines several factors considered to be critical in developing a methodology for conducting design experiments and provides an example of a proposed application of the methodology to the development of a multimedia teaching unit about the seasons which would incorporate the film &quot;The Voyage of the Mimi 2,&quot; associated computer programs, a program for teaching students how to construct tables and graph data, a computer network, and application programs such as word processors and drawing programs. It is  noted that the evaluation of the unit, through its reliance on multiple data collection methods--including pre- and post-tests, structured interviews, classroom observations, teachers' comments, and follow-up studies--would avoid the shortcomings of current design experiments and would help determine the form that a design theory should take. Finally, the initial phases in constructing such a theory--i.e., identifying all relevant independent and dependent variables by which the success or failure of an innovation can be measured and specifying how these variables interact--are discussed. Factors affecting the success of technology in education are presented in two tables. (GL)",

Recent literature is reviewed and critically analyzed using a four-part framework of individual differences and skill acquisition: sociodemographic factors, abilities and motivation, task constraints, and the man-technology interface. Furthermore, a conceptual framework is outlined for assessing training efforts using four dimensions: learning setting, teaching method, duration of skill acquisition and frequency of training, as well as computer ergonomics. The review of existing research indicates that most studies are based on a narrow disciplinary focus, thereby ignoring important intervening variables which might help explain learning outcomes. Several other fundamental concerns  regarding existing research are identified and discussed. This article concludes with projections for the future based on past research and the present research climate. (45 references) (Author)",

        "description":"This report discusses in detail the 1988-89 evaluation study developed by the University of California at Los Angeles Center for Technology Assessment and the Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT) administration for the purpose of determining the impact of the ACOT project on students, teachers, and parents. Both student achievement in writing and student attitudes toward computers were measured, together with teacher attitudes about curricular practices, student's achievement, and occupational stress, and attitudes of parents about the impact of ACOT on their children. Measurement instruments on attitudes were primarily questionnaires. A norm-referenced achievement test in basic skills and educational development was used to establish a basis for comparison, and a study of written  composition was used to rate writing achievement. Results indicate that: (1) there is inconclusive evidence for ACOT contributing to students' achievement at a level beyond that of conventional instruction; (2) the ACOT project neither undermines student interest and motivation, nor enhances affective aspects of their school experience; (3) in spite of the amount of variability among those who responded, it can be determined that ACOT teachers experience considerable personal and professional impact; and (4) response bias among parents limits the ability to infer ACOT effects on parents' views or home activities. Overall satisfaction with the children's progress was reported, and computers appeared to be increasingly integrated with home activities. It is concluded that assessment of ACOT  requires new documentation and evaluation tools capable of measuring the complexities of ACOT effects. (DB)",

        "description":"In response to Congressional direction, a quantitative, analytical review (a meta-analysis) was completed of interactive videodisc instruction applied in Defense training and in the related settings of industrial training and higher education. Over all instructional settings and applications, interactive videodisc instruction was found to improve achievement by about 0.50 standard deviations over less interactive, more conventional approaches to instruction. This improvement is roughly equivalent to increasing the achievement of students at the 50th percentile to that of students currently at the 69th percentile. An improvement of 0.38 standard deviations was observed across 24 studies in military training (roughly an increase from 50th to 65th percentile achievement). An  improvement of 0.69 was observed across 14 studies in higher education (roughly an increase from 50th to 75th percentile achievement). Interactive videodisc instruction was more effective the more the interactive features of the medium were used. It was equally effective for knowledge and performance outcomes. It was less costly than more conventional instruction. Overall, interactive videodisc instruction demonstrated sufficient utility in terms of effectiveness, cost, and acceptance to recommend that it now be routinely considered and used in Defense training and education.

        "description":"Research has shown that multiple-choice questions formed by transforming or paraphrasing a reading passage provide a measure of student comprehension. It is argued that similar transformation and paraphrasing of lesson questions is an appropriate way to form parallel multiple-choice items to be used as a posttest measure of student comprehension. Four parallel items may be derived from a lesson: (1) an item that is neither transformed nor paraphrased, thus testing simple rote memory; (2) an item that is transformed only; (3) an item that is paraphrased only; and (4) a compound item that is both transformed and paraphrased. These four items produce a hierarchy of difficulty from easy (rote) to difficult (compound), depending on the extent to which an item is altered from the  original lesson question. In the three studies cited in this paper, posttest performance for the four types of items followed the hypothesized hierarchy of difficulty, and this is viewed as evidence that many of the cognitive skills underlying comprehension may also be hierarchically related. It is concluded that the formation of test questions from lesson items provides a practical way for designers to utilize multiple-choice items for instruction and also for posttest assessment. (DB)",

Each group was examined in terms of classroom practices and educational objectives, teachers' perceptions of themselves and their students, conceptualizing the relationship between technology and education,  integrating technology into the curriculum, how teachers got involved with technology, facilitating factors, deterring factors, and envisioning future classroom environments. Results indicate that unless teachers are personally ambivalent about computers or have lacked the opportunity to get involved with computer technology, their educational beliefs play an important role in how they choose to appropriate and make use of technologies in their classrooms.

Examination of 19 evaluations reveals that many of them were conducted over brief amounts of time, and that the programs being evaluated were not adequately described. Results on attitude were generally positive, whereas results on achievement were mixed. It is easier to achieve positive data on attitude since many individuals are impressed by the mechanism and characteristics of interactive video equipment. Mixed results on achievement can be attributed to the many possible variations in the wide range of design characteristics for interactive video which  render any kind of general statement about achievement invalid. Formative evaluation continues to be an important need in the design of interactive video. Finally, interactive video allows an individual to select and sequence instruction in a way that is meaningful to him or her. Such learning is usually non-sequential and non-linear, and requires a fundamental change in approach to designing instruction. Information on the 19 individual reviews is summarized in tabular format. (DB)",

        "description":"Based on the findings of a content analysis of representative literature on educational technology, this report examines the trends and issues in the field, beginning in 1988 and continuing into 1989. It is noted that trend analysis, particularly year-to-year analysis which reveals less variability than decade-to-decade analysis, reveals topics of current interest and is more a reflection of the status quo than a prediction of the future. The following trends are identified and discussed: (1) concern for the design and development of instructional products and procedures dominates the professional literature; (2) evaluation is becoming an integral part of the instructional design and development process; (3) there is increasing use of research and development knowledge to solve  current problems of teaching and learning; (4) computers can be found in almost every public school in the United States; (5) interactive video is widely accepted as a research and development product, but not in schools and higher education; (6) distance education has become established as a major vehicle for instruction at all levels of education and training; (7) the definition, conduct, and status of professional education in the field continues to preoccupy practitioners; (8) the impact of technology on individuals in the society at large continues to be considered by educational professionals; (9) the applications of telecommunications used in the society at large are reflected in the schools and in postsecondary institutions; (10) the results of research do not appear to have much  effect on applications and operations of educational technology; and (11) the curriculum support function is an important element of educational technology programs. The report concludes with a discussion of the methodology used to identify the trends; it was written by Glenn LeBlanc. (39 references) (DB)",

        "description":"The successful inclusion of school library media centers in fully articulated networks involves considerable planning and organization for technological change. In this study a preliminary model of the stages of school system participation in library networks was developed with the major activities for each stage identified. The model follows stages from the innovation adoption and diffusion literature, and is constructed from a study of the literature, observation, and informal interviews. The model is composed of four primary aspects: technological support, financial support, human support, and anticipated activities and applications. Within each aspect, anticipated events in each of the three stages of participation in a network were identified. The population for the study  included school systems in one or more of three types of networks: OCLC vendors, state regional multitype networks, and statewide school networks. A random sample of 674 school districts in 17 states with 3,613 school systems was drawn, and a questionnaire based on the preliminary stage model was mailed to district level persons responsible for school media programs, school contact persons for the library network, superintendents, or building school library media specialists. Descriptive statistics were used to provide a profile of the respondents and chi-square and gamma coefficient tests were performed on each event in the questionnaire in relation to the level of involvement reported by the respondent. Significance of the 19 events tested in the model varied when analyzed by the  different variables. This model provides a guide for users to assess their own progress in the adoption of innovations and to plan for the future. Twenty-six tables, 11 figures, the survey instrument, and a 175-item bibliography are provided. (Author/SD)",

        "description":"The theme of the 1990 Texas Reading Club, &quot;The Secret Code is READ,&quot; allows librarians to use a wide variety of topics dealing with mystery, intrigue, and the unexplained in programming, displays, and reading suggestions. Through the Texas Reading Club, students in grades 2-9 meet real-life and fictional detectives, spies, cops, and criminals. They can also investigate detection techniques and the science of crime solving. The flexibility of the program allows teachers to decide what aspects of the theme to use and which to ignore. Librarians are encouraged to involve their school districts, other staff members, and volunteers in planning and promoting the program. They are discouraged from embarrassing children by rating their reading skills, criticizing their taste in books, or  appearing to doubt their honesty about whether they have read their books. This guide provides ideas for activities, crafts, bulletin boards, speakers, and book and film materials related to the theme. An annotated bibliography provides 352 titles on the subjects mentioned in the guide which schools may already own; a 40-item filmography is also provided. The guide also lists commercial suppliers of materials for this program, children's specialty bookstores in Texas, speakers and storytellers, and organizations to contact for additional information.

The concept of a Government-wide Information Inventory/Locator System is explored, and it is suggested that such a system should would serve as an authoritative register of all Federal information collection requests, assist agencies in locating government information, and eliminate duplication of information collection. The system would contain citations and abstracts of publicly available U.S. government information, and the name of the agency or source where the information could be obtained. This study: (1) reviews the  existing policy system regarding FILS; (2) clarifies the objectives and uses for FILS; (3) identifies key stakeholders (i.e., Federal mission agencies, Federal dissemination agencies, Office of Management and Budget Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Congress, public advocacy groups, the library/information science community, the general public, and the private sector); and (4) discusses issues and criteria related to how these systems can meet the needs of the stakeholders. The report assumes that readers are knowledgeable about Federal information policies and information resources management and does not provide a general overview of the existing Federal information policy system.

This background paper identifies key issues that require attention by Congress and by NTIS itself to increase the effectiveness of NTIS in the collection and dissemination of Federal scientific and technical information (STI). It begins by discussing factors that have affected the development and current status of NTIS, including an ambiguous Federal STI policy system; broad (or non-specific) enabling legislation; limited Congressional oversight; staving off privatization; and competitive and collaborative relationships with other agencies. Underlying assumptions of STI use and dissemination are then outlined  and approaches to increasing the usefulness of the technical report literature are discussed. An overview of key policy issues related to the future role of NTIS in the collection and dissemination of Federal STI is presented and these issues are discussed: STI dissemination process; organization of NTIS within the Federal Government; pricing and fiscal management, and internal NTIS concerns. The paper concludes by suggesting options and strategies by which NTIS could improve its operations and its role in linking information services and products to the STI community, including ways in which NTIS could improve its self-sufficiency.

The report discusses likely trends that will affect the effectiveness with which the DLP provides access to Census Bureau services, and describes a range of possible scenarios for the dissemination of Census Bureau data and services that will influence the DLP. A concise descriptive listing of key issues and policy questions that require debate and discussion in the professional community is provided. The report focuses on eight issue areas:  (1) future technologies for exploiting Census Bureau data; (2) the rate of absorption of new technologies by depository libraries; (3) space considerations for storing Census documents over time; (4) use of paper as a preferred medium for the data; (5) use of other media as storage devices; (6) how the structure of the DLP may affect the dissemination of Census data; (7) trends in the usage of Census data; and (8) the feasibility of more research in the patterns of use of the data.

While the programs span the range of grade levels, several of those highlighted are specifically for at-risk preschoolers, dropouts, and adult learners. Overall strategies for making education more relevant, real, and rewarding are outlined, including continuing professional development for teachers and the use of the whole language approach in the curriculum. All of the programs are: (1) small in size and local in scope; (2) individualized to the needs of the school, the individual, and the particular localized population; (3) characterized by caring and attentive staff members who are  highly attuned to the personal needs of students; (4) involve teacher-librarians as an integral part of the whole program; (5) include teachers who have high expectations for the students, and who encourage them to reach these goals; and (6) establish stronger links between the school and the family.

In order to ascertain patterns of interdisciplinary research, including the patterns of demand for bibliographic resources, this study analyzes the input/output factors that are related to the research activities and subsequent publications of the faculty of the School of Communications, Information and Library Studies (SCILS) at Rutgers University (New Jersey). This school was studied because its mission is explicitly interdisciplinary. A list of the SCILS faculty publications was obtained through the University Computing Center, where the records of the annual survey of faculty activities are kept. The input portion of the study  identified the Library of Congress classification numbers of those works that were cited by SCILS faculty who were carrying out research leading to publication. The output portion of the study identified the SCILS faculty publications by their Library of Congress classification numbers. A total of 1,622 titles were analyzed. Analyses of the data indicate that approximately 46% of the intellectual endeavor of the SCILS faculty falls outside of their own disciplinary areas. In addition to being consumers of materials from other fields, the faculty are also producers in those fields. It is imperative that selection librarians understand the fluidity of current research activities and the extent of interdisciplinary demands that are being placed upon research collections.

The use of the REPORT command on DIALOG will illustrate how to  reformat selected data from multiple records retrieved online into easily read columns for post-processing and ultimately a graph of the results. For those DIALOG databases without the REPORT command, the PARSE option on Lotus 1-2-3 will demonstrate how the post-processing of online data output can be converted into a graph. Essentially, the search results will be manipulated to the extent that actual value will be added to the information retrieved online. The article concludes with a selected list of other sources containing the beta coefficient and market share information.

Both these iniatives were part of the school's writing-across-the-curriculum (WAC) efforts which had been launched in fall 1987. Writing Fellows are specially-trained peer tutors who work with all students in courses involved with WAC, which include among others, classes in physics, nursing, music, chemistry, logic, algebra and drafting. This annual report of MCCC's WAC program describes the background to and goals of the program, presents frequency use data for the LAL, and provides results of an evaluative survey of students, faculty and student tutors involved in the program. Survey results include the  following: (1) while MCCC enrollments decreased from fall 1989 to winter 1990, use of the LAL increased dramatically from 2,481 to 2,896 student visits; (2) total tutoring sessions per year at the LAL increased from 609 in 1986 to 1,937 in 1990; (3) in 1990, 84% of students who could arrange conferences with their Writing Fellows felt that the conferences were helpful or very helpful, up from 76% in 1989; (4) 91% of students surveyed in 1990 believed the program was either effective or very effective as compared with 78% in the 1989 survey; (5) all 18 faculty involved in the WAC program wished to continue having Writing Fellows assigned to their courses; and (6) all Writing Fellows who intended to return to MCCC in fall 1991 volunteered to continue their work as Writing Fellows.

        "author":["Richardson, Richard C., Jr."],
        "description":"More than half of entering community college students lack the basic skills required to do college-level academic work. Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians disproportionately rely on community colleges as their point of initial access to higher education, making the issue of preparation inherently tied to factors of race and ethnicity. In some areas, community colleges enroll 40% of all high school graduates, but 80% of the minority graduates. The prevailing community college approach to student preparation issues involves a deficiency model in which remediation is emphasized as the dominant strategy for bringing everyone to minimum standards. Also needed is an achievement model that challenges faculty to design an environment where diversity is valued and individuals are  inspired to build on their strengths to attain maximum potential. The task of implementing achievement models in institutions historically committed to access is, above all, a task of managing culture. While culture management is more time-consuming and difficult than the introduction of technology, it is the only approach through which faculty can be influenced to augment deficiency views and practices. A complicating factor is that the two models will need to coexist in most community colleges for the foreseeable future. Efforts to manage culture will be aided by the opportunity to employ new staff as those faculty who represent founding values and beliefs retire in large numbers over the next decade. A flow-chart model of institutional adaptation to student diversity and a 28-item  bibliography are included. (JMC)",

The program provides educational support services, special classes, and supplemental allowances and grants to such students. Following a review of the founding legislation, a description of the support services and grants provided by CARE, and a discussion of the program target population and eligibility criteria, this report presents the results of an annual study of program participants. Study findings show that among the 2,942 program participants for the 1989-90 school  year: (1) 21% were non-high school graduates; (2) 99% were single mothers; (3) 49% were between 26 and 35 years old; (4) 53% were white; (5) over one-half had received Aid to Families with Dependent Children for 31 months or more, with over 40% having received welfare assistance for more than 3 years; (6) 45% identified transfer as their educational objective, while 38% were seeking associate degrees; (7) 34% were new to the program at the beginning of 1989-90; (8) 11% had completed 70 or more units; and (9) 75% had earned at least a 2.0 cumulative grade point average (GPA) with 31% achieving a 3.0 GPA or better.

        "description":"In 1988, Assembly Bill (AB) 1725 directed the governing boards of the University of California (UC), the California State University (CSU), and the California Community Colleges to jointly develop, maintain, disseminate, and adopt a common core curriculum in general education for the purpose of facilitating student transfer between institutions. In 1986, all three academic senates had already begun work on a common curriculum in response to recommendations from California's legislative Review of the Master Plan for Higher Education. By February 1990, all three senates had approved the curriculum, with implementation scheduled for fall 1991. Completion of this Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) permits a student to transfer from a community college to the  CSU or UC system without taking additional general education (GE) courses to satisfy campus GE requirements. The IGETC calls for a student to complete specified courses in the following subject areas: English/Communications, Mathematics, Arts and Humanities, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Foreign Language. The IGETC agreement does not specify the individual courses to fulfill each of these requirements, nor does it list the procedures to be followed by community colleges in certifying that students have completed the IGETC. This report reviews the relevant AB 1725 legislation, summarizes the general contents of the IGETC courses, and describes the plans for its implementation and dissemination. The full text of the IGETC agreement and the names of the IGETC Committee members are  appended. (JMC)",

To address this issue, the Chancellor's Office staff are examining enrollment projections under varying assumptions about future conditions and running computer simulations to estimate capital outlay needs for the system. This report presents the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges' capital outlay growth plan, developed in response to the board's Basic Agenda calling for plans to accommodate projected enrollment growth as well as three other mandates requiring long-range planning for community colleges. Following a brief overview of the plan, an  introductory section presents plan objectives, external planning requirements, the planning process, and planning assumptions and conditions. Chapter 1 presents enrollment projections, chapter 2 examines capital outlay planning process and criteria, and chapter 3 reviews alternative methods for accommodating growth. Chapter 4 describes each of the 14 proposed new campuses and 23 proposed new centers to be completed by the year 2005. The final chapter discusses capital outlay funding considerations. Appendixes provide tables of selected planning estimates and capital outlay cost estimates, and brief descriptions of individual district planning conditions. Detailed data tables, figures, and maps are included. (PAA)",

        "description":"During spring 1988, an initial survey was conducted among two- and four-year colleges in New York State to identify the primary reading test used for diagnosis and placement. In order to address several questions raised by the study, a follow-up survey of participating two-year colleges was conducted during fall 1989. Of the 28 two-year colleges involved in the initial survey, 20 schools returned the follow-up questionnaires. The purpose of the second survey was to pinpoint the exact reasons for test use, to evaluate instructor satisfaction with the measurement tool, and to identify any trends in the adoption of new measurement tools. The second survey instrument was individualized, identifying each institution's original responses (e.g., cut-off scores, follow-up testing, and  reading course components). Findings of the follow-up survey included the following: (1) educators felt that current standardized tests were not meeting the needs of the individual colleges to assess the abilities of the diverse student populations which are served; (2) there was a general move toward the use of more comprehensive, multiple assessment tests; (3) in-house tests for follow-up assessment remained the most commonly used tool; and (4) reading educators agreed that their major concerns were insufficient time and the lack of administrative and faculty support to deal with students experiencing reading deficiencies. The survey instrument, sample responses, and the names of the specific tests most commonly used are included. (GFW)",

        "description":"At the College of the Canyons in California, the majority of faculty are adjunct instructors, many of whom have had little formal background in teaching. In an effort to support these faculty and to assure the quality of instruction, the Associate Program for Adjunct Instructors was instituted. The program emphasizes the development and evaluation of skills rather than the dissemination of information, and instructors who complete the program become Adjunct Associate Instructors. The program completion involves four steps: (1) obtaining a recommendation from the division chairperson, which usually requires that the adjunct first complete at least one semester of instruction at the college; (2) completing a 24-hour Instructional Skills Workshop (ISW) in which each participant  presents a series of 10-minute videotaped presentations; (3) completing an 8- to 10-hour Advanced Teaching Workshop (ATW), which examines issues such as questioning techniques, critical thinking, and writing across the curriculum; and (4) undergoing a classroom evaluation which involves classroom observation and feedback from colleagues and/or students. Benefits for Associates completing the program include improved teaching skills; the professional status of having completed the ISW and the ATW; and a program stipend and 10% salary increase. Criteria for candidate selection include seniority, the number of times an instructor has applied to the program, a fair representation of disciplines, and comments submitted by division chairs. An application for admission to the program is  appended. (GFW)",

Employer-based education and training is generally contracted in one of six ways: (1) employer-funded credit courses not open to the public and referred to as &quot;closed credit&quot;; (2) average daily attendance (ADA) funded credit courses open to the community at large; (3) certificate or degree programs offered on a closed credit or ADA basis; (4) not-for-credit customized training funded by the employer; (5) special topic or umbrella courses; and (6) non-credit offerings funded at a reduced ADA rate. In a study of  contract education conducted by the San Bernardino Community College District, 107 California community colleges were contacted to gather information regarding the age of the program, number of contracts, enrollment, kinds of offerings, faculty participation and compensation, collective bargaining, advantages, and disadvantages. Responses from 89 colleges (84%) revealed that the majority of the programs were less than 5 years old, served less than 15 businesses, enrolled less than 300 students, and were staffed by full-time faculty. Cited benefits for the colleges included enhanced faculty and curriculum development and increased income, while the benefits for business included cost effective and convenient quality education and training.

        "description":"Cuyahoga Community College (CCC) and Kent State University's (KSU) current partnership for educational progress has evolved over nearly two decades of continuous communication and political obstacles. The foundation for the partnership was established in the early 1970's, in spite of community college criticisms of the inadequacy of higher education programs for training two-year college personnel and university criticisms of the open door policies of two-year colleges. In the eyes of the two-year college administration, universities over-emphasized specialized knowledge and research skills, and failed to prepare graduates to address matters of teaching competencies and learner understanding, issues critical to junior college educators. In January 1974, a career and personal  development workshop, based on a human potential model in use at CCC's east campus, was organized jointly by KSU and CCC faculty. While efforts to develop a doctoral program at KSU to address the skills required of community college educators failed, a community college specialist was added to the KSU faculty in 1979, and informal relations between the institutions continued. Aided and supported by interested KSU and CCC faculty and administrators, 12 CCC faculty members did enroll in doctoral programs at KSU. A High Schools for the Future project developed and jointly administered by KSU and CCC senior faculty led the CCC east campus provost to propose a joint staff development program for CCC faculty. A formal plan was presented to the KSU Regents Advisory Committee on Graduate Studies  and was subsequently approved in 1987. The successes of these and additional collaborative efforts has created a solid working partnership between the two institutions. (GFW)",

        "description":"Studies suggest that developmental students like peer tutoring, are more relaxed with peers, and feel that peer tutoring helps their grades. However, the small number of studies on college tutoring provides no consistent evidence that underprepared students who are tutored improve either their grades or grade point averages. The students who do earn higher grades after tutoring tend to be better prepared to begin with, have higher ability and/or more experience in college--there is no consistent evidence that tutoring helps the weakest students. Research does suggest, however, that underprepared students who were tutored remained in college longer than comparable students who were not tutored. Experts also agree about what constitutes a successful program; at a minimum, tutors  are recommended by a faculty member, carefully screened, trained how to work with underprepared students before they start tutoring, and evaluated regularly by their coordinators, instructors, and their students. The dearth of research on tutoring may result from a lack of research skills among tutor coordinators; a lack of money, time and resources; the difficulty in comparing results from various kinds of tutoring; or other causes. However, as college tutoring programs adopt standards and better programs, researchers should examine the questions of whether, how, and to what extent tutoring can help underprepared students.

        "description":"In an effort to clarify some of the problems educators have in understanding children's play behavior, a half-hour-long episode of two 4-year-old girls playing with newsprint, paints, and brushes at an easel is described. The episode showed how ephemeral yet recognizable play can be. The idea of countours is used to describe play behavior in its interactive entirety. In the 30-minute period, the two girls explored the play environment, prepared and explored materials, engaged in representational play, and became involved in dramatic play and a game with rules. They then returned to exploration and representational depiction. One would expect the easel to be used for symbolic representation and exploration with paint; however, the easel also served as the location for many types  of play. The children moved quickly and fluently in and out of different types of play. Interruptions and conflicts did not fragment the playing; they simply contributed to a different shape for the play. Although educators should discern when children are solitary or cooperative, exploring or representing, pretending or not pretending, categorization alone is not sufficient. The existence of fluid transformations that can be seen over the course of play sequence suggest the challenge to teachers that play can provide, as well as the potential of play for learning and development.

Findings indicate that tests used for special education identification have only a slightly better than chance prediction rate. More reliable predictors of school success are the race and educational status of the mother, the gender of the child, and the socioeconomic background of mother and child. The studies indicate that no test instruments can predict at-risk learners at an early age better than chance. Observations of children's abilities to follow direction, attend to tasks, visually and sequentially organize tasks, and systematically approach tasks may  be the best indicators of early school success and failure.

Three frameworks for interpreting the influence of nature and nurture on individual development assign biological and environmental factors a direct role in shaping the individual. An alternative framework models a view of the cultural mediation of biological inheritance and universal features of the environment. This framework is discussed in terms of two forms of &quot;structuration processes&quot; that characterize human development: context and modularity. Context is thought of as a cultural source in the &quot;structuration&quot; of behavior, while modularity indexes a model of the structure of mind  which posits domain-specific modules loosely linked by a &quot;central processor.&quot; Interposed between modules and processor is a level of organization thought to be roughly equivalent to cultural context, which selectively recruits different kinds of modular inputs depending on culturally accumulated constraints. This picture of the interaction of context and modularity is elaborated in a discussion of the temporal relations between the two forms of structuration in the contexts of the microtime of individual development and the macrotime of evolutionary history.

        "description":"In six brief chapters, mixed-age grouping of young children in schools and child care centers is explored and advocated. Chapter 1 defines mixed-age grouping, examines limitations of single-age grouping, and points out positive characteristics of mixed-age classes. Chapter 2 discusses social development as seen in children's interactions in mixed-age groups. Various studies are cited that focus on how children perceive one another and adapt their behavior and expectations accordingly, how children exhibit specific prosocial behaviors in mixed-age situations, and how children's group participation varies. Chapter 3 reviews studies on the cognitive effects of mixed-age grouping, concluding that psychologists and educators do not yet fully understand how mixed-age interaction  affects cognitive development, and calling for more research on the interactive processes involved and the teacher's role in them. Chapter 4 discusses two strategies for mixed-age learning: peer tutoring and cooperative learning. Chapter 5 describes examples of successful implementation of mixed-age programs, including a 2-year kindergarten at the University of Northern Iowa's Malcolm Price Laboratory School, and the Fajans School in Sweden where elementary school-age children were not grouped by age or ability. Chapter 6 addresses four basic questions about implementing mixed-age grouping. A brief section giving conclusions and recommendations is provided, followed by 63 bibliographic citations and appended suggestions for teachers working with mixed-age groups. (RH)",

        "description":"This ERIC Digest discusses three ways in which teachers can create an environment that stimulates critical inquiry: critical reading; writing to learn; and classification games. Critical reading has been defined as learning to evaluate, draw inferences, and arrive at conclusions based on the evidence. Elbow's (1983) writing to learn approach to first- and second-order thinking is based on a two-step writing process involving freewriting that helps students discover what they think about a topic. In this approach, students use reflection to help them logically develop and control a topic. Classification tasks are integral to vocabulary-concept development and the inquiry approach to science. Classification tasks require that students identify attributes and sort into categories  according to some rule. These tasks are important for the retention of information in memory. Instead of relying on special courses and texts, every teacher should employ methods such as these to create an atmosphere where students are encouraged to read deeply, question, engage in divergent thinking, look for relationships among ideas, and grapple with real life issues.

In particular, temporal stability, concurrent validity, and boundary conditions (age and gender differences) of sociometric nominations were investigated. Teacher ratings of social skills and children's observed emotions also were examined as predictors of sociometric nominations. With a mean age of 46 months, the 63 subjects were younger than those in most similar investigations. Findings demonstrated good cross-time and cross-method stability. Gender, but not age, appeared to be a moderator of nominations. Teacher ratings and the  extraction of fairly stable, coherent peer status groups confirm the validity of using peer nomination measures with preschoolers. It is concluded that sociometric nominations can be used to assess younger preschoolers' social skills and social deficits. Thirty-three references and 5 tables are attached. (Author/RH)",

These chapters focus on the ways in which infants and toddlers develop and consolidate a sense of self, preschoolers test and evaluate the self, and kindergartners and primary school students set new standards for the self. Part II covers implications of the knowledge base for practitioners. The text concerns ways in which adults can promote  self-esteem in children, care for infants and toddlers, guide preschoolers, and teach kindergartners and primary school students in ways that promote the development of self-esteem.

The report also compares farm statistics from 1880 to 1982, noting a steady decrease in the percentage of U.S. population living on farms. The report offers information about minorities and women who operate farms in America, showing a general decrease in the number of farms operated by minorities from 1978 to 1982. The number of farms operated by women, however, showed a 7% increase. Eighty-nine percent of U.S. farms are family held. Small and large farms increased from 1978 to 1982 while the number of medium-sized farms (of 50 to 1,999 acres) decreased. \"Part-Time  Farmers\" offers statistics about part-time farming in the United States. The report provides a statistical view of U.S. part-time farmers, the size of their acreage and product sales. There are numbers showing livestock inventories and the kinds of crops harvested by part-time farmers. The booklet also compares full- and part-time farms according to acreage, value of agricultural sales, value of equipment, and value of land and buildings. There is also a breakdown of the amounts of part-time acreage and sales according to U.S. region. Each booklet is brief and contains large print, pictures, graphs, and graphics. (TES)",

        "description":"The property tax base in Vermont's towns are overburdened as property taxes are usually the only funding method available to finance schools, police departments, highway work, recreation programs, and government in general. Attempting to offer their citizens a balanced program of services without exorbitant taxes, local officials are striving to increase the tax base by enticing developers to locate within their town boundaries. While officials may be considering the tax consequences of new development, some Vermonters are complaining of inappropriate land use decisions, which they attribute to the quest for increased tax bases. Each town's situation is different, and the impact of a development on the tax rate depends on many factors including the type of development, the  capacity of the existing municipal and educational infrastructure, the services necessitated by the development, the services desired by the voters, and the role of state aid to education. Designed for estimation and planning in small towns, this workbook was prepared to help public officials and citizens in Vermont to project the direct costs and revenues associated with proposed developments in their towns and to estimate the effect on the property tax rate. The workbook contains step-by-step explanations, detailed tables of data, and worksheets to estimate changes in capital and operating costs and changes in the tax rate. A list of useful references and groups that can help is included, and other information sources are cited on data tables. (ALL)",

The yearbook contains nine chapters contributed by different administrators and practitioners. The first six chapters deal with specific areas of instruction: art, health, language arts, social studies,  natural sciences, and music. The final three chapters examine: (1) the local community and environment as sources of instructional materials, (2) individualized instructional practices, and (3) the educational program and school activities as sources of student \"socialization\"--preparation for citizenship in a democracy and for the realities of a more urbanized environment.

        "author":["Gale, Nancy"],
        "description":"This brief booklet, based on interviews with Gay Munsell, a Native American child development specialist, with the National Resource Center for Youth Services at the University of Oklahoma, examines the difficulties experienced by Indian youth in confronting the problems and changes of adolescence. In urban areas, 80% of Indian youth drop out of school, compared with 50% of reservation Indian students. Up to 25% of Indian youth display symptoms of psychological problems, and many Indian youngsters live in environments with a high rate of alcoholism and other drug abuse; in fact, Indian youth use alcohol at a rate three times that of adolescents in the general population. Adolescence is a time of change, when a child's mind becomes capable of abstract thinking. As their concepts  of time mature, young people begin to see themselves as individuals and are confronted with the need to define their relationship with the future. Adolescence implies six primary tasks: (1) learning to think abstractly; (2) learning to distinguish between the real and the ideal; (3) deciding how one relates to the past and future; (4) developing independence; (5) defining individualism; and (6) determining how, as an individual, to fit into and function in the world beyond family and community. Aside from these normal adolescent tasks, Indian youth must also struggle with their cultural roles and identities. Negative coping patterns, such as reliance on drugs and alcohol, often develop. The booklet suggests strategies to make adolescent transitions smoother, including: (1) strengthening a  youth's sense of being a valued member of the family; (2) raising youth's self-esteem; and (3) helping youth strengthen relationships with significant adults. The document encourages adults to establish relationships with Indian adolescents based on patience and trust. (TES)",

Based on personal interviews with 358 New York rural residents 60 years of age and over, this paper examines the relationships of political behavior and attitudes to personality differences in extraversion, openness, neuroticism, and locus of control. Controlling for age, sex, group consciousness, and education, Pearson coefficients revealed that personality factors had an independent effect on the political behavior and attitudes of the samples. Internal locus of control, extraversion, and openness were positively correlated with political efficacy, interest, and participation, and negatively correlated with  political distrust, while neuroticism had high negative correlations with political efficacy and interest. Path analyses showed personality also had an indirect effect via civic orientations and, perhaps, education. This report contains 26 references. (Author/SV)",

A number of separate but complementary attitudes are creating a circle of support in the fight against alcohol abuse. These new attitudes hold that: (1) Native Americans are not condemned by their race to a destiny of alcohol-related problems, but, rather, have a choice; (2) abstinence is an acceptable option; (3) the non-drinker need not be isolated and lonely; (4) the community is responsible for addressing alcoholism and drug abuse and must act to offer alternative activities; and (5) success is possible. Among the new concepts about alcoholism that have emerged in the past decade are the ideas that alcoholism: (1) is a family and community disease; (2) affects multiple generations; (3) is the tip of an iceberg,  riding atop a mass of other problems; and (4) often coexists with other specific problems such as depression and cultural shame. In the fight against alcohol abuse, American Indians have some special cultural attributes that can help them, including extended family networks, close-knit communities with strong identities, and holistic world views. Native Americans are headed in the right direction and must use their resources to maintain the movement against alcohol and drug abuse. (SV)",

        "description":"This report examines parent-involvement programs that focus on Hispanic families and the methods that have been used to evaluate these programs. The survey involved 10 Hispanic parent-involvement programs named by various state education agency directors as being significant. Particular attention was given to whether or not the programs were formally evaluated. The programs, located in Texas, New Mexico, Washington, and Florida, were diverse in client populations, although each served a significant number of Hispanics. The study indicated a total of 29 different parent-involvement activities reported by the 10 programs. Of these, the most often used were parent workshops or courses, parent-teacher conferences, and parent advisory councils. The least prevalent activities included  providing incentive grants to develop parent involvement activities locally, parent-teacher conference improvement courses, and parent resource centers. The most prevalent ways that districts evaluated their parent-involvement programs were: (1) parent opinion surveys; (2) monitoring the frequency of activities; and (3) monitoring parent attendance at events and activities. Three school districts conducted formal evaluations, five conducted informal evaluations, and two reported no evaluations. The document concludes with a discussion of program evaluation procedures and the need for documentation of program activities. It suggests that an important key in narrowing the educational gap between majority and minority groups lies in the development of effective parent-involvement programs.

The paper provides two case studies from Ethiopia which demonstrate how proper implementation of community development processes and principles might lead to successful attainment of tangible and intangible development goals. During the past two decades, there has been growing doubt about the efficacy of community development. The criticism is often based on the notion that community development is designed to produce only tangible results or material progress. Intangible objectives might include social and psychological development, human resource development, or institutional development. Certain key elements or principles of community development  are described and it is noted that if these are observed, they will make successful implementation of a development program more attainable. The formation of a community development association and the development of a small cooperative store and weaving industry are described. These two cases, both from Ethiopia, are offered to demonstrate community development's potential for the third world. (TES)",

        "author":["Harrison, Gordon S."],
        "description":"This paper is an informal assessment of Alaska state spending during the lucrative &quot;oil years&quot; of the early 1980s. The huge Prudhoe Bay oil field began producing in 1977 and reached a daily output of about 1.5 million barrels in 1980. From 1980 to 1986, the field helped Alaska's government to have, in relation to its population, a revenue income that vastly exceeded that of any other state. During those years, the state spent more than $26 billion, most of it from oil revenues. A previous study found that several programs received disproportionately more state money than others. Prominent among these were the following: municipalities receiving grants for operating expenses, capital improvements, and school construction; public corporations; and state-subsidized loan funds, such  as the state student-loan program. The following are significant successes of the state's financial management during the early 1980s: (1) establishment of the Permanent Fund, a public financial trust established to save part of Alaska's oil revenues; (2) evidence of concern for distributional equity, benefitting all geographical, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups; (3) support for public education, with educational expenditures exceeding one-third of the state's operating budgets; and (4) a lack of major corruption. The failures of fiscal management, however, include excessive spending, state budgeting performed in secret, and an indifference to accountability. The document includes a table showing state expenditures for education and other programs from 1981 to 1986. It concludes with a  call to reform the budget process. (TES)",

        "description":"This report describes two programs in Saginaw, Michigan, that are designed to meet the special education needs of bilingual and migrant students. The focus of the report is a product evaluation using the results of students' test performance. The Section 41 State Bilingual Education Program and the Chapter 1 Migrant Education Program operated at 21 elementary schools, 4 junior high schools, and 2 high schools. The state bilingual program served approximately 709 students during the 1989-90 school year with reading instruction, instruction in other basic skills, and counseling services. The migrant program, largely in cooperation with the bilingual program, served 775 K-12 students. The California Achievement Tests (CAT) served as evaluation instruments for these students. The  attainment of the performance standard by program, subject, and grade is presented. Mean posttest Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE) scores showed improvement over pretest NCE scores. K-12 students were pre- and post-tested to determine their achievement in reading and mathematics, as required by the funding sources. The CAT evaluation also looked specifically at fulfillment of the elementary-level reading comprehension objectives. Test results indicate a bilingual-program increase in the percentage of grade levels meeting reading and mathematics performance standards over the previous year. The migrant results show a decrease from the previous year in reading and an increase in math. The following program improvements are recommended: (1) reduced variations among building sites; (2) better  program monitoring; (3) lower student-to-staff ratios; (4) improved consistency in the secondary-level advisor program; and (5) more parent-related activities. The document includes 5 appendices and 17 tables, most of which are found in the appendixes. (TES)",

        "description":"This digest presents recent findings about effective instructional practices for classroom teachers in small schools. In terms of instruction, small schools have two characteristics: a broader scope of teacher responsibilities and more instructional levels per classroom. Teachers in small schools have the opportunity to develop the student as a learner and to include collaborative learning experiences. Learning is the combined result of many variables; some are under the teacher's control and have strong effects on students' behavior, attitude, and achievement. These teacher-controlled variables include: (1) high expectations; (2) management and planning skills; (3) learning-oriented classrooms; (4) success rate; (5) appropriate learning activities; (6) engaged time; and (7)  effective questioning. The typical small school classroom tends to have students with a broad range of age, knowledge, and experience, and students who attend small schools often approach each other for help and learn by teaching each other. Collaborative learning can provide a way to capitalize both on students' variety and their cooperative spirit. Collaborative learning may be used to: (1) focus on multiple ways to solve problems; (2) involve students in goal setting and self-monitoring; (3) produce positive effects through peer interaction, cooperation, and communication; and (4) organize groups to incorporate contributions of each student. Supporters of the collaborative classroom value heterogeneous student grouping; others hold the view that homogeneous grouping for instruction is  sometimes necessary.

        "description":"In the 1980s, the falling incomes and climbing poverty rates characterizing young workers in rural America were closely linked to rapidly changing national and international economic systems. Findings of a recent Senate Budget Committee study indicate that between 1979 and 1987 the share of young workers (ages 16-34) with low-wage jobs increased nationally by 4.7%. Further analysis of the committee data reported in this document shows that the share of young rural workers having low-wage jobs increased by 11% in those years compared to 4% for young urban workers. The mean earnings of young rural workers fell by 13% compared to an increase of 1% for young workers in urban areas. The decline in wages for young rural workers was pervasive, although men, blacks, and part-time workers  experienced a bigger decline in wages than did women, whites, or full-time workers. Wages of young rural workers in every sector declined, but those in extractive industries, manufacturing, and trade experienced the biggest decrease in earnings in every region except New England. The wage decrease for young workers is related to the rise of the poverty rate for young rural families (those headed by persons ages 18 to 29) from 19% in 1979 to 32% in 1986. The rise of poverty for young rural families along with the shifting economic fortunes of male and female workers in rural America are likely to have ramifications for marriage and family. This report, which bears on the issue of school to work transition in rural areas, contains statistical tables and 28 references. (ALL)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to identify characteristics of at-risk students and review certain circumstances that affect their decisions to leave or stay in school. Mail survey responses were collected from 272 students (out of a total of 300) in 15 rural Tennessee high schools. The subjects were identified by their guidance counselors as being at risk of dropping out. At-risk students frequently have been shown to be older males, often from low socioeconomic backgrounds, who possess low basic academic skills. The mother's educational background and her aspirations for her children's educational attainment strongly influence their decisions regarding school. A majority of at-risk students live with their mothers in a single-parent home. More than 70% said their birth parents  were divorced. Some 47% stated they had jobs. More than half preferred a job to staying in school. Eighty-six percent revealed that they consume alcohol on an average of four times a week and 73% used other drugs regularly. Almost half of the students had experienced some problems in school, and more than 33% had appeared in juvenile court before age 15. More than half had experienced physical abuse. Most did not involve themselves in extra-school activities and 61% said they did not believe that a high school education was important. Effective dropout prevention programs use a combination of mentorships, counseling, remediation, social services, and other incentives to keep students in school. Early identification and personalized intervention programs are essential to disrupting the  cycle that leaves many students dysfunctional in today's complex society. (TES)",

        "description":"Developing countries in Asia and the Pacific are undergoing a critical period in rural development. As part of a plan for integrated rural development, education has shifted its priorities to equalizing access to educational opportunities and improving quality of instruction. Representatives from Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Thailand held a Study Group Meeting aimed at identifying causes of educational underdevelopment in rural areas and related issues. The group attributed the educational underdevelopment of the rural areas to the following major causes: (1) poverty combined with cultural, social, religious, and political factors affecting education in different geographical conditions; (2) transportation and communication factors; (3)  population explosion; (4) language difficulties; (5) inadequate emphasis on rural development in educational policy, planning, and management; (6) inadequate provision of educational services due to disparities in educational opportunities and inefficient or inadequate physical facilities and materials; (7) irrelevance of the curriculum to the rural environment and needs; (8) low quality of teaching due to low professional competence, experience, incentives, and motivation, lack of teacher support services, lack of materials; and (9) lack of parental or community support. The report describes the participating countries' experiences in rural educational development, and also includes a review of the participating countries' innovative approaches to providing education in rural areas, an  analysis of selected innovative approaches, a proposed regional plan of action, and recommendations for the improvement of education in rural areas.

The guidebook emphasizes the need for active administrative leadership and strong teacher involvement in planning and implementing partnership activities. The book is divided into nine chapters and provides both general information and specific examples relating to instructional approaches, recruiting and working with partners, and ways of assessing and supporting partnership programs. Chapter 1 discusses the need for science partnerships and encourages planning that puts partnership activities within a larger context of goals for general science-instruction improvement. Chapter 2 discusses  elements of effective science instruction, teacher training, and the use of &quot;hands-on&quot; science education. The chapter also encourages educators to use local resources and to integrate science content into other curriculum areas. Examples of potential partnerships are offered. Chapter 3 is a guide for involving teachers in improvement efforts. Various steps of the planning process are detailed. Chapter 4 offers strategies for establishing science partnerships, including tips for identifying and contacting potential partners, clarifying partnership goals, and establishing good working relationships. Chapter 5 describes partnership concerns, including liability and safety issues, scientific ethics, and disabled students' needs. Chapter 6 describes ways of involving parents. Chapter 7 deals  with program assessment and evaluation. Chapter 8 is a guide to fundraising. Chapter 9 offers more general suggestions for those embarking on partnership efforts.

This study is a first effort to explore multicultural reform in rural schools. Multicultural education is the process by which the school environment is modified to accommodate cultural differences as well as to teach the role culture plays in shaping people's view of society. The Rural Clearinghouse for Education and Development commissioned five separate case studies of selected rural schools in Alaska, Arizona, New Mexico, Nebraska, and Washington. At each site, school administrators, teachers, students, parents, and community members were interviewed and documentation on multicultural education was collected. The centerpiece of this document consists of the  five case study reports, each by a separate writer, with the analyses focused on some or all of the following elements: (1) school mission; (2) staffing; (3) curriculum; (4) instructional strategies; (5) policies and norms; (6) home linkages; (7) community linkages; (8) staff development; (9) extracurricular activities; (10) assessment and testing; (11) multicultural leadership; and (12) student characteristics.

        "description":"The deterioration of industries in rural America in the 1980s has placed rural youth in a difficult situation. Those who remain in rural areas face a scarcity of good jobs, while those who leave face competition for employment against better-educated metropolitan youth. A study was conducted to: (1) examine the educational experiences of both metro and nonmetro youth by their senior year in 1980; (2) analyze what had happened to these same seniors six years later in terms of education, income, and occupational status; and (3) determine the impact of migration on the senior class of 1980. Using the data file of the High School and Beyond survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, the study determined that metropolitan youth had several advantages over nonmetropolitan  youth by their senior year in high school. The 1980 data show that metro seniors were more likely to (1) have well-educated parents; (2) have taken a curriculum that better prepared them for college; and (3) score higher on tests of cognitive skills. Follow-up data from 1986 show that metro seniors tended to: (1) continue formal education; (2) have higher incomes and earnings; and (3) be more likely to work in white-collar jobs than nonmetro seniors. The difference in occupational status was evident at nearly all levels of education. Rural youth have diminished opportunities which have often made a successful transition to adulthood more difficult. Data tables are included in the appendix. (ALL)",

        "description":"In Iowa, shared superintendency originated in the 1980s as a response to the agricultural recession of the 1980s which had tightened Iowa's public school finance. Iowa lost 80,000 people through out-migration and about 10,000 fewer births occurred, while the school student population decreased by 181,670 during this same period. While nearly every school district in the state has been touched by these declines, rural areas and smaller schools have tended to lose the greatest percentages of population. To continue to provide high quality educational programs, Iowa schools have initiated changes. Encouraged by state legislative financial incentives, many school districts are currently sharing grades, teaching staff, and administrators. By the 1989-90 school year, the number of  districts sharing their principal administrator increased to 102. This paper reports on a study examining the effects of sharing of superintendents by school districts. The basic design of the research was a qualitative study using a structured interview format. The information centered on these areas: (1) the financial motives; (2) the challenges of sharing a superintendent; and (3) lessons learned from the experience. Thirty-one percent of the 83 respondents indicated that there was no advantage associated with sharing superintendents; 69% identified such advantages as cooperative purchasing and coordinating curriculum. Every respondent identified at least three weaknesses associated with the shared position. The most commonly identified weakness was the amount of time it took to manage  both districts.

An examination of economic trends, demographics, and philosophical changes regarding rural education's purpose puts educational changes into context. Increasing diversity in various areas of rural life tends to complicate educational planning and policy-making. The data suggest that there is no single future for rural America and its schools, but many different futures. Consolidation advocates argue that bigger schools mean better programs, but the evidence does not support contentions that educational quality is a function of size. Greater efficiency can be  achieved by reducing costs or by raising output and its quality. False efficiencies are achieved by cutting costs and reducing quality. The challenge for rural schools is to offer not just standardization, but positive learning environments, as evidenced by a wide array of indicators. While measuring efficiency is difficult, successful small schools have taken steps such as establishing low pupil/teacher ratios, offering strong core curricula, hiring competent generalist teachers, and using local resources. Redesigned schools would be different from existing models in all respects, including governance, administration, mission, staff, curriculum, scheduling, and organization. The document describes experimental redesign programs in different parts of the country. Its recommendations  include: (1) financing that is sensitive to local peculiarities; (2) incentive grants for local pilot initiatives; (3) appropriate instruction for school staff; and (4) encouragement for collaborative projects.

Banking legislation and regulation changes have aimed to strengthen the industry and to provide consumers with more services and more choices among providers. Ownership of many banks is changing hands as holding companies acquire additional banks both within and beyond their home states. Most banks that disappear become branches of other banks, so that financial services within most communities are maintained. By incorporating branch offices and by identifying holding company to the services and lending experience associated with large banks. A growing number of rural counties are served by a  combination of local and urban-based banking firms. These communities may receive the benefits of wider services from large banks and greater local knowledge available from locally owned community banks. On the other hand, some analysts fear that rural communities will be stripped of locally owned banks and left to the whims of large banking firms. This report examines the structure of rural bank markets including sources of rural credit, individual state patterns of bank branching, and holding company characteristics. It attempts to determine how rural bank structure has changed during the 1980s and discusses bank failures and mergers, the growth of holding companies and interstate banking activities, and probable scenarios for the future of the rural banking system.

        "description":"Enrollment levels of high schools are positively related to the number of courses offered. The most common way to expand educational opportunities in communities served by small high schools is to increase enrollment, usually by means of consolidation. Size, however, is not always the predictor of course offerings, as some relatively small schools offer numbers of courses that rival the number offered by considerably larger schools. This study was designed to analyze the effects on course offerings of factors other than school size. The analysis is based on the data of the High School and Beyond Survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education. The strategy of the inquiry was to explain the variation in curricular offerings after the effects of school size were statistically  removed. None of the predictor variables (community characteristics, spending level, flexibility in the internal allocation of resources, the external labor market conditions, the press for achievement, and the presence of a collegial decision making structure) were found to make a substantive difference in explaining the variation of course offerings. The data tables point out inequalities in the educational opportunities being provided for high school students. In addition, the analysis illustrates how inadequate school or school district consolidation is likely to be for broadening educational opportunities at the secondary level. Table of regression coefficients are included. (ALL)",

        "description":"Recent studies portray African education in a state of stress. Since it is widely believed that education is critical to development, proposals for addressing this crisis have been numerous and frequent. A knowledge base of research studies has to be created to advise the external agencies that support education in Africa. Many studies were, however, incomplete and non-scholarly. The resulting reports were not widely circulated, as they carried access restrictions imposed by the sponsoring agency. This paper attempts to provide an overview of education sector studies in Africa. It contains an introduction to over 100 studies submitted through August, 1989; a review of the major themes; and an analytical commentary on what is and what is not contained in the studies. The emerging  consensus from these studies about what is wrong with African education and how it ought to be restructured is discussed. Four themes appear in most of the studies: (1) the curriculum does not match the job market; (2) a larger share of the cost of education should be paid by the students and their parents; (3) the authority and responsibility for schools should be decentralized to improve local responsiveness and efficiency and to decrease corruption; and (4) internal and external efficiency are useful standards for evaluating educational policies, programs, and expenditures in all countries. The appendix contains a listing of the studies by country with UNESCO Database numbers. (ALL)",

        "description":"The economic decline of rural America has widespread consequences for families, children, and education. Broad changes in farming and in the rural nonfarm sector have pushed the poverty rate for rural areas in the 1980s higher than the central cities rate. Projections indicate that by the mid-1990s, one-half of all farm families in the midwest may become financially insolvent. Prompted by a decline in economic and living standards, the young and educated leave, schools and service establishments close, and social pathology increases. This study focuses on families under economic pressure in an agriculturally dependent county in Iowa. Relatively affluent before the downturn, these families had much to lose in a troubled economy. The sample includes 76 two-parent families with a  seventh-grade child and at least one other sibling. Approximately half of the parents grew up on a farm, but only 12% define themselves as farmers. Four out of five of the families are in the middle class. Based on self-report and observational data, this study examined ways in which families were adapting to scarcity and the psychosocial consequences of such adaptation for couples and their children. Findings indicate: (1) that adverse income change has effects on hardship adaptations that match those of income level and far exceed the influence of unstable work; (2) that hardship adaptations mediated the negative effects of deprivation on emotional health and family relationships; and (3) that father's negativity represents a stronger link between hardship and child behavior than  mother's negativity. The document includes data tables, illustrative figures, and 48 references. (ALL)",

The study was conducted during the first 6 months of 1990, and data were collected from interviews with 921 homeless adults in 21 randomly selected rural counties in Ohio. The sample counties represent 26% of the rural county population in the state. The study was designed to replicate prior research conducted in 1984, thus providing a comparison of the nature and extent of change in the problem of rural homelessness in Ohio over the span of six years. The primary instrument in this study was the Homeless Person Survey that was used in the 1984 study. Findings indicate significant growth in the number of rural homeless persons, as well as some  basic changes in their demographic characteristics. The estimated number of homeless in rural Ohio based on the collected sample was 14,462 with the number possibly going as high as 19,616, or 3.4 per thousand. The conclusions drawn from the study include: (1) homelessness is an increasingly pressing rural social problem; (2) rural homeless persons are younger, more likely to be women or mothers with children, more educated and less disabled than their urban counterparts; and (3) patterns of homelessness in rural areas are diverse. Eleven data tables are included, several of which compare variables with the 1984 study. (ALL)",

The general goal of the survey was to collect information on distinctive features of migrant education programs at the national, state, and local levels. The survey identified past programs that in the views of the respondents were useful or have met unique needs of the migrant population. Three general questions were asked in each interview: (1) What innovative approaches or noteworthy changes have been made in migrant education to enable people to meet the needs of this student population? (2) What noteworthy programs at the national level (interstate  programs) that meet unique educational needs of students can you identify? and (3) What noteworthy programs in states that meet unique needs of students can you identify? This report presents the survey outcomes in five categories: (1) Family Characteristics; (2) Student Characteristics; (3) Administrative Modifications; (4) Information Exchange; and (5) Program Characteristics. Additionally, a summary is provided of respondent's comments regarding major pluses of the program, major unique features, and perceived needs and concerns, along with a list of noteworthy programs.

Preconceptions also provide a reference point about which students may reflect as new meanings are acquired. This paper describes one aspect of an ongoing project involving preservice teachers and methods instructors at three Canadian universities over 2 years. The overall purpose of the study is to collect and analyze data relating to the conceptions held by preservice secondary science teachers about the nature of science, of teaching, and of learning. Data were collected in the form of three-phase questionnaires, interviews, and videotapes of class  interactions. An interpretation of these data has been used in the development and piloting of some strategies aimed at promoting meaningful preservice instruction. Data described in this paper were derived from responses to one particular item on the questionnaire administered at the start of the 1-year teacher education program at the University of British Columbia (Canada). Preservice students were asked to provide metaphors for the teaching/learning process. Samples of the students' metaphorical statements are provided. (CW)",

Skin resistance (GSR) was measured by a biosensor attached to a microcomputer and served as the dependent variable. Analysis of the data included a 2x2x8 ANOVA of gender v. ability v. GSR. The significant three-way interaction indicates that low-ability girls had the lowest GSR measures and inferentially that they were the least attentive to the videotape. High ability boys and girls, and low ability boys produced equal GSR measures. These results suggest that a low cost GSR biosensor may be useful to science education researchers with an additional measure of attention or arousal. (Author/CW)",

The NSF/PIES project was sponsored by the Five College/Public School Partnership--a school/college collaborative initiated in 1984 to share resources and strengthen communication between the 43 school systems in the 4 western Massachusetts counties and members of the higher education consortium, Five Colleges, Inc. (Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges, and the  University of Massachusetts at Amherst). The Administrator's report presents the various aspects of the program in chronological order: (1) staffing; (2) participants; (3) spring pre-institute workshops; (4) institute; (5) academic year follow-up; and (6) continuation. Each section includes a brief description followed by suggestions to other administrators starting similar projects. The Evaluator's report is divided into two sections. The first is a summary report which looks at NSF/PIES as a successful staff development project and analyzes the reasons for its success. The second is a series of presentations and discussions for each major data source used in the process. Appended are all of the questionnaire and interview protocols, the criteria used by the people who made the classroom  observations for the project, and a full chronology of project events. (KR)",

        "description":"Mathematical word problems are notoriously difficult to solve for students at all grade levels. Performance deficiencies have been attributed to students lacking abstract logico-mathematical knowledge or to insufficiently developed language comprehension skills. At least four general sources of difficulty can be distinguished in mathematical word problems: (1) the verbal formulation of the problem text; (2) the structure of the underlying episodic problem situation; (3) the conceptual logico-mathematical or arithmetical knowledge about set relations; and (4) the arithmetic problem solving skills that are required to perform counting operations or to resolve equations. This paper describes a process model Situation-Problem-Solver (SPS) computer program that constructs a problem  representation based on strategies that take into account the specific situational structure as well as its wording. Discussed in this study is the role of two linguistic and of one situational factors on comprehension difficulty of simple mathematical word problems. The linguistic form factors that were manipulated concerned the narrative focus of the problem episode and the problem question. The results of this experiment indicate the script factor to be a dominant source of comprehension difficulty. (KR)",

This background material was developed for a program in which a Japanese kite maker conducts kite making and flying classes in the Japan School District Elementary Schools of the Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS), Pacific Region. The two principles critical to understanding why kites fly are an understanding of Newton's Law and Bernoulli's Principle. While other factors such as the friction between the air particles moving over the flying surface and the material comprising the flying surface are important, these two factors explain the major components of lift and therefore the major reasons kites fly.

        "description":"In the early 1980's a number of reports on the status of science and mathematics education were published, making evident declining science and mathematics achievement, dropping enrollment, and a shortage of qualified teachers. In April 1983 the National Commission on Excellence in Education presented its report to President Reagan. The report, entitled \"A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform,\" compared the quality of teaching and learning in schools and colleges in the United States with those of other advanced nations. The report became the focus of nationwide media attention. This sparked renewed federal involvement in science and mathematics education, school/industry coalitions were set up, and a call for help was issued to all interested parties. Concerned  with the scientific literacy of their employees and their future employees, business and industry offered assistance in a number of ways.

        "description":"One of the most common misconceptions about probability is the belief that successive outcomes of a random process are not independent. This belief has been dubbed the \"gambler's fallacy\". The belief that non-normative expectations such as the gambler's fallacy are widely held has inspired probability and statistics instruction that attempts to counter such beliefs. This study presents an investigation of student performance pre and post instruction on problems dealing with these kinds of statistical misconceptions. Instruction consisted of 10 laboratory sessions, 1.5 hours each, delivered to 16 high school students attending a summer mathematics program at Mount Holyoke College (Massachusetts). The instruction included computer simulations that were intended to provide students  with sufficient data to refute expectations based on the representativeness heuristic, as well as other misconceptions about chance. Student performance suggests that a belief in representativeness may not be as widespread as thought, and that curriculum development aimed at countering this belief should proceed cautiously. In addition, student who apparently do not have a well-developed understanding of independence in random sampling may nevertheless answer such problems correctly based on reasoning that is fundamentally non-probabilistic. Thus, many items currently being used to assess conceptual development may be insensitive to certain misconceptions about probability. Student misconceptions about probability need to be better understood if more appropirate mathematics instruction is  to be achieved. (KR)",

This trend is toward using research on how learners grow and develop prior to program development and the organization of instructional techniques. Clear scientific explanations of how students learn will be of great practical value in assisting teachers to more directly work with and promote students' learning activities. Therefore, in order to define concept/process-based science education, this paper begins by summarizing the relevant research trends. The research, which leads to a definition of concept/process-based science, has been summarized in five main areas which include: (1) the instructional methods teachers  use; (2) the curriculum that is identified as important to student growth; (3) the learning activities in which students are asked to participate; (4) the evaluation of student growth; and (5) placing science in a broader, interdisciplinary context which relates it to societal values. Each section discusses the problem, the trend, and the implication for science education. The paper concludes with a definition of Oregon's concept/process-based science. (KR)",

The 977 students who served as subjects were randomly selected from approximately 20,000 Trinidadian students who wrote the 11+ examination in March 1989. They were spread among 9 denominational and 6 government schools, were equivalent to the U.S. grade 6, and had taken 7 years of elementary schooling. Overall, the results indicate that numerous factors appear to influence the achievement of elementary school students. Since many negative factors appear to be correlated  with home background, it was recommended that this should be the starting point of intervention. (CW)",

        "description":"This report analyzes the overall mathematics achievement and its potential relationship to instructional activities. National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assessed the mathematics achievement in seven content areas, five of which were administered at all three grade levels included in the assessment. This report focuses on the five content areas common to all grade levels and attempts to answer three questions: (1) Are there differences in mathematics achievement on any of the common content area subscales across levels of exposure to traditional instructional activities? (2) Are there differences in mathematics achievement on any of the common content area subscales across levels of computer use? and (3) Are there differences in mathematics achievement of any of the  common content area subscales across levels of mathematics course taking? In addition to addressing the three major questions, the report presents comparisons between racial-ethnic group, gender, and type of school attended in an attempt to determine whether the differences in mathematics achievement typically found on these variables change when the levels of instructional activity, computer use, and mathematics course taking are held constant. The analyses in this study used achievement and background data from version 2.0 of the Public Use Data Tape for the 1985-1986 NAEP. This report includes the methodology and analysis, results, and conclusions. Several insights into potential relationships between mathematics-related instructional activities and student achievement are highlighted  including the following: (1) daily exposure to some traditional instructional activity does appear to be associated with higher levels of mathematics achievement in specific content areas; (2) when the number of math courses an examinee reported having taken was held constant, non-Hispanic Whites still tended to have significantly higher achievement scores than Blacks and Hispanics; and (3) no gender difference in achievement was found at the third-grade level. Technical notes, detailed methodology, and the NAEP data in tabular form are appended. (KR)",

        "description":"South Africa is in a state of transition. In viewing the struggle between apartheid's defenders and its opponents, social scientists can make the valuable contribution of projecting alternative scenarios of change as it relates to the way in which state institutions intersect with society. This paper is part of a larger study of South Africa that examined the relationship between state policy and social science influences and contending theories of political change and control. Contemporary themes in South African politics are briefly outlined, and the importance of newly introduced political and administrative structures is emphasized. It is a major thesis of the paper that the impact of these new structures, supported by social science theory, may both contribute to the  dismantling of apartheid and define the developmental strategies adopted by a majority rule government. The paper suggests that there have been four separate social science ideologies that have defined the policy debate in South Africa since 1948: (1) modernization theory; (2) dependency theory; (3) corporatism; and (4) the concept of internal colonialism as exemplified by South Africa's &quot;homelands&quot; system. Each of these is discussed with a particular focus on how the specific theory has been used to promote and attack racially based political structures and public policy in South Africa. (DB)",

        "description":"An approach to the assessment of classroom thoughtfulness is presented. The approach recognizes the importance of in-depth knowledge, intellectual skills, and dispositions; it also emphasizes general qualities of discourse such as teachers posing higher order challenges and students giving reasons. The approach is contrasted with those that attempt to prescribe highly specific instructional procedures for teaching discrete thinking skills or specific bodies of content. The classroom observation scheme was used to assess levels of thoughtfulness in 39 diverse 9th grade social studies classes in 7 midwest high schools during the academic year 1988-1989. At the end of the year, students read two pages of background information on a constitutional issue and completed a written  exercise asking them to state and to defend their position. Although teachers had not prepared students for such an exercise, the persuasiveness of student reasoning on the constitutional issues was strongly associated with the level of classroom thoughtfulness to which students were exposed, even after controlling for student scores on a pre-test of social studies knowledge, a pre-test of writing, student grade point average, race, sex, parents' education, and the racial and ability composition of the class. The design did not allow demonstration of a clear causal effect, but the evidence is consistent with the conclusion that general qualities of classroom discourse over a wide range of subjects affect student performance in higher order thinking.

It is proposed that subject matter knowledge creates two major problems for teachers. First, it results in an explosion of the curricular landscape, for if teachers know subject matter well, the curricular territory expands. This expansion includes a blurring of the boundaries between different school subjects. Second, subject matter knowledge is a necessary but not sufficient condition for creating powerful instructional representations. Teachers, therefore, need pedagogical content knowledge as well as knowledge of their subject matters. (Author/DB)",

Now it is even more important as technological change and new methods of production transform the world economy. Development will depend more and more on knowledge-intensive industries, agriculture, and services. The continuing economic crisis, however, is jeopardizing the ability of many countries to maintain even the present quality of their educational services. These countries are falling behind in providing the education and training needed by their youth to create and adapt available knowledge and technologies to the local environment. This report examines the relationship between education and economic development and evaluates various measures designed to improve the quality of education  in developing countries. It draws on the successes and failures of past educational policies to recommend strategies that address a number of different economic conditions. Among the topics addressed by the report are: (1) the effect of education on the achievements of women; (2) a comparison of the benefits of vocational/technical and academic education; (3) the effect of education on mortality, nutrition, and fertility; (4) management of the educational system; and (5) cost recovery and private education.

The results of the review show that most of the texts are very good; some are judged to be excellent. Despite the positive general conclusions, a number of serious concerns are put forth concerning the group of texts. It is pointed out, for example, that too great a use of \"readability\" formulas that emphasize using commonly recognized words and short sentences result in poor writing quality; that efforts to reduce attention to violence and conflict in some history textbooks risk a bloodless  narrative; and that the treatment of religion as a force in U.S. history continues to receive short shrift.

        "description":"In many countries in Africa today formal education is in a state of crisis. While curricular reform continues to serve as an ongoing source of public policy debate, African leaders are confronting increasing difficulty in allotting educational resources to meet present and future levels of demand. The paralysis that has been unfolding is one characterized basically by education's rising claim on public sector resources against a backdrop of widespread poor economic growth, mounting international debt, and rapidly growing populations whose demand for education cannot be met readily by traditional means. This paper seeks to explore the options available to respond to Africa's growing educational demand, how the options can be managed, and what role the options can play in promoting  accelerated economic growth and development. Three basic policy options for education are proposed: (1) maintaining existing programs and institutions and allocating relatively static levels of educational resources; (2) increasing the allocation of resources to education based on an expansion of existing institutions and programs; and (3) structural reform. These basic educational policy options are examined by first looking at Africa's institutional experience, and then through the use of an educational forecasting model. Numerous figures and tables of statistical, economic and educational data appear throughout this report. An extensive bibliography also is included. (DB)",

The 16 locally developed lists and the criteria which comprise them were examined and compared on the basis of: (1) a conceptual framework derived from categories used in the Tennessee Career Ladder Program; and (2) types of criteria used in research on teaching. The criteria content were then assessed through a survey of a random sample of Maine teachers; the analysis of the survey provided information about the content and nature  of criteria which are most likely to be accepted or rejected by a broad cross section of Maine teachers. The final analysis explores the congruence between the criteria preferences of local committees and the criteria preferences of Maine teachers.

        "description":"Research findings on effective teaching are being used to identify potential \"master teachers.\" This paper discusses six problem areas with respect to using research results in this manner. The first problem area is the question of whether the concept of \"master\" is necessarily implied by the concept of \"effectiveness.\" In effect, does knowledge of effective teaching practices provide a logical basis for making judgments regarding teaching mastery? A second problem is the matter of inferring unequivocally that teachers are causing higher or lower student achievement by their observed teaching behaviors and classroom processes. A third problem area pertains to the kind of student growth that researchers tend to investigate. Achievement measures employed in research on teaching  often emphasize only the cognitive domain while overlooking the affective domain. A fourth question pertains to the generalizability of research confined to students of only one grade or level. A fifth problem area concerns the frequent assumption that relationships between teaching practice and student achievement are linear. The final problem area is that using the results of research on teaching for identifying master teachers is incongruous with the purpose of this research. (29 references) (JD)",

The relationships among principal, mentor, and beginning teacher were explored. Near the beginning and the end of their first year of working in the BTIP, 84 principals (70%) completed instruments that collected their expectations/experiences, attitudes, and views of BTIP. Analysis of the data from the questionnaires suggested that intern-mentor programs have mostly positive impacts on beginning teachers. Principals confirmed that student  teaching was important to beginning teachers and teacher preparation programs should provide courses that can help beginning teachers learn how to manage class discipline and motivate students. Principals reported that beginning teachers adjusted more readily to teaching responsibility than the principals had expected, and that teachers and mentors readily discussed areas of concern with less embarrassment or breaches of confidentiality than principals had expected.

Major sources of data were the interactions among participant teachers as observed during various times of the school day, observations of these teachers in their classrooms while teaching, and interviews. The findings revealed that classroom practices such as curriculum planning, delivery of instruction, evaluation of student performance, and behavior management were influenced by the collaborative nature of teacher interactions with one another. These findings were congruent with the theory base for the study  that teachers' attitudes, cognitions, and beliefs are socially constructed and maintained through daily organizational life. Implications based on this analysis are offered for middle school organization, the implementation of teaming as school innovation, and teacher preparation programs. (Author)",

        "description":"This booklet was written to help teachers plan their own research. It concentrates on how to translate an issue of general concern to a teacher or group of teachers into a worthwhile and feasible piece of research. The booklet is divided into four sections: section 1 deals with the purpose of doing research. It stresses that research questions can be developed if it is clearly understood why the research is needed. Section 2 contains an example of the different kinds of purposes and, therefore, the different kinds of research questions a researcher might have. The topic of primary-secondary transition is used as the example. Section 3 suggests a straightforward procedure which teachers can use to develop their own research questions out of the professional concern they would like  to research. The concluding section offers a form which teachers can use to formulate their own research questions. This section includes an example of how the form might be filled in for the primary-secondary transition research discussed in section 2. Three figures explain the procedures in outline form. (JD)",

        "description":"This study investigated the current policies and programs in selected teacher-training colleges and universities to determine if listening skills are being taught. In addition, language arts professors' attitudes toward the teaching of listening skills were surveyed. Opportunities provided for preservice teachers to observe, demonstrate, and practice listening skills were also identified. The subjects of the study were 99 responding professors who were from 125 colleges or universities chosen by random selection. The research inquiry was divided into two categories: questions pertaining to practices, both institutional and personal, and statements pertaining to attitudes, as measured by policy statements on current practices compared to desired practices. Results indicated that  listening is being taught in 89 percent of the responding institutions, and that 95.8 percent of the respondents offered this listening instruction in the teacher training department. In language arts departments, listening received less attention than the other language skills; however, preservice teachers (91.7 percent) reported that they had opportunities to acquire listening knowledge. Generally, the responders did not believe that listening should be taught as a separate course, but that preservice teachers should be taught methods in the techniques of listening. The survey questionnaire is appended and 31 references are included. (JD)",

The GAO's first report is based on its national survey of school districts and their policies on reaching young people who stay in school and on training teachers in AIDS instruction. The GAO found that more Federal leadership is needed to improve the HIV curriculum and to train teachers about students' knowledge, behavior, and beliefs. The second report concerns the slow progress made by Federal, State, and local governments in reaching the small but critical percentage of youth who are  not in school. This group includes the runaways, the homeless, the incarcerated, the migrants, and street youth who may be involved in a variety of high-risk behaviors.

Part 1, the District Survey, was sent to designated health education contacts or the superintendent in all of Colorado's 176 school districts. The purpose of this part of the survey was to obtain information about school districts' policies, curriculum, health-related programs, health education funding, and community involvement. Part 2, the Teacher Survey, was sent to 1,000 teachers statewide to learn about classroom instruction and resources. Data  from the survey are displayed on charts and graphs, and the two surveys are appended.

The subjects were all students who had entered the teacher preparation program at Bowling Green State University (Ohio) in 1985 and completed their student teaching experience by spring 1988 (N=152). It was found that the prospective teachers expressed less anxiety about teaching and more confidence about their decision to  teach after their training than they had expressed at the beginning of their training, a finding to be expected from teacher development theory, and that teacher candidates maintained a highly positive attitude about teaching during training. The instruments used for the study were the Attitude toward Teaching as a Career Scale, the Teaching Anxiety Scale, a confidence about teaching scale constructed by the researchers, Rotter's Internal-External Locus of Control, the Myers-Briggs Personal Preference Type Indicator, the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, and a demographic data sheet requesting gender, academic major, and anticipated grade level of instruction.

None of the principals thought that the internship was the specific reason an individual was hired; the personality of the individual was cited by some of the principals as being more important than the type of preparation program completed. Personality included attitude, ability to teach, flexibility, and maturity. The internship was seen as an advantage only if all other attributes of the candidates were equal. However, being in the school for  a full year was seen as a strength. According to principals, interns were as well prepared as or better prepared than student teachers. While the internship year was viewed as being extremely valuable, there was some concern that the additional year and increased financial demands would discourage students from entering the program.

The results indicated: (1) that both elementary and secondary education majors had high levels of conformity, social awareness, self-sufficiency, and self-discipline; and (2) that elementary and secondary education majors were significantly different on emotional stability, assertiveness, imagination, and self-sufficiency factors.

The distinguishing characteristics of the model are that it is a flexible, site-initiated program for undergraduate students and that it works in close cooperation with school districts. Internships are provided both for in-place district personnel and the university's resident undergraduate students. Factors to be considered in arranging appropriate sites include: the  teaching situation; availability of mentors; orientation procedures; supervision; on-site training; and contract terms. Program benefits to interns, school districts, and state departments of education are discussed. (JD)",

A synthesis of studies from related literature indicate that there are numerous ways to approach the assessment of student teacher attitudes and that socialization into teaching is affected by a number of variables. During the fall semester of l989, items were selected for the instrument. The basis for the selection of the specific items was derived from the courses included in the teacher preparation program designed to meet the requirements of the Mississippi Educational Reform Act of 1982. A total of 38 items were included in the final survey. The survey  was administered to 136 students at the end of their student teaching in the spring semester, 1990; an analysis of the results demonstrated the instrument's reliability. Future studies are planned to utilize it in a variety of ways. A table displays data on the frequency and percent of responses for the inventory. (JD)",

Data were obtained from 120 Mississippi secondary school teachers. Two instruments were used: the Maslach Burnout Inventory Form Ed (MBI) and the Supervisory Behavior Description Questionnaire, Form One (SBDQ). Significant differences were found for the Depersonalization subscale of the MBI and both Directive and Collaborative dimensions for the Evaluation of Instruction on the SBDQ. Teachers reported both high and moderate levels of Depersonalization with Collaborative behaviors and lower levels with Directive supervisory behaviors. The conclusion was that teachers preferred the principal to  evaluate with Directive behaviors. Teachers indicated more depersonalization and, therefore, less satisfaction when required to collaborate. (JD)",

        "description":"In recent years, the number of traditional preservice teachers (18- to 21-year-old age range) has decreased, while the number of older, nontraditional students has increased. At the time of student teaching, nontraditional students seem to have more problems than do more traditional students. This study developed and field tested an instrument, the \"Perceptions for Student Teaching Instrument\" (PSTI), designed to ascertain students' feelings of preparedness for student teaching and to compare the attitudes of various types of students. Seven public and three private institutions in Tennessee participated in the study by administering the PSTI to all student teachers at the beginning of their spring semester (1990). The results of the study, based on 629 returned and usable  surveys, indicated that, although the instrument did not detect differences between groups of students, it added another dimension to the evaluation of teacher education programs. Tables provide information on subjects by category; percent response, mean, and standard deviation for each statement on the PSTI; and means, standard deviations, and t-test for total score for traditional and nontraditional students, for males and females, and for public and private institutions.

Instructional planning can be and often is taught to teacher candidates as a generic skill, yet in practice it must necessarily occur in the context of a subject. The paper describes four examples of lessons teacher candidates received in instructional planning. Two of these occurred in the context of a curriculum. The first portrayed instructional planning as a matter of choosing instructional goals. The second portrayed instructional planning as a matter of arranging required subject matter into the available calendar spaces. The other two examples were removed from any curriculum context. The first of  these focused on a well-organized sequence for instruction, with the focus on packaging and presenting each day's subject matter. The second portrayed instructional planning as a process that existed independent of subject matter. A discussion is presented on the implications of such lessons for subject matter content. (JD)",

These practices, once established on a large scale, became both counterproductive and resistant to change. A reform agenda is suggested, establishing and encouraging alternatives. These include: (1) parental choice of elementary/secondary schools; (2) alternative paths to certification for prospective teachers; (3) alternatives to the mechanical criteria commonly used to select textbooks; (4) alternatives to the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) such as the National Assessment of  Educational Progress; (5) inservice opportunities for teachers to study their subjects; (6) paths to recognition and reward for college faculty that emphasize teaching as well as research; and (7) well-informed choices for college selection for students and parents. The value of cultural and educational programs--\"the parallel school\" offered by museums, libraries, the theater, and exemplary television presentations--is discussed. (140 endnotes) (JD)",

Each of the four Myers-Briggs dichotomous personality preferences, Rotter's external-internal locus of control classifications, anticipated grade level of instruction, level of basic academic skills, and  gender were all found to be related to changes in the prospective teachers' concerns about teaching during teacher training.

A central feature of this emerging world has been the development of the lead teacher--a person who continues to teach while at the same time accepting greater responsibility for assisting colleagues and the success of the overall school program. The exact function of teacher leaders is specific to individual districts, but in every case the teacher is required to assume a new relationship both with the school administration and with colleagues. The Southeastern Teacher Leadership Center (STLC) functions to help teachers as they assume their new roles as leaders. The center's philosophy, organizational  structure, and program activities are described. The Leadership Seminar, offered at the beginning and end of the summer, with follow-up activities throughout the year, is central to the STLC's activities. This seminar has three main components: assessment, seminar workshops, and follow-up activities. The themes of the 4-day seminar and of the fifth and sixth days of follow-up sessions are outlined.

In discussion on the first issue, it is pointed out that with the influx of minority students, matching students and teachers by demographic characteristics cannot realistically be achieved. However, since teachers are also role models for students, recruitment of minority teachers must be actively pursued. On the issue of raising the intellectual calibre of teachers, it is noted that the current standardized testing of prospective teachers needs to be re-examined, and further exploration of alternative routes to  certification should be considered. Regarding the improvement of classroom practice, two proposals are considered: developing sound and effective induction programs, and encouraging the growth of professional development schools.

Delphi methodology was used to classify TPK items according to findings in a selected review of research. Six professors in teacher education completed a questionnaire to rate seven literature reviews. The three most highly related were presented to the Delphi panelists--three public school administrators and six college teachers from various areas of teacher education. In Phase 2, two panels of six experienced classroom teachers each considered half of the 104 TPK items in light of the selected review. Of the 104 TPK items, 20 were classified as supported by research; only 9 of the 20 were judged to require knowledge of that research. It is  suggested that the TPK may be missing opportunities to measure important aspects of teachers' professional knowledge. Alternate strategies for measuring knowledge of teaching effectiveness research are considered for the planned successor to the NTE. Four tables contain study data.

        "description":"Using a segment of one program from a series of videotaped staff development programs as a data base, this paper investigates the nature of the relationship involved in peer coaching. The segment is a model interview between two teachers who are engaged in a peer coaching program. The series, Coaching for Improved Teaching, promotes the idea that teachers can be partners in the coaching process, which includes observing each other, taking notes on observed lessons, and providing feedback through peer conferences. Two methodologies are employed in the paper: a conversation analysis of the interview focused on the qualitative aspects of the discourse at the detail level, and a quantitative examination using the sequential analysis techniques developed by B. C. Wampold (1984) in  conjunction with the coding system developed by R. Penman (1980). This analysis examines structural and pragmatic patterns of behavior and control characteristics in the conversational dyad. The conversation analysis is based on three types of evidence: recipient design, observer overlap, and absence of commonality in the discourse. Results indicate a relatively equal but competitive relationship, with the observer attempting to gain control of the interview while the teacher attempts to maintain independence. It appears that coaches need to develop a subtle repertoire of conferencing styles. Training for coaching should address affective as well as cognitive aspects. Eight tables and five figures are included. (TJH)",

The first study focused on the skill of an otherwise normal subject who increased his digit-span to over 100 digits with 4.5 years of practice using the mnemonic system developed by W. G. Chase and K. A. Ericsson. The second study followed two college undergraduates who became mental calculation experts by practicing for 3 to 4 years with strategies used by previously studied experts. The studies relied on the tenets of skilled memory theory. Observations of subjects' learning and performance suggest that acquired knowledge, rather than exceptional native talents or general aptitudes, constitutes the foundation of expertise, and that the knowledge structures and processing that support  expertise can be analyzed. Theoretical analyses reveal that rapid and reliable storage and retrieval of information in long-term memory (LTM) appears to be a key characteristic of experts' information processing. Acquired memory skills enable experts to use LTM in order to reduce the constraints that a limited working memory capacity imposes on performance in complex tasks. The studies also document the effects of efficient information-processing strategies on cognitive skill acquisition and expert performance. The report distribution list is appended.

These papers demonstrate that it is possible to base qualitative interpretation on quantitative measurement. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 show that meaningful measurement is possible in the classroom.

        "description":"An overview of educational reforms during the 1980s (1978-88) and their effects is presented for use by policy makers, practitioners, and interested citizens. The first section of this report, called &quot;The Reforms of the 1980s&quot;, is based largely on a 50-state survey and a research report, both commissioned by the Educational Testing Service Policy Information Center. The second and third sections of this report, &quot;Progress toward Excellence&quot; and &quot;Progress toward Equality,&quot; draw heavily on statistics and assessments carried out or funded by the National Center of Education Statistics. The &quot;education reform decade&quot; is most identified with state-level reform laws and policy changes that were initiated and carried out by governors and state legislatures. The decade is associated with  what came to be called the &quot;excellence movement&quot;, a shorthand reference to the reforms called for in the 1983 report of the National Commission on Excellence in Education entitled &quot;A Nation at Risk.&quot; Since a great deal of state action was well under way by that time, particularly in testing, the reform decade is dated from 1978 for the purposes of this review. The following reform policy topics are addressed: high school graduation requirements; student testing; accountability; teacher standards; student and school district standards; and policy changes at the school level. Data on educational improvement are reviewed in the areas of reading, mathematics, science, civics, writing, student retention, and student effort. Topics associated with equal education include achievement gaps in  reading, mathematics, and science as well as gaps in student retention and gender differences. Thirty-five figures are included.

        "description":"The Mathematics Assessment Questionnaire was designed to sample thoughts and feelings of students in grades 7 through 9 in relation to solving mathematical word problems. Test development studies began in 1986-87 with a review of research and literature and the writing of sample statements that were evaluated by 16 experienced teachers and educators. In the 1987-88 academic year, a series of small-scale studies addressed issues related to: (1) metacognitive statements; (2) self-regulatory statements; (3) affective belief; (4) motivation; (5) attribution statements; and (6) usefulness to teachers. In a 1988 pilot study, the revised statements were administered in three forms to 1,557 students in grades 7, 8, and 9 in New York City. The item pool was subsequently revised to retain  a model of the domain structure that included both settings and psychological constructs. Analyses were conducted on data for 1,368 respondents. The revised questionnaire was administered in the fall of 1988 to 2,658 students in grades 7, 8, and 9 in New York City public schools. Results from 2,451 students were examined through factor and discriminant analyses to provide information about students' item responses and test reliability. Forty tables and two figures provide data from the development studies. A 30-item list of references is included. The 161-item source questionnaire; the responses for the fall 1988 sample; and statement numbers, scale response numbers for indicators, and interpretation of diagnostic indicators for affective belief, motivation, and attribution categories are  appended.

Procedures for eliminating item bias and maximizing the validity and reliability of such measures are discussed and illustrated through actual data collected in the attempt to develop such an instrument. The model of M. Thomas (1989) was used to guide the development of the ethical evaluation instrument by the following steps: (1) generate a pool of ethical and moral concerns; (2) select knowledgeable judges; (3) have judges identify the moral and ethical issues from the list compiled; and (4) establish a hierarchy of issues. A list of 52 potential concerns was prepared and rated by 52 college  business faculty members and 61 business practitioners in the community. Top issues for both cohorts were identified; and a high degree of consistency was found between the two groups, providing a set of items for an eventual student instrument. The data collection and analysis procedures demonstrated the viability of the framework for construction of a student test. Two tables and one figure contain study data. An appendix lists the 52 ethical issues. (SLD)",

        "description":"Some pre-instructional misconceptions held by children can persist through scientific instruction and resist changes. Identifying these misconceptions would be beneficial for science instruction. In this preliminary study, scores on a 60-item true-false test of knowledge and misconceptions about earthquakes were compared with previous interview results to determine whether or not both methods yield the same conclusions. An Earthquake Information Test (EIT), was administered to 194 students in grades 4 through 6 in Salt Lake City (Utah) and Buffalo (New York). Subjects included: 19 fourth graders from an urban public school in Buffalo; and 175 fourth, fifth, and sixth graders from an urban public school in Salt Lake City. The EIT contained scientifically correct statements  interspersed with misconceptions previously expressed by students in individual interviews. The EIT was administered after most students had received some instruction about earthquakes. Students from Buffalo and a random sample from Salt Lake City were also individually interviewed. Internal consistency was calculated, and an item analysis was performed. Students could correctly choose scientifically acceptable answers while simultaneously choosing answers not compatible with science. The EIT was least reliable for grade 4 students. While a refined version of the EIT could provide useful information about student misconceptions, individual interviews should continue as a source of test questions and information about children's misconceptions. Five tables provide study data. A 25-item  list of references is included. (SLD)",

The three methods were used to forecast school enrollments for kindergarten through grade 12 in a rural Tennessee school district. The cohort survival method is based on the calculation of a series of proportions that indicate the fraction of students in one grade in a given year who pass to the next grade; the ratios are averaged across 5 years to obtain the grade progression ratio. The SAS method is a statistical procedure based on extrapolation, and it fits and forecasts a univariate time series. The simple method uses the ratio of  the 2 previous years' enrollments for each grade level; this ratio multiplied by the most recent year gives an estimate of expected enrollment for the following year. All three methods are based on the established consistency of the various ratios and variables. Study data included the number of live births and grade level enrollment figures. To test the accuracy of the three methods, the total enrollment obtained by each method was compared with the actual enrollment for the years 1987, 1988, and 1989. The cohort-survival projections were closest to actual enrollments; the next best technique was the simple ratio. One table and two graphs are included. (TJH)",

        "description":"This study addressed the writing of college educated officers compared to their overall performance in an introductory Army course. The effects of an effective writing (communicative skills) program and a remedial enrichment program were also examined. A total of 137 U.S. Army lieutenants, who were students in the 15-week Military Police Officer Basic Course during January through June of 1987, completed both indirect and direct measures of writing skills. The indirect measure was the Test of Standard Written English (TSWE), and the direct measures consisted of six different written exercises. Officers scoring a scaled score of 40 or above on the TSWE were sorted into groups of active and reserve component officers and then were randomly assigned to two experimental groups. All  officers scoring below a scaled score of 40 had to take the enrichment program. Ninety-eight of the students were placed in the writing enrichment program. The enrichment program significantly improved the writing skills of officers with initially deficient skills. However, the enrichment program improved neither the writing skills of officers initially scoring higher on the initial indirect measure nor their performance in the overall course. There was a significant relationship between the indirect and direct assessment techniques. The indirect assessments provided a statistically significant predictive measure of overall course averages. The results support the usefulness of remedial writing programs with indirect tests of writing performance; effective writing programs would  significantly improve the productivity of college educated professionals. Four data tables, a 29-item list of references, and the communicative skills grade sheet are included. (RLC)",

        "description":"This paper examines the historical roots of critical realism in western thought, highlights the dramatic nature of the shift in thought that the radical constructivists are seeking, and critically considers the relevance of radical constructivism in science teacher education. Radical constructivism is an epistemological philosophy that divorces knowing from any notion that reality is the referent of knowledge. Radical constructivists argue that adopting this view, rather than the realist view, will help teachers improve science instruction. The argument was put forward by Ernst von Glasersfeld at the 1990 annual meeting of the National Association for Research in Science Teaching. However, Glasersfeld's position implies a dramatic shift away from critical realism, which has deep  historical roots in western thought and which was critical to the development of modern science. Furthermore, the possible effect of radical constructivism on science teaching must be questioned. Many would argue that there is little reason to think that ontological beliefs are more critical in teacher behavior than social and material factors. Nevertheless, ontological belief is an interesting aspect of culture and could be incorporated into a general discussion of cultural issues during a program of science teacher education. The thorough discussion of ontological issues, however, is probably best left for graduate education. (Author/TJH)",

        "description":"A plausible &quot;s&quot;-factor solution for many types of psychological and educational tests is one in which there is one general factor and &quot;s - 1&quot; group- or method-related factors. The bi-factor solution results from the constraint that each item has a non-zero loading on the primary dimension &quot;alpha(sub j1)&quot; and at most one of the &quot;s - 1&quot; group factors. This structure has been termed the &quot;bi-factor&quot; solution by K. J. Holzinger and F. Swineford (1937), but it also appears in the work of L. R. Tucker and K. G. Joreskog. All attempts at estimating the parameters of this model have been restricted to continuously measured variables; it has not been previously considered in the context of item response theory (IRT). It is conceivable that the bi-factor structure might arise in IRT-related  problems. The purpose of this paper is to derive a bi-factor item response model for binary response data, and to develop a corresponding method of parameter estimation. This restriction leads to a major simplification of the likelihood equations that: (1) permits the statistical evaluation of problems of unlimited dimensionality; (2) permits conditional dependence among discrete and previously identified subsets of items; and (3) in some cases, provides more parsimonious factor solutions than an unrestricted full-information item factor analysis might provide.

        "description":"The probability integral of the multivariate normal distribution (ND) has received considerable attention since W. F. Sheppard's (1900) and K. Pearson's (1901) seminal work on the bivariate ND. This paper evaluates the formula that represents the &quot;n x n&quot; correlation matrix of the &quot;chi(sub i)&quot; and the standardized multivariate normal density function. C. W. Dunnett and M. Sobel's formula for the univariate ND function, and R. E. Bohrer and M. J. Schervish's error-bounded algorithm for evaluating &quot;F(sub n)&quot; for general &quot;rho(sub ij)&quot; are discussed. Computationally, the latter algorithm is restricted to &quot;n = 7&quot;; even at &quot;n = 7&quot;, it can take up to 24 hours for it to compute a single probability with 10(sup -3) accuracy on a computer than is capable of about 1-2 million scalar floating  point operations/second. This report presents a fast and general approximation (APX) for rectangular regions of the multivariate ND function based on C. E. Clark's (1961) APX to the moments of the maximum of &quot;n&quot; jointly normal random variables. The performance of this APX compared to special cases in which the exact results are known and error-bounded reduction formulae show that the APX's accuracy is adequate for many practical applications where multivariate normal probabilities are required. The computational speed of the Clark APX is unparalleled. The error bound for the APX is about 10(sup -3) regardless of dimensionality, and accuracy increases with increases in &quot;rho&quot;. The Clark algorithm provides a generalization of Dunnett's (1955) results to the case of general &quot;rho(sub ij)&quot;, a  natural application of which would be a generalization of Dunnett's test to the case of unequal sample sizes among the &quot;k + 1&quot; groups (i.e., multiple treatment groups compared to a single control group).

Data were obtained from admission records of 201 students admitted to undergraduate and 285 students admitted to graduate programs. Data included grade point averages, admission test scores, grades, gender, class rank, course instructor, and course grades. The neural net models used were the Adeline model and the Layer Back-propagation model. The neural net model makes no assumptions about the underlying distribution of the observations. In general, a neural network may be defined as a non-programmed information reduction system that develops processing abilities in response to its environment. The  function of the neural network is to learn from examples. The study findings indicate that the results obtained using the neural net models are comparable with, but not the same as, those of the classical statistical approach. While the neural net technology is not a replacement for the classical techniques, it may represent a viable alternative when certain assumptions of the statistical model are grossly violated.

This discussion guide focuses on the five corollary objectives of the National Goal, which are to: (1) increase the academic performance of elementary and secondary school students in every quartile and achieve a distribution of minority students in each level that more closely reflects the student population as a whole; (2) increase the percentage of students who demonstrate the ability to reason, solve problems, apply knowledge, and write and communicate effectively; (3) involve students in activities that promote and demonstrate good  citizenship, community service, and personal responsibility; (4) increase the percentage of students who are competent in more than one language; and (5) make students knowledgeable about the diverse cultural heritage of the nation and the world community. Under each objective the guide provides brief comments about the NAEP data in America's Challenge and other research findings, some illustrative graphics, and several discussion questions designed to help teachers and administrators re-examine current practices in their schools in order to find ways to better educate their students.

Mathematical programming models like the Maximin Model are formulated for computerized item selection from a bank. In this paper, mathematical programming models based on the Maximin Model are proposed for the construction of weakly parallel tests. Numerical experiments were conducted to obtain an impression of the practicality of the approach using an item bank of 600 items from college placement mathematics examinations (520 items were from 13 previously administered American College Testing Assessment Program tests, and 80 were from the Collegiate Mathematics Placement Program). Six tests were constructed, and their test information functions were computed. The results  demonstrate that tests constructed with the proposed models were near-optimal with respect to the Maximin criteria and were approximately weakly parallel. Five tables present information about the constructed tests. Four graphs illustrate the information functions. (Author/SLD)",

A mathematical programing model for constructing tests with a prespecified test information function and a heuristic for assigning items to tests such that their information functions are equal play an important role in the methods. The MI and MIDI methods are proposed for constructing tests with a prespecified test information function applying the Minimax model. Similar methods, MAMI and MADI, are provided for construction of a weakly parallel test approximately equal with respect to the Maximin criterion. The four methods were applied on a real item bank of 600 items from college placement mathematics tests (520 items were from 13 previously administered  American College Testing Assessment Program tests, and 80 were from the Collegiate Mathematics Placement Program). The numerical examples indicated that the tests were constructed quickly and that the heuristic gave good results. However, the heuristic was not applicable for every set of practical constraints (i.e., constraints with respect to test administration time, test composition, or dependencies between items). Four tables and four graphs present information about the constructed tests. (Author/SLD)",

The Education Data Improvement Project (EDIP), funded by the National Center for Education Statistics, began in the fall of 1985. In the first phase/year, the focus was on the Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe and the Public Elementary/Secondary Education Agency Universe Surveys. In the second phase/year, the project examined the information provided in the fiscal portions of the CCD. During the third phase/year, focus was on state-aggregate staffing data reported in the State Nonfiscal Survey. At the beginning of each project phase, state education agencies were asked to provide  their most recent data collection instruments and supporting documents. EDIP staff reviewed the documents, developed state profiles of data collection, and identified elements for which states cannot provide comparable data. Technical assistance plans have been developed for the first phase of the project; these will be revised for the states as additional information is collected. Areas of particular concern due to incompleteness or lack of comparability of data were: (1) student and school counts; (2) demographic and descriptive data; (3) high school completion rates; (4) per pupil expenditures; and (5) staffing data.

Information was gathered from statewide public hearings at which over 50 individuals and groups representing the general public and health care providers testified. The major finding was that a disproportionate number of black and minority Marylanders died needlessly between 1983 and 1985 from diseases, homicide, or accidents that were either preventable or controllable. Although Maryland has one of the best health care delivery systems in the nation, major improvements are needed if the health status of blacks and minorities is to change. Goals for improvement and priority recommendations are discussed. Statistical data are included on one  graph and 13 tables. Brief summaries of the following topics are also included: (1) major racial health-related disparities in Maryland; (2) factors contributing to identified racial health disparities; (3) major causes of death and related risk factors; (4) differences in the cultural norms of Anglo-Americans and minorities that may impede health care; and (5) priority goals and recommendations.

        "description":"Beginning in 1981, the Bay Shore (New York) School District initiated comprehensive changes in its instructional program. The process, which involved long range planning for 1982-1987 and 1987-1992, used focus groups, survey data, community input, and school-based feedback. Several of the overall goals of these plans are concerned with assuring equal education opportunities for all students, regardless of socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, gender, or handicapping condition. This paper summarizes the school district's efforts to bring about positive changes and increase student achievement, and presents an overview of data and results that indicate substantial gains by at-risk students. Bay Shore's long-range planning, accomplished through a participative-consultative  leadership model, elicited contributions from a broad cross section of the educational community. Major action objectives of the two plans focused on instructional development, program evaluation, and staff development. Each of these three foci has facilitated closing the achievement gap between White majority students and Hispanic and Black minority students. The paper includes discussion of the implementation and evaluation of a full-day kindergarten program, effects on minority group students and students from lower income backgrounds, and referrals to special education and remedial mathematics and reading. Students' achievement in mathematics as measured by New York State tests rose from 87% of students exceeding the State Reference Point (SRP) to 100% of students exceeding it, while  reading achievement rose from 79% to 89% of students scoring above the SRP.

The gap-reduction model has been recommended for the evaluation of bilingual programs, but has only recently been given consideration for evaluating local Chapter 1 programs. This report recommends that projects use local comparison groups and examine multiple outcomes, but voices concern that state educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs) will lose sight of the benefits of the gap-reduction model because of significant technical problems with interpreting Relative Growth Indices (RGIs) as an extension of routine Model A analysis. The report discusses the following three issues: (1) the validity of the RGI; (2)  conditions for aggregation; and (3) data quality. The following recommendations are presented: (1) do not require aggregating RGIs, but rather encourage piloting the gap-reduction model as a means to augment local evaluations; and (2) encourage LEAs to use annual testing and explicitly allow selection on the pretest at the local level, then leave the gains &quot;uncorrected,&quot; acknowledging that they are measures of relative gain, or adjust the results downward to better estimate treatment effects.

A recent study of the conditions of children reported the following changes since 1969 that warrant a reassessment of service delivery: (1) the number of children living in poverty has increased; (2) family structure and working patterns have shifted dramatically; and (3) the number of minority group children has increased relative to the majority population. These changes require a revamping of the present inefficient and ineffective delivery system that is unable to meet the multiple needs of disadvantaged children. The following examples of promising short-term solutions are described: (1) Ventura and San Bernardino Counties (California) interagency network;  (2) the Minneapolis Youth Coordinating Board (Minnesota); and (3) the Ounce of Prevention Fund, which supports a statewide system in Illinois. A long-term solution might be found by using schools as a structural \"hub\" for organizing and brokering an effective, integrated system of service delivery. The following examples of partially successful state interventions are described: (1) state commissions; (2) legislative committees; (3) consolidated budgets; (4) children's codes; (5) traditional programs; (6) interagency cooperation; (7) legislative mandates; and (8) task forces. Positive political momentum to improve federal and state systems has been hampered by federal budget deficits and slower state revenue growth.

The house plan is based on the subdivision of one or more grades into smaller schools within schools. Long-term monitoring of New York City dropout prevention programs found that those strategies, based on targeting limited numbers of at-risk students for remediation and support for limited time periods, failed because they returned students to the same overwhelming system that defeated them in the first place. New York's large, impersonal high school organization breeds alienation and isolation, its curriculum is broad rather than deep, and its management is autocratic rather than  participatory. Well-conceived house plans offer the following advantages: (1) intimate environments that promote interaction among staff and students; (2) cohesive educational programs reinforced by interdisciplinary teaching; (3) personal, ongoing staff support; (4) student and staff involvement in decision making; and (5) encouragement of wide participation in extracurricular activities. House plans have not been successfully implemented throughout the system over the past 2 years, despite a mandate from the New York City Board of Education, due to resistance at the school level, lack of forceful leadership, and inadequate funding from the central level. Until the Board of Education puts its full weight behind the house plan program, it is in danger of becoming one small effort among  many other uncoordinated dropout prevention and restructuring initiatives. A table illustrating the key features of the house system is included, and a table comparing the effects of different types of house plans on students is appended. (FMW)",

A large percentage of the legal and illegal immigrants who have entered the United States since the Refugee Act of 1980 are children who require assistance from community-based institutions. These children present the following problems to the human services delivery system: (1) lack of a common language; (2) culturally different concepts of illness and health; (3) educational deficiencies; and (4) fear of \"foreign\" treatment approaches. Current fiscal pressures have reduced the financial resources available to meet  their needs. Policymakers and service providers must coordinate, communicate, and collaborate to make the best possible use of the remaining public and private resources. It is recommended that a central collection place for research and program information on refugees be created to help service providers overcome fragmentation, and that coalitions at the national, state, and local levels be developed to design, execute, and evaluate systems of care for refugees. Model service delivery programs foster a network of organizations and individuals concerned with refugee issues, redirect existing programs to meet immediate needs, and develop special culturally sensitive services for refugee children.

The Peer Tutoring Program serves high school students who have failed to achieve specified levels of achievement in mathematics, reading/writing, or English as a Second Language. Higher-achieving students provide tutoring in one-to-one or small group sessions either before or after school. A few schools also provided in-classroom tutorials. The program is funded in low-income schools by Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act and in other schools by New York State's Pupils with Compensatory Educational Needs (PCEN) Program. Sixty-two of the 71 participating schools responded with evaluation information on 721  tutors and 7,492 students. Ninety-seven percent of the schools met the first objective of at least 25 students participating in the before- or after-school programs. The program as a whole met the second objective of at least 50 percent of the participants in the before- and after-school programs participating for at least 9 hours of instruction, and the third objective of at least 70 percent of the participants in classroom tutorials passing the class in which they were being tutored. Eighty percent of the schools met the fourth objective of training at least five tutors. Many of the schools expressed interest in implementing computer-assisted tutorial instruction in future programs. Statistical data are presented in three tables. (FMW)",

The program encourages the design and implementation of collaborative projects that address specific problems that prevent students from completing high school. The evaluation of the following projects is described: (1) Project SMART, a conflict mediation program involving a collaboration between the Victim Services Agency (VSA) and four high schools; (2) Enhancing Basic Reading Skills, an after-school reading and guidance program that used a consultant to design a specialized reading program;  (3) Cultural Diversity at Prospect Heights: Strategies for Meeting Staff, Student, Parent, and School Needs, a three-pronged program comprising English instruction, student leadership training, and peer truancy prevention involving collaborations between the school and Brooklyn College, New York University, and the Crown Heights Collective; and (4) English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) Instruction for Parents, a dual program offering language instruction for parents of Hispanic students enrolled in an AIDP reading program and offering workshops and field trips to students whose parents participated; this program did not involve collaboration with an outside agency. The following problems were encountered by more than one program: (1) stimulating parent participation; (2) late start-up due to  delays; (3) availability of funds; and (4) poor design of evaluation objectives.

The program comprised basic skills and English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) courses, serving 12,785 students in 880 classes in the regular high schools and an unspecified number of students at 73 off-site facilities. Participants were either taking a course they had previously failed; or had failed a Regents Competency Test (RCT) in reading, writing, or mathematics; or had fallen below the State Reference Point on the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) Test. All classes were composed of 25 students or less. Evaluation information was gathered from staff interviews, classroom observations, and statistical data on the number of courses passed and the  number of RCTs passed by participants. Sixty-three percent of the participants in the regular school courses passed at least one course, and 50 percent of the participants taking an RCT passed the exam. Students scored above the stated objective on the writing RCT and below the stated objective on the reading and mathematics RCTs. Quantitative data on the performance of participants served by off-site facilities were not available. Recommendations for improvement include compilation of statistical data on the performance of participants served by off-site facilities and inclusion of science and social studies courses in future programs.

It argues that the surge in small business is related to what is happening in big business, warns that protectionism may soon appear in the service sector, and calls for a national information policy. \"Is Entrepreneurial Opportunity Still Alive in America?\" (Albro Martin; Richard McKenzie and Robert Friedman, commentators) explains that entrepreneurship is a vital component of successful large firms. An overview highlighting conference themes (William Dennis, Stuart Butler) concludes the publication.  (YLB)",

        "description":"Vocational education programs conducted by the Cincinnati Public Schools were reviewed to analyze their characteristics and to clarify their mission and goals. The review examined information on demographic and economic trends in the labor market served by the schools and developed information on the purpose, conduct, and outcomes of the vocational programs through school visits, personal interviews, and mail surveys. Participants in interviews and surveys included teachers, principals, guidance counselors, staff, and students at each high school offering vocational programs; parents of students interviewed; employers; directors of community agencies and other community representatives involved with vocational programs; employers of students; and former students. The information  developed by these activities provided the basis for development of a questionnaire sent to 187 educators, employers, and other community representatives; 95 responded. Four recommendations resulted from the survey: (1) expand vocational education to give students transferable as well as technical skills; (2) document the skills acquired by vocational graduates; (3) demonstrate school district support for vocational education; and (4) improve the quality of jobs available in the Occupational Work Adjustment and Occupational Work Experience programs.

        "description":"This book traces the process by which the British government's formal commitment to increasing access to higher education and expanding continuing education has gone hand in hand with severe cuts in extramural departments, insistence on self-financing, and emphasis on vocational training for regeneration, at the expense of liberal education for personal development and citizenship. Chapter 1 is an outline of the history of university adult education (UAE). The next two chapters detail developments in UAE over the last 20 years and attempt to relate change in UAE to education in the wider university and to the growth of political pressure. The argument is made that UAE is in crisis. Chapter 4 considers recently expressed views on the future of UAE, critiques the rationale of the  drive to vocational and professional continuing education, and considers the organization of UAE in the context of the changes of the last two decades. Chapter 5 examines the nature of the university today, scrutinizes recent developments in the patterns of UAE provision, suggests changes to facilitate a serious move by universities into a broader continuing education, and discusses proposals from the political parties and a 1987 White Paper. Twenty-one pages of notes and references, a bibliography of approximately 350 items and an author index are provided. (YLB)",

        "description":"Five kinds of assessment measures were used to determine whether improvements took place in the continuing education program at the State University of New York at Stony Brook as a result of a new faculty hiring plan that emphasized departmental control. The five assessment methods were: scheduling information; student evaluation of teaching data; verified anecdotes; a commissioned research study; and a study of administrators conducted by the University Senate. Each assessment measure suggested either an improvement or a positive perception of the unit. Following the change in hiring and the incentive program, there was an increase in the number of courses scheduled, in student evaluations of teaching showing better scores, and in anecdotal information that suggested that  department chairs were paying heed to poor teaching evaluations brought to their attention. Additional improvements were indicated on a commissioned survey that showed a change in perspective among key decision makers and in a campus poll that reflected favorable responses to the new initiatives.

The study focused on service delivery aspects of programming and incentives/motivations as well as on barriers affecting participation. Surveys and interviews collected data on programs, students, and need for services as well as attitudes and perceptions. Results indicated that most adult literacy providers and consumers were involved in adult basic education (ABE) programming; volunteers were an important component of most adult literacy programs; computer lessons were used in two-thirds of the responding programs; and two-thirds of the participants did not have more than a  10th-grade education. Barriers to participation in and delivery of ABE services were the following: low motivation and few incentives; need for confidentiality; inadequate transportation; lack of child care services; lack of community leadership; lack of professional support; and inappropriate funding. Recommendations corresponding to these barriers were made to improve and expand existing literacy services.

The 10 \"change drivers,\" each of which is discussed in its own section of the report, are as follows: the maturing of the population; the information explosion; problems of environmental health and stewardship; problems related to social issues,  life-styles, and values; economic restructuring; mosaic society; changing families; health and wellness issues; tensions between individual and social roles; and globalization.

        "description":"Communities in Crisis is a British training program for unemployed adults that was developed in response to the needs of community organizations in areas where community programs have few resources. Its underlying philosophy focuses on motivating and encouraging long-term unemployed people to take initiatives and reflect on their progress. The first fully funded program was structured to include 1- or 2-day workshops and residential events. In the second year of funding, dramatic changes in the structure of the program to ensure funding included increasing participant numbers and altering program content. Further structural changes have since occurred. Apart from immediate benefits to individuals and their communities such as improved efficiency through skills development,  additional and important wider economic and employment developments occurred. In regard to differences of approach between men and women, no broad generalizations can be made. Some differences did emerge, however; for example, the majority of women chose projects that produced a response to an identified area of unmet need, while the majority of men concentrated on strengthening existing groups and securing further resources. The final methodology adopted by the program included day workshops, residencies, and regular consultation meetings with the development worker. Project work on community issues continued to be the focus of activity for participants. (A list of seven references and a projects catalog are appended.) (YLB)",

Good training pays--for workers whose skills are upgraded, for companies seeking a competitive edge, and for the nation in overall productivity. However, workers in other countries are better trained than most U.S. workers. Too often, U.S. businesses seek to improve productivity by investing in hardware rather than in training people. Firms that do provide training have found it to be harder than anticipated. Traditional approaches are too narrow and many workers lack basic skills. The quality of training must improve. Greater federal involvement may be required to develop the highly skilled, flexible workers needed today. New institutional  structures will also be needed to make affordable training available to small businesses. Policy options can be grouped in four broad issue areas: reducing barriers to firm-based training; retraining for individual career advancement; linking training and technology assistance to firms; and improving the quality and effectiveness of training.

Program services, which center on education, occupational skills training, parenting and health education, child care, and counseling, aim at improving the effectiveness of participants both as wage earners and as parents. The New Chance pilot phase was conducted from January 1986 to September 1988. During this time, the program model was developed and implemented at six sites across the country. Descriptions of the services of the six sites showed some success in treating clients with difficult problems. Eight lessons were drawn from  the project: (1) making services available is not enough--they must be exciting and address participants' needs; (2) integrated services are more effective; (3) intensive staff training and technical assistance are needed; (4) techniques for maintaining a sense of momentum should be built into the program model; (5) sites should set attendance and lateness policies early; (6) stipends and incentives are important to many participants; (7) child care is a critical program service; and (8) optimum program development requires thought and planning facilitated by stable funding.

        "description":"This document reports the trends in participation in adult basic education and secondary education programs from 1968 through 1985 in 11 charts and 8 tables. It also summarizes trends for the 18 years of that period and for program year 1985. According to the summaries, during fiscal years 1968 through 1985, more than 27 million persons received training under the Adult Education Act. Enrollments in the last 3 years were noticeably higher than in the preceding 3 years; more than 29 percent of the total number of participants for the period enrolled during 1983-85. Women consistently were the majority of those served by adult basic education programs, with enrollments reaching the highest level of male participation in 1985. Total annual spending increased from $40 million in 1968  to $325 million in 1985--an increase of 160 percent in constant 1985 dollars. During this 18-year period, the federal share increased 5 percent in constant dollars, while the state and local share increased 656 percent. Since 1976 the federal share has decreased 13 percent and the state/local share has increased 221 percent in constant dollars. In program year 1985, adult education programs funded under the Adult Education Act served more than 2.8 million persons, an increase of almost 11 percent over the previous year. Four states account for 64 percent of the enrollment: California, Florida, Texas, and New York. Women continued to make up more than half of the enrollment. The two largest age groups in 1985 were 16-24 and 25-44. Approximately 31 percent of those enrolled left before  completion. In 1985, more than 65,000 persons were employed in adult basic or secondary education; most were part time or volunteers. (KC)",

        "description":"Work force issues regarding technological change, international trade, and changes in job skills were the subject of a series of studies of work force changes in U.S. industries. The studies examined the characteristics of employees in 61 manufacturing industries in 1960, 1970, and 1980 through data obtained from the Labor Demographics Matrices compiled by the U.S. Department of Labor. Differences in wages and education levels were compared with differences among industries with respect to capital equipment and other measurable characteristics. One finding indicated that industries introducing new technologies hired better-educated employees and paid them higher wages. The policy implication of this finding is that since new technologies create work environments that demand more  learning, levels of investments in all levels of education must be improved. Another finding was that as international trade expands, the United States is specializing in learning-intensive goods and services. U.S. trade deficits have been concentrated among traditional industries whereas the country's comparative advantage is in skill-intensive goods and services. The policy implication of this finding is that federal and state economic development strategies should shift to a focus on and support for emerging high technology industries.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 323 randomly selected ABE students in Iowa. During the interviews, students were asked to rate the personal applicability of 62 motivational statements derived from earlier interviews with ABE students. Ratings were subjected to factor analysis, and the following 10 distinct motivational factors were identified: educational advancement, self-improvement, literacy development, community and church involvement, economic need, family responsibilities, diversions (or enrichment), job  advancement, launching a new life, and urging of others. The research concluded that there is no single, typical ABE student and that ABE needs to meet the needs of this diverse group. (KC)",

        "description":"A great discrepancy exists between the potential number of adult basic education (ABE) participants (all adults who have not graduated from high school) and those who actually choose to participate in ABE. To determine why high school dropouts choose not to participate in ABE, telephone interviews were conducted with a carefully constructed, statewide sample of 129 adults in Iowa who were eligible for ABE but had never participated. During the interviews, respondents were asked to rate the accuracy of 32 statements describing reasons for not taking classes to complete high school. (The statements were derived from earlier interviews with ABE nonparticipants.) The ratings were subjected to factor analysis, which suggested that there are four basic reasons why eligible adults  choose not to participate in ABE: low perception of need; situational barriers; perceived effort; and dislike for school. Older adults were most likely to have low perceptions of need, whereas situational barriers most often prevented participation of young, married adults who were employed full time and had children. The study concluded that adult educators should try to change perceptions of potential students toward education, admit that low perception of need may be reasonable in some cases, and work toward removing situational barriers by providing child care and other support services.

        "description":"Students with special needs living in rural areas face a difficult challenge as they prepare for employment and adult life. Access to vocational education in rural areas may be limited by isolation, problems in teacher recruitment and retention, curriculum and instructional deficiencies, and weak financial support. In addition, program relevance and student outcomes are negatively influenced by outdated program offerings, lack of quality, limited relevance to the local job market and industry needs, lack of local job experience opportunities, and lack of recognition by rural educators of vocational education's role in decreasing both the likelihood and impact of worker layoffs or job displacements. Vocational education can play a key role in the economic growth of rural areas.  The school can act as an agency of rural economic development; skill-specific vocational education can prepare students with special needs for the job market. If skill-specific vocational education is reduced, vocational educators must encourage special-needs rural students to pursue further education. Vocational education in rural areas can be improved by strategies placing an emphasis on support services personnel, guidance and counseling, involvement of a variety of public and private service providers, more effective use of existing community resources, and modification of existing employment opportunities to address rural conditions. Improvements can also be made by forming cooperative programs, taking administrative action, using mobile facilities, using electronic technology,  forming school-business partnerships, and training for entrepreneurship.

Section I, an overview of performance standards, discusses the evolution of the standards and the rationale supporting them. Section II details a systematic approach to obtaining comprehensive baseline data on local performance, an analysis of the performance of specific activities and contractors within the Service Delivery Area, and an analysis of performance  trends. Section III describes three approaches for improving performance: (1) the oversight response, which identifies probable causes of poor performance; (2) the planning response, which provides tools to examine new strategies and approaches that will improve performance; and (3) the follow-up response, which reviews strategies related to the new postprogram measures. Section IV summarizes the key issues related to planning and managing with performance standards. Sixteen worksheets for report summaries or charts are included in the guide. (KC)",

In service-oriented activities, adult and community educators make extensive use of volunteers, asking them to fulfill a number of roles and giving them such responsibilities as tutoring, counseling, problem solving, and decision making. Issue- or cause-oriented activities seek volunteers who work to make community agencies and individuals aware of a need for social and community change. Knowing why people volunteer their time and talents is important to understanding volunteer motivation and involvement. They volunteer to help other people, to benefit society, to use socializing skills, to develop or maintain personal development skills, and for employment-related motives. Recruitment of volunteers  should be done with a major campaign to address the needs of the agency, the needs of the volunteer, and the needs of the director. A job description should be presented to the applicant, and an effective training program should be developed and implemented. Adult education principles are helpful in developing meaningful, effective training programs. Retention is best accomplished through the development of feelings of importance and belonging. Rewards and recognition are also important to volunteers. (12 references) (YLB)",

When an agency works by itself, it avoids risks, protects its resources, gets sole credit, and controls goals, methods, and efforts. When agencies cooperate, they can prevent duplication of efforts and services, economize and stretch resources, multiply the efforts of personnel and facilities, serve clients more effectively, increase public support for all agencies involved, and achieve goals unreachable individually. One planning technique for developing interagency cooperation is the Process Model by Janove (1984). This cyclical model is an ongoing process with six phases: assessment; setting realistic goals; formulation of an action plan; implementation of the action plan; evaluation; and  reassessment and recycling. With scarce human, financial, and agency resources, the need for agency cooperation has never been greater. By combining and coordinating forces, the group has a greater potential than individual efforts. The whole is greater than the sum of the individual parts, and synergy is achieved. (YLB)",

The report begins by defining OJT as the one-on-one process of providing the knowledge and skills to perform a specific task within a job. These five features of OJT are described: OJT (1) occurs in the actual workplace; (2) makes use of training objectives and plans; (3) requires the active involvement of a trainer; (4) uses printed materials and job guides; and (5) employs a systems approach. The report goes on to suggest selection criteria when considering the use of structured OJT, including demands of the workplace, types of training outcomes, trainee characteristics, costs of the method and of the  performance problem, and level of organizational commitment. Next discussed are the benefits of structured OJT in four major areas: effectiveness, efficiency, employee development, and organizational climate. Finally, a case-study example of the use of structured OJT in a large manufacturing organization is described, and the report concludes with brief discussions of future research opportunities. Appendixes include a list of 21 references, a comparison of unstructured and structured OJT, and tables of structured OJT selection criteria and structured OJT process. (YLB)",

The curriculum is nonsexist, has a low reading level, is activity oriented, meets the needs of single parents as identified by parents in North Dakota, may be used with individuals or groups, requires little preparation by the leader, and can be adapted to fit classes of different lengths and different numbers of meeting times. The curriculum focuses on problem-solving skills, incorporating the Practical Action Teaching Approach (Laster 1982), a model for teaching problem solving that enables learners to solve their own problems and to acquire new information and skills based on their own needs. The curriculum contains five units that cover the following skills:  self-esteem and assertiveness; managing stress; raising happy, healthy children; managing money matters; and food for healthy families. Each unit consists of an introduction, problem-solving suggestions, and 13 to 35 activities for participants. Some activities include handouts with space for participants to plan actions and answer questions. (KC)",

        "description":"The development theory for progress in the countries of the Third World must be based on the aspirations of the common people; the majority poor. The poor cannot simply be provided with resources; they must also be psychologically, socially, and economically empowered. The most important conflict in poor countries is between urban and rural sectors. Governments need to consider such policy options as more efficient reallocation of resources to rural areas and provision of more social services for rural poor. An appropriate strategy is a balanced and purposeful use of human resource development and information systems. An example of a poverty alleviation project is Bangladesh's Upazila Resource Development and Employment Project (URDEP). The basic URDEP concept is to organize  family groups; raise their consciousness about their situation and environment; train them to organize with other families; and select livelihoods or trades to be financed through small loans. An extension of such a micro-type project by and for the poor is the maximum use of technology for the most remote villages. One suggestion for intervention to help the poor in the Philippines is the establishment of a People's Foundation, the main task of which would be to spearhead poverty alleviation projects based on guided self-reliance.

        "description":"The Bagby, Oklahoma, Human Resources Center was conceived in the mid-1970s as a model of community education and unified services. It was built with federal grant money to serve as a middle school, library, human services office, and meeting space for Bagby, a growing town of about 5,000. As envisioned, it was to serve all parts of the population, with a gymnasium for recreation, a library for both adults and children, adult education and job training, senior citizens meals and recreation, and many of the human services needed by disadvantaged people. Ten years later, however, interviews with townspeople and observation of the uses of the building showed that the dream has not been fulfilled. Although a middle school, a library, and a health service operate in the building, it  has not become the community center that was proposed. Each of the units operates separately. There is little integration of personnel or services, and each of the major entities, the school and library, thinks of the building as &quot;theirs.&quot; No director of the facility was hired to coordinate activities; the middle school refuses to let community groups use &quot;their&quot; gym, and the library makes strict rules about the use of &quot;their&quot; meeting room. In addition, the building was built away from the center of town, where the majority of the people needing human services live, and little input was gathered from the community about its needs prior to construction. The Bagby disappointment points out the paradox of the philosophy of adult education: If it is meant to empower adults, as has been  maintained, then it cannot be &quot;owned&quot; by the schools or other authorities.

Witnesses included Senators, Representatives, officials from the Department of Labor, educators, and representatives of business and industry associations. Testimony stated that many workers are not being educated and trained to meet the demands of the jobs that need to be filled. From basic entry-level positions to technicians, engineers, and scientists, workers who can do the job are becoming increasingly hard to find. This skills crisis is becoming a menace to the nation's economic future, according to  testimony. A proposal by the Labor Department to improve the situation called for norms for work readiness, credentialing, school-to-work transition programs, and work-based training. Testimony also noted the need for inclusion of minority groups in training to help them participate in the work force more fully. Frustration was expressed with the slow pace at which programs are being initiated to solve this crisis. (KC)",

        "description":"A study examined the information collected by the Department of Defense on both the quality of its new recruits and the effectiveness of its training in preparing recruits to operate in a technologically sophisticated environment. It found that data were collected at a recruit's entrance to military life, during and upon completion of formal training, and after assignment to a military specialty in the field. The study showed that for most recruits, the services' selection criteria are moderately successful at predicting individual performance during classroom technical training. However, they are notably less successful for women and minority recruits. Each service has evaluation mechanisms in place, but only the Army systematically collects data on the field performance of  individual graduates in a way that would allow comparison of a graduate's on-the-job performance with entry-level ability and classroom performance. These data reveal an even weaker connection for women and minority group members between criteria used to assign them to technical specialties and their later field performance. The field evaluation practices of the Navy are particularly fragmented and have deteriorated during the 1980s. The lack of reliable field performance data in the Navy and the Air Force makes realistic assessment of training effectiveness impossible. The study also found that the quality of recruits in respect to education increased during the early 1980s, but leveled off later in the decade. (KC)",

Four sections explore various dimensions of the self affecting literacy perspective; examine respondents' relationships with friends and relatives around literacy; describe elements of the community context respondents considered important to literacy perceptions and decisions; and forge a theory of literacy perspective as a result of the interaction between psychological and social contexts and the response of low-literate adults. &quot;Lifelong Learning in  Livingston, Montana&quot; (John Shirk) investigates resources used in adult learning projects and the economic impact such learning activities had on an economically disadvantaged community. Interviews with 60 respondents produced the following findings: learning activity costs totaled as much as $2,000 per year, with the average learner spending at least $500 per year; economic benefits to learners included promotions, new responsibilities, and investment returns; and noneconomic gains to learners included improvement in interpersonal skills.

The differences are that academic problems are prerecognized, predefined, and well-structured; most school problems have one right answer; academic problems provide relevant information; in school settings, there is clear feedback; and schools emphasize individual problem solving.

        "description":"The purpose of this project was to identify and gain consensus among vocational educators regarding their perceptions of the most critical research goals and the most critical research problem areas in vocational education personnel development. The Delphi technique was used in the three rounds of the survey. The first round requested lists of the five most critical research goals and the five most critical research problem areas. Analyses identified 50 goal statements and 75 problem areas. In the second round of the survey, participants were asked to identify the 10 most critical research goal statements and 12 most critical research problems. Items selected by 75 percent of the participants were on the survey questionnaire in round three. In round three, there was agreement  among 90 percent of the 73 participants on the goals and problem areas. The goals were as follows: (1) clarify the mission and goals; (2) determine appropriate requirements for and effective ways to deliver programs; (3) improve the quality of preservice teacher education; (4) improve the quality of inservice teacher education; (5) improve ability to select, recruit, and retain students into vocational teacher education; (6) improve teacher educator preparation; (7) improve ability to serve special populations; (8) determine requirements for teacher certification; (9) improve professionalism of vocational educators; and (10) improve leader development.

        "description":"The challenge of change in the transition from one spiritual leader to another has two facets: the \"letting go\" of the departing pastor and the adoption of a new spiritual leader. A Transition Committee of a midsized Episcopal church in rural Washington State has used the Rogers 1962 Adoption Model to develop an intentional plan to influence the change process and acceptance of the \"new.\" Steps or stages in the Adoption Model are awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption. As developed by the Transition Committee, two models correspond to two separate change or adoption processes that exist: one adoption model that would lead to positive disengagement and another that would lead to positive engagement. Although this process is not complete at the church, some  conclusions are evident: (1) involvement of clergy is paramount; (2) designing activities to deal with the process around change in institutionalized church life is intentional not accidental; (3) participation by all congregants creates more ownership over the entire change process; and (4) monitoring of acceptance of change is important.

First, work force literacy is described within an economic framework. Second, economy-literacy links are demonstrated with data from a hypothetical economy, dubbed Tinkerland because its economic features are \"tinkered with\" during the demonstration. The links among production, consumption, employment, and literacy are shown in the economy during the \"previous\" period. Then the status quo of the economy is altered to show the sensitivity of literacy requirements to changes in production and consumption. Third, directions for research  are established to help unravel the complex ties between the employment needs of an economy with the literacy of its workers. A technical appendix describes methods used to calculate the linkages and changes described in the section on the hypothetical economy, Tinkerland. A list of 61 references is provided. (YLB)",

The workshops were designed to share experiences on the introduction of group methods, to exchange ideas on \"what works,\" to identify continuing needs and problems, and to give new insights. Literacy practitioners enjoyed working in groups. Workers and students alike valued the interaction made possible by group instruction. Adult learners talked about the support and challenges that group members give each other. They identified as problems the effects of people with different educational levels and learning styles working together. Participants also  shared specific information on making group literacy programs work: organizing groups, recruiting and retaining students, choosing content and materials, working with students who learn differently, defining and assessing success, and training volunteers and teachers.

        "description":"U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projections of occupational employment growth have systematically underpredicted the growth of occupations that require the most education and training. The latest data on occupational growth rates show that the BLS's recent projections of occupational employment growth to the year 2000 probably suffer from the same bias. Based on a regression analysis of trends in occupational shares, forecasts of occupational employment demand imply substantially faster growth of higher level occupations. A comparison of past and projected percentage rates of change in employment in high skill jobs to actual and projected rates of change in the stock of well-educated workers illustrates the supply/demand balance for college graduates. Findings show that,  during the 1980s, employment in high skill occupations grew at nearly the same rate as the stock of workers with one or more years of college; employers wished to increase the proportion of workers in these ocupations who had a college education. A shortage developed and the wage premium for college graduates rose to unprecedented levels. Policy implications include the following: (1) the social returns to a college education are extremely high and likely to go higher; (2) continuing inequality in wage premiums will put U.S. corporations at a competitive disadvantage; and (3) public policy must focus on increasing the supply of technically and scientifically trained individuals.

The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire sent to Unesco National Commissions, a review of legal documents, and analyses of comparative studies and monographs on individual countries. Results were reported in terms of the universalization of adult education, the social extension of the right to education, the right to education in all fields, the administration of the adult education system, and adult education teachers and research. The study concluded that there is a tendency for a growing number of  countries to enact laws concerning adult education. Although at one time and in some countries these provisions reflected state welfare policies, today adult education is required by law to accompany and even precede major economic and social changes. The achievement of such objectives is seen to depend on two basic hypotheses that are becoming reality: (1) the recognition of the right of all individuals, especially workers, to devote part of each day to study; and (2) the creation of an adult education system that guarantees the right of education to all, at any age, from the lowest to the highest levels.

From the resolutions, seven goals can be set, concerning updating, serving all  groups, expanding the whole person concept of education, developing educational programs to meet demands, fostering free enterprise, providing leadership, and elevating standards of excellence in all facets of agricultural education. From these goals flows a three-step strategic plan: (1) creating a mission document; (2) challenging each organization in the community to align its goals with the national mission; and (3) clearly and constantly communicating the goals of the agricultural education community.

A study examined the extent to which advance notice eases the adjustment problems associated with permanent loss of jobs. Data from the Displaced Worker Supplement to the January 1988 Current Population Survey, which contain information on the type and timing of notice and on the duration of the initial spell of joblessness, were analyzed. Six primary findings emerged: (1) prior to the passage of WARN, few firms voluntarily provided written advance notice of 60 days or more; (2) previous research has overestimated the extent to which prenotification reduces postdisplacement joblessness; (3)  written announcements of layoffs and plant closings increase the probability that displaced workers obtain new positions without intervening joblessness--however, there is no indication that formal notice reduces average joblessness for those failing to find other jobs; (4) formal advance notice provided more than 2 months prior to displacement may substantially raise earnings in the new job; (5) further research is needed before the effects of mandatory notice can be predicted confidently; and (6) the impact of prior notification varies widely over population subgroups, with married persons, household heads, and workers in high-unemployment areas benefiting most.

It suggests possible short- and long-term policy strategies that might be used to increase the effectiveness of voluntary service in JTPA programs. The issue analysis is based on a review of literature and informal discussions with officials of national agencies and associations. The report is organized in four sections. Section I discusses briefly why the use of volunteers is important. Section II presents what is known about the numbers and characteristics of volunteers nationwide. Section III reviews experience to date with volunteers in employment-related programs in order to  determine the types of services typically delivered by volunteers, the sources of volunteers, the potential costs involved in using volunteers, and possible barriers to their use. Section IV recommends possible policy alternatives for the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration to consider in promoting the use of volunteers in JTPA. Some of the conclusions reached by the study are that about half of U.S. citizens volunteer, with more women than men involved, that volunteers average 5 hours of service per week, and that it is important to provide training and request a time commitment in order to make the best use of volunteer help.

        "description":"This study was conducted to determine how many workers are in low-wage jobs; their characteristics and changes in their characteristics over time; the characteristics of the low-wage jobs; gender, sex, and racial factors influencing participation in low-wage jobs; and the relationship of low-wage work to family poverty and welfare receipt. The study used samples from two major nationally representative data sets, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which were analyzed using trend analysis, spell analysis, and regression analysis. Some of the findings of the study were the following: (1) over the decade from 1975 through 1984, both the number and proportion of adults working at low wages have increased, with  approximately one-fourth of all adult workers working for $5.30 per hour or less in 1984; (2) the increase in low-wage work has occurred disproportionately among women, mothers responsible for children, and racial and ethnic minority groups; (3) holding constant human capital and job factors, low-wage work is still unequally distributed by gender and race/ethnicity; and (4) human capital factors (experience, education) are less significant for minority and female low-wage workers than for white males in determining their wages. The study concluded that these findings raise a number of policy issues that need to be addressed by policy-makers in many fields, including education, job training, and welfare, as well as for employers.

The New Chance model provides a variety of services to meet the program's multiple objectives. The model will be implemented in 10 states at 16 selected sites that will serve as models for other states and organizations interested in developing similar programs. At least 100 young mothers will participate at each site. Funding will be provided through a consortium of federal, state, and local government agencies, private corporations, and foundations that are committed to increasing knowledge about  programs that can inform social policy. The model was piloted in six sites for a year. The pilot sites were successful in attracting the highly disadvantaged population for whom the model was developed, and the sites were able to mount and integrate the comprehensive services that comprise New Chance. Short-term data on the performance of the pilot programs and the achievements of participants suggested that the model has sufficient strength and promise to make the yearlong, 16-site test.

        "description":"A study examined the quest for social equity by one adult education institution in New Zealand. It placed social equity in the wider context of recent developments in New Zealand society and explored models for conceptualizing social change. These models included the adaptive framework, helping/coping strategies, and allocation policies. A social change model advanced by Law and Sissons (1985), also explored, includes four essential systematically interrelated elements: collective empowerment, access for the oppressed, control by participants, and a holistic curriculum. A program devised with and for Maori (indigenous) people is then &quot;tested&quot; against these models. The study concludes that although the framework in which the program is offered appears limited in terms of  potentiality for social change, the program may still have transformative properties.

        "description":"New statistics showing the need for improving the quality of the U.S. work force shift the focus of government-sponsored employment and training programs from social justice to economic security for all. At the same time, statistics show that more than 50 percent of young black males, even those who have a high school education, cannot find jobs. Hispanic youth in cities have similar or higher unemployment rates. However, with the present budget deficit, the Federal Government cannot solve this problem. The next round of federal legislation to aid education for disadvantaged youth should start with the concept of community responsibility and establish a tracking system to give each community information on how its youth are doing. New federal legislative initiatives must leverage  local private sector employment, public education, and community organization resources and build systems of accountability for measurable results into the program design. The existence of Private Industry Councils to represent the interests of local businesses as partners with education and training institutions and the growth of such programs as the Boston Compact indicate that the elements of a more effective youth policy can be designed with the government as catalyst rather than as funder.

        "author":["Pritz, Sandra G."],
        "description":"Integrated programs provide students with a balanced mix of academic and vocational skills needed in the workplace and for lifelong learning. Basic skills in mathematics, science, and communication form the foundation for lifelong learning and the content for higher-order skills. Occupational skills depend on and do not exist apart from academic foundations. The National Association of State Directors of Vocational Technical Education Consortium supports the concept of integration and the restructuring of the relationship between academic and vocational education. Federal, state, and local initiatives are recommended to bring about this reform. A number of strategies for implementing the vocational-academic approach are being tried in many schools, bolstered by the mandate for  enhanced integration in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. More widespread implementation depends on the resolution of a number of issues: (1) developing the drive and achieving commitment from all levels; (2) setting goals to bring about the integration of academics in vocational education and the integration of academic and vocational education; (3) overcoming such barriers as staff concerns and lack of funding; (4) determining structural questions such as who will teach academic and vocational skills, what effect will organizational structure have on making changes, what curricular materials will be used, and who else (parents, counselors, community) needs to be involved; (5) providing inservice training for vocational and academic teachers; and (6)  preparing to evaluate integration efforts. One strategy for implementation is cross-correlation of vocational and academic curricula, that is, identification of exactly where academic concepts are used in vocational courses. A matrix of vocational tasks and academic concepts can assist in this effort. Cross-correlation can lead to other joint activities such as adaptation/adoption of curriculum materials, shared lesson planning, and documentation for granting academic credit for basic skills taught in vocational classes. Recognition is growing that integrated partnerships supporting students' varied learning styles are the most effective means of achieving the academic and vocational competence needed in a global economy. The policy issues, strategies, and examples provided in this  position statement and guide can assist policy makers, administrators, and teachers in reaching that goal. (SK)",

Clients are self-referrals who pay no fees. Students are provided with an effective strategy to use when teaching an adult to read. Each student applies this strategy while working directly with an adult client in closely supervised tutoring sessions. The strategy consists of a cycle that includes assessing an adult's reading abilities, using this assessment to develop a profile of the adult's strengths and needs, using the profile to develop an effective instructional plan, and using  instruction to gain additional information as part of assessment. Each aspect of the teaching process is guided by knowledge of the reading process (components) and what is known about the way in which reading develops (levels). Students first participate in workshops and lectures during which they are introduced to the concepts and strategies. Once tutoring begins, the course consists of one lecture or workshop along with two tutoring sessions each week. (15 references) (YLB)",

        "description":"Vocational educators and special needs personnel face many challenges as they address the educational needs of urban youth and update vocational programs in large inner city school districts. Vocational education programs must take a holistic approach to meet the needs of a wide range of disadvantaged students. Demographic projections of increased proportions of nonwhite students in urban areas underscore the need for personnel who can serve culturally and linguistically diverse populations. Because as many as 40% of minority students live in poverty, the risk factors associated with persistent poverty must also be taken into account. Predictions that the majority of new entrants to the work force will be females, nonwhites, and immigrants mean that sex and race stereotyping in  program placement and training opportunities must be overcome. Pressures for higher skill levels among workers also make postsecondary training imperative. To meet the challenges posed by demographic and work force trends, it is recommended that vocational programs implement early intervention to ensure equal access of urban special needs students, beginning at the middle school. Flexible instructional programming and support services are needed to provide alternatives for diverse student groups. Interagency planning and comprehensive service coordination are needed to help disadvantaged individuals throughout each stage of transition from school to work. Multiple or second-chance opportunities for education, training, and employment help ensure that special needs students participate in  training opportunities and succeed in the workplace.

The program is a collaborative effort of the school district, the district's technical education center, community social service agencies, health clinics, and business/community partners. It is staffed with a coordinator, home economics instructor, public health nurse, early childhood education specialist, volunteers, paraprofessional child caregivers, and foster  grandparents. During the program, the number of youth served has been rising each year (1981-90). As a result of the program, a high percentage of at-risk youth has been served, dropout rates for teen parents have gone down, there is a decreased incidence of low birthweight babies, and repeat pregnancies have decreased. The program's heavy vocational education emphasis has made it possible for many teen parents to complete vocational training. (KC)",

Qualifications of a successful florist include being a good businessperson, able to design, having enough capital, being a good buyer, being really interested in the business, having good interpersonal skills, knowing how to advertise, knowing how to train and handle employees, having experience, being a merchandiser, having a thorough knowledge of plants and flowers, and participating in civic affairs. A formal college education is highly desirable. Areas of study should include floriculture, floral design, and business  management. The most common form of business ownership is proprietorship. Two other forms are partnership and corporation. Each form has advantages and disadvantages that the prospective florist must consider. Steps in setting up a flower shop include obtaining capital, formal training, discussion of options with a lawyer, location selection, purchase or lease of a store, application for tax number and licenses, selection of bookkeeper and accountant, interior work, purchase of supplies from a wholesaler, delivery arrangements, advertising, purchases, and customer solicitation.

        "description":"The accuracy of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projections of occupational employment growth was investigated for the period 1972-1989. BLS was found to have consistently underpredicted the growth of skilled occupations and overpredicted the growth of occupations requiring low or moderate skills. A regression-based forecast was indicated as doing a better job of forecasting future occupational staffing ratios than the judgmental approach used by BLS. A regression analysis of the substantial changes in occupational shares that occurred from 1972 to 1989 predicted substantially greater upskilling than BLS. BLS's projections of the supply/demand balance for college graduates were also evaluated and found to have been consistently wrong. An examination of this balance was done by  comparing past and projected percentage rates of change in employment in high skill jobs to actual and projected percentage rates of change in the stock of well-educated workers. Projections indicated that the labor market for college graduates was tight and would get even tighter. Findings implied high social returns to a college education and the need for a public policy response to ameliorate the shortage. (Appendixes include 14 tables and 42 endnotes.) (YLB)",

The findings were established through telephone interviews with 17 professional business associations and 2 universities and through a literature review. The study distinguished between &quot;specialized&quot; courses, which are related to the specific industries the associations represent, and&quot;generic&quot; business courses (traditional business courses such as finance, accounting, and marketing). Three main options for pursuing partnerships with professional associations were suggested. They were developed by analyzing the educational needs and interests of the associations in conjunction with the practical implications that their needs and interests pose for TVOntario. Each option corresponds to a different educational level: (1) bilateral partnerships for specialized introductory and intermediate programs; (2) bilateral partnerships to support highly specialized and advanced subject areas; and (3) a bilateral arrangement not with the associations directly, but with a university or community college that offers the generic business courses they approve.

Interviews were conducted with 14 groups of subjects composed of four older adults and one practitioner who had all been involved in learning activities together. Participants were invited to clarify their positions about learning, working with older adults, and establishing a rapport with older learners. Two broad categories of analysis were used to identify meaningful statements: learning, and being with older learners. Four subcategories of being with older learners were identified. In the first two, the role of \"the lovable/loving person\" and the role of \"the competent person\" were stressed by the practitioners. The perspective was  reinforced with the other two subcategories: keeping in touch, and the older person as a factor in practitioner self-development. An exchange of roles by practitioners and learner was suggested. Competent practitioners were found to present themselves as engaged with the older learners in the same learning process. The role of the practitioner was also seen as being restorative. Competence and love were identified as an antidote to aging. (5 references) (YLB)",

From its inception, the organization moved rapidly to codify academic formats, operational procedures, and administrative structures for extension education based upon prevailing models found within traditional academia. At the same time, NUEA espoused a view of the field of continuing higher education that was specialized, institutionally. Therefore, NUEA excluded from membership most university-level schools, even when the continuing education programs of these institutions were comparable and, in some cases, considered superior. During the period from 1915 to 1923, standardization of practice and universality in membership were viewed as  incompatible goals for the NUEA. Impetus was thereby given to the formation of alternative organizations within continuing higher education representing other types of institutions, such as teachers' colleges.

The general directions are clear: an ever smaller share of the nation's work force is employed in the manufacturing sector; service sector industries are the source of most new jobs; and some \"high tech\" industries have had explosive growth. Unfortunately, at a time when the United States is said to be entering an era of human capital, the gap between work force supply and demand appears to be widening. There will not be enough new workers to fill projected new jobs, and, without effective action, a large percentage will not be qualified. Business and government are working separately and in concert to close the human capital gap. State and local governments are central  to making the link between economic development and human development. Local economic development practitioners are developing partnerships with local Job Training Partnership Act agencies, secondary and postsecondary institutions, private training agencies, and the private sector. Four areas of high priority for the economic development strategies of many states and localities are manufacturing modernization, high technology development, new business creation, and service sector expansion.

The program encouraged better cooperative efforts between vocational and special educators by providing an opportunity for these teachers to consult with and learn about and from one another. During the project, 40 vocational education students and 20 special education students from the University of Pittsburgh worked directly with special needs learners for a 2-week internship in a special needs service agency or vocational school. The project coordinator visited each intern, and the director of the special needs service agency or vocational school supervised them. Each intern planned, conducted, and evaluated vocational education  programs for special needs learners. Interns evaluated their teaching experience and demonstrated an increased level of confidence in their ability to work with and to teach special needs learners in vocational education and to prepare them for employment.

It is, for the most part, not a separate program area but is integrated into production units. The same instructional method for teaching environmental education is followed as for any other topic, predominantly problem solving. The agricultural teacher education program at Michigan State University contains significant amounts of emphasis on environmental education through specific courses and integrated parts of other courses. Major achievements in the incorporation of environmental education into agricultural education are: (1) curriculum revision and inservice education in teacher education; and (2) curriculum revision and Future Farmers  of America contests and awards for students. Major constraints include insufficient course offerings and local school district autonomy. Strategies for incorporating environmental education into agricultural education are active state support, leadership, expanded knowledge base of teachers, and curriculum development. Documents and activities need to be developed to support teachers and assist regional leaders.

Literacy has been defined by self-report in early Census Bureau surveys, in a competency-based approach by the Adult Performance Level project, and as &quot;the application of skills and knowledge across a variety of adult contexts&quot; by the 1985 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The NAEP definition is being used by the National Workplace Literacy Project, and it has also been adopted by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) for the 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS), which will assess a nationally representative sample of adults (ages 16 through 64) residing in private houses  and college dormitories in the 48 contiguous states. About 12,500 1-hour, one-on-one interviews will be conducted. The assessment of literacy skills is planned to last 45 minutes, during which respondents will perform simulation tasks. The remaining 15 minutes will be devoted to obtaining background information. ETS will offer states the opportunity to conduct a concomitant State Adult Literacy Survey.

Representatives of these respondent groups, plus teachers, school board members, technical college representatives, and other educators also discussed the subject at regional meetings. Analysis of the data gathered led to six overall conclusions focused on the organization, delivery, and leadership of K-12 vocational curriculum: (1) the purpose of vocational education should be preparing youth not only for employment but also for advanced and continuing education; (2) new content and  structures for vocational education are necessary; (3) most vocational education programs need more financial resources; (4) many vocational programs suffer from declining enrollments; (5) increased graduation and college admission standards take the focus of students away from vocational education; and (6) more effective leadership and staff development in vocational education are needed.

They also observed numerous expressions of local economic activity. Findings indicated the population appeared ample to support increased economic activities despite some danger of a brain drain. The natural resources and the local labor force could support increased economic activities. Community power resources alone were, however, not sufficient to bring about economic development. Public attitudes supported economic development. Although conditions of access and equity were not ideal, the general state of education in the district did not present an obstacle to economic development. Two recommendations were made: funding should be sought to initiate economic  development activities and any economic development plan should meet certain criteria, namely that planned economic activities should be labor intensive, capitalize on the current work skills of the local labor force, respect the traditional nature of the people, be based on local input, and include start-up capital from outside Dinar. Components of such a plan were identified: provision to meet the needs of women, provision to meet the employment needs of youth, and refinement of the education and training system. (YLB)",

This information was analyzed within the framework of relevant psychosocial and gerontological theory and research. The findings identified some general characteristics of the population, including cohort and occupational similarities. Three case studies explored individual experiences related to education and motivation for learning in late life. The three persons interviewed in depth are motivated by a desire to learn, to complete their education, and to make sense out of older age. These individual stories reflect a diversity of motivations within the population. The study concluded that since the quality of life for older  persons can be greatly enhanced through participation in education, adult education researchers should explore the meaning of education for this growing population.

Defining commuting students as older than 24 and living at some distance away from the college they attend, a survey was conducted among commuting students at a university. Preliminary interviews were conducted with commuting students to draft a list of questions for a data-gathering instrument. Following a pilot test, the survey instrument was finalized. A commuter population was identified and respondents volunteered to complete the instrument, which asked questions about what they do while commuting. Results of the study indicated that commuters were pragmatic and realistic about their expectations and activities. Those surveyed were mostly  female and seeking masters degrees. Most commuted alone because it was more convenient, most drove more than 51 miles round trip, and some said they occasionally tried to recruit others for the ride. Activities the respondents did while commuting included providing encouragement, sharing problems, and brainstorming if they commuted with others. They also listened to radio and arranged other meetings. They rated as not helpful during commuting reading, using instructional materials, and using educational tapes. The study concluded that further investigation should be made of students' commuting time, with a view to increasing their use of educational technology, such as tapes, during that time. (KC)",

While the variables identified in this 60-year study started by Lewis Terman in 1921 are provocative, one must ask whether the predictors identified as meaningful for the Terman women would apply to a group of contemporary women. This study compared responses of 485 contemporary women with the responses of the Terman women to a host of questions covering their aspirations, educational and occupational achievement, satisfaction with life, personal adjustment, and their childhood families. Of the contemporary women, 306 were identified as gifted and 179 were identified as being of normal intelligence. Comparisons were made between the Terman  gifted women and the contemporary gifted women, between the gifted contemporary women and the normal contemporary women, and between the Terman women who attended college in the 1930s and contemporary women who attended college in the 1960s. Contemporary women, not surprisingly, had surpassed the Terman women in educational and occupational achievements. Despite these clear gains, the contemporary women reported significantly lower levels of satisfaction in all spheres of their lives. (Author/NB)",

There is little information on young adult black males, who may be at increased risk, since blacks in this country are contracting Acquired Immune Disease Syndrome (AIDS) at a rate higher than their proportion of the population. This study examined sexual behavior of a sample of heterosexual, sexually active, young adult, black male community college students (N=94), including condom use, length of time sexually active, number of sexual partners, sexual knowledge, and AIDS knowledge. The sample represented a lower middle class, upwardly mobile group. Subjects were  knowledgeable about AIDS and generally knew that condoms could protect them from a virus. They were sexually active, although their activity varied a great deal. Knowledge about AIDS and about sexual physiology were not related to concerns about contracting AIDS or to condom use for this sample, nor were high risk behaviors or amount of sexual activity. The young men in this sample did not increase condom use as a result of learning about AIDS. Findings suggest that education about AIDS and condom use is not leading to desired changes in behavior.

While there are obvious demographic, cultural, and economic differences among the five cases, certain clear  lessons may be drawn from them, notably that: (1) while the various examples of union programs and services and community-based efforts suggest that much is happening at the community level for retirees and older adults, the identification of needs and concerns suggest that more can be done; (2) although the range of programs and services available to retirees is encouraging, concern stems from the realization that much of what is available in the communities focuses on the most needy or frail in the older population; and (3) opportunities need to be expanded so that the largest possible population of older adults in a community could take advantage of the widest array of programs and services.

It was written in response to a Congressional request for development of a national plan delineating how the National Institute for Mental Health would expand basic, clinical, and services research in the area of child mental health, and also describing how the critical shortage of manpower can be addressed. These topics are discussed: (1) dimensions of mental disorders among children and adolescents; (2) causes and determinants of mental disorders; (3) interventions for child and adolescent mental disorders; (4) service delivery and systems of care; (5) the problems and needs in the field of child and adolescent mental health research and suggestions to assure that a strong  research infrastructure will permit continued rapid advances; (6) research dissemination and advocacy for child and adolescent mental health; and (7) National Institute for Mental Health budget and administrative recommendations.

        "author":["Harley, David A."],
        "description":"Relatively little empirical research has been done on the supervisory referral of employees to employee assistance programs (EAPs). Inclusion of constructive confrontation (supervisory referral) into program standards and its continued promotion as a &quot;central strategy&quot; of program theory and operation calls for critical investigation of supervisors' referral behavior, factors affecting their use of the strategy, and its effectiveness with the referred employees. This study examined two factors found to influence referral action--job performance and occurrence of a critical incident at the worksite which can serve as a &quot;trigger event&quot; for the supervisor. Supervisors (N=415) at 25 sites from 7 organizations responded to a survey regarding their referral behavior. Both impaired job  performance and critical incidents were found to have significant relationships to the EAP referral handling of a specific &quot;job problems&quot; employee. Reported occurrence of a dramatic worksite incident accounted for about eight times as much of the observed referral index variance as did the job performance (impairment) scale. A nonsignificant trend was noted that the more &quot;public&quot; the incident, the greater the referral action taken. About one-half of the respondent supervisors were found to have taken no referral action whatever with their &quot;job problems&quot; subordinate. These findings raise questions about supervisors' perceptions of EAPs and their motivations in referral. More research into referral dynamics is needed if EAPs are to achieve their potential to help workers and their host  organizations. (Author)",

This study was conducted to evaluate an assessment center which was part of a management development program for state government employees. The study examined: (1) whether assessment center feedback is accepted and acted on by participants; (2) whether this feedback improves managerial performance; and (3) the utility of assessment centers for career development. Participants (N=102) were middle-managers in state government who took part in an assessment center program. The findings revealed that participants appeared to accept and act upon the assessment feedback they received. Poor performers followed the assessment  center's recommendations to the same extent as did high performers, and the participants believed they could improve their managerial performance by following the recommendations. After receiving feedback, participants were able to improve their performance on a measure of managerial effectiveness. Utility analysis indicated that the gain in productivity from the assessment far outweighed the costs. (Author/NB)",

This study was undertaken to assess this parenting behavior and how it relates to the child's symptomatology based on both parent's and child's report, and to probe the degree of inconsistency between the parent's and the child's reports. Participants were 190 children of divorce between the ages of 8 and 15 years, and their custodial parents, 185 of whom were mothers. Parents and children completed separate in-home interviews in which they reported on parenting behavior and child's psychopathology. The findings revealed that the correlations between parent's and child's reports of  parallel constructs were all significant. Furthermore, the correlations between parenting behavior and child symptomatology based on the same informants were significantly higher than those based on different informants. The relationships between parenting and child symptomatology were higher for boys than for girls in the sample. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"While public opinion associates old age with loneliness, some social scientists argue that emotional responses such as loneliness decline in the later years of life. The purpose of this study was to empirically examine life cycle fluctuations in loneliness. To do so, a meta-analysis of 14 data sets involving over 25,000 respondents was performed. The results showed that loneliness was highest among young adults, declined over midlife, and increased modestly in old age. Methodological cautions are advised in interpreting these findings. Three possible types of explanations for age trends in loneliness include methodological artifacts, analysis of the high or low level of loneliness in specific age groups, and general models of loneliness which incorporate age-related factors. With  regard to methodological factors, the possibility of differential volunteering rates exists, as does the question of measurement equivalence across age groups. With regard to age specific explanations, some authors have offered analyses of why adolescents are so prone to loneliness (separation from parents, identity diffusion, excessive rejection). Others have claimed that the declining social ties of the elderly make them susceptible to loneliness. Finally, a model of loneliness has been proposed that uses a single primary factor to explain fluctuations in loneliness in which loneliness results when there is a discrepancy between people's desired and achieved levels of contact.

        "description":"This curriculum model has been developed by the United States Department of Education to provide a flexible framework for classroom-based drug abuse prevention efforts from kindergarten through grade 12. An introductory chapter discusses the role of prevention, how to use the curriculum model, identifying students at risk for drug use, and integrating curricula and materials. It also provides guideline for curriculum presentation and evaluation. Thereafter, the curriculum model is divided into four grade clusters: K-3, 4-6, 7-8, and 9-12, and each grade cluster is treated in four sections: (1) a background for teachers discussing children's developmental stages and including information on children's beliefs, behaviors, and susceptibilities to using drugs; (2) suggestions for  working with parents to keep them informed about what their children are learning in class; (3) suggestions for working with the community to create awareness and support for the schools' prevention efforts; and (4) lesson plans and activities. Each lesson plan specifies a learning objective, background activities with directions for presentation, needed resources, and teacher tips, all geared to a specific grade level range and subject area. Some lesson plans are accompanied by activity pages that may be reproduced for classroom use. The curriculum model also includes information on drugs and their effects and a list of resources for information and for further curriculum development. (TE)",

However, the counseling psychology specialty historically has shown little concerted interest in consultation. Consequently, counseling psychologists have approached consultation through the conceptual lenses of their training and experience in counseling, psychotherapy, and teaching. As a result, much consultation is delivered by practitioners using models and skills from related areas, but not directly from concepts in the consultation literature. The human-development consultation system is divided into four basic premises: (1) it is a cyclical, collaborative problem-solving process; (2) it is administered to a consultee or consultee system to advance role effectiveness so that the client is served more  proficiently; (3) organizational settings provide the greatest potential to maximize broad human development and prevention goals; and (4) long-term consultations afford the best opportunity for providing enduring change in organizations. The future of consultation in counseling psychology practice is equivocal, at best, although some current signs appear promising. While definitions of consultation exist, conceptual clarity and excellent, detailed examples are in short supply. (ABL)",

Subsequently, 79 of those people participated in a laboratory procedure in which they provided evaluations of specific same-sex and opposite-sex targets presented to them in pictorial form. The results suggest that satisfaction with a relationship and  interest in alternatives to that relationship are substantially (and negatively) interrelated.

        "description":"The decision whether a woman has consented to sexual intercourse is rarely determined by the woman herself. Often, instead, a woman's consent, and ultimately her sexuality, is determined for her by others--her partner, the community, or the court system. Women in this culture have traditionally had very little power to control their own bodies and their own sexuality, ironically, while held responsible for its consequences. In the examination of rape and its treatment by the legal system, the woman's voice is drowned out and lost. Female consent has been defined traditionally from the male perspective. Sexual scripts create a prototype of the consenting female. The prototype consists of a cluster of attributes and behaviors indicative of willingness to engage in sexual  intercourse. Traditional views render nonconsent virtually impossible. Without evidence of nonconsent, there can be no crime, and the problem of acquaintance rape becomes trivialized--it is really \"just sex.\" A feminist alternative argues that rape must be viewed from the woman's point of view. Women desire sex based on mutual attraction, that involves minimal pressure and two-way communication about each partner's desire. A feminist perspective also suggests that a woman has the right to be sexually provocative. Finally, male-female interactions in general, and the dating situation in particular, must be reconceptualized; relationships should be based on mutual respect and trust. (ABL)",

Further, changes in the frequencies of their high level developmental responses between the pre- and post-training questionnaires are significantly greater than their peers'.

The first study involved 69 male and 75 female subjects, randomly assigned to four conditions receiving different information about AIDS. Subjects initially completed the Attitudes Toward Gay Men scale and a scale developed to assess beliefs about the potential spread of AIDS through casual contact (the Belief scale). The second study was similar to the first, although it examined the efficacy of the different types of communications over a longer period of time, and without the potential priming effects that could result from the initial measure of beliefs. The  results of the two studies point out a distinction between affecting people's beliefs about the spread of AIDS and affecting related prejudices. Although the information manipulations had an impact on the specific beliefs related to the information, they did not appear to affect attitudes toward homosexual men. This distinction occurred despite the strong relation between initial AIDS-related beliefs and attitudes toward homosexual men found in the first study. The findings suggest that efforts to educate the public about AIDS, although important in their own right, cannot be regarded as a substitute for efforts to reduce antigay prejudice. (NB)",

The second comparison group consisted of 92 nonalcoholic women selected randomly from households in the general population. Face-to-face interviews were administered to all three samples.

Childhood sexual abuse was defined as sexual contact before age 18 with someone at least 5 years older and/or sexual contact involving a relative. Alcoholic women were significantly more likely to have  experienced father-to-daughter physical violence and verbal aggression than either nonalcoholics in treatment or in the general population. Alcoholic women were more likely to have experienced mother-to-daughter physical violence and verbal aggression as compared to the general population but not as compared to the nonalcoholic treatment group. Alcoholic women were also more likely than either of the comparison groups to have experienced each of three forms of childhood sexual abuse: exposure/invitation, touching/fondling, and intercourse. Finally, alcoholic women were more likely than the general population to have experienced both physical and sexual abuse. Women's descriptive accounts suggest that victimization experiences lead to negative feelings about themselves and their lives,  including lack of control, setting the stage for substance abuse as a coping strategy.

        "description":"This study examined the relationships between alcohol abuse and spousal violence for 96 women in alcoholism treatment as compared to these comparison groups: 78 women receiving mental health treatment; 98 women receiving services for family violence; 91 women from a random sample of households; and 100 women in a driver education program following arrest for driving while intoxicated (DWI), 41 of whom were classified as alcoholics. Respondents completed face-to-face interviews that included both structured and open-ended questions. Adult alcohol use was measured by questions on quantity-frequency of use and the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. Based on the Conflict Tactics Scale, verbal aggression, moderate violence, and severe violence were measured. The findings indicated  that women in alcoholism treatment reported high levels of spousal violence when compared to women in the general population, women in mental health treatment, and DWI women. Levels of spousal violence were not as high for women in alcoholism treatment as were levels found in battered women receiving treatment for family violence. Regression analyses suggest that although alcoholism predicts spousal violence, spousal violence does not predict alcoholism. Despite some support for the relationship between spousal violence and women's alcohol problems, alcoholism does not appear to explain much of the variance in spousal violence. (NB)",

        "description":"The role of social support in moderating the impact of childhood sexual abuse on adult psychological adjustment was examined. Women were drawn from three clinical samples (women in treatment for alcoholism, for being battered, or for mental health treatment) and two nonclinical sources (women arrested for driving while intoxicated and a random sample). Subjects completed face-to-face interviews that included both structured and open-ended questions. Subjects also completed the Symptom Checklist-90 to assess general psychiatric symptomatology, the Janis Self-Esteem Scale to measure self-esteem, and the Trauma Symptom Checklist to measure post sexual abuse trauma and dissociation. Of the 477 subjects, 238 had been sexually abused as children. Sixty-eight percent of the women in  alcoholism treatment, 62% of the battered women, and 63% of the women in mental health treatment reported being sexually abused as children compared to 21% in the driving while intoxicated group and 39% in the random sample. Sexually abused women in the nonclinical samples who perceived others' responses to be supportive exhibited more positive adult adjustment scores than did women who did not perceive others to be supportive. Psychological adjustment of the socially supported nonclinical women did not differ from that of nonclinical women who had not been abused. Among clinical women, childhood sexual abuse was associated with poorer adult adjustment; however, there was little evidence that social support ameliorated the negative effects of sexual abuse.

        "description":"Relationships among perceived stress, trait anger (general propensity to become angry), modes of anger expression, and health status were examined in a sample of 720 college students, using Caplan's conceptualization of stress as the study's framework. Propensity toward anger was assessed by the 10-item form of the Trait Anger Scale (Spielberger et al.), modes of anger expression were assessed by the Framingham Anger Scales, perceived stress was operationalized by the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, and Mermelstein), and current health status was assessed by Ware's 9-item Current Health Scale. As hypothesized, stress was a positive correlate of trait anger and all four modes of anger expression. To clarify the relative contributions of anger and stress to the variance in  current health status, stepwise regression analyses were used. Trait anger, anger-in and anger-out failed to meet inclusion criteria. The final model explained 14% of the variance in health status with three variables: perceived stress, anger-discuss, and anger symptoms. Thus, trait anger was not as important to health as were the modes chosen to express anger after its arousal by stressful events. Discussion of anger appeared to be a health-promoting expression mode, while expressing anger through somatic symptoms was inversely related to health. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"While previous studies investigating sex differences in the growth of academic abilities have been inconsistent in their conclusions, sex differences have often been reported, particularly in the areas of verbal and mathematical achievement. Results from several longitudinal studies have suggested that these measured differences in achievement are negligible at the elementary school level but are significant thereafter. The objective of the current investigation was to examine the possibility of sex differences with respect to true-score achievement in the verbal and mathematics domains over time, employing a longitudinal model for achievement which included both a covariance structure and a mean structure. The data were taken from the Growth Study at Educational Testing Service.  Four measures of verbal achievement and two measures of quantitative achievement were examined at four time periods in consecutive 2-year intervals for 1,433 boys and 1,594 girls from grades 5 to 11. The analysis indicated that there were only slight differences in latent variable achievement means on verbal measures, but widening differences on quantitative measures. The means indicated that boys' mathematical skills increased faster than girls' skills from grades 5 to 11. The results do not support the contention that sex differences exist with respect to verbal achievement, but do support the notions that sex differences exist in the mathematics domain and that these differences are increasingly divergent across time.

Sixty couples with an alcoholic husband, after participating in 10 weekly BMT couples group sessions, were assigned randomly to receive or not receive 15 additional conjoint couples RP sessions over the next 12 months. A multidimensional battery of marital, sexual, drinking, and related outcome measures was collected before and after the BMT group and at quarterly intervals for 2.5 years after the BMT group. This provided ongoing assessment during the 12 months when one-half of the couples were getting RP sessions and 18 months follow-up data after the RP  sessions ended. Results from 12-month follow-up data for one-half of the sample showed that significant improvements in male alcoholics' marital and drinking outcomes occurred from before to after the BMT couples groups. Alcoholics who received RP after BMT maintained their improved marriages better, used behaviors targeted by BMT more, and showed a trend toward less drinking. Further, alcoholics with more severe alcohol and marital problems, who did not receive RP, deteriorated at a faster rate in the months after BMT ended than did their counterparts who did receive RP.

Husbands' severe violence, however, did not decrease  significantly and the prevalence rate, although reduced by one-half, was still significantly elevated relative to national norms. Wife-to-husband violence after BMT was significantly decreased in prevalence or frequency and no longer significantly elevated relative to national norms for indices of overall, moderate, and severe violence, except for the specific act of threatening with a knife or gun, the prevalence of which did not change after BMT, but remained significantly higher than national norms.

The cognitive-behavioral group training approach equips students with specific social skills to use in situations of interpersonal conflict. The PACT program has been implemented with students between 12 and 15 years of age in cooperation with an urban school system. Participants were selected by teachers on the basis of skill deficiencies in relating to peers, behavior problems (particularly aggression), and/or history of victimization by violence. Twenty-eight students have completed the training and an additional 37 are currently  being trained. The PACT project appears to be a viable and effective way to reduce the potential for violence in African American middle school youth. Students who completed the training were rated by both teachers and trainers as showing improvement in the target skill areas as measured by pre-to-post observation of behavior. Also, participants completing the program demonstrated reduced negative behavior such as suspensions or expulsions related to violent behavior in comparison to a closely matched group of untrained students.

It notes that the life expectancy and longevity of American Indians remains below that of the general U.S. population; that Title VI of the Older Americans Act was designed to provide support services to older American Indians living on reservations, but that nearly half of American Indians over age 25 live not on reservations, but in cities; and that the older Indian urban population should be served by Title III programs. Examples are given  that illustrate why chronological age is not a clear indicator of health status in American Indians. Socioeconomic and health profiles of older urban American Indians are given. A small study on nutrition of urban elders is reported that shows that, although elderly urban American Indians do not suffer from malnutrition as their reservation peers do, they have below the recommended levels in total food energy, vitamin A, and calcium intakes. A low utilization of mental health services among elderly American Indians is discussed, and support services needed by urban American Indians are considered. Problems and solutions in providing services to this population are presented. Several relevant data tables are included. (NB)",

Small group interaction; student attitudes toward school; student perceptions of the classroom environment; student attitudes and beliefs about learning and cooperative learning; student social attitudes, skills and values; peer relations; social adjustment; self-esteem;  intrinsic motivation; and academic achievement were measured through a variety of methods and questionnaires. The findings revealed that students in all classes in all three districts had had at least some experience with small group learning, and that the effects of cooperative learning on students' academic and social development were a function of the quality of the group interaction. These results demonstrate the importance of directly examining interaction processes within groups to improve understanding of the effects of cooperative learning, as well as to help to ensure that cooperative learning is used effectively in classrooms.

School faculty and staff are trained to identify and refer students whose personal and/or academic behaviors change in a problematic way. Once identified, the students are provided special services which include referral to community agencies for additional help. Pennsylvania initiated intensive training of SAP teams to coordinate secondary school SAPs in 1984. SAP teams are currently represented in almost every senior high school across the state. An evaluation was conducted on the first 69 teams trained between 1986 and 1988, assessing perceptions of SAP training, SAP implementation, and school-wide SAP impact on student behavior. Separate surveys were completed by SAP  coordinators, core team members, and non-core team members. The results indicated that one-half of the coordinators were school administrators. The problems most frequently called to the attention of SAP teams included substance abuse, poor grades, depression, and discipline. Teachers were the primary source of referrals. In general, the core team members rated their training very highly. Training and implementation of SAPs reportedly has run smoothly for most schools and there was a perception among respondents that SAPs had a positive impact on students. This report presents findings from the evaluation, including a results section with 47 data tables; a description of the school-wide impact analysis; references; and appendices of survey instruments and relevant materials.

Five modifiable factors found to be significantly associated with children's post-divorce adjustment were identified: (1) quality of the custodial parent-child relationship; (2) discipline strategies; (3) negative divorce-related events; (4) contact with the noncustodial parent; and (5) contact with and support from non-parental adults. Multiple strategies were used to change these factors in 11 group sessions and 2 individual sessions of the program. The groups consisted  of five to eight custodial or primary residential mothers and were led by two of eight graduate students in clinical or community psychology. Measures of the putative mediators and of children's adjustment were obtained from both mothers and children pre- and post-intervention. A randomized experimental versus wait list control design was used to evaluate the program. At posttest, families in the intervention group reported better functioning than did families in the control group. The results suggest that the program was clearly effective in enhancing the quality of the mother-child relationship and in decreasing negative divorce related events. Positive program effects on discipline occurred for mothers' reports. Expected changes in father-child contact and support from non-parental  adults did not occur. (NB)",

Perceived social support from the extended family was measured by a modified version of the Perceived Social Support--Family scale, perceived spouse support was measured by a modified version of the Perceived Social Support--Family scale, and perceived friend support was measured by the  Perceived Social Support--Friends scale. The five aspects of psychological health investigated were measured using scales of the Profile of Mood States: Depression (depression-dejection scale); Tension (tension-anxiety scale); Irritability (anger-hostility scale); Fatigue (fatigue-inertia scale; and Well-Being (vigor-activity scale). Sociodemographic information was collected through a Personal Data Questionnaire. Canonical correlation analysis revealed that 26% of the variation in distress and well-being was accounted for by a composite of perceived social support strongly related to spouse support and moderately related to extended family support. Surprisingly, friend support was unrelated to the psychological variables. The relation found was not influenced by a range of  sociodemographic variables. (Author/NB)",

Research has focused on a longitudinal cohort of children that entered three program schools in kindergarten in the fall of 1982, and completed sixth grade in the spring of 1989. A corresponding cohort of children that attended three other elementary schools in the same district has served as a comparison group. Data were collected from cohort students at all six schools at third and fourth grades, from students at two schools at fifth grade, and from students at four schools at sixth grade. Overall, 236 comparison and 285 program students participated in the research. Data revealed that  program students were more accepting of (and more accepted by) their classmates, were less lonely, and were lower in social anxiety than were students at comparison schools. No differences were found between program and comparison students on measures of self-esteem, liking for school, perceived social competence, or perceived popularity. The observed positive effects on peer relations and social adjustment support and extend earlier findings indicating that the program has had positive effects on students' interpersonal behavior in the classroom, social problem solving skills, and commitment to democratic values. Collectively, these studies suggest that the program has consistent positive effects on children's social development throughout the elementary school years.  (Author/NB)",

The results provide further confirmation of the independence of ESC  and MSC and for the invariance of the structure of self-concept across gender, at least for adolescents.

        "description":"Although there has been much research on the link between femininity and female appearance, body image, and eating disorders, there has been little research with respect to the behavior of eating itself. Recent literature has indicated that an individual's perception of a women can be affected by the amount of food that the woman is perceived as eating. This study explored the relationship between meal size and perceptions of a woman by asking 97 college students to give their impressions of a female student who was seen via a television monitor eating one of four meals. Meals were varied in terms of both amount and gender connotations. Four questionnaires were used in the study: a questionnaire focusing participants' attention on the meal without revealing the meal's importance  in the study; an adaptation of the Bem Sex Role Inventory designed to measure the viewer's impression of the woman's sex-typed characteristics; a Social Appeal Scale used to evaluate how much the participants liked the target woman; and a five-point Likert-type scale measuring aspects of the woman's attractiveness. The results showed that meal size significantly affected ratings of the woman's social appeal, physical attractiveness, and expressive traits, but not ratings of her instrumental traits. Thus, eating lightly appears to be socially advantageous for a woman. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"An intervention to prepare children for pretrial interviews and testimony was tested. The goal of the intervention was to increase the completeness of young children's eyewitness accounts because their free recall is typically less complete than that of older children or adults. Seven- and 10-year-old children (N=132) were randomly assigned, within age groups, to one of three treatment conditions: (1) training with retrieval strategies using schema based categories and visual cues with practice, feedback, and self-monitoring; (2) instructions to be complete, but no strategy training; and (3) a control group receiving no instructions and no strategy training. The children participated in a staged event followed, 2 weeks later, by a 30 minute, individual training or control  session. One day later, there was a booster session after which they were interviewed about the event with free and cued recall tasks. The results validated the assumption that the completeness of children's eyewitness accounts can be enhanced without the risk of an increased rate of error. Moreover, instructing children in this age range to be more complete was not effective. (A discussion focuses on implications for the forensic context, limits on generalization, and directions for future research.) (Author)",

        "description":"People's beliefs about the origins of their health, sometimes referred to as health locus of control, have been shown to influence a variety of important behaviors, including the propensity to engage in effective health maintenance activities, and the willingness to seek and follow medical advice. The purpose of this study was to explore the nature of health locus of control beliefs of children and to examine the construct validity of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scales (MHLC). The subjects constituted two discrete samples of children in grades four, five, and six. The first sample (N=914) completed the MHLC Scales with simplified sentence structure for some items to improve the usability of the measure with this age group. The second sample (N=390) completed the  same modified version of the MHLC Scales and an additional six items from a second measure. Confirmatory maximum-likelihood factor analyses were conducted, and a confirmatory factor analytic analog to analysis of variance was illustrated. Results were generally supportive of the validity of data collected using the MHLC Scales, though some additional item revisions are suggested. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"While the relationships between health behavior and health status and between health status and perceived quality of life have received some attention, the association between health behaviors and quality of life has not been determined. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effects of health behaviors on quality of life that are independent of health status. A sample of approximately 5,000 randomly selected United States Navy personnel was split into halves and analyses performed on each to establish the replicability of the findings. At step one of a multiple regression procedure, health status variables were forced into the equation; next, health behavior variables were entered. As expected, the block of health status variables was significantly related to  quality of life: self-assessed health and fitness status and lower reporting of physical symptoms accounted for 16% and 18% of the variance in quality of life for the two subsamples. After controlling for health status, two behavioral measures made unique contributions to the prediction of quality of life: behaviors related to avoiding unnecessary risks as a driver or pedestrian and avoiding or minimizing accidents. Wellness maintenance behaviors also were associated with quality of life in one subsample. After controlling for health status, health behavior measures contributed an additional 11% and 6% of the explained variance in quality of life for the two subsamples. The results suggest that health behaviors influence quality of life independently of health status. (Author)",

        "description":"A vast amount of reading comprehension research was reported in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. The study reported in this paper used the basal reading programs considered by California for adoption in 1988 as a vehicle for examining how the comprehension research had affected basal materials. Five series that were completely new and that had been issued by influential publishers were chosen for study, and two topics were selected for attention: main idea and story structure. Results revealed that the five series did not turn out to be as different from their predecessors as they appeared to be at first. Four of the five series examined use expository and narrative text indiscriminately when they teach and review main ideas. As a result, the conception of &quot;main idea&quot;  that the four series foster is neither clear nor consistent. The series are similar to older programs except that they cover many more topics. Results also showed that all five series teach the components of stories early; and much of what they teach is covered quickly. Additionally, the four series that use narrative text for main idea instruction never relate what is done with stories in the manual sections to what is taught in other sections labeled &quot;story structure.&quot; Finally, examination also revealed that expository texts are often referred to as &quot;stories,&quot; even though all five series teach and frequently review the nature of &quot;story.&quot; Findings suggest that manual segments dealing with main idea and story structure need to be improved.

        "description":"Educators must accept the challenge of encouraging the lifetime reading habit in school. Students who are surrounded with books, newspapers, magazines, and other materials will be tempted to browse and to read from these sources. When selecting materials for the classroom, educators should work closely with the library media specialist who is usually aware of a wide variety of materials that are well-matched with students' interests and needs. This positive experience with reading builds independence and self-esteem, both of which are important for creating lifelong readers. After educators clutter the classroom with reading materials, they must give students the opportunity to read for pleasure in the classroom. By providing them with time to read in school, educators are  sending students a message that lifetime literacy is a major instructional activity. A language arts educator should also be concerned with promoting and supporting the value of lifetime literacy across the curriculum. One way of supporting this challenge is to guide content area colleagues to include independent reading in their classroom for sustained blocks of time. The reading habit should be encouraged throughout the school year through methods such as reading aloud, booktalks, pairing young adult literature with traditional literature, and pairing of authors who are similar in their writing styles or themes. (A model of a student's yearlong schedule that includes independent reading is included, and 17 references are attached.) (MG)",

        "description":"A review of the literature on the use of the computer in teaching reading included studies that centered on basic reading skills and studies that, for the most part, supported the use of computer assisted instruction (CAI) to assist in developing these skills. The research indicated that CAI in reading is effective for a wide variety of reading skills and concept areas. Many researchers believed and produced evidence that the computer has already begun to bring students great benefits, such as better, more comfortable and faster learning of basic reading skills. CAI has been effective in raising reading achievement, especially when used to supplement regular teacher-presented instruction, and has produced a decided advantage in reducing the time taken to learn. Some investigators  believed computers were more effective with younger students. The research dealt with diverse age levels, and varied from the intellectually handicapped to the gifted and talented. CAI has had a positive effect on student and teacher attitudes and motivation. A few research studies found no advantage in using CAI to increase student achievement since scores on post-tests were no better than those which involved only traditional methods. However, even those studies suggested that there were other advantages, such as student motivation, saving of teachers' time, savings of students' learning time, and opportunities for increased practice and reteaching. The computer is limited in its ability to contribute to this literacy only by man's capabilities and imagination. Thirty-four references  are attached. (MG)",

Students need to be provided with problem solving lessons in meaningful learning contexts for critical thinking to take place. In order for schema construction to occur, a framework needs to be provided that helps readers to elaborate upon new facts and ideas and to clarify their significance or relevance. A 6-week interdisciplinary project with ninth-grade students enrolled in Gallatin High School (Tennessee), located in a rural community where industry and agriculture are primary sources of revenue, was implemented. Cases were developed to help students reason about multiple major concepts expressed in Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and to help students apply these  concepts to other contexts and subject areas. Each case was unique because different reading, research, and writing skills were needed to problem solve and complete the tack of the particular case. The teacher and her students became active participants in the learning process by creating an environment that was mutually adaptable rather than arbitrary and teacher dominated. Case-based instruction and learning provides students with a forum for taking an active role in structuring and creating their own meaning.

According to formal testing, Debbie was functioning in the moderately handicapped range of ability, and her speech and language skills were commensurate with her ability. Debbie participated in a variety of reading and writing activities throughout the year, including: individual reading class, group reading activities, independent reading, group writing activities, independent writing, group spelling class and four thematic units of study. Four data collection procedures were used to document changes in Debbie's reading and writing over the school year: 2  reading miscue inventories, 14 running records of her reading, samples of Debbie's writing throughout the year, and a retelling of stories before and after the thematic unit. Comparative results indicated that Debbie did change and grow as a reader and writer, a fact that clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of whole language learning to promote language learning and literacy growth of special needs students.

        "description":"Collaborative learning strategies can improve the learning of subject matter in content area classrooms, but they are only one aspect among many that influence how much learning will take place in a class period. The Directed Reading-Thinking Activity (DR-TA) is an effective teaching/learning strategy to use with content area material. Much of the effectiveness of the DR-TA has to do with teachers getting students to predict what is coming up next. The amount of learning and attention will increase in the classroom when the teacher deliberately gets students to communicate with other students (in groups of four or five) to make meaning and then has each group share that meaning with the rest of the class. A jigsaw strategy can also be used to enhance the understanding of subject  matter in various content areas. A modified jigsaw strategy has been used in the Kansas City, Missouri, School District's Comprehension and Cognitive Development Program which enables students to make meaning using three or four different pieces of text which deal with the same subject matter. Combining the use of cooperative learning groups with strategies such as the DR-TA can facilitate the learning of narrative material, and using a strategy such as the modified jigsaw can enhance the learning of non-narrative or expository material.

The T/LC operates under the umbrella of the Instructional Services Unit in a three-way program which includes a Technical Assistance Center and a Learning Resource Center. Preservice teachers engage in &quot;hands-on&quot; teaching/tutoring activities; computer managed instruction; planning and implementing instruction; preparing test items and giving diagnostic tests; and preparing alternative modes of  instruction. As an extension of this tutoring program, the T/LC began a trial outreach program in the fall of 1990 for 79 &quot;at-risk&quot; students at a local elementary school. This special program targets economically disadvantaged students who cannot travel to the university site. If successful, this outreach program may be expanded to include additional public school sites. The overall impact of the T/LC has been to reduce the drop-out rate, increase students' test performance scores, and strengthen preservice teachers' teaching competencies.

The basic research question was: Do proportionately more students entering Brenau with combined SAT scores at or above 800 persist to graduation at Brenau as compared to students entering with combined SATs below 800? The subjects were entering freshmen during the fall quarter for each of the years 1980 through 1983. The findings of the study revealed a statistically significant difference in graduation rate with proportionately more students entering with SAT composite scores at or above 800 persisting to graduation. However, the results were considered in relation to the data  showing 51% of students admitted as freshmen during the years under study achieved less than 800 on the SAT, and 45% of freshmen who graduated in those classes came from the &quot;below 800&quot; SAT category. Recommendations included the following: (1) develop a study skills course for entering freshmen; (2) conduct faculty workshops encouraging teaching strategies and program planning to support the students enrolled; and (3) adjust in admission and recruiting strategies to emphasize Brenau's academic support system.

A total of 105 responses (78%) was received, composed of 60 research and 45 doctorate-granting universities. While it was found that strategic planning is a major topic on university campuses today, environmental scanning is presently implemented at barely over half of public research and doctorate-granting institutions. No significant difference was found in the amount of time spent scanning between research institutions and doctorate-granting institutions. Also, there was no  significant difference found to exist between public research and doctorate-granting institutions as to which areas of the environment are important to scan, whether formally or informally. Although not significant, informal scanners at doctorate-granting institutions spend a larger percentage of time scanning the educational/competitive organizations area than do their counterparts at research institutions. Additionally, there was no correlation between the length of time universities have employed environmental scanning and their satisfaction with the process. Currently, the dissemination of environmental scanning information at public research and doctorate-granting universities is low. The survey form is appended. The document contains 32 references.

Specifically, the study sought to: (1) describe the opinions of academic faculty members of Division 1-A schools toward athletes; and (2) determine if a relationship exists between these faculty opinions and the quality of academic support student athletes receive at their respective institutions. Also, the study attempted to investigate the frequency and types of attempts to influence students athletes' grades. Eighteen institutions were selected and 1,350 faculty were given a 46-item questionnaire to assess their opinions; response  rates ranged from 29% to 71%. The results showed that faculty largely rejected a major role in the academic welfare of athletes and were resolute in resisting pressure to provide special academic benefits.

        "description":"The monograph examines the literature of the last decade on the rise and role of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) in higher education, business, and health care and reports results of a 1989 survey of higher education CIOs. After a discussion of the origins of the CIO position and concept, chapter 2 presents a survey of the literature, primarily since 1985. Noted are the large number of perspective pieces, the relatively few surveys of CIOs, and the lack of differentiation between CIO title and function. The findings of the survey of CIOs (N=58) in higher education are reported in terms of the CIO profile; CIO organizations; CIO functions, characteristics, and activities; CIO salaries; trends and issues; and other findings. Notable findings included: self-reported management  styles tend to be similar and people-oriented; individuals in the position are relatively happy; CIOs see strategic planning for information technology as part of their role; there was little mention of evaluation activities by CIOs. The fourth chapter presents conclusions comparing survey findings with the literature and offering personal observations. Approximately 150 references are included. The CIO survey questionnaire and results and a profile of the study's corporate sponsor are included. (DB)",

        "description":"Much of the literature in general education is focused on the design or the contents of education programs, or the \"supply side,\" while little attention has been given to students' understandings of and attitudes toward general education, the \"demand side.\" This paper reviews literature on the \"demand side\" of general education by first providing a brief synopsis of the notion of general education and recent recommendations for reform, and next summarizing research on student knowledge of and attitudes toward higher education and general education. The paper also considers processes used in higher education to affect demand side questions, including teaching, recruitment and admissions, orientation, academic and career advising, and course scheduling. Three primary strategies for  data collection were used: (1) a national advisory group was identified whose members contributed to a pool of information on student perceptions of general education; (2) a network of more than 25 educational leaders was contacted for information and opinions; and (3) a literature search was undertaken. Appendixes list members of the advisory group and names of education leaders consulted, as well as providing information on the research methodology; and 77 references are included. (JDD)",

        "description":"This statement of the Director of Education and Employment Issues of the General Accounting Office's Human Resources Division discusses how the Stafford Student Loan program works, the growth in loans guaranteed and defaulted, and the concerns surrounding the financial problems being experienced by the Higher Education Assistance Foundation (HEAF). The Stafford program consists of Stafford loans, Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students, and Supplemental Loans for Students, which together represent 61% of federal student aid for postsecondary education made available in fiscal year 1990. The program involves five parties: students; schools; lenders; guaranty agencies; and the Department of Education. The amount of new loans guaranteed increased 83% from 1983 to 1989, while  defaults increased 352% from $444 million to $2 billion. Default costs (payments to guaranty agencies) have risen from about 10% of total program costs in fiscal year 1980 to 36% in 1989. HEAF is the largest guarantor in the Stafford program and the biggest payer of default claims to lenders. Risks faced by lenders, the Student Loan Marketing Association, and the federal government if HEAF becomes insolvent are noted. A flow chart depicts the life of a Stafford loan. (JDD)",

The objectives of such a system are to detect social, scientific, economic, technical, and political interactions important to the organization; define potential threats and opportunities from these developments; promote a future orientation in management and staff; and alert management and staff to trends which are converging, diverging, speeding up, slowing down, or interacting. Each developmental step required in creating an ongoing environmental scanning program is reviewed; these are: (1) the development of a program structure, i.e., the literature review needed, personnel to do the scanning, and types of available  information resources; (2) developing a comprehensive taxonomy, including an electronic filing system; (3) identifying and assigning information resources; (4) securing scanners; and (5) training scanners and abstractors. It is noted that incorporating a systematic environmental scanning system process should enable decision makers to anticipate what is happening in the state, region, nation, and world, and, correspondingly, to plan more effectively.

Such vision is needed for the formulation of strategic long-range plans. Section 1 begins with a discussion of how an internal analysis is conducted. The components of such an analysis are a review of the current organizational mission, identification of critical performance indicators, and identification of organizational strengths and weaknesses. Section 2 (external analysis) focuses first on how to identify the most critical trends that define the context within which the organization will function in the future, then on how to identify potential events that,  if they occurred, would affect those trends or the organization directly. In addition, forecasting trend levels and event probabilities and the impacts of both are reviewed, as well as a description of how to interrelate trends and events in cross-impact analysis and how to assess their effects on critical performance indicators. Section 3 gives details on how to analyze scenarios in order to derive their implications for policy analysis, described in section 4. An appendix is included which is designed to enhance discussion of the text, such as a group facilitator's guide, an article on environmental scanning activities, and sample pages from an environmental scanner's notebook.

The survey attempted to determine opinions in regard to the publishing requirements for the attainment of continuing status or tenure. Although faculty respondents did not all express satisfaction with the research and writing expectations of their institutions, the percentage of dissatisfaction was evenly distributed among the three universities. Librarians' attitudes on these points, however, were not evenly distributed, which may reflect  their reactions to criteria which vary widely from institution to institution, especially as compared to the criteria for faculty which is more consistent among the compared institutions.

        "description":"College students' level of interest in volunteering for eight campus organizations was compared with their foremost educational objective (career orientation versus personal development orientation). A random sample of 858 entering students at a large eastern public university was administered the University New Student Census, which included a question about educational objectives, and the Campus Involvement Interest Survey, a survey of interest in volunteer opportunities by level of compensation. Results showed that career-oriented students (a majority of the students) were generally less interested in volunteer opportunities than their personal development-oriented counterparts. Students undecided concerning career goals appeared to be the least interested in volunteering. The  paper discusses the apparent disregard of opportunities for career exploration by some students and interventions to increase interest in volunteering. Includes 12 references. (JDD)",

More than two-thirds of the respondents were male, and the majority (58%) identified themselves as Asian. Most of the goals listed were related to academics. The average age was 25 years; almost all expected to receive graduate degrees and 60% expected to pursue doctoral degrees. Almost half of the respondents said they decided to attend UMCP because the University offered the kind of academic program they wanted. Students were  certain about their own strengths and weaknesses; perceived themselves to be not easily discouraged; and reported that they needed assistance in learning how to budget their time efficiently, achieve satisfactory grades, and earn expenses for school. Students expressed interest in participating in intramural sport programs, academic clubs, and music and drama organizations. Includes 11 references. (JDD)",

To assess the degree to which level of interest is influenced by the incentives of a monetary award or course credit, students were randomly given one of three forms of the survey. Findings suggested that generally, students did not differentiate among &quot;serving as a volunteer,&quot;&quot;earning course credit as a volunteer,&quot; and &quot;earning a monetary award as a volunteer.&quot; Students were most interested in volunteering for the Homecoming Committee and Maryland Images (a campus recruitment organization), and least interested in volunteering for the Counseling Center and the Health Center.

        "description":"The General Accounting Office reviewed 18 relevant studies and analyzed existing data from the High School and Beyond Survey of 58,728 students to determine students' and parents' knowledge of federal financial aid for postsecondary education. It was found that students and parents knew very little about financial aid and held erroneous views about financial aid and school costs. Additionally, there was found to be a relation between a family's income and educational level and its level of awareness of federal financial aid: low-income families knew more about Pell Grants and high-income families knew more about loans. Higher educational institutions were found to be the primary source of information about financial aid for most students and parents, followed by informal sources  such as family and friends. In addition, studies showed that students from families with knowledge of financial aid at the time the students were in high school were far more likely to apply for aid. Academic ability, high school grades, family income, and motivation to continue education were seen as more highly related to postsecondary attendance than was knowledge of financial aid. Prior awareness of the availability of financial aid can be part of a chain of influences leading to completion of additional schooling. Contains 19 references. (GLR)",

Illustrations of the system are based on the accounting courses offered by the Department of Accounting and Law. The paper first describes the creation of NP from an amalgamation of two colleges in 1974. Next, the development of the peer review system itself is outlined. The necessity of accountability and quality assurance became apparent when the numbers of students and courses increased. An explanation of how the system evolved is presented. The Boards of Studies reports which had little or no course critique led to the development of Faculty Sub-Committees, and to improved communication between the sub-committees and the  Faculty Board and Course Co-Ordinators regarding the annual monitoring and evaluation of the faculty's courses. Finally, a critical appraisal of the professional studies approach is provided, as well as the impact it had on the polytechnic. Case studies from the Department of Accounting and Law are presented.

The clusters of variables examined were: (1) management style (use of communication and participation as techniques); (2) funding for professional development (travel expenses for conferences, equipment and book purchases, etc.); and (3) institutional characteristics (student populations, highest degree offered, affiliation). Study results indicated that perceptions of resource adequacy are more closely related to the institutional environment within which faculty work than to administrative management styles; an open management style  did not necessarily translate into greater funding for professional development. In addition, the institution's characteristics largely determined resource availability and adequacy, which suggests that bright scholars will be excluded from pursuing their scholarly goals if they are not at the \"right\" institution.

Faculty members were also queried about their practices in dealing successfully with problems and their recommendations for administrative action. The three most common teaching problems identified were: the diversity of students' levels of ability (47%); knowing how well students are understanding (41%); and the low level of student reading and writing abilities (39%). The three most common non-teaching problems identified were: dealing with incompletes, make-up exams, or grade change requests (40%); too few teaching assistants (TAs) (36%); and unreliable equipment  (28%). The efficient use of faculty time and the large numbers of students exposed to high-quality teaching and senior faculty members were viewed as the benefits of large classes. The faculty gained personal satisfaction from lecturing large numbers of students. Among the recommendations were: (1) provide funding for more TAs; (2) set an enrollment limit in lecture classes; (3) develop teaching idea packets for large classes; and (4) provide instructors of large classes with lighter teaching loads.

Responses from the questionnaire showed that aging faculty remain internally controlled, vital, and productive while being active in areas of teaching, scholarship, and service. Level of satisfaction was not shown to vary significantly by race, gender, or academic discipline. Senior faculty did not want to give up their jobs and leave academia, and most did not want to leave their present institutions. Senior faculty also tended to rate their abilities as high in teaching,  scholarship, and service; felt more vital and committed to their work than ever before; and would choose an academic career if they could make the decision again. Additionally, recognition from administrators was found to be a good predictor of faculty satisfaction. Faculty profiles were developed for major disciplines. Contains 20 references. (GLR)",

The specific goals were: (1) to identify the tools necessary for the effective support of existing authors or development teams of computer-supported learning or training materials (short term goal); (2) to indicate where advanced developments in this and related fields might lead to better computer-based training development tools (medium term goal); and (3) to suggest areas of fundamental research which are needed to underpin more effective courseware development tools for the future (long  term goal). General issues covered included computer-based training and users of authoring tools. Several topics related to what tools are needed to improve current practice are then considered, i.e., the limitations of current authoring systems; problems to be solved with better tools; assessment of organizational needs; analysis of training needs; design; prototyping tools; and user modelling. Software engineering techniques are described, including simulation and modelling, Smalltalk and direct-manipulation interfaces, HyperCard, integration, and expert systems. Several issues of instructional and learning strategies are summarized. The report concludes with outlines of tools and techniques that need to be developed and issues for the research on which such development depends. A list  of seminar participants is appended.

        "description":"This paper discusses two methods used in training allied health students to clarify patients' problems and develop treatment plans to resolve them. The traditional problem solving approach is presented as a means to introduce students to patient evaluation and treatment planning, while clinical reasoning is seen as a more expert way to approach this process. The incorporation of problem solving early in allied health curricula, followed by instruction and practice in clinical reasoning, is recommended. An instructional model for facilitating students' acquisition of clinical reasoning skill is presented. Flowcharts of the problem solving and clinical reasoning processes and a model for instruction in clinical reasoning are included. (9 references) (Author/GL)",

        "description":"This study investigated the interaction between hemispheric specialization and pictorial recognition memory for pictures presented in three different color modes: realistic color, non-realistic color, and monochrome (back and white). The study was also designed to confirm the efficacy of applying signal detection analysis to color recognition memory data to obtain a more accurate assessment of the role of color in visual information processing. The stimuli consisted of 120 stimulus slides and 60 distractor slides, all photographs of North American and Canadian geography scenery. Twenty-six graduate students were first shown the set of 120 stimulus slides. They were then instructed to perform a complex verbal masking task designed to localize processing to the right hemisphere  while viewing either the first or second 60 slides; the alternate slides were viewed without the masking task. The subjects were then presented with a random distribution of the stimulus and distractor slides for five seconds each, and asked to indicate whether the slide was one they had seen before or a \"new\" one. It was found that under the right localized treatment, both the realistic color and black and white treatments scored significantly lower than the non-realistic color treatment, although the non-realistic group did not differ significantly from any of the treatment groups under the integrated treatment. It is concluded that color processing is bi-locational, with realistic/verbal image processing being done in the left hemisphere and pure color processing in the right  hemisphere. It is further concluded that visual realism probably constitutes a combination of imaginal and verbal information. Three figures are appended. (49 references) (BBM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of &quot;Discretion vs. Valor,&quot; a simulation game designed to give North American players a chance to: (1) identify with &quot;believers&quot; (Christians) in the Soviet Union in order to form new images of these persons; (2) gain empathy for Christians by understanding the dilemmas they face as they exercise their faith; and (3) become active participants in decision-making in a family group context. The game prototype was tested, evaluated, and revised during 10 field tests in 1987. During 1988 celebrations of the millennial year of Russian Orthodoxy, 72 North American Christians played the revised game in 15 &quot;family&quot; groups, returning self-report evaluations which included 78 claims of &quot;identification&quot; with at least one of the game's  characters. Reports of the game's greater than average influence upon their cognitive learning came from 76% of the players, while 60% of all players reported that the game experience produced changes in their attitudes. Comparison of pre- and post-game measures of behavioral intention for six common religious practices showed 95% of players with altered &quot;commitment levels&quot; after play. Future tests of identification theory and role empathy are suggested by this study. Data are presented in three tables, and instruments for pre-game and post-game measurement of attitude change and for participant evaluation of the simulation are included.

        "description":"This study surveyed adults in a wide variety of settings to determine their perceptions of their motivational needs. Subjects were 307 adult participants, mostly K-12 teachers and administrators, who were enrolled in a variety of credit and noncredit continuing education classes and workshops at a major midwestern university. A needs assessment survey instrument, developed through revisions of the Course Interest Survey and the Course Effort Survey to reflect the integration of adult learning and general motivational factors relevant to adult learners, was administered over a 4-month period. Results suggest that: (1) instructional strategies can have a positive effect on the interest and effort of adult learners; (2) instructional motivation has components of instructional appeal  and learner effort; and (3) many instructors' motivational methods are perceived to have a stronger positive effect on adult learners' interest than on their effort in learning. Confidence building strategies were found to be much more strongly linked to perceived effort of learners than to instructional appeal. Based upon instructional motivation theory, adult learning theory, and these results, an adult learner/instruction interaction motivation model has been developed to show the interaction of methods, conditions, and outcomes for the motivational instruction of adults. Methods are organized as to the suggested effects on appeal, effort, and satisfaction. (15 references) (GL)",

        "description":"This study investigated learners' preconceptions of interactive video (IV), instructional television (ITV), and television (TV), and compared three treatment groups on learners' perceptions of invested mental effort and achievement on a test of recall and inference. The three treatments consisted of an IV lesson that included practice questions requiring an active response, an ITV lesson that included practice questions requiring a covert response, and a TV lesson that did not include practice questions. The relationship between learners' preconceptions and perceived mental effort was also investigated. The subjects were 78 undergraduate students who were randomly selected and assigned to the three treatments, and a posttest only control group design was used. The independent  variable consisted of the video-based instructional materials, and the dependent variables were student ratings of perceived mental effort, recall scores, and inference scores. Information on student preconceptions of the difficulty of learning from IV, ITV, and TV was also collected for descriptive and correlational purposes. Several statistical tests of significance were used to analyze the data, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test, and Pearson's test of correlation. The results of the study indicate that learners who are required to actively respond to practice questions that are embedded in a video-based lesson recall significantly more information from the lesson than learners who are not provided with practice questions. It is  suggested that, although the inclusion of such questions does increase the amount of factual information recalled, higher level practice questions may be needed to increase the number of inferences generated in response to a video-based lesson.

        "description":"Designed to begin a feminist &quot;unthinking&quot; and rethinking of educational technology, this paper begins by examining some definitions of what that technology essentially is. Three characteristics of a feminist approach to science that can inform a rethinking of educational technology are then identified: (1) the theorizing of gender as a variable of consequence; (2) the valuing of women's experience as a scientific resource; and (3) the positioning of the researcher in the same critical plane as the researched. The discussion emphasizes issues that arise from an examination of educational technology in the context of three categories of technology users in schools: administrators, who impose educational technology on teachers; teachers, who impose educational technology on  students; and students. It is argued that, since educational technology has been developed largely outside the domain of the teacher and without the benefit of her wisdom, the structures, standards, and schedule of the teacher's school day become out of her control, and research on the effectiveness of educational technology denies the importance of her work. It is also argued that educational technology as used by students is thoroughly saturated with the sex biases of its root disciplines and curricular contexts. It is concluded that the contributions of the teacher user and the female student user to the teaching-learning process are denied by the increasing use of educational technology, and a number of questions that might guide feminist rethinking of educational technology are  suggested.

Sources for the analysis included five leading professional journals in educational technology, papers given at annual conventions of three professional associations, dissertations from five universities that have a high level of doctoral productivity, and the educational technology documents entered into the ERIC database. The analysis was complemented by the examination of supplementary documents to determine the political, social, and economic reasons for the findings. The top trends identified in the study are: (1) design, development, and evaluation of instructional products and procedures is a primary concern; (2)  professional education for teachers in the use of educational technology is seen as a basic need for present and future professional service; (3) distance education is becoming a significant instructional delivery system that uses technological means to reach its goals; (4) the computer is the dominant medium in the field, and after computers, telecommunications and video are emerging as major delivery systems; (5) the role of the educational technologist is unclear and varies from location to location; (6) case studies serve as models to follow in the implementation of educational technology applications; (7) the field of educational technology is concerned about its status as a profession; and (8) educational technology principles, products, and practices are just beginning to be  integrated into courses and curricula.

A descriptive and correlational design was used. Subjects were 79 undergraduate students enrolled in  junior year classes in textiles and clothing and teacher education. Students completed the CAIN, BACS, and achievement tests before and after using the hypermedia program. The data demonstrate that students had individual cognitive styles and preferences for progressing through a lesson. The lack of more significant relationships between variables signifies that there is much variability in the way students learn. Textiles and clothing students had fewer significant correlations than did teacher education students, suggesting that their pattern of learning is harder to detect. The findings support an approach to instructional design that allows students to choose from many types of information modes. (27 references) (GL)",

        "description":"This study determined the effects of using an instructional game and supplemental readings on student motivation as defined using the ARCS model of motivation and performance. Subjects were 75 undergraduate education majors enrolled in a required educational psychology course at a large southwestern university. All students attended a lecture on the information processing model of learning and were told to read a chapter in the textbook, &quot;Essentials of Learning for Instruction,&quot; by Gagne and Driscoll. Two days later, subjects were randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group. Both groups were given 30 minutes to practice the information presented in the lecture and assigned reading. Treatment group subjects used an instructional game developed by the  researchers, and subjects in the control group used a worksheet containing the same review questions as the game. Upon completion of the practice activity, all subjects completed the Instructional Materials Motivation Scale (IMMS) and then took a 15-item constructed response posttest to measure their performance. Multivariate analysis was used to test for an overall difference between groups on the motivation scales. This was followed by univariate analysis on each of the four IMMS subscales. Results indicate that using the instructional game and completing the reading assignment both had a significant effect on motivation, and that completion of the reading assignment significantly contributed to posttest performance. While results suggest that subjects in the treatment condition  outperformed control group subjects on the posttest, this difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that instructional designers can provide students with a motivating practice alternative that is as effective as more traditional methods of practice. (39 references) (GL)",

Subjects were 123 seventh grade Hispanic students from a rural junior high school near Phoenix, Arizona. A pretest was employed to control for potential initial achievement differences by treatment or sex. Subjects were blocked by sex on the basis of their pretest scores, then randomly assigned within each block to the three treatments. A biographical inventory was administered three weeks prior to the administration of treatments to collect, in addition to biographical data, information regarding favorite objects, places, persons, and events for use  in personalizing the word problems. The three treatments were administered during regularly scheduled math classes. Achievement was measured the following day using a 16-item constructed response posttest immediately after completion of the review material. An attitude scale was administered to measure the student's level of interest in the lesson and perceived level of difficulty, perception of the importance of the lesson, the level of importance attached to seeing one's name in print, preference for personalized or non-personalized problems, and preference for word or number problems. Analyses of the data indicate that personalization had a significant effect on student achievement on two-step problems, and that there was no significant difference in the overall performance of males  and females. Attitude data generally favored individualized personalization over the other two treatments. (29 references) (GL)",

Textual display was operationally defined as the arrangement of specified elements on the printed page, and was manipulated by varying text and column width and position, horizontal and vertical spacing, and heading placement in three versions--Simple Textual Display, Moderate Textual Display, and Complex Textual Display--of a printed self-instructional text. Ability was measured by grade point average. Attention was measured by the Attention subscale of the Instructional Materials Motivation Scale (IMMS). Performance was measured by an  objective-referenced test of recall. Preference was measured by items from the IMMS Attention and Confidence subscales. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and chi-square. Results indicated that there was an interaction between ability and textual display for performance, but not for attention. Results also indicated that textual display significantly influenced performance, but not attention. The moderate textual display produced significantly higher performance scores for low ability subjects. Results of the test for preference revealed that, of the three versions, learners preferred the text exhibiting the Moderate Textual Display. (62 references) (Author/GL)",

        "description":"An extensive evaluation was conducted of a training program on industrial safety that was designed to change employee attitudes and behaviors in relation to energy control and power lockout (ECPL), i.e., closing down an assembly line while completing diagnostic or repair tasks. The research question was aimed at determining the effects of entry perceptions of organizational climate factors on training outcomes. Materials for the professionally designed and developed program consisted of eight modules, a videotape, an instructor's manual, a participant's workbook, and a portable pocket manual. Participants, consisting of both hourly personnel and salaried and supervisory personnel, completed a questionnaire prior to and within 30-90 days after the training. The training outcomes  used were gain scores calculated from pre- and posttest measures of knowledge of ECPL procedures, attitudes toward safety on the job, on-the-job application of general safety precautions, and on-the-job applications of specific behaviors related to ECPL procedures. Organizational climate factors were measured by employee perceptions of 20 different climate elements. The results support only one of four hypotheses; i.e., organizational climate variables influence specific on-the-job behavior directly related to the training content. It is concluded that designers of industrial training programs need to consider all of the factors that affect the learning process--with emphasis on the principles of adult learning--as well as the systematic procedures of designing programs, materials, and  media. Six figures, 5 tables, and 14 references are included. (BBM)",

        "description":"Designed to develop a more practical model for adapting context to learner interests, this study used computer-based instruction to make alternative contexts for statistics problems--sports, business, education, or no-context--available for selection by individual learners. The subjects were 227 undergraduate students enrolled in required education courses at Memphis State University. The context adaptation strategy was evaluated as it was used both independently of and in combination with learner control (LC) of the practice examples. The research design involved the manipulation of standard (prescribed) contexts versus LC-context in combination with standard instructional support versus LC-instructional support. The study also investigated the nature of LC decisions in relation  to the types of instructional options made available and learner characteristics. Instruments used in the study were the Nelson-Denney Reading Test, a unit pretest, a unit posttest, and a task attitude survey. Analyses of the data revealed little difference between the treatments in achievement; students who received minimum support found the lesson faster moving than those who received maximum support; 92% of the subjects had positive attitudes toward the desirability of selecting problem themes; and learners with higher prior achievement and reading ability tended to complete the task faster, score higher on the posttest, and view the task more favorably. It was concluded that, although the achievement results failed to support the hypothesized benefits for learning, a practical model  for incorporating contextual adaptation in CBI had been developed and demonstrated.

Subjects for the first phase were 62 fourth, fifth, and sixth graders in a public elementary school. Using a computer-based drill involving the naming of the capitals of the 50 states of the United States, the students each determined their own practice schedules over a period of two weeks. A pretest and posttest were used to measure the level of success of each student in learning the assigned items. Results suggest that two times through the optimized drill, one near the time of original learning and the other near the retention measure, are sufficient for maximal learning of the drill material.

        "description":"This study tested the hypothesis that children bring specifiable expectations to their use of interactive computer programs, and that these expectations will determine, to a large extent, which features of a given program will be motivating to a child. It is also argued that the different genres of interactivity relied upon by software designers will elicit different expectations from a child. Subjects were 14 fifth-grade students. Three sets of data were collected by: (1) asking students to sort software titles into piles of \"like\" programs; (2) asking students to indicate on a scale of one to three how much they like to use each program; and (3) identifying the interactive elements of the favored software genre-adventures through group interviews. The groupings were recorded  and children were asked to label each pile. The analysis yielded seven clusters of programs that could be differentiated according to the students' labels, and four ways of interacting in and with the world were identified. To investigate the relationship of motivation to interactive formats, the motivational strength of a program was measured by asking 22 subjects to complete a questionnaire by indicating how often they would choose to use each of the programs in their free time. Adventures and programs which generated printer output were significantly preferred to the other clusters but not to one another. It is suggested that what makes each program so successful is the fit between the reasons the child wants to use the program and the interactive environment it creates, and the  similarity between the motivating goal structure for that type of activity in the real world and in the software program.

Recommendations for equipping SWOS classroom and production areas cover video display, front screen projection, audio reinforcement/supplemental, video recording, graphics support (local production), student support/study, and instructor support. The SWOS instructors found that the proposed design plan for classrooms was compatible  with their needs, had appropriate centralized control of equipment, met expectations, and was at an appropriate level of sophistication. Reactions to the proposed media centers were slightly less positive. Six prototype systems were completed, i.e., equipment was installed in one of each of four categories of classrooms and the prototype satellite and central media centers. After using one or more of the prototypes, the reactions of the instructors were generally favorable. It was concluded that instructional design procedures that are normally limited to the development of instructional materials or sequences are just as appropriate for a hardware-based project as they are for software development.

        "author":["Tennyson, Robert D."],
        "description":"Scientific advancements in cognitive science and instructional technology extend the behaviorally-oriented learning paradigm of instructional design and management in three major areas: (1) analysis of information-to-be-learned; (2) means of evaluating learners; and (3) linkage of learning theory to instructional prescriptions. The two basic types of analysis of information-to-be-learned--content analysis and task analysis--both identify the external structure of the information without regard for how it might be stored in human memory. Cognitive science suggests that a context analysis should also be conducted and the concepts and their organization for employment identified to provide a means for sequencing instruction so that it improves the use of knowledge in problem  solving. While learner evaluation in the behavioral paradigm focuses on observable student performance, evaluation in the cognitive paradigm takes on diagnostic functions. The implications for instructional design lie in the cognitive paradigm concepts of diagnosis of learning needs during instruction, and measures of achievement within the context of meaningful and complex situations. The instructional design model that is presented focuses on the planning of a learning environment which enables students not only to acquire knowledge, but also to improve their cognitive abilities to employ and extend their knowledge. Computer programs that are domain specific and provide for self-directed learning seem to offer excellent instructional strategies for meeting the goals of a curriculum that  emphasizes higher-level thinking strategies.

        "author":["Tripp, Steven D."],
        "description":"This review of the role of the metaphor in instruction begins with a brief description of historical thinking on the subject. Modern views of the metaphor as a psychological mechanism rather than just a figure of speech are then presented, with emphasis on reasons why metaphors should be helpful in education. It is noted that the hypothesis that metaphor allows a transfer of meaning from something well-known to something less well-known is supported by contemporary theorists, who further suggest that the transfer of structures from one domain to another may involve the creation of new cognitive structures. Brief discussions of the substitution theory view and the interaction view include the limited role ascribed to metaphor in education by both substitutionists and  interactionists. The attitudes of scientists toward metaphor are then described, and it is noted that investigators during the 1960s began to recognize the apparent importance of non-literal imagery to the explanatory aspects of scientific theory. Psychological studies of metaphor comprehension in the context of child development and processing by mature subjects are reviewed, as well as research on the time needed to process metaphor under various conditions and the memorability of metaphorical language. Instructional uses of metaphor are also discussed in the context of the communication process. The paper concludes with a discussion of the possibility of theoretical integration of metaphors into instructional design theory, Reigeluth's elaboration theory, and Keller's motivational  theory.

        "description":"This paper is a short tutorial in formal grammar with speculative examples of how it could be used as a research tool for task analysis, the description of lesson structure, the modeling of interactive dialogue, and perhaps the instructional design process. Gagne's notion of &quot;events of instruction&quot; is used in an example of the application of linguistic techniques to instructional system design, and it is suggested that use of analogy is one way to think about the problems involved, e.g., the events of instruction may be compared to parts of speech, and sentences are made up of parts just as lessons are. It is argued that sentences are infinite in variety but constrained structurally; some instructional designs may be thought of as well-formed strings while others may violate our  intuitions of well-formedness; and a grammar of instructional design would assign descriptions to lesson materials. A brief explanation of the term &quot;formal grammar&quot; as used in linguistics is followed by descriptions of other grammars proposed by researchers, including a story grammar, a cinema grammar, a computer-interface grammar, a lesson grammar, and a grammar of instructional design. A summary suggests that while the ideas presented in this paper are far from complete, formal grammar as an instructional design device will at least facilitate the identification of testable hypotheses about optimal sequences, and might also be modified to help designers generate lessons more fluently or to allow the computer generation of large numbers of different, acceptable lesson structures that can  be fleshed out by subject experts. The various grammars described are presented in nine figures. (11 references) (BBM)",

        "description":"This paper reports on an empirical study of educators' perceptions of learning concepts, reviews the cognitive learning literature, and argues for an expanded view of conceptual knowledge and its role in education and training. The report begins with discussions of changing views of concept learning and declarative and procedural components of concepts. A survey of 56 students in 3 graduate education classes is then described in which subjects were asked to respond to a scenario in which they are imagined to be teaching a sampling of concrete and defined concepts (glasnost, snow leopard, and justice) to college sophomores with no prior knowledge of the topic. The question for the students then is: What performances would serve as indicators that their students had really learned  the three concepts? The broad array of concept performances listed by the subjects--339 for the three concepts--are summarized in four categories: definitions and defining attributes; examples and nonexamples; elaboration; and use--and an expanded notion of concept learning is presented. Five concept teaching strategies that include the declarative and problem-solving aspects of concept learning as well as procedural classification skills are then discussed. The strategies are: (1) teaching with analogies; (2) encouragement of learning strategies; (3) use and inference practice; (4) alternative strategies for classification performance; and (5) determining qualities of concepts to be learned. It is concluded that this way of looking at concepts takes into account the declarative and  metacognitive components of concept learning and use, and it is recommended that the \"intellectual skills\" of concept classification be integrated with the \"verbal information\" that makes the concept meaningful, and with additional skills that encourage use and inference.

        "description":"A research project was conducted to develop a narrative description of the strengths and weaknesses of the distance education component of the Zimbabwean teacher education program. The Triad Perspective Model of Distance Education (TPMDE), which resulted from the study's emergent design, combines three theoretical perspectives on education: systems theory; curriculum development theory; and adoption and diffusion of innovations theory. Major program strengths, identified using the TPMDE as a framework, are: (1) the strength of the conviction among Zimbabwe's educational community that distance education is a worthwhile venture; (2) the persistence of those involved in the program; (3) Ministry of Education advocacy; (4) quality of personnel involved in the program; and (5)  quality of students at the teachers' colleges. Major weaknesses were: (1) the lack of a Zimbabwean model for distance education; (2) ineffective communication; (3) lack of accountability; (4) insufficient quantities of trained personnel; and (5) lack of instructor-student feedback procedures. Recommendations based on the comprehensive description of the program's distance education component included establishing a Distance Education Commission, providing for program evaluation on a regular basis, encouraging a more active role for the University of Zimbabwe, and establishing a distance education department at each teachers' college in the country.

It would also allow aircraft to interact with ground vehicles and surface-to-air missiles. It is argued that this training would enable pilots to transfer skills from training to actual combat environments without the high risk of failure due to lack of experience. This conceptual research effort used information obtained from fighter pilots and  computer and training experts to examine a range of questions and options that might be considered with a network of tactical aircraft combat simulators. Although the main emphasis of the research was on training, some consideration was given to the use of such a network in aircraft development and in pilot selection. While such a network of aircraft simulators remains to be built, the results of this study suggest that such a network should be given serious consideration. (DB)",

Designed, developed, formatively evaluated, and revised according to an instructional systems design model, the program provides basic, individualized instruction for students to master prior to more advanced classroom instruction in strategies and methods of library research. The need for the program, specification of its target audience, and overall content of instruction were established by the 1988 UMCP Library Education Committee. Instructional materials  and activities were developed by a design team composed of a content specialist, an instructional designer, and a computer programmer. Evaluation activities and materials were administered to 28 UMCP upperclassmen in two junior composition classes. Analyses of pre- and posttest data suggested that students profited from use of the program. Analysis of observational data indicated that students had virtually no difficulty with content, encountered some problems with navigation, and found the package useful and attractive. Students' suggestions for improvement provided a rationale for incorporating a navigational tutorial and other minor revisions into the package to make it even more valuable. Copies of the pre- and posttests and the observation protocol are among the 15 exhibits attached  to the report. (11 references) (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Both interview and direct observation data were collected via on-site visits with the training directors at 22 U.S. training centers which had been identified as the best training facilities in order to examine why the instructional methods, techniques, and media changes in use had been tried and adopted, and to identify the trends these methods represent. The organizations studied included computer manufacturers, universities, military contractors, military academies, an airline, and a simulator developer. It was found that most of the organizations perform a needs assessment analysis to aid in choosing instructional methods and media, and that there is a trend toward individualized instruction and real environment simulations. While the organizations were researching  computer-assisted instruction, interactive video, instructional television, and distance learning as alternatives to current training programs, only instructional television was in widespread use. Many successful programs were under the direct supervision of a high level administrator and funded at the corporate or division level; more innovation and creative activity seemed to occur if this was the case. Almost all class instruction was evaluated in some manner; however, materials and overall program evaluation was not consistently performed. Specialized according to instructional objectives, clients, and security, physical facilities included multimedia classrooms, most of which included equipment to project overhead transparencies and display videotapes and/or live television  presentations.

The first paper, &quot;Self-Definition: Naming Yourself in a College Environment,&quot; explores the diversity of campus activities, and encourages students to become involved in some of them to continue their self-development as well as to make connections with other people. The second paper, &quot;Education and 'The Color Purple'; 'No matter what happen, Nettie steady try to teach me what go on in the world,'&quot; describes two people who had a major influence on the speaker as a young girl, and mentions some of the people  at SUNY Oswego--e.g., roommates, friends, professors, counselors, residence hall directors--who will help students continue to learn &quot;what go on in the world.&quot; The third paper, &quot;SUNY Oswego Students Research the Topic of Abuse,&quot; provides examples of ways that Oswego students have demonstrated concern and scholarship in this area by elaborating on three specific topics of abuse that have been the subject of research papers written by undergraduate students: female circumcision in Africa, violence in families around the world, and terrorism and torture. The final paper, &quot;Arts in Education,&quot; offers references to art in &quot;The Color Purple&quot; and describes some of the opportunities for students at Oswego to appreciate art, participate in art, create art, and develop a knowledge of the visual and  performing arts.

Because of this financial support, the Federal Government exercises a strong indirect influence on the conduct of education at the provincial level and is continuously involved in educational policies. Each of the provincial and territorial departments of education is responsible for the organization and administration of education at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels within its boundaries. Because of the diverse racial and ethnic population, each province and territory has developed an educational system suited to its historical,  social, economic, and political circumstances. Despite the many differences, the 12 educational systems are committed to similar aims including: (1) fostering growth and development of individual students; (2) teaching basic knowledge and skills required for living and learning throughout life; (3) preparing students to become contributing members of society; and (4) providing opportunities to all individuals according to their individual aptitudes, needs, and interests. While no national 'image' of education is articulated, there exists a shared image of education as providing practical means for meeting practical ends. (11 references) (DB)",

        "description":"This paper examines communications and information technologies and the ways in which they have been used in both the formal and the nonformal education of Canada's native people (four groups: status Indians, non-status Indians, Metis, and Inuits). It is noted that generalizations about the use of technology in native schools is difficult because of the varying official status of native populations, different provincial jurisdiction over those populations, and the different languages and customs involved. The first section of the paper considers the use of film, video, and computers in formal education settings. The second section briefly discusses the history of native education from 1960 to 1983 and examines federal experiments in nonformal educational applications including  radio, satellite, video, and interactive television communications. A mini-revolution in the development of native-language materials made possible by new developments in microcomputer technology is described, as well as uses of computers, instructional television, teleconferencing, and instructional video in classroom settings. A concluding statement briefly discusses the need for native access and control, the need to exploit the interactive capacity of new technologies, the need for culturally appropriate software, the need for further research, and future goals for the education of Canada's native peoples. It is noted that, although educational technologies offer native Canadians the potential for major advancements in formal and nonformal education, there is always the danger that  the distinct identity of native peoples may be subverted in the process.

        "description":"This paper examines the history, functions, and impact of the four existing educational communications organizations in Canada: (1) TVOntario; (2) Radio Quebec; (3) ACCESS Alberta; and (4) the Knowledge Network of the West in British Columbia. It is noted that, while broadcasting and communications have always fallen under federal jurisdiction, education is the sole responsibility of each provincial government. The overlap between these two, in the form of educational broadcasting, necessitated the formation of new regulatory policy. A discussion of the new policy reveals that, while the four authorities may share similar purposes in the provision of educational opportunities to the public, and adhere to a common national programming definition, there are distinct differences  among them that are reflected in their roles and functions: (1) TVOntario produces and distributes all educational programs on its television network; (2) ACCESS Alberta (Alberta Educational Communications Corporation) produces educational programs and operates radio stations, but has no television network of its own; (3) Radio-Quebec distributes educational programming and produces programming relevant to the region's cultural concerns; and (4) the Knowledge Network distributes programming produced elsewhere. It is noted that the Agency for Tele-Education in Canada (ATEC) is an umbrella organization designed to facilitate interaction among the four educational communications authorities, including communication, information sharing, and co-production of programs. This report provides a  brief introductory overview of the four communications organizations together with a detailed description of each of the four. (17 references) (DB)",

While the CBC was not designed to fill a formal education role in Canada, it does broadcast informative radio and television programs on a complete range of subjects including news, current affairs, special documentaries, culture and children's topics, entertainment, and, most recently, adult education. In addition, it currently broadcasts the Canadian School Telecasts twice a week for half an hour during the school year. The CBC also makes use of teletext and satellite technologies. Also a publicly-owned agency, the National Film Board (NFB) of Canada is designed to benefit Canada and Canadians  through the making of informative films. The current role of the NFB in Canadian education is the production of educational films that are relevant to the interests of young people, to course content, and to Canadian issues. These films address all levels of education in subjects ranging from language arts to social history, geography, and Third World studies. (20 references) (DB)",

        "description":"Videotex is a generic term used to describe computerized two-way information delivery systems designed for simple, mass-market use which provide access to computer-based information via a telecommunications link and an information display, usually a modified home television set. In Canada videotex has become almost synonymous with the name Telidon, which has been described as a high level, efficient communication code for the creation, storage, and transmission of graphics and text. Telidon has been used by both academics and corporations in experiments, field trials, and applications for formal and nonformal education purposes. Flexible enough for use by people of all ages, Telidon has been applied in computer assisted instruction courses, business and information libraries,  information databases, supplements to science and museum educational exhibits, distance education and teleconferencing programs, special education programs, TVOntario educational sequences, and many others. Some of the issues surrounding the use of Telidon/videotex are: (1) the need for more research, development, and evaluation in distance education, special education, and in the broader field of computers in education; (2) the need for support materials and resources; (3) the need for local access to page creation facilities (and inexpensive equipment) and the potentially prohibitive cost of the Telidon/videotex system; and (4) the effects of Telidon/videotex on privacy, employment, industrial development, technological change, and other 'social impact' questions.

        "description":"Canada has explored the use of satellites as a means to provide information and communications services to geographically isolated populations since 1962. Between 1972 and 1984, five series of satellites known as Anik A, B, C, and D and Hermes were launched. Each satellite provided expanded communications services, and each led to research and experiments in educational applications, some of which included joint ventures with other countries. For example, more than 20 Canadian organizations carried out technical and social experiments with the Hermes satellite, including direct-to-home television and radio broadcasting, tele-education, telemedicine, community interaction, administrative services, and native communications services. Research indicates that communications  satellites far surpass their initial purpose of reaching remote populations. Current and future developments include two-way satellite technology, integration of satellites and computer assisted and managed instruction in distance education, and local and regional computer networking via satellite. Among the most important issues regarding the use of satellites for educational purposes are: (1) determining ownership and copyright of satellite programs; (2) integrating satellite educational services with existing terrestrial distribution systems; (3) determining cost-effectiveness of satellite delivered educational service; (4) evaluating student satisfaction and performance for educational services delivered by satellite; (5) establishing educational satellite consortia on a regional  basis; and (6) deciding whether a satellite educational service should have one-way or two-way capabilities.

The first section focuses on the technology itself, i.e., the disks, disk players, and the possibilities they offer for interaction between learner and machine. The current costs of the technology and the probable effect of these costs on the market are also discussed. The second section reports on a survey of the research and production of videodisks in Canada, and includes a discussion of the contents, educational design, costs, and features of projects completed by ACCESS Alberta, the Univesity of Alberta in Edmonton, Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, and the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, among others. Issues involved in most of the projects include: (1) the  effective design of interactive learning programs; (2) coordination of the team producing the videodisk; and (3) cost of the technology both to produce and to use.

The report begins by reviewing the development of 'telemedicine' or 'telehealth' systems using various combinations of telephone, cable, microwave, and satellite technologies. Examples of such systems are provided by describing three experiments with linking hospitals in remote areas with urban teaching hospitals. The remote hospitals were the Moose Factory General Hospital in the northern district, the Sioux Lookout Zone of northwestern Ontario, and four remote hospitals in Newfoundland. Technologies included linking via the Hermes  satellite and/or slow scan television; applications ranged from medical diagnosis and consultation to administration, continuing education for health professionals, and patient treatment. Current telehealth applications in Canada are then described, including programs operating in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland. Issues involved in planning for telehealth programs are also discussed, including whether video is needed in addition to audio, protection of patient-physician confidentiality, remuneration for services rendered via telecommunications, and the need for more expertise and guidance in creating the programs to be transmitted. A look at future directions for telehealth in Canada concludes the report. (20 references)  (DB)",

Research has shown that students learn more through active participation in their own learning process. From 1984 to 1987, a teacher's secondary social studies students were actively involved in the National History Day Program (NHDP), one purpose of which is to promote student competency and interest in carrying out original research. Of the four program categories--paper, project, performance, and media--the media category was the most popular. Students worked in groups of from two to five to produce videos, dissolve slide/tape shows, standard slide presentation, computer programs, and overhead projection displays on designated themes. Compared to academically  similar students in previous classes using alternative instructional methods, the NHDP students showed dramatic increases in involvement, learning, comprehension, and motivation. They learned how to find, interpret, analyze, organize, use, and present information in creative ways, and they learned skills related to everyday technologies. Participation in NHDP classes became popular with students in the school, more of whom tried to enroll each year although the work involved was extraordinary and relentless. In addition to active participation, cooperative group work, intergroup competition, and student choice of project may have contributed to the overwhelming success of the program. (DB)",

A 46-item questionnaire was mailed to the principals, computer coordinators, and heads of academic departments at 21 junior and 73 senior high schools throughout the state. Topics of inquiry included questions about teacher training, computer hardware and software, and computer use, as well as questions of a general nature. Results of the data analyses are presented in 28 tables. Based on these analyses, it was concluded that: (1) although regular expenditures on computer technology fall between $4,000 and $8,000 annually, school computers have had a  limited impact on instruction; (2) the lack of effective use of microcomputers, particularly in the area of instruction, may be caused by the lack of time available to teachers to plan for the use of software; (3) there is a need for continued formal training for both computer coordinators and teachers, and increased opportunities for teachers to borrow school computers for use at home; and (4) the underutilization of existing hardware and software promotes the viewpoint that computers are helpful but not important in the improvement of the learning and teaching process.

        "description":"A training module developed following the Instructional System Design model was implemented at Nassau Community College (NCC) to teach its administration, faculty, and staff members computer skills that would enable them to use the available computer equipment more efficiently. Using this module, each trainee designed a file to be used for the storage and retrieval of data about a single topic using the software package &quot;Q &amp; A,&quot; an integrated, menu-driven software package that includes word processing, database management, utility modules, and report-creation capabilities. Gagne's nine instructional events were used to develop the learning activities, and the transfer of skills to the job was incorporated into the training as part of the program design. Questionnaires were used  to ascertain the trainees' needs, and a formative evaluation of the course materials was conducted. The summative evaluation was based on a questionnaire to measure the participants' reactions to the course, a posttest and checklist combination to measure learning, use made of the database &quot;FILE&quot; on the job to measure behavior changes, and the benefits transferred to NCC offices by personnel using FILE to do their jobs more effectively to measure the results of the course. Additional materials contained in nine appendices include sample instructional material sets and both needs assessment and course evaluation questionnaires. (33 references) (SD)",

It is suggested that the availability of detailed research into the dynamics of this library's formation may help historians identify factors that support the advent of public libraries, regardless of their locations, and may assist the library profession to better articulate methods to help floundering public libraries. It is proposed that several independent variables be examined in varying depth, including: (1) the confluence of Carnegie's philanthropy with the local philanthropic impulse and civic pride; (2) local leadership from elected officials, library association members, and community leaders; (3) the presence of supporters of  the local subscription library and their backgrounds; (4) the presence of enough wealth in the county to support Carnegie's matching funds requirement; (5) the backing of the local newspaper; (6) the influence of populism; and (7) the presence of general cultural factors--e.g., the public library movement throughout the southeast, the growth of public education, and the relative lack of racial and political turmoil.

        "description":"This report provides technical and scientific information useful for planning a mass deacidification program and choosing mass treatment processes to preserve library and archival paper-based collections. Aimed at institutions investigating mass deacidification as a preservation alternative, the document explains technical and other related factors that decision makers need to consider, as well as a rationale for considering them. The most conservative path to decision making is advocated, with maintaining the safety of the collections given the highest priority. Basic background information about mass deacidification processes is then offered, and reasons for their development are explored. Ways in which mass deacidification differs from single-item treatment are discussed  together with the particular challenges of choosing mass processes. Major emphasis is placed on in-depth analyses of six technical evaluation factors: (1) effectiveness of deacidification procedures; (2) unwanted changes in materials; (3) process engineering; (4) extra benefits from specific processes; (5) toxicity; and (6) environmental impact. Other evaluation issues outlined include unit treatment costs, book and document security, logistical considerations, long-term vendor performance and contracting, observation of facility operation, and liability. Brief explanations of organizational and planning considerations that are of primary importance to the total mass deacidification effort are appended. (SD)",

The first section of the guide, &quot;Online Curriculum,&quot; features an introduction, course objectives, student outcomes, planned course scope and sequence, and sample lesson plans. The second section, &quot;Online Management,&quot; discusses vendors, budget and costs, gateway products, telecommunications, copyright, security, record management, and resource sharing networks. Interlibrary loan, public relations, and alternatives to online searching are also described.

        "description":"Because a right of information privacy is not firmly imbedded in constitutional case law, advocates of the concept that citizens have the right to control personal information held by others turned to Congress. Enacted to regulate the government's use of personal information, the Privacy Act of 1974 has failed to work in the way intended. Shortly after its passage, the political swing away from privacy and toward bureaucratic efficiency revealed the Act's structural and conceptual weaknesses. It is suggested that this act needs to be redrafted to strengthen its major principle--i.e., that information collected for one purpose may not be used for another purpose without the individual's consent. It is also recommended that information legislation restrict access to personal  information held by private institutions. Further, it is felt that public policy is needed in response to advanced information technology that imbues institutions with the power to instantly exchange, compare, verify, profile, and link information in separate databases. This report provides guiding principles for drafting legislation, and concludes that statutory standards should incorporate a balance between the sensitivity of the information at stake and the institutional justification or need for the information.

        "description":"In this policy briefing, the technological developments of recent years are linked to the erosion of individuals' informational privacy under the press of bureaucratic efficiency and the ever-growing needs of executive agencies for more information. It is noted that privacy protection within federal agencies may entail costs, and therefore, may be viewed as a constraint upon or impediment to the agency's mission. Discussion of these considerations points out that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is not likely to actively enforce privacy constraints because its purpose is to pursue cost reduction. It also indicates that data subjects themselves are largely unaware of potential privacy threats posed by information and technology practices, and that they have not organized  into a constituency to focus on the issue. It is concluded that the Privacy Act of 1974 has not accomplished its mission, and that there is no existing device to adequately deal with privacy matters. It is proposed that Congress establish an independent agency charged with the responsibility of protecting federal information privacy. Related constitutional issues are raised, the general contours of an effective privacy protection mechanism are explored, and the makeup of data protection agencies in Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are briefly reviewed.

        "description":"During the past decade the Federal Government has significantly retreated from its historical responsibility to maintain the free flow of information that is essential to maintain a healthy democracy. This responsibility includes the collection of basic data on the health of the economy as well as the dissemination of information that assists and propels public debate. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which has wide-ranging authority over Federal information activities, is the agency primarily responsible for discouraging the flow of public information. It has failed in its mandate to improve Federal information resources management (Circular A-130), deferring to private sector businesses instead of helping agencies to plan for the new electronic information age. Two  areas in which OMB has exercised control over Federal information activities are paperwork reduction and information resources management, and management of Federal information dissemination through reductions in printing of government publications and the privatization of government information dissemination. The consequences of these cutbacks in information activities have been magnified by the current revolution in information technology. Efforts should be made to: (1) articulate a national information policy; (2) reform legislative direction and oversight; (3) reduce centralized political control of Federal agency information activities; and (4) strengthen the capabilities of Federal agencies to control their information activities. Congress and the President must work together to  redirect Federal information policies and practices if the free flow of public information is to be ensured. (SD)",

        "description":"The rapid growth and distribution of scholarly research in the middle and late twentieth century, the limited supply of old books and other paper-based materials, and the deterioration of items printed on acidic paper since the mid-1800s have meant that many libraries lack suitable copies of printed sources that their users would like to read. For some time, libraries have converted books, journals, and newspapers to forms that are more stable, easier and cheaper to copy, and more compact. The most important such form has been microfilm, which is considered a safe, durable, and inexpensive preservation option. Digital imagery is now seen as a viable alternative that offers long-term promise, and is rapidly becoming more accessible to libraries. This report compares digital and  microform imagery and emphasizes that making either kind of copy is preferable to leaving acidic paper to decay. Topics addressed include: (1) preservation alternatives, including chemical deacidification, microform, digital imagery, and ASCII (non-image); (2) storage considerations--i.e., magnetic disk, optical WORM (write-once-read-many) disk, digital videotape, digital audiotape, conventional magnetic tape, CD-ROM, magnetic-optical erasable disk, and digital paper; (3) conversion considerations; and (4) transmission considerations. It is concluded that, because microfilm to digital image conversion is going to be relatively straightforward, and the primary cost of either microfilming or digital scanning is in selecting the book, handling it, and turning the pages, librarians should use  either method as they can manage, expecting to convert to digital form over the next decade.

After finding that students did not tend to order fee-based online searches, the WSU library provided access on a trial basis to bibliographic databases via CD-ROM. After evaluating a number of systems, the library chose InfoTrac because it seemed to be user-friendly and it came equipped with its own hardware. Students in English Department courses were alerted about the new system's arrival because it was thought that InfoTrac might be particularly useful to them. A questionnaire designed by InfoTrac was administered to users. The 50 positive responses (out of 51) reflected that the  system was easy to use and searches yielded favorable results. The one negative comment remarked on InfoTrac's inability to use Boolean logic. The WSU periodicals department observed that students working on assignments in basic English composition courses tended to rely exclusively on InfoTrac for their research, while upper-level students began their searches with InfoTrac but then moved on to specialized printed indexes for more articles. As a result of the trial, it was decided to keep the system. A copy of the user questionnaire is attached, and an addendum notes that the library has since acquired a reference workstation from InfoTrac that contains the General Periodicals Index (Academic Version) and SilverPlatter ERIC. A reference list provides 36 endnotes. (SD)",

Second, the role of government in collecting, maintaining, and publishing information has been curtailed because of reduced federal spending on information resources. The President's policy agendas should include an initiative on information policy with special programs focusing on science, the economy, and national security. The following elements would be included in such an initiative: (1) a review of the system for classifying information; (2) a review of export  controls and related restrictions on the communication of unclassified STI; (3) steps to give Congress and the public time to comment on proposed executive orders and national security directives; (4) interagency deliberations to develop guidelines that protect against undue government control over the content and conclusions of federally sponsored research; (5) actions to limit the role of the Office of Management and Budget; (6) revisions in the Freedom of Information Act to facilitate access to government information; and (7) authorization for the Secretary of Defense to curb inappropriate secrecy in agency budgets.

Issues librarians should consider include how libraries can more effectively support formal literacy education; assist greater numbers of learners and their volunteer tutors; help people whose primary language is not English; cooperate with other agencies in community information and referral; use new technologies to serve learners; help people develop coping skills; extend literacy and other services to minorities, to people in penal institutions, and to rural populations; and mobilize community, state, and federal action in behalf of literacy. To this end, librarians can: (1) contact  their state library to determine whether the state is holding a pre-WHCLIS conference; (2) secure the names of individuals responsible for WHCLIS planning; (3) apprise the president of the state library association and of the International Reading Association of an interest in literacy and willingness to provide input to WHCLIS pre-conferences; and (4) sponsor speakers representing the various WHCLIS program teams at schools, churches, libraries, professional organizations, and clubs.

Following a &quot;Review and Preview&quot; by Martha Hale, Dean of the School of Library and Information Management, three of the major speeches are presented in this collection. In the first paper, &quot;Libraries and Economic Development: Reality and Potential,&quot; Kansas State Librarian Duane Johnson articulates the Kansas Economic Development Information Network, a vision for the future. In the second paper, &quot;Economic Development in a Small Rural Community,&quot; Mary Alice Harvey recounts her experiences as Director of the Grand Marais Public  Library, Minnesota, making many of those present aware of economic development activities that can be a part of daily operations in a small town library in a rural area. In the third paper, &quot;Libraries Mean Business,&quot; Sarah Long, Director of the Library Association of Portland, Oregon, describes major projects that demonstrate one public library's success at playing a role in local economic development in an urban setting. Also included is a 22-item annotated bibliography compiled by Margaret Anderson, Director of the Fort Scott (Kansas) Public Library, that describes resources useful to public librarians interested in economic development in local communities.

        "description":"A series of recollections, memoirs, and anecdotes, this short autobiographical sketch focuses on former American Library Association (ALA) President Robert Vosper's involvement in the international library community from World War II until the 1980s. The work opens with reminiscences of acquiring foreign materials in 1944 while working at the University of California at Los Angeles. One story recalls how an order for the last installment of a publication from England arrived 6 years late, accompanied by an apologetic note explaining that it was delayed because (1) all of the type had been destroyed by air raids, and (2) some of the newly set proofs had later been lost at sea. Tales are shared about the founding of the Farmington Plan, which helped coordinate academic libraries'  acquisitions, and about several of the key players in this effort who would later turn up as leaders in various positions within the library community. Vosper also relates his experiences as a Guggenheim Fellow in Great Britain and Italy, his association with the U.S. Information Service, and observations on his experiences while touring libraries throughout Western and Eastern Europe. Much of the narrative is devoted to Vosper's orientation to and high level of activity in the International Federation of Library Associations, and provides insights into the development of this organization.

        "description":"Over the past 25 years, five large-scale research studies of community college students have been conducted in North Carolina, involving cooperation between Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the North Carolina Department of Community Colleges. The different research strategies employed in these studies can be seen as taking one of three forms: the Traditional Researcher Dominated Strategy; the Researcher Dominated with Limited Client Involvement Strategy; and the Researcher-Client Collaborative Strategy. By examining and contrasting these three approaches, referred to collectively as &quot;action research&quot; strategies, this paper seeks to identify the specific strategy that provides for optimum levels of involvement, impact, and overall effectiveness. After an  introductory section, the paper reviews the essential principles and concepts of action research and presents a model identifying strategies which would maximize the linkages between the university researcher, community college administrators, and the sponsors of the research. The list of the critical stages in the action research process identifies the following eight steps: (1) legitimization of the effort; (2) problem definition; (3) development of the plan; (4) data collection and preliminary analysis; (5) feedback to the client group; (6) joint diagnosis and planning; (7) action; and (8) evaluation. The paper then uses these eight stages as criteria to evaluate the three different research strategies. Examining extent of usage of study results, comparisons of study impact, comments  from college and system staff, and study response rates, the paper concludes that the Researcher-Client Collaborative Strategy, involving more direct participation of system and college personnel and more direct application of study results, is the optimum model.

        "description":"Sacramento City College (SCC) is enrolling a growing population of minority students requiring English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) training. This shift in demographics has resulted in two major challenges for SCC faculty: a visible language barrier between them and their students, and also a more subtle and critical &quot;culture conflict&quot; between faculty and students. While early college ESL efforts, such as tutoring and special courses, were directed at the students themselves, more recently, a new program has been developed to address the needs of faculty. Faculty were recruited to participate in the training program and queried on their perceived needs. A handbook was developed to serve as the text for an inservice training program. Phase I of the project consisted of a 2-day  summer workshop for full-time faculty, focusing on the language and cultural barriers facing ESL students and ideas for developing customized teaching strategies to meet the unique needs of these students. In phase II, which involved both full- and part-time faculty, a 1-day workshop was held during the semester break, focusing on cultural conflict and its resolution. Phase III brought ESL and vocational faculty together on the development of a vocational ESL (VESL) course emphasizing listening comprehension. As a result of concerns about vocational students' failure to enroll in ESL courses, SCC initiated an enhanced and expanded counseling/orientation/assessment program to insure a higher level of participation in appropriate ESL courses by vocational education students. The new program  will include early identification of ESL students in the admissions process, use of multiple assessment instruments, and targeted orientation and counseling. Ethnic enrollment data tables are included. (JMC)",

The program is administered by a committee of five people who represent the five major employee groups at the college (i.e., senior administration, middle administration, support staff and executive secretaries, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, and faculty). The REACH program has four major components. First, a referral service assists employees and their families in accessing initial, short-term counseling programs or services in the community. From 1987 to 1989, 68 people were referred to outside agencies through the service. Second, a peer support component trains individuals from all levels of  college staff to help other employees to deal with problems. Though only 9% of the RDC staff had used the peer support services, 82% of employees knew of their existence. Third, a wellness component focuses on providing such special employee programs as workshops on weight management, aging, financial matters, fitness, and mental health. Over a 3-year period, 719 employees have participated in these programs. The fourth and newest aspect of the program is the development of a collection of print and non-print resources for employees. Information on program costs and future goals, and comments from a program review are included. (GFW)",

Institutions were asked to describe the frequency with which they employed various transfer strategies, their method of identifying transfer students, and their approach to calculating institutional transfer statistics. Study findings, based on a 39.4% response rate, included the following: (1) the institutions utilized written articulation agreements (85%), course equivalency guides (81%), and transfer counselors (81%); (2) additional transfer  strategies employed included joint degree programs, dual registration, transfer information centers, intercollegiate relations commissions, and guaranteed admissions to receiving institutions; (3) the most popular methods used to identify students who transferred were graduate follow-up surveys, estimates/guesses, state reporting systems, documentation of transcript requests, and information obtained from senior institutions; and (4) most institutions based transfer statistics on recent associate degree graduates or students enrolled in transfer curricula, producing higher transfer rates than institutions considering the entire student population in estimating transfer rates.

        "description":"In an effort to curb high first-year attrition rates and to motivate students from a state of passive learning to one of active participation, Bergen Community College implemented a program of peer teaching-learning and group inquiry strategies in a preclinical dental hygiene course. To determine freshman students' learning styles, the following tools were employed: weekly student interviews; a checklist of interests and skills; interest in the syllabus; background knowledge probes; journal-keeping by students; autobiographical sketches; study habit inventories. In addition, a colleague visited the classes to observe students' learning styles, take notes on the classroom environment, and assist the instructor in zeroing in on class reactions to planned teaching strategies. As the  semester progressed, the traditional lecture format was increasing replaced by group inquiry and collaborative learning. For example, after new instruments were briefly introduced in lectures, the actual use of the instruments on manikins and fellow students was learned through the group inquiry strategy. Student interviews and journals indicated that students were more comfortable learning from each other, and that they learned the usage of instruments at a faster pace. The instructor emerged as a resource person rather than an authority figure. Peer involvement diminished competitiveness, fostered professional partnerships, reduced anxiety, increased motivation, and facilitated active involvement in the learning process. (JMC)",

        "description":"Over the past 10 years, Austin Community College (ACC) has expanded college offerings from 41 degree programs, 24 degree options, and 1 certificate program to 60 degree plans, 35 degree options, and 22 certificate programs. In addition, ACC has grown from an enrollment of 13,000 credit students to over 24,000 students. During the past 5 years, minority full-time faculty have increased from 12% to 20% of the faculty. Changes in the economy, growing enrollments, demands of local businesses, new legislative mandates for minimal skills competency among degree students, and lagging state funding require careful planning to meet the institution's future needs. Consistent with its focus on accessibility and flexibility, ACC has plans to: (1) initiate new curricular programs in service  sector occupations; (2) become a continuing education center for governmental employees; (3) develop a pre-education curriculum for future teachers; and (4) include an entrepreneurship track in the mid-management curriculum. To help meet the demands for a world class workforce, ACC will develop articulation agreements with independent school districts and adopt a core requirement in computer competency. To better fulfill its fourfold mission of quality, flexibility, accessibility, and diversity, ACC will implement an honors program, an international studies curriculum, 2 + 2 programs, and a mentoring program for underprepared students. Other college goals include increasing the number of minority instructors, developing a minority leadership program, and establishing a mentorship program  for minority secondary school students.

This report provides excerpts from six of the presentations given to the assembly. First, Mike Nettles discusses the collection methods, content, and scope of the various types of available data on transfer, and reviews evaluative purposes those data might serve. Next, Burton R. Clark emphasizes the \"public accountability\" factor served by data collection, suggesting that the collection of data on transfer prompts honest self-reporting and promotes both the institutional integrity of, and public respect for, the community  college. Next, Jim Palmer underscores the importance of developing an operational definition for the calculation of transfer rates. Then, Louis Bender discusses the increasing influence of state legislatures through the passage of resolutions and provisions relating to transfer and articulation, and the growing national concern for transfer/articulation problems. Next, Charles McIntyre addresses the issue of data standardization, longitudinal data collection, and guidelines for the use of accountability data. Finally, Judith Eaton uses a hypothetical conversation between a wealthy benefactor and an evasive, ill-informed community college president to illustrate the inability of community college officials to provide meaningful, intelligent information about the institutional transfer  experience.

The survey targeted three groups of former LCC students: all 1988-89 graduates who earned degrees or certificates, all no-formal-award leavers with 70 or more credits, and all early leavers who had earned less than 70 credits while attending LCC. The data were classified by whether the respondent was a declared vocational major or a lower division transfer student. For the student survey, 289 usable questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 68.2%. The employer section of the survey was sent to all supervisors of those student respondents who agreed to have their employers surveyed, and 91 completed surveys were returned. Major findings of the surveys included  the following: (1) a majority of the no-formal-award leavers and lower division transfer students were attending a four-year institution full or part time; (2) over 75% of the graduates and 60% of the no-formal-award leavers and early leavers were employed full or part time; (3) graduates were more likely than no-formal-award leavers and early leavers to be employed in fields related to their LCC training; (4) 78.5% of the graduates agreed \"very much\" with the statement that they had accomplished their goals at LCC; (5) average employer ratings of employees' personal skills were very high; and (6) employers rated specific vocational skills and general technical skills lower than personal skills.

The study was designed to determine the length of time it took a sample of CCC graduates to receive a two-year degree. Data for the study were drawn from computerized and hard-copy student records, including the number of hours enrolled and earned each semester (including summers), the CCC college attended (or an indication of the nature of the non-CCC college attended), and the number of hours earned at each college. Major findings of the study included the following: (1) the average time between first enrollment at CCC and the receipt of a degree was 5.9 years; (2) only 61 students received their degree  in 2 years or less, with most taking from 2 to 8 years and 50 taking 20 years or more; (3) three out of five graduates took time off while pursuing their degrees; (4) on average, graduates enrolled for 9.2 semesters, with only 35 graduates completing their degrees in four semesters; (5) 72% of the graduates combined part-time and full-time enrollment, with only 20% continually enrolled full time; and (6) based on limited comparative data, CCC enrollment patterns appeared to be similar to those of associate degree recipients at many other institutions and reflected the general trend toward longer enrollment periods in American public higher education.

        "description":"Since 1984, the California community colleges have charged an enrollment fee of $5 per credit unit for all students. A 1987 study revealed that the fee contributed to an enrollment decline during the first year, especially among low-income and part-time students, and that the Board Financial Assistance Program (BFAP) for low-income students did not significantly compensate for the fee's impact. In subsequent years, however, enrollment stabilized, and there was a return of low-income and minority students. The statutes authorizing the enrollment fee expire in January 1992. If the fees are not reauthorized, the colleges would lose about $70 million annually, one or more programs would lose funding, and there would be no mechanisms for distributing BFAP funds to low-income students.  To forestall these problems and promote the enrollment of underrepresented groups, the following policies have been proposed: (1) apply a cost of living adjustment to the fee that would raise it to $6 per unit up to $60 per semester in an estimated 3 to 4 years; (2) continue the present BFAP program; (3) increase the health fee maximum from $7.50 per semester to $10 per semester and continue to exempt BFAP recipients from this fee; (4) remove the mandate that all colleges must maintain their 1987 level of health services; (5) clarify and standardize practices involving instructional materials charges. Appendixes summarize principles and policies on fees and financial aid, costs of attending a community college full time, distribution of community college students by income level,  financial assistance awarded in 1984-85 and 1989-90, and statewide general fund revenues.

        "description":"The renewed emphasis on the community college transfer function has both positive and negative aspects. On one hand, the creation of articulation agreements, transfer centers, consortia, and national centers promises to reduce the barriers between two- and four-year colleges, enhance the mobility of minority students, and improve teaching and learning. On the other hand, raising the academic emphasis of the community college above all other purposes might weaken the comprehensive nature of these institutions and still fail to improve transfer rates. The decline in transfer rates is due to a host of causes, many of which not effectively addressed by articulation agreements or transfer centers. These factors include the rise of vocational programs relative to academic programs,  nontraditional attendance patterns, declining achievement in high school, and declining federal financial aid. Efforts to enhance the transfer function should promote the other purposes of the comprehensive community college as well, including: (1) providing low-cost/low-risk options for \"experimenters\" and \"undecided\" students; (2) integrating academic and vocational education; (3) making developmental education more effective; and (4) minimizing the tracking of \"low-ability\" students into vocational programs and otherwise preserving educational equity. Community colleges will improve transfer rates and the college as a whole by focusing on: initial student assessment and counseling, remediation centers linked to both academic and vocational programs, coherent sequences of courses, the  gathering of comprehensive information on student progress and follow-up statistics, improved instruction, placement and transfer centers, increased student financial aid, and better preparation of high school students for college-level work.

        "description":"Part of a series of reports on transfer research conducted by the Community College of Philadelphia (CCP), these three reports examine transfer outcomes among former CCP students who matriculated at four-year universities in Pennsylvania. The first report compares CCP transfer student outcomes at Temple, LaSalle, West Chester, Widener, and Thomas Jefferson Universities, examining admissions outcomes, grade point averages (GPA's), program enrollment, and persistence patterns. The second report examines specific transfer outcomes among 100 former CCP students who enrolled at Widener University between fall 1984 and spring 1989, focusing on CCP program of study and credits earned, as well as persistence, graduation, and dismissal patterns at Widener. The third report provides a  brief review of the transfer outcomes of 47 former CCP students accepted for the 1987-88 school year at Hahnemann University, examining retention rates and GPA's at the start of the second year. Results of the studies included the following: (1) acceptance rates for CCP students were highest at LaSalle; (2) among students attending universities that provided GPA data, students at Temple were most likely to have a GPA above 2.0; (3) graduation rates were highest at Widener University; (4) students at Widener who had earned more than 55 credits at CCP were the most likely to be dismissed from Widener for academic reasons; and (5) 82.9% of the first-year CCP transfer students at Hahnemann University earned an average GPA of 2.46 and continued on for a second year.

Ingram Technical College (JFITC) in Alabama. Designed to serve the professional development needs of support staff, apprentice and master teachers, and administrators, the model provides for vertical and horizontal occupational movement and for increasing knowledge and skills to levels commensurate with present job positions and future aspirations. To develop the support staff component of the model, job and task analyses were conducted for each position, time on task estimates were developed, educational requirements were identified, a conference was held to develop a needs plan, educational/work experiences were  reviewed, desired changes in job responsibilities were implemented, and a professional development plan was developed and agreed upon for each support staff member. The instructional staff component of the model involved the classification of the teaching staff as master or apprentice teachers, an annual conference review, an annual meeting with a TRIAD committee (comprised of a supervisor, professional development staff member, and university teacher educator), in-house learning activities, and the development of individual professional development plans. The administrative component also included input from the TRIAD committee, an annual conference and review, and professional development plans. During the model's implementation, morale was identified as the single most important  influence on job satisfaction, and project staff utilized a variety of approaches to improve morale and provide a stress-free environment. A flowchart of the model is attached. (JMC)",

        "author":["White, Maureen E."],
        "description":"Enrollment statistics and projections confirm the importance of focusing community college student recruitment and retention efforts on re-entry students. Re-entry students are a distinct and growing population whose educational requirements often differ from those of younger, traditional students. The literature on adult learners indicates that: (1) among the variety of reasons that adults return to school are that they have advanced as far as possible in their career field, they are demoralized by working long hours for low pay, or that their credentials are out-of-date; (2) curricula and instruction for adults should build on their prior learning and experiences; and (3) adult learners tend to be goal-oriented, interested in putting their knowledge to practical use, and  affected by situational, dispositional, and institutional barriers to formal education. Marketing a community college education to this group should take advantage of existing knowledge about adult learners' goals, characteristics, and needs to select an appropriate communication method and message. While marketing efforts are being undertaken to sell the community college's &quot;products,&quot; public relations efforts should focus on selling the college itself, with the lessons of communications theory applied to both efforts. Building upon the principles of marketing, public relations, and communication theory, and drawing from research findings on the effectiveness of various recruitment methods and programs for re-entry students, Sacramento City College (SCC) has developed two proposals to  restructure and expand the college's re-entry program. One calls for the development of a comprehensive community relations plan based on other SCC recruitment models and re-entry programs to be incorporated into the college's overall marketing plan. The other calls for the development of a video to inform the community about re-entry education and promote SCC. Timelines, budgets, and an 83-item bibliography are included. (AYC)",

The sample was drawn from nine schools, three schools for each stream. Participants were 1,165 eighth and tenth graders. Measures included Biggs' Learning Process Questionnaire items and additional items concerning languages, social studies, mathematics, and sciences. Findings based on responses to English and mathematics questionnaires revealed significant differences in the choice of learning strategies of students in the normal track and those in the other two tracks. Students in the normal track indicated use of inappropriate learning strategies in both language and mathematics  courses. Further examination seems to suggest that normal students lacked confidence and security. Strategies used by students in the special and express tracks indicated that they understood the special features of the subjects and had the confidence needed to explore alternative routes in problem solving. It is concluded that if normal track pupils are to achieve satisfactory scores on academic examinations, they may have to revise their learning strategies. However, they may not be able to do so without help from their teachers. English and mathematics learning strategy questionnaires are included in the text. (RH)",

While modern families are structurally diverse, they function in the traditional way as the primary places where persons care for each other; produce, consume, and distribute goods and services; and try to satisfy family members' emotional needs. What is truly notable about today's family is the proportion of young women with children who have entered the labor force or remained  in the labor force while their children are young. Several considerations suggest that women are in the labor force to stay. Increasingly under pressure, the family is no longer a refuge, but has become a zone from which members seek refuge in individual pursuits. To respond to the needs of families in the 21st century, Canadians will have to recognize and respect the diversity of family forms and be sensitive to the particular circumstances of families which they seek to help and support.

While childhood poverty is closely related to a number of factors pertaining to the structure and functioning of families, such as parental marital status and wage-earning patterns, the poverty of children is a consequence of the poverty of families. As such, childhood poverty can be reduced or eliminated only indirectly through policies oriented toward improving families' financial security. The incidence of poverty among Canada's children is itself a function of the more general erosion of the nation's commitment to its children. Contrary to current opinion, the interests of poor children and their parents will not be effectively advanced by reducing the modest amount of support provided to relatively advantaged children  and their parents. Family allowances and tax provisions are not welfare measures for the middle-class. They are, rather, the only measures through which Canadians have provided a minimal, yet tangible, acknowledgement of the costs incurred by parents in raising the next generation of citizens. There is much that can and should be done to supplement the capacities of families to care for their children. (RH)",

        "description":"Recent statistics on the Canadian family suggest that, for many families, family life is now characterized by exhaustion, deprivation, older members, and the provision of support services by agencies rather than by unpaid women. Stress, in particular, is an effect of heavy burdens and a cause of new ones. But families cannot be adequately understood apart from the economic system in which they live. For example, as families juggle work and family responsibilities, absenteeism in the workplace increases. Stress caused by preoccupation with family responsibilities can substantially reduce productivity on the job. Many Canadian employers believe that at least one quarter of the human resource problems they face are due to employees having to manage dual responsibilities at home and  at work. Governments can demonstrate leadership in making work and family responsibilities more compatible by: (1) enacting legislation that creates a responsive work environment; (2) demonstrating flexible employment practices; and (3) facilitating the development of new approaches conducive to the social change associated with a better balance between work and family responsibilities. Strategies that integrate workers with family responsibilities into corporate structures are emerging in a number of Canadian corporations and organizations. These strategies include flexible benefit programs, employee familiy benefits, and services and supports for employees' family members. (RH)",

One of the significant changes has been the increase in the number of women with paying jobs outside the home. This change has not necessarily caused families to be better off economically. Today, both spouses working full time at minimum wage can earn only 92 percent of the poverty line for a family of three. In a world where two paychecks are increasingly essential for family survival, single parents have a particularly tough time. Canadian families have shown resiliency in surviving severe threats, but any working parent knows that the linear requirements of work do not fit with the cyclical responsibilities of family life. There are  important consequences to juggling these two separate worlds. In particular, dual-wage and single-parent wage-earning families seem to have a steady diet of overload and need all possible support. Unfortunately, that support is rarely available at present. Employers increasingly provide a range of leaves and flexible working conditions, but they must also change corporate culture to encourage the use of these benefits by individuals with caregiving responsibilities. The ethical, legal, and human dilemmas brought about by the new reproductive technologies constitute yet another challenge to those that families must face as Canada moves into the 21st century.

        "description":"Kentucky's PACE program, which was designed to provide adult basic education and parenting skills training for parents, early childhood education for children, and parent-child interaction and learning, lacks proof for the validity of its theoretical base and service model. Questions that need to be resolved before widespread replication of the PACE program occurs include the following: (1) Is there a causal relationship between family background and children's educational and social outcomes? (2) Will changes in family attitudes and behaviors change children's outcomes? (3) Can replication of the program in different settings by different providers reproduce original effects? Program review produced a statement of the theoretical model implied by the program's assumptions. The  model consisted of hypotheses about family background, children's outcomes, and PACE services. Drawing from the literature on family background and child learning, an explanatory model includes hypotheses about the causes of undereducation. A prevention and remediation model includes hypotheses about the effect of PACE services on the amelioration of literacy problems related to family factors. The present paper presents these hypotheses along with ideas about how they might be tested. Concluding material offers a strategy for evaluating the program. (RH)",

        "description":"This attempt to explain cooperative goal structures as instances of social affordances begins with a description of Gibson's concept of affordance. &quot;Affordances&quot; are conceptualized as properties of the environment relative to an animal. The concept's parallel theoretic development in Lewin's notion of psychological ecology and the advancement of this notion by Lewin's students are considered. Central to the discussion are the concept of a synomorph, or behavior setting, and the idea that behavior patterns may be either synomorphus with behavior settings or inappropriate. It is suggested that behavior settings may be conceptualized as affordances, which more or less support appropriate and socially competent actions of children, and that Gibson's idea of an affordance might be an  excellent way of describing lesson types. It is suggested that each of Kounin and Gump's (1974) six lesson types may afford more or less task appropriate behaviors. Further dimensions of social affordances may be elaborated by descriptions of lessons in terms of Johnson's goal structures and signal system terminology. Also considered are Stodolsky's (1988) ideas on the importance of the complexity and novelty of the information in a signal. A figure categorizes cooperative learning methods according to the variables of incentive and task structures. (RH)",

A young child named Anna, living in a bilingual environment in which English and Finnish were spoken, was observed and her speech recorded. This discussion focuses on aspects of Anna's acquisition of language. Initial discussion works toward a definition of bilingualism and describes the social experiences of the bilingual child and the effects of bilingualism on the child. Daily observation and recording of the child's speech revealed that the majority language, which, after a move from Finland to the United States, changed from Finnish to English, emerged quickly from a receptive stage and moved to a productive stage. While Anna was able to conduct role-play exclusively in English 4 weeks after  entering nursery school in Mississippi, emotional attachment to certain Finnish words was evident. Extensive examples of Anna's code-switching, keeping the languages separate, self-correcting behavior, literacy learning, learning to count, concept acquisition, and second language maintenance, are provided. Concluding remarks focus on the role of the teacher with bilingual students in the classroom. (RH)",

        "description":"In recent years, the interest in how children spend their out-of-school time has resulted in program development projects at the local and state level and has influenced state and federal policymakers to propose legislation supportive of school-age child care programs. Gubernatorial and legislative efforts have succeeded in several states. Successful policy proposals involve enabling legislation that encourages public school space for before- and after-school programs in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Arizona, and full-scale funding programs for school-age child care in California, Indiana, and New York. Under the federal Dependent Care Grants Program (DCGP), states can apply for funds to set up school-age child care programs. The DCGP has been reauthorized by Congress at 20  million dollars per year for fiscal years 1987-1990. While there are many possibilities for policy initiatives, particular attention should be directed to the needs of children of minority families in poverty. This publication's working list of state policy initiatives on school-age child care provides brief summaries of state initiatives followed by more extensive state-by-state descriptions. (RH)",

        "description":"This study of the influence of social context on children's learning investigated the functions of literacy-based verbal exchanges of 37 preschoolers in a print-enriched play environment. Play settings in two preschool classrooms were enriched with print materials and literacy-related props. Four play settings were created: post office, library, office, and kitchen. Literacy props, such as stamps and recipe cards, were added to the play settings on the basis of appropriateness, authenticity, and utility. Children's play behavior was recorded by means of extensive observations over a 2-month period. A total of 67 literacy-related conversational episodes were isolated and analyzed. The three types of discourse about literacy identified were those used for: (1) designating the names  of literacy-related objects, pictures, or texts; (2) negotiating meaning related to literacy topics or routines, such as mailing a letter; and (3) coaching another child in some literacy task, such as spelling words or forming letters, in order to achieve a goal in play. It is concluded that provision of literacy tools and authentic literacy contexts in play inducts children into the culture of literacy, where they may ultimately adopt the discourse patterns, ways of knowing, and cultural practices of the literate community.

It is argued that in many ways, the project approach reflects the cognitive-developmental view; that it is a convergence of Piaget's constructivism and Dewey's progressivism. Like any approach, the project approach is a way of teaching, learning, and thinking about children, learning, and knowledge. The project approach views the child as active, individual, and whole. Children are unique in terms of experience, perceptions, understandings, and interests. This uniqueness should be the school's starting point in fostering continuous growth and development. To understand the physical environment and know the functions of things, children should have  hands-on experience in interacting with and manipulating objects. Learning that is focused on both the physical and social environment involves knowledge, skills, disposition, and feelings. It is concluded that what is required in preschool and kindergarten is an intellectually oriented approach in which children interact in small groups as they work together on a variety of projects which help them make sense of their experience.

More children are in child care than in the past, and there has been a significant move toward center-based care. Preschoolers, particularly those from relatively well-off families, are increasingly enrolled in prekindergarten. Declining family size and recent American prosperity have created material well-being for most of today's children. But the development of an underclass has also increased the number of children trapped in poverty. Stagnant wages of the working poor and the growing number of mother-only households have  exacerbated income inequality among children. The decline in educational achievement scores of the 1970s has ended, and average school performance has improved in the 1980s. An increased number of students, especially blacks, completed high school in the 1980s. The physical health of the average American child has improved dramatically since 1960. But the picture is marred by the problematic future of the children of the underclass and the uncertain psychological impact of America's transformed family life. (RH)",

The program was first implemented in the 1987-88 school year in Abbottson Elementary School in Baltimore. First year results revealed substantially higher student performance in language and reading, and substantially reduced student retention and placement in special classes in comparison with a matched school. This paper adds four major sets of findings to the earlier study. The discussion covers: (1) results of the second year of program implementation at the pilot school; (2) the evaluation of a replication of Success for All in its fully funded form in one of the poorest elementary schools  in Baltimore; (3) the evaluation of a form of Success for All designed to be implemented under Chapter 1 schoolwide funds with relatively minor additional costs; and (4) the evaluation of the beginning reading component of the program. Sections of the document detail program elements, variations, evaluation design, and results. Findings imply that the insuring of kindergarten children's success at school may almost eliminate the need for retention in grade and placement in special classes. (RH)",

Effects of middle grades practices on course-taking opportunities were also examined in an effort to gain insight into the ways in which learning opportunities can be expanded through school restructuring. Findings indicate that schools that serve disadvantaged young adolescents are as likely as other schools to offer students substantial instruction in basic academic subjects, but are less  likely to offer extensive remedial programs, advanced courses, or instructional methods that promote active or higher-order learning. Schools for the disadvantaged are less likely than other schools to offer a rich array of exploratory courses, &quot;minicourses,&quot; or extracurricular activities for students, but are equally likely to use responsive practices in the middle grades. Schools with a high proportion of minority students are less likely to offer instruction for active learning, higher-order thinking, or enriched electives. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This study uses data from a national survey of principals of public schools with a 7th grade to document and analyze the variation in the types of marks and evaluations included on report cards issued to young adolescents in the United States. The analyses examine the prevalence of report card entries of various types and the antecedents and consequences of using specific types of entries. Principals report that performance grades are widespread, handwritten comments and conduct grades are common, and progress and effort grades are rare. Although grade span, region, size of grade enrollment, and urbanicity have some important connections to report card practices, there is considerable variation in practices among schools with similar grade spans, locations, or grade enrollments.  Use of progress grades or handwritten comments on report cards is significantly associated with middle grades principals' reports of lower retention rates, lower projected dropout rates for males, and more successful middle grades programs. It is suggested that the actual benefits to students when they receive comments on each report card from each teacher are probably greater than the average benefits reported here. (Author/RH)",

An introductory section provides background information on educational trends involved in efforts to revise state standards for licensing teachers. The general structure of the license is presented and four distinguishing characteristics are discussed. They are: (1) increased emphasis on the development of children from conception through their eighth year; (2) strong emphasis on family and community involvement; (3) pervasive emphasis on teacher knowledge and skills related to observation and assessment of children; and (4) the integration of teacher communication, assessment, and parent relation skills. The major part of the document consists of the  official public statements setting forth Tennessee's early childhood education teacher licensure standards and related guidelines, both of which are appended. Standards concern licensure and teacher competencies regarding general, professional, and early childhood education in the areas of human growth, development, and learning; family and community involvement; the planning and facilitating of development; communication and language arts; reading; mathematics; social studies and history; science; foreign language; health and safety; physical education; and arts education.

The project was designed for infants and children from socioeconomically disadvantaged families. It provided interventions at the preschool and primary school levels. A day care center provided direct instruction to infants and children and educational materials to parents. Parents used the materials at home with their children to supplement the primary school curriculum. Participants were 109 families of children who were free of conditions known to have genetic or infectious  links to mental retardation and who came from homes with low levels of parental income and education or histories of social maladjustment. Duration and type of intervention were systematically varied. Each high-risk subject was matched with a same-sex child in his or her class. Findings demonstrated that early educational intervention could significantly benefit children at high risk for academic failure. Results suggest that intervention should begin in infancy. Children who appear to benefit most are those of mothers with very low intelligence. A total of 33 references are cited. (RH)",

Subjects were 83 low-income parents whose children were judged to be at risk for academic problems associated with mild mental retardation. Children from the at-risk subjects' kindergarten classes were randomly chosen to provide a local population comparison group. The preschool intervention consisted of a systematic program that provided intellectual stimulation for  infants and preschoolers in a day care setting. The school-age intervention consisted of supplementary learning activities that parents could implement with their children and that were delivered in biweekly home visits of a home-school resource teacher. Findings indicated that mothers of at-risk children in the preschool intervention group scored lower than other mothers on traditional beliefs. Such parental beliefs were negatively correlated with children's achievement in reading. Parents of at-risk children differed from control group parents in beliefs and values. Maternal IQ and authoritarian beliefs may both be implicated in differences in parenting style which impact children's language development and eventual literacy. References number 34. (RH)",

Subjects were 61 children whose pretest scores on 14 balance beam problems that allowed reliable assessment at five increasingly sophisticated levels of thinking were at rule level two or three. Target children were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Children were paired with another child whose thinking was at the same or a higher level or were not paired at all. Pair members took turns predicting the movements of the beam which would result from the placing of weights at various distances from the fulcrum. If pair members disagreed in their predictions,  they were left alone to discuss the problem and arrive at one answer. Half the children received immediate feedback on their joint solution; half received no feedback. It was hypothesized that: (1) children who worked with a partner would improve more than those who had no partner; (2) children who received feedback would improve more than those who did not; and (3) children whose partner was more competent and who received feedback would improve the most. The second hypothesis was supported by findings of posttests administered a week and a month after the treatment. Only in the absence of feedback did children suffer from the lack of a partner.

Kagan, entitled \"Excellence in Early Childhood Education: Defining Characteristics and Next-Decade Strategies,\" that analyzes the field of early childhood education and defines excellence in terms of quality, equality, and integrity. The critical component of quality is discussed in terms of research findings and difficulties in maintaining high quality programs. The neglected component of equality involves several kinds of inequality in communities and states. These include segregation by income, race, and stringency of regulation. Such segregation results from the absence of federal standards. The unconsidered component of integrity involves the linking of disparate parts in a field that is characterized by  acrimony and competition among providers. Concluding material describes three strategies that offer hope that the field can develop from well-intentioned, piecemeal programs to comprehensive services. These strategies involve moving from a program approach to a systems approach, from a piecemeal vision to an integrated vision, and from short-term or quick-fix strategies to long-term thinking that confirms commitment to young children by matching rhetoric with financial support.

        "description":"The State of Alaska spends 75% of its operating revenues on transfer payments to individuals and local governments and on salaries and benefits of state workers. By the year 2000, dwindling petroleum revenues will result in a projected $1 billion gap between state income and spending, but inflation and growing population could widen that gap to $1.3 billion. This paper presents profiles of Alaska's 10 largest transfer programs, examining past, current, and projected costs; program beneficiaries; economic effects; and possible alternatives. These programs are the: (1) Permanent Fund Dividend Program; (2) Longevity Bonus Program; (3) Power Cost Equalization Program; (4) School Foundation Program, which pays 60-75% of school operating costs; (5) School Debt Reimbursement Program,  which pays 80% of the debt service on bonds for school facilities construction; (6) Pupil Transportation Aid, which reimburses school districts for most student transportation costs; (7) Revenue Sharing Program; (8) Municipal Assistance Program; (9) Public Assistance Programs; and (10) Medical Assistance Payments. Details are also provided on state payroll and employee benefits. Alaska spends much more per capita than any other state, partly because of its special environmental and demographic features, but mostly because of: (1) its unique programs; (2) higher spending for traditional government services; and (3) significantly higher spending on state workers, even after allowing for Alaska's higher living costs. This paper contains numerous graphics and charts to illustrate the  discussion. (SV)",

        "description":"This paper examines existing research regarding the problem of school dropouts. It examines the historical context of the problem and discusses current definitions and methods for identifying dropout characteristics and computing dropout rates. Few incentives exist for accurate record-keeping on dropouts. School finances are often linked to attendance reports, a circumstance that creates a conflict of interest for schools and administrators. Also, the varied methods districts use to determine enrollment alter the reported dropout rates. At the state level, education agencies should consider establishing common dropout definitions, methods for collecting data, and student tracking systems. In Maine, officials have become increasingly active in attempts to lower the dropout rate,  which is reported annually as a percentage of fall enrollment. The state's average rate has stabilized at about 4% during the past 5 years. National computations show Maine's 79% graduation rate as being relatively high compared to the 71% national average. Many researchers have attempted to identify national dropout characteristics, looking at such factors as academic achievement, socioeconomic background, family background, individual attitudes, and ethnicity. Responsibility for the problem has been placed alternatively on the schools, society, and students themselves. An analysis of dropout programs and literature reveals a combination of prevention strategies, including non-punitive approaches, alternative school schedules, and modifying or rescinding policies that tend to discourage  at-risk students. The traditional dropout prevention method has been segregation and remediation. The document concludes by calling for consensus on a national dropout definition, systematic research, and better understanding of the problem. It includes a bibliography with approximately 100 citations. (TES)",

        "author":["Johnson, Thomas G."],
        "description":"This paper sketches several successful community economic development programs that have implications for rural education. Case studies are used to discuss community characteristics that contribute to development success. In Virginia, a Community Certification Program offers statewide business recruitment services to communities that meet program standards. A $500,000 economic development fund in northern Vermont makes loans to promising businesses which cannot get bank funding. In many areas, venture capital clubs and business incubators increase the range of resources available to entrepreneurs. Nash Technical College in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, created thousands of jobs by drawing a firm to that state with the offer of specialized training for its employees. Hocking  Technical College in Ohio offers on-the-job training by operating its own businesses, including a sawmill, a hotel, and a retail business. In Canton, Illinois, a library developed a database on the city's resources that eventually served a local business incubator project. In Virginia, businesses donated goods and services to build an industrial park. Public-private partnerships allow businesses to contribute to education in other ways. The Rural Entrepreneurship through Action Learning program in several Southern states helps students start their own small businesses. The paper suggests that successful community development cases are usually innovative, offer real advantages to the firms involved, and often involve an individual leader who serves as a catalyst. These factors are very  difficult to replicate but they suggest that good rural development efforts start with leadership, entrepreneurship, and ingenuity. (TES)",

The district's bilingual education staff attempted to locate a commercially developed instrument that could be used to measure the various levels of oral and listening proficiency of their limited English proficient students. The staff agreed that an effective English language proficiency test would: (1) measure a wide range of basic interpersonal communication skills and beginning to intermediate cognitive academic language proficiency skills; (2) assess oral and listening comprehension; (3) provide levels of proficiency, K-12;  (4) be diagnostic and prescriptive; (5) be easy to administer, score, and interpret; (6) provide approximate placement to grade level; (7) have a high degree of interrater reliability; and (8) meet testing standards of validity, reliability and appropriate norming. These were the criteria used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the following tests: (1) Language Assessment Scales I and II; (2) Basic Inventory of Natural Language; (3) Idea Oral Language Proficiency Test I and II; (4) Comprehensive English Language Test Secondary; (5) Second Language English Proficiency Test Secondary; and (6) the Maculaitis, K-12.

        "description":"Property taxes relate directly to rural education finance. This bulletin discusses differential tax assessment laws and the reasons states choose to institute them in 1970s. The first part of the report discusses the different types of tax laws and offers available evidence of their effects. More detailed summaries of individual state assessment laws are offered in the second section. (An addendum to the document shows the kind of state differential assessment law, if any, being used by each state as of January 1, 1977.) Differential assessment laws, currently used in 31 states, can be classified into three general categories: preferential assessment, deferred taxation, and restrictive agreements. A preferential assessment law, used in nine states, is one in which land is valued  according to its current use. No penalty is exacted if the land is later converted to another use. A deferred tax law, used in 18 states, is also one in which land is taxed according to current use value, but a penalty is levied if the land use changes. A restrictive agreement, used in 10 states, occurs when the landowner and the local government agree to restrict use of the land in return for differential assessment. Assessment laws typically are instituted for one of two reasons: to reduce perceived inequities in the application of property tax to farms or to influence land use. The three assessment approaches defined here are compared, evaluated, and discussed in the context of the problems to which they respond. (TES)",

The Bureau of the Census collected this information in the March 1989 supplement to the Current Population Survey. Data on Hispanic households includes household composition, urban and rural residence, tenure, availability of telephone, and income. Data on Hispanic families includes composition, size, income, and poverty. The Hispanic population, totalling 20.1 million in 1989, continued to grow at a rapid pace. Hispanic households were more likely to live in urban areas than non-Hispanic households and less likely to live in homes they owned or that were purchasing in 1989. Hispanic families tended to be larger, were less likely to have a phone, and were more  likely to be poor than non-Hispanics. Only 60% of young Hispanic adults reported they had completed 4 years of high school or more, compared with 89% of their non-Hispanic counterparts. The report contains tables that break down the population by age, sex, marital status, and educational attainment, and that estimate population figures for various Hispanic ethnic groups (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, etc.). Other tables give information on Hispanic employment, household size, and income levels. Appendices in the report offer definitions of terms, describe changes in census processing procedures and research on data fluctuations, and provide information on the source and accuracy of data estimates.

The reservation is populated mainly by members of the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre communities. The report begins with a tribal history starting from the 17th century, when a group of Assiniboine Indians split off from the Yanktonai Sioux and migrated north to Canada. Various characteristics of the reservation, including the people, setting, climate, education, medical facilities, employment, natural resources, and recreation, are described. Also discussed are cultural traditions of both Indian communities and a history of federal acts and treaties covering the &quot;tribal sovereignty&quot; period (1787-1935). A section on Indian  education covers relevant federal legislation and names four examples of alternative Indian education programs. Natural resource issues are discussed, including water rights, forestry history, transportation, and farm-irrigation problems. A section on the Bureau of Indian Affairs discusses federal regulations, trust funds, programs, policies, and management. The document contains a complete description of the Fort Belknap Tribal Constitution, tribal court procedure, and the educational philosophy of the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes.

        "description":"Changes in farming and agribusiness influence rural community and rural education. This paper reports on Kentucky-farmer surveys that focused on farm characteristics and adaptive strategies. The survey, when first conducted in 1986, yielded responses from 1,000 farmers. The second survey, in 1988, drew responses from 830 members from the first group, 11.7% of whom had quit farming. The report is divided into seven sections, each comparing the 1986 and 1988 surveys. The first section offers general survey highlights. Section 2 discusses farm structure and demographics, examining the scale of operations, types of commodities, and farm family characteristics. Section 3 examines farmers' point of view concerning the farm economy, rural industrialization, and government policy,  showing little change between surveys, but some diversity among farmers. Section 4 discusses employment trends, examining farmers' links with other economic sectors. The figures show an increasing dependency by farmers on off-farm jobs. Section 5 discusses debt and the financial changes for farms, broken down into four categories by dependence on off-farm income and total household income. With some exceptions, there appeared to be an overall improvement in farms' financial conditions between 1986 and 1988. Section 6 offers a long discussion of factors affecting burley tobacco, Kentucky's largest cash crop. Farmers were surveyed on major changes brought about in 1986 by the federal Tobacco Improvement Act. Section 7 examines the views of those who quit farming, most of whom did so because  they found more lucrative off-farm employment. Social and demographic characteristics of these ex-farmers also are examined. (TES)",

        "description":"The 'rural' definitions applied by the Federal Government, especially by two data-gathering agencies, the Bureau of the Census and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), emphasize different dimensions of the concept, and delineate the rural-urban continuum in different ways. This report discusses the inconsistency of curent &quot;rural&quot; definitions and its impact on research data collection and health policy formation. The Census Bureau's urban-rural definitions rely on settlement size and density, while the OMB's &quot;metropolitan statistical area&quot; (MSA) designation more closely follows county lines. Different designations also may be used by the same program, notably for purposes of hospital classification and reimbursement under federal health programs. Some have called for the  development of a standard rural typology that would capture elements of rural diversity while improving the use and comparison of nationally collected data. But a standard typology would be difficult to create, because different typologies serve different purposes. Typologies usually are based on population size and density, urbanization, relationship to an MSA, and principal economic activity. The paper concludes that better measures of population concentration would be helpful to distinguish between urban and rural areas within the same counties. (TES)",

        "description":"The Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs is considering legislation to improve mental health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. This report is in response to the Committee's request for information on the mental health needs of Indian adolescents and the services available to them. The section on mental health problems among American Indian and Alaska Native youth examines: (1) diagnosable mental disorders, particularly developmental disorders, depression, suicide, anxiety, and substance abuse and dependence; (2) serious, but less diagnostically specifiable, problems of adolescence, such as low self-esteem, conduct disorder, school dropout, delinquency, and running away; and (3) environmental risk factors, including otitis media, fetal alcohol syndrome, child  abuse and neglect, parent alcoholism, family disruption, and stressful school environment. The section on delivery of mental health services discusses: (1) agencies and programs involved in service delivery, including the Indian Health Service (IHS), Bureau of Indian Affairs, tribal health programs, urban Indian health programs, and state and local service agencies; (2) treatment settings and therapeutic interventions adapted to and by American Indians; (3) cultural insensitivity in Indian mental health programs; (4) community involvement; and (5) agency coordination efforts. The report concludes that 160-200 child and adolescent mental health providers are needed in IHS service areas, and presents Congressional policy options. This report contains 390 references and 37 data tables. The  appendixes include a review of earlier evaluations of Indian adolescents' mental health needs. (SV)",

        "description":"In a national survey, a total of 1,200 surveys were mailed to school administrators in rural areas in all states. Responses from 312 rural, urban, and suburban school administrators provided estimated percentages of students in 12 high risk categories. Survey data were analyzed by a repeated-measures analysis of variance that considered three factors: community (rural versus non-rural), risk categories, and disability (mildly handicapped versus non-handicapped). This analysis was performed separately for preschool, elementary, middle school, and high school levels. The differences between community type for all risk factors in both disability categories were significant for all levels except preschool. In almost all cases, rural at-risk student estimates exceeded non-rural  estimates. Certain risk categories showed large differences (greater than 7 percentage points) between rural and non-rural groups. For the nonhandicapped, these categories were poverty, minority group status, and substance abuse at the elementary level and poverty at the middle school level. For the mildly handicapped, these categories were depression at middle school and high school levels and poverty at all levels. The findings suggest that the social and economic stresses on rural students are at least as difficult as those of urban youth. This report discusses the importance of self-esteem in lowering student risk, and offers recommendations concerning federal and state policies, holistic program approaches, teacher and parent training, and early intervention. An appendix provides  statistical data on all risk categories. (SV)",

        "description":"This paper asks whether manufacturers of high technology are locating production facilities in nonmetropolitan areas and, if so, which industries and geographical areas are affected. It identifies high-technology manufacturers and estimates national employment trends for the sector from 1975 to 1982. National and regional employment data for specific subsets of the high-tech sector are analyzed and high-tech development in the rural West is reviewed, focusing on the major high-tech industries and employment in 11 Western states. The document suggests that high-tech manufacturing helped decentralize national employment from 1975 to 1982. Rural employment in the sector increased, indicating an urban-to-rural shift. The different geographical regions did not equally share new  high-tech employment. Rural areas of New England, Pacific, Mountain, and West South Central states saw benefits. The Mid-Atlantic and East North Central states showed a decline. New England and the Pacific states attracted more innovative high-tech manufacturers. Mature, high-tech industries are shifting employment to rural counties with low land and labor costs. Industries in growth and innovative stages remain close to metropolitan areas with skilled labor and specialized inputs. The high-tech industries are a potential source of rural employment. However, it is suggested that communities not concentrate their efforts on the sector. Mature firms are not likely to generate community development impact due to their limited employment and slow growth. (TES)",

In confronting these issues, the task force made recommendations in four topic areas: Reorganization and System Change, Education and Child Care, Teen Pregnancy, and Child Abuse. The task force identified state agency reorganization as a necessity, suggesting that the needs of families be the focus of any reorganization effort. The report suggested that departments serving public health, education, finance, and human services coordinate their efforts to provide community-based services for children, youth, and families. This &quot;continuum of care&quot; should include: assessment, prevention, early intervention,  home services, respite care, foster homes, and residential treatment. The task force found shortages of affordable child care, preschool programs, and educational opportunities for at-risk youth in West Virginia. It recommended: development of child-care tax credits, information and referral networks, and expanding early-childhood education programs. The task force also recognized a lack of available primary health care, measurable teenage pregnancy problems, and a lack of centralized information about health services. It recommended: expanding Medicaid eligibility, increasing health education (including a teen pregnancy program), and establishing incentives for health professionals to practice in rural areas. Regarding child abuse, the task force recommended: an extensive  public-information campaign, inservice training for law-enforcement officials, and increasing the number of state child protective-services workers.

        "description":"The relationship between a state's metro and nonmetro economic performance is a key consideration in determining whether a special rural development policy is appropriate for that state. This report compares the economic performance of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas in 49 states, 1979-86. On average, metropolitan areas enjoyed higher levels of growth in population, employment, real earnings, property income, and real per capita income. Both metro and nonmetro areas experienced declines in real earnings per worker, with larger percentage declines in nonmetro areas. Performance varied widely across individual states. Accordingly, each state was categorized as &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;weak&quot; (based on whether or not its real earnings growth for 1979-86 exceeded the national aggregate  rate of 8.1%), and as &quot;balanced&quot; or &quot;unbalanced&quot; (based on whether the differential of its metro versus nonmetro earnings growth was more or less than 7 percentage points). Further consideration of special rural development programs appears particularly warranted in the 31 states with unbalanced economies. Especially strong candidates are the 11 states with unbalanced economies but strong metropolitan growth. Tables provide 1979 and 1986 data for each state on: population; employment; unemployment rates; earnings; earnings per worker; dividends, interest, and rent; transfer payments; and per capita income. An appendix briefly relates 1987 earnings data. The information and analysis is potentially useful for policymakers. (SV)",

This issue contains articles about the impact on rural areas of economic trends, employment, and industry changes. A general overview indicates that moderate improvements in rural employment since 1986 have been tempered by slow income growth. Rural areas significantly lagged behind urban ones in economic well-being. Rising interest rates cooled the economy in 1989 after 3 years of rapid economic activity. Following an unusual first quarter, stable-to-slightly falling rates were expected to support economic expansion in 1990. Rural employment in 1988-89 grew faster than metro employment for the first time since the 1980-82 recession. But some data suggest that rural growth  slowed in the last three months of 1989. Nonmetropolitan unemployment rates fell dramatically since the 1980-82 recession. But teenagers, blacks, and Hispanics continued to face high unemployment in 1989. Employment growth accelerated in rural manufacturing and construction in 1987, but service-producing industries accounted for most new rural jobs. The rise in service-sector employment and a continued loss of natural-resouce industry jobs reflected a basic industrial restructuring in the rural United States. Nonmetro earnings lagged behind metro earnings in 1987. Nonmetro income continued to improve slowly, but a substantial gap between metro and nonmetro incomes persisted. The nonmetro poverty rate fell slightly between 1986 and 1988 but rural poverty remained higher than before the  recession and higher than urban areas. Nonmetro population began to recover slightly after a sharp fall in the mid-80s. Most growth occurred in counties near metro areas.

Chapter 1, &quot;Getting to Know the Community,&quot; addresses qualities of living and working in rural communities. It emphasizes that effective administrators are involved in community affairs, reflecting their commitment to rural community socialization. Chapter 2, &quot;The Board/Administration as a Team and Respective Roles of the Team Members,&quot; emphasizes the importance of establishing roles, goals, and priorities with board of education members while working as a team. Successful administrator-board relations depend on understanding the  expectations and respective roles within the leadership team. Chapter 3 identifies issues of leadership and different management styles. Although rural school boards may prefer one over another, the successful rural administrator needs qualities of both management and leadership. Chapter 4 examines decision-making and problem-solving principles, and includes action plans for analyzing problems and making decisions. Chapter 5, &quot;Conflict Resolution,&quot; includes strategies for dealing with the &quot;fishbowl&quot; or &quot;rumor factory&quot; phenomenon often present in rural communities. Chapter 6 includes specific tips for stress and time management, critical skills for a successful administrator to handle multiple roles, expectations, and high visibility. Chapter 7 includes procedures to help the administrator  build a vision for the rural school and to develop strategies for achieving that vision.

As adults, students will be living in a complex world and in a democracy where both individual and collective actions will require effective selection, processing, and use of information. National, state association, business, and industry reports on education produced in the 1980's called for increased emphasis on higher-order learning skills, including critical thinking skills. This digest includes: (1) a definition of critical thinking; (2) research findings concerning critical thinking; (3) a discussion of the role of environmental education in critical thinking instruction; (4) materials available for environmental education that  emphasize critical thinking skills; and (5) assistance available to teachers wanting to modify instruction to emphasize critical thinking skills.

        "description":"This paper describes the development of a sixth-grade \"Matter and Molecules\" unit using a new curriculum development model based on conceptual change research, the field testing of this unit in 15 classrooms and the field test results. The development process and the resulting unit are contrasted with the unit's predecessor, the \"Models of Matter\" unit in a commercial sixth-grade text. The development process was based on an extensive program of research on student conceptions and classroom teaching using preclinical interviews, pretests, classroom observations, journals by collaborating teachers, postclinical interviews, and posttests. The development procedures also included a careful content analysis and extensive interaction with collaborating teachers who were part of the  development team. It is argued that the procedures described in this paper constitute a workable alternative to present curriculum development procedures and that the alternative procedures are superior in two respects. First, these procedures make use of the methods and findings of recent research on teaching and on students' scientific cognition. Second, posttest results and interviews with teachers indicate that the new unit was demonstrably superior to its commercial predecessor in terms of the students' conceptual understanding and the teachers' professional satisfaction.

This report examines the major fields of study of a representative sample of high school seniors from the 1980 High School and Beyond senior cohort survey who had graduated from college by 1986 and compares those who majored in engineering, mathematics, or the natural and physical sciences with those in other fields. Among the significant findings are: (1) the proportion of males was higher than the proportion of females; (2) there were no significant differences in the proportions in majors among Whites, Blacks or Hispanics; (3) students with higher grades in high school, students who reported more time  spent on homework, or students who had high achievement test scores graduated more frequently with a major in science, engineering, or mathematics; (4) those who studied more mathematics in high school graduated more frequently with a major in science, engineering, or mathematics; (5) the number of students who moved out of the sciences in college was larger than the number who moved in; (6) females who had higher grades and took calculus in college were less likely than males with similar backgrounds to graduate with a major in science, engineering, or mathematics; and (7) more male college graduates stated in high school that they intended to major in science, engineering, or mathematics than female college graduates.

        "description":"This study examines the relationship between children's procedural and conceptual understanding of mathematics and their accuracy in reporting and interpreting geography text material containing mathematical information. It was hypothesized that (1) children's misconceptions or lack of experience with particular mathematical content areas would be associated with inaccurate interpretations of geography content; and (2) that mathematical competence would not necessarily be applied to reasoning about mathematically related geographical concepts. Sixty-four children, 16 in each of grades 3-6, were interviewed about related topics in mathematics and geography to test these hypotheses. Preliminary data analysis focusing on the correlational relationship between knowledge of  mathematics and the attainment and application of geographical concepts tended to be consistent with expectations. First, there seemed to be a positive relationship between overall mathematics and geography performance. However, the data indicate that mathematically inaccurate children had lower accuracy scores on some but not all geographical information as compared to children who were accurate in their mathematical concepts and procedures. This suggested that the positive correlation between mathematics and geographical knowledge scores was not necessarily a function of mathematically competent children applying their knowledge to geographical contexts. There may have been a common non-mathematical component related to performance in both areas that affected some contexts but not  others. Appended are examples of mathematical misconceptions and associated geographical knowledge for grades 3-5. (KR)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine if the academic achievement of first grade students was affected by the family employment status in the two-parent family where the mother works, the two parent family where the mother stays home, and the single-parent family where the mother works. Academic achievement was measured using the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills for Reading and Mathematics. Thirty first-grade students were divided into three groups: 13 students from a two-parent family in which the mother did not work, 10 students from a two-parent family in which both parents worked, and seven students in which a single mother works. Test scores were analyzed using an ANCOVA design. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the mean scores for the  groups on either reading or mathematics achievement. It was concluded that the family employment status alone did not have a significant influence on a child's achievement. (CW)",

The objectives for the activities are to show students how the computer can be used as a tool to store and arrange scientific data, provide students with experience using the computer as a tool to manage scientific data, and provide students with experience building computer data base files for use in science. Activities were introduced to elementary school teachers during an inservice workshop where they were trained to use an AppleWorks data base program with the Apple IIGS computer. Students who conduct the activities use research team processes, data pooling techniques, and computers as they attempt to make sense out of random data. Each activity includes: (1) grade level; (2)  science skills; (3) math skills; (4) computer skills; (5) vocabulary; (6) list of variables; (7) materials; (8) procedures; and (9) curriculum extensions. Topics covered are: weight and counting using toothpicks and M&amp;M's; the student's own personal data such as height, weight, and eye color; levers; acids and bases; and fire and atmospheric pressure.

These is concern over the quality of science and technical education at the elementary, secondary, and college levels. High school students in the United States lag behind those of other industrialized nations according to several sources. At the doctorate level, half of all graduate students in science are foreign nationals. To be economically competitive at home and abroad, the United States must have scientists and engineers who can keep the nation at the forefront of technological development. Reported in this document are: (1) \"Trends Affecting the Future Supply of  Engineering Students\"; (2) \"Systemic Barriers to the Participation of Women and Minorities in Engineering\"; (3) \"What Works at the State and Local Level\"; (4) \"The Governor's Role\"; and (5) a \"State Action Agenda.\" Appendices include descriptions of various state initiatives, and a directory of the Women and Minorities in Engineering Project Advisory Committee.

Second, many teachers' traditional experiences with and orientations to mathematics and its pedagogy are additional hindrances. This paper examines teaching practices and reviews some of what is known about prospective and experienced elementary teachers. In analyzing practices, the document's focus is on one major aspect of teacher thinking in helping students learn about fractions: the construction of instructional representations. One teacher's practice is analyzed to highlight the complexity inherent in the construction of fruitful representational contexts with students. Prospective and experienced teachers' knowledge, dispositions, and patterns of thinking relative to  representing mathematics for teaching are discussed. It is argued that attempts to help teachers develop their practice in the direction of teaching mathematics for understanding requires a deep respect for the complexity of such teaching and depends on taking teachers seriously as learners.

Such education is very important in an increasingly technological society such as the United States. To get a feel for students' understanding and appreciation of science, it is important to examine their mastery of basic skill levels as well as their exposure to more advanced concepts. The goal of this report is to provide some of the data necessary to evaluate how well the secondary school system is meeting these goals. The focus of this initial report is on coursework in science and mathematics as one measure of the successes and shortcomings of the education system. The bulk of the analyses described in this document was carried out on the base year data from the High School  and Beyond Study. Related data from other sources are discussed to fill out the picture provided by these analyses. Highlighted in this report are: (1) &quot;National Trends&quot;; (2) &quot;Regional Diversity&quot;; (3) &quot;Physics and Chemistry&quot;; (4) &quot;Race and Ethnic Background&quot;; (5) &quot;The Gender Gap in Mathematics and Science&quot;; and (6) &quot;Post-Secondary School Plans.&quot; (CW)",

Teaching strategies used when discussing moral, ethical, and science-technology-society (STS) issues need to be consistent with the moral growth stages of their students so that meaningful learning will occur.

The Teachers Involve Parents in Schoolwork (TIPS) project, which has been operating in a Baltimore City middle school for 3 years, offers processes and models designed to increase the involvement of parents in productive roles as volunteers and provides a structure for the middle grades teacher to develop and provides a structure for the middle grades teacher to develop and conduct a program integrating art and social studies. The process links art appreciation, history, and criticism to middle school social studies curricula and uses parents to present lessons on well-known art work government, and citizenship. This paper presents the first  formal evaluation of the TIPS process. Data were collected from over 400 middle school students and questionnaires measured students' recognition of and reactions to American artists and paintings that they saw in their social studies classes. The data is analysed and presented in tabular form; and it is concluded that the TIPS process can be a useful way of providing students with a background in art awareness, art history and art criticism, especially when teachers trained in art education are scarce, time is tight, and budgets are low.

The consortium was comprised of six historically black colleges and universities in the south and three graduate institutions of education. Chronologically, the paper begins with the establishment of the consortium in 1987, the introduction of key players, and a discussion of aims. It then moves to the collaborative process the consortium underwent, explains the activities designed by the consortium to address the minority teacher shortage, and ends with a progress report on current consortium activities. Conceptually, the paper examines the collaborative process in relation to  what the literature has to say about successful collaborations, and uncovers some new understandings about factors which help support and facilitate collaboration.

Both clinical and instructional models of supervision were used and goals were established on several criterion process variables that were monitored. Statistically significant improvements were not found on the variables monitored, but the overall process of instruction did improve. The teacher's attitude toward this type of supervision was favorable. Results lend credence to the trend of empowering teachers rather than administrators with more responsibility for improving instruction in public schools. (Author)",

The Institute of Education (IE), the sole trainer of teachers in Singapore, is conducting ongoing research in the area of effective teaching strategies, which aims at assessing the effectiveness of methods used in fostering learning strategies and metacognitive skills in students of varied background characteristics in English and mathematics studies. Data from two concurrent studies provide information on IE students and secondary pupils' learning strategies and academic ability. A sample is presented of differential learning behaviors of pupils from three different ability streams: special, express, and normal. Findings  from a questionnaire submitted to teachers indicated that the teachers' perceptions of effective strategies did not seem to match their pupils' experiences with the strategies. However, the pupils' ability seemed to influence the teachers' perception of the effectiveness of the learning strategies. Preservice teachers need to know that all pupils, irrespective of ability, should be taught the use of effective learning strategies. A brief description is given of the continuing second phase of this study; four tables displaying the data are appended. (JD)",

The quality and/or accuracy of actual responses and their rate of success were also examined. The subjects were 4 college students in a class of 18 students enrolled in an advanced soccer class. The four peer recorders were trained in the use of the Pioneer Instrument for Measuring Soccer Playing Ability in Regular Setting (PIMSPARS) following baseline conditions. Results revealed  that the introduction of the CWPR procedure produced immediate change and gains in the frequency of actual responses for all subjects. Withdrawal of the CWPR procedure produced a consistent decrease in behavior patterns for all subjects.

        "description":"This collection of papers addresses three important aspects of professional practice schools: student learning, teacher development, and implementation issues related to collaboration among institutions and state policy environment. The first paper, \"The Child as Meaning Maker: The Organizing Theme of Professional Practice Schools\" (Ellen M. Pechman), focuses on the implications for classrooms and schools in what is known about how children learn and develop socially and emotionally. The new roles teachers play as mediators of student learning are discussed. The second paper, \"Teacher Development in Professional Practice Schools\" (Ann Lieberman and Lynne Miller), builds on a concept of professional practice, maintaining that teachers themselves are an important source of  knowledge about teaching and equating the renewal of teaching with the renewal of schools. A framework is offered for developing a school culture that supports continuous inquiry and the improvement of teaching. The third paper, \"Professional Practice Schools in Context: New Mixtures of Institutional Authority\" (Barbara Neufeld), lays out a number of areas of critical importance in implementing professional practice schools, such as issues surrounding collaboration among institutions, definitions of teaching and learning, and the policy context in which design and implementation will take place. The final paper, \"Afterword: A Look at Professional Practice Schools with an Eye toward School Reform\" (Marsha Levine), discusses the relationship of these schools to the broader school  restructuring agenda.

Results from an assessment in an urban school district confirmed the belief that physical education teachers did not possess needed competencies and were in need of extensive professional development. This paper describes the inservice program which was carried out in 5 phases from January, 1989 to June, 1990 for 27 physical education teachers in the Cleveland City School District. Eight learning modules were completed in a series of on-site training workshops. Next, the teachers wrote a handicapped activity packet for each of the 114 handicapped students in the district physical  education classes. In phase 3, activity packets were implemented from September to April. Evaluative information was collected and overall effects were determined based on handicapped students' change in motor proficiency and teachers' change in knowledge and attitude. In addition, an ethnographic examination of physical education in the district was conducted. Results of the program were disseminated through a policy workshop for selected school districts in Ohio. The eight learning modules used in the program are appended as well as a formative evaluation of the program. (JD)",

        "description":"The Center for Excellence in Education at Northern Arizona University has learned a great deal from the past 5 years of research and evaluation of 15 pilot-test school districts, as they endeavor to restructure and make positive changes. The purpose of the reform movement is to provide adequate incentives for recruitment, retention, and motivation of high-quality professionals and to improve student learning. This extensive study has found an extreme diversity in the readiness and ability of school districts to reform and improve. The studies have identified several important factors impacting upon each organization from the outside (school boards and legislative policy) and from within (organizational climate, communication, teacher evaluation, and curriculum). These  interrelated components directly affect productivity and must be integrated and operating in a positive way to influence teacher development and student learning. Organizations that have done an assessment based on key components and redesigned operations to focus on the instructional program have improved teacher attitudes, skills, and leadership activities and dramatically increased student achievement. Those systems which have accomplished total organizational development and integration are now appropriately rewarding professionals on the basis of performance (tied to student learning), rather than solely on years of experience.

Electronic networking, linking beginners with other beginners and with their former university-based teacher educators, provides a new medium of support for beginners. One such network is the Beginning Teacher Computer Network at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. This electronic network offers support and direction to novice teachers in disparate geographic locations during their first year of teaching. This study examines the following questions: (1) What is gained or lost by substituting for face-to-face interactions a system involving telephone lines and  electronic equipment? and (2) What influence does the referent of multiple teaching contexts represented by the novices on the network have on the articulation of concerns and the development of strategies and solutions to problems? These questions form the foundation for a deeper understanding of the influence of electronic networking on induction support and the potential of this medium to encourage and foster reflection in beginning teachers.

        "description":"TEMAS is an apperception test depicting Hispanic and Black characters (minority version) or White characters (non-minority version) interacting in urban settings and expressing culturally oriented themes. It is scored for cognitive, affective, and personality functioning. The normative profiles, reliability, and criterion-related validity of TEMAS were compared for school and clinical children from three different Hispanic cultures. Subjects were: (1) 280 students in grades 1 through 6 and 50 child psychiatric outpatients in San Juan (Puerto Rico); (2) 167 students in grades 1 through 6 and 67 psychiatric outpatients of Puerto Rican background in New York; and (3) 59 children in grades 2 through 7 in Buenos Aires (Argentina). Children in New York and Puerto Rico were administered  23 minority TEMAS cards, the Spielberger Trait-Anxiety Scale for Children, and the Piers-Harris Scale. Children in Argentina were administered 10 TEMAS cards, the non-minority short form, and the Piers-Harris Scale. Results support the use of TEMAS with these cultural groups, but suggest that some TEMAS cards do not pull the designated personality functions as consistently with native Puerto Rican and Argentinian children. The reliability and validity estimates for the native Puerto Rican children were less favorable than were those for mainland U.S. groups. Preliminary evidence suggests that the characters, setting, and events of some pictures in the TEMAS are not appropriate in Argentinian culture. Findings point to the need to revise selected TEMAS cards to be culture specific. Three  tables summarize study data. (Author/SLD)",

Subjects (N=437) were selected from about 800 students in the elementary teacher education program of a small California state university. Predictor variables for each subject included: (1) undergraduate grade point average (GPA); (2) subscale scores from the California Basic Education Skills Test; (3) prerequisite education course grades; and (4) composite scores from the National Teacher Examination (not available for all subjects). Criterion variables included: (1) grade in the curriculum and methods course taken during the last student teaching block; (2) two student teaching performance ratings; (3) positive and negative comments written on student teacher rating forms; and  (4) successful completion of two quarters of student teaching. Multiple regression analysis enabled the assessment of the relative importance of the factors. The reading methods course grade and GPA functioned best as predictors of the performance criteria. Scores on the standardized tests were not significantly predictive. These results suggest that academic performance may be predictive of student teacher success, yet there is a need for further research. Three data tables are included. (SLD)",

More specifically, the distinguishing characteristics include: reference for measurement; information obtained; homogeneity of item difficulty; standards of performance; distribution of outcomes; and item format. A critical difference is the reference for measurement. For criterion-referenced tests, the reference of measurement is the existence of the behavior of interest. The criterion-referenced test assesses whether or not the individual possesses the skill. The qualitative distinction about performance  is optimal for assessing specific or minimum competencies. The reference for measurement for norm-referenced tests is the distribution of outcomes in a representative normative sample. The question asked is how the individual performs relative to others from the reference population. Performance standards are arbitrarily imposed on the norm-referenced measure. Normative tests are optimal when the entire range of knowledge or skill is of interest. These differences are summarized in a table. (SLD)",

It reviews the basic research findings of issues of educational and social inequalities, within a discussion of the possible contributions of basic research to the solution of educational problems. Areas addressed in the research review include the Blau-Duncan \"basic model,\" the Wisconsin School Process Model, studies of gender and racial disparities, the  social-psychology of the schooling process, school organization and climate, and family factors. It is concluded that fundamental research can help to locate the role of the school in the larger social system, suggest strategies for improvements within the school environment, and combine an inward and outward approach to shed light on the interdependence of school and society.

        "author":["Paulson, Leon F.",

        "description":"Issues that must be addressed in designing procedures for aggregating portfolio data are considered. These issues have profound implications for what is aggregated and how data are collected, combined, and interpreted. Portfolio assessment occurs at the intersection of instruction and assessment; it requires students to collect and reflect on examples of their work, providing both an important instructional component to the curriculum and offering an opportunity for complex authentic assessments. A multidimensional, cognitive process model of assessment is recommended in this paper. The cognitive model for assessing portfolios is structured much like the program evaluation model developed by R. Stake (1967). The model is designed to be broadly descriptive, yet to provide a  framework for presenting high quantitative and qualitative data in a coherent fashion. Its results are judgments taken from the perspectives of multiple parties. The model does not provide a single score; rather, it provides a comprehensive view of complex learning outcomes in a context where instruction and assessment are inseparable. The three-dimensions of the model are the following: (1) activity, including assessment activities intrinsic to both compiling a portfolio and aggregating across portfolios; (2) historical, including changes beginning from conditions at the outset through transactions to outcomes; and (3) stateholder, which reflects viewpoints of stakeholders with an interest in the portfolios. Three sample portfolio projects are outlined: the Pupil Product Portfolio; a  writing portfolio; and a metacognitive letter. Five figures and a 65-item list of references are included. (TJH)",

The second set of interviews concentrated on problem areas, and identified several areas of concern: administrative leadership; program requirements; the evaluation process; communication requirements; and need for long-range planning.

The survey questions asked subjects to identify the perceived strengths and indicators of insufficiency of the overall CL program, and perceived strengths and weaknesses of organizational climate by district and school. There were six subsets of specific responses. Responses were clustered and substratified in a qualitative matrix form according to the respondents' CL status and years of experience. Careful examination revealed  several critical underlying items. Substantial teacher input and ownership were considered essential, and respondents indicated that the primary focus should be student achievement and teacher accountability. The biggest problem identified was lack of consistent application of rules. The analysis demonstrated the usefulness of structured qualitative analysis in the model validation process.

Generally, GENESYS can be run any time after first-semester records are tallied for the current year. Computer programs using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) have been written and linked to generate standard output on several variables for specific programs. GENESYS can be  run for any group identifiable through a computer file. Most of the groups included in the first year were for students served in 1988-89; some were follow-ups of groups served in 1987-88. Overall, 25 programs and 130 subgroups at the elementary, secondary, and kindergarten through grade 12 levels were run through GENESYS in the spring of 1989. Three of the school district programs--Teach and Reach, Kealing Magnet Program, and Liberal Arts Academy--are described in this paper as examples of reports generated by GENESYS.

Goodman (1987) for analyzing intrinsic properties of cross-classified nominal or ordered categorical variables were used to examine the performance of items measuring psychological adjustment (PA). These methods were applied to 35 3x4 tables cross-classifying 1,158 persons according to their mental health status (MHS) and responses to 35 Likert-type items measuring PA. The subjects included: 562 normal individuals; 336 persons who had recently attempted suicide; and 260 psychiatric inpatients. Items in this study were drawn from the Suicide Probability Scale. Two sets of orthogonal metric scores were derived for categories of MHS and PA variables. Scores in the first set--representing the direction of MHS and PA--were used to assign scale values to  categories of the variables, making it possible to examine the consistency between intrinsic and a priori orderings. The second set of scores, representing the strength or intensity of the variables, formed J- or U-shaped curves when mapped onto the first set. These curves were used to distinguish positive and negative PA and MHS categories. For all tables, the intrinsic ordering of MHS categories was consistent with their a priori ordering; this finding was true for only 23 of 35 tables for PA. The location of the zero point indicated that categories representing positive PA varied depending on the content of the item, with some patterns evident across items of similar content. Two tables and 14 graphs are included. (SLD)",

New indices of agreement are presented for ordinal level items and for summative scores produced by nominal or ordinal level items. Two sets of empirical data illustrate the performance of the two formulas derived to estimate agreement. Three different agreement estimates, one at the item level and two at the score level, were computed for 2- and 5-point scalings and were compared using data from two human sciences studies: (1) ratings of speech production quality of an English-language consonant pair by 29 Japanese students; and (2) ratings of the quality of published research by 100 judges. In Study 1, each of the subjects was rated on a 5-point, 30-item scale  by 4 raters. In Study 2, the judges rated the quality of 50 different research articles on a 5-point, 33-item scale. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient estimates of reliability were computed for each score. Results show that the first formula appeared best for total scores based on a 2-point scale, while for scales with a greater number of scale points, the second formula produced a more conservative estimate of agreement. It is concluded that different situations call for different estimates of consistency. Researchers must determine what score level is of interest prior to conducting agreement/reliability estimates. For multi-point scales, researchers must make sure that the technique used to compute agreement is appropriate for the logic inherent to the rating technique used. Six  tables present data from the two studies. (SLD)",

The computer-based courseware evaluation model and the video-based courseware evaluation model provide information on over 300 items, 150 of which pertain directly to instruction (e.g., defining objectives, instructor skills, lesson characteristics, questioning and tutorial techniques, learner interactions, resource scope, and content assessment). Descriptive data were obtained in one of three manners: (1) a yes/no indication of whether or not a characteristic is found; (2) a 4-point ranking indicating  the necessity of a characteristic to use the package effectively; and (3) a 4-point Likert-type scale revealing the extent to which a given characteristic is used by the courseware. Content validity was investigated by four experts evaluating 10 computer-assisted learning packages and five experts evaluating seven video-based packages. Reliability was investigated as each evaluator produced synthesized quality ratings for each course. Results suggest that both models provide fairly close agreement estimates and fairly reliable evaluations. An overview of 213 computer-assisted learning packages and 248 video-based training packages indicated that many developers have failed to take advantage of their inherent capabilities, with particular shortcomings in: management system capacities; the  instructor's control of lessons; and the student's flexibility in moving through lessons.

        "description":"Patterns of occurrence and type of computer use, major, gender, and computer anxiety were analyzed for teacher education students. Over a 4-year period beginning in the fall semester of 1986, 914 teacher education students provided data for this study while they were enrolled in a mandatory computer awareness module. All of the subjects were education majors with the following concentrations: English; science; social studies; elementary education; mathematics; special education; and physical education. In addition to providing data for the study, the students responded to a computer anxiety instrument--a modified version of Spielberger's Self-Evaluation Questionnaire. Males (n=277) had significantly lower levels of computer anxiety than did females (n=637). Almost half of the  students had no previous computer experience, and many were highly apprehensive toward computers. Mathematics education and science education majors were significantly less anxious toward computers than were students with other majors. Students in all seven majors had very little experience in running content-area software. Across the 4 years studied, there was a lower percentage of no prior computer experience and a higher percentage of previous use of content area software and word processing, spread sheet, or data base software. Three implications for teacher education are highlighted: (1) course designers should recognize that many students have no prior experience with computers; (2) practical uses of content area software and managerial types of software should be the focus for  areas other than mathematics education; and (3) computer instruction should be driven by the student's major. Four tables contain study data. (SLD)",

        "description":"This study evaluates a 1-year, pre-vocational intervention--Project OASES (Occupational and Academic Skills for the Employment of Students)--for at-risk middle school students in the Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) Public School District. The study sample consisted of 502 former participants and 148 active participants (1988-1989 school year) plus control groups of at-risk peers (n=157). The Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale and the Multi-Dimensional Measure of Children's Perception of Control were administered to active participants during May of 1989. Classroom grades, attendance rates, enrollment status, and results of California Achievement Test administration during the spring of 1989 were compiled. Participants' and non-participants' dropout rates were comparable, as  were self-concept scores and achievement test scores in reading and mathematics. Participants' grades in reading and mathematics and absenteeism declined during the succeeding year. Participants exhibited a lower project-participation-year retention rate than did their control group peers and a lower ninth-grade retention rate as well. Non-participants exhibited higher degrees of internality in cognitive and social domains than did participants. Results indicate that project participants may not be well served. Recommendations include interdisciplinary planning, use of chronological age rather than grade level as a selection criterion, and de-emphasis of vocational goals in favor of vocational education as academic intervention. Three data tables and three figures are included.  (Author/TJH)",

This paper reports performance results from administration of the California Achievement Tests (CAT) to public school students in the spring semesters of 1986 through 1990; and administration of the North Carolina Science and Social Studies Test (NCSST) to public school students in the spring semesters of 1988 and 1990. In the spring of 1990, North Carolina students scored above the national norm group in all CAT subject areas in the three grades  tested, with performance higher in mathematics and language than in reading. Between the spring semesters of 1986 and 1990, the average student improved performance in all measured areas. Between the spring semesters of 1988 and 1990, the performance of the typical student in the three grades was maintained or improved in all areas measured by the NCSST. Eighteen graphs illustrate state frequency distributions for the CAT and NCSST. Test results are summarized in 32 tables. Five appendices include: (1) state summary reports from the CAT (21 pages of tables); (2) regional CAT summary reports (36 pages of tables); (3) regional NCST and NCSST summaries (48 pages of tables); (4) &quot;Selecting a Measure of Central Tendency: Comparison of the Mean and Median&quot;; and (5) definitions of measurement  terms used in the report.

        "description":"Three articles on current research in testing are presented. The first article, &quot;Testing in the Schools&quot;, discusses the role of testing in educational reform. In the 1980s, the overwhelming purpose of state standardized testing has become promoting accountability in areas of: (1) monitoring; (2) gatekeeping; (3) remediation; and (4) funds distribution. Educational policy makers need to find some way to evaluate the tests. Some guideposts for evaluating testing are suggested: making sure that instructional outcomes and learning outcomes guide the testing; determining how a test protects against bias in race, gender, or ethnicity; making sure that appropriate techniques are used; and making testing for accountability less obtrusive. The second article, &quot;Constructed Response  Testing: Some Development Efforts&quot;, examines two approaches focusing on student-developed solutions to questions that can be economically scored. The first approach involves the use of an answer grid to record answers to mathematical questions, and the second approach involves the use of figural response items for science testing. The third article, &quot;Assessing Performance&quot;, describes some of the work conducted at the Educational Testing Service (ETS) and in Connecticut in the area of student performance assessment. The &quot;Learning by Doing&quot; project of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is described. Also discussed are: a writing portfolio study; the Arts PROPEL program in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania); and Connecticut's Common Core of Learning Assessment Project.

        "description":"The validity of criterion-referenced interpretations of the proficiency scales of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is discussed. A major goal of the NAEP scales is to describe student achievement in specific content areas from grade 3 (age 9 years) through grade 11 (age 17 years). The numerical values for NAEP scales are intended to be interpreted almost exclusively from a criterion-referenced perspective. The NAEP intends to accomplish the goal of making criterion-referenced interpretations of examinee scores through the use of item response theory methodology. The basis for classifying an item at a proficiency level is the estimated probability of success of examinees at different proficiency levels. The implications for criterion-referenced  interpretations are discussed in the context of the Science Proficiency Scale (SPS). Problems with interpreting SPS results are due to the following factors: (1) the science domain is not well defined; (2) it is doubtful that learning in this domain proceeds through an orderly sequence; (3) the number of test items that could be developed is virtually unlimited; and (4) many problems are generated by the interactions between the examinee's past experiences and item content. The NAEP mathematics, reading, and history scales are also reviewed. It is suggested that the NAEP proficiency scales do not yield valid criterion-referenced interpretations. Four figures illustrate the discussion. A 27-item list of references is included. (SLD)",

For less-than-two-year institutions, the IPEDS collects data on fall enrollment, completions (earned awards and certificates), etc., from all public institutions in that category and from a sample of private institutions. The methodological issues that arise from trying to collect data from less-than-two-year postsecondary education institutions are discussed. The variable nature of the universe of these institutions, which go in and out of business frequently, contributes to errors in IPEDS estimates. The IPEDS sectors discussed are: (1) less-than-two-year public institutions; (2) less-than-two-year private  non-profit institutions; and (3) less-than-two-year private for-profit institutions. Sampling errors were computed by balanced repeated replication based on 32 replications. Data are provided for 330,007 male and 425,835 female students attending the sample institutions in the fall of 1987 and for 311,561 male and 378,267 female students who graduated from the sample institutions in 1987-88. Challenging problems are presented to IPEDS statisticians because of: reluctance of the institutions to respond to the survey; the volatile nature of the population; the highly skewed distribution of the sizes of the institutions; and the sensitivity of the data to precise definitions.

Background materials on application of the Rasch model in statistical analysis of the MFTP are provided, studies of item fit and causes of item misfit are outlined, and recommendations for uses of fit statistics are made. It is recommended that: (1) since the number of items detected as &quot;misfitting&quot; is a matter of choice in selecting the fit statistic from a wide range of fit statistics produced by BICAL, and since there are no sound statistical procedures for selecting items on the basis of fit indices; test of item fit should  not be used with some arbitrary critical value to make automatic decision for eliminating them; (2) items that have total or between &quot;t&quot; values larger than 2.00 should be investigated for flaws in the construction of the item, unusual item content, &quot;order effects&quot; resulting from its position in the test, and level of difficulty; (3) if an easy item does not fit the model because it occurs near the end of the test which low ability students may not reach time for the test might be extended; (4) guessing is inherent in the use of multiple-choice items and such items should not be deleted for this reason; and (5) items flagged by various tests of fit should be studied by subject matter experts to generate possible hypotheses about the reason for misfitting items. Fit statistics produced by  BICAL-1980 are described, with emphasis on the sample size effect on fit indices, and computation of these statistics are explained. One data table is included. (TJH)",

The MAQ provides teachers and students with a tool to understand aspects of constructing knowledge in mathematics classrooms for grades 7 through 9. The questionnaire is intended to survey students' thoughts and feelings about learning a particular aspect of mathematics--solving mathematical word problems. The MAQ provides additional, complementary information to that provided by teacher assessments or standardized tests of mathematical concepts and procedures. The MAQ  contains 162 statements and can be completed by most students within 40 minutes. In the first of 2 sections of the questionnaire, students solve a non-routine word problem and respond to 20 statements about what they did while solving the problem. In the second section, students respond to statements grouped within three activity settings (participating in the class as a whole, working with other students, and doing homework), after which the students' cognitive processes within each of these settings are again assessed, and affective beliefs, motivation, and attributions are studied. Three data tables and 10 figures are included. Appendices include sample responses for the fall 1988 sample; preliminary results of teacher ratings of items; statement numbers, scale response numbers for  indicators, and interpretation of diagnostic indicators for beliefs, motivations, and attribution categories; the questionnaire; and the hand tally form.

        "description":"This paper describes recent research on the topic of assessment that has been conducted at Project Zero at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. It is argued that assessment built around an interesting and challenging project that explores a particular domain (such as music, writing, drawing, mathematics, science, or programming) offers an important alternative to traditional standardized tests. Such assessment instruments are known as &quot;domain projects.&quot; This view of assessment is based on the theory of multiple intelligences which claims that human beings have evolved at least seven forms of knowing or processing information. These intelligences are structurally independent, but function in concert. An assessment must elicit use of the materials of a given domain and  mobilize a number of different intelligences. The Arts PROPEL Project in the Pittsburgh schools uses student portfolios and domain projects to assess artistic development in secondary school students. The Catalyst Project, an investigation of how children and adults learn with microcomputers, is another effort developing domain project assessments. The Catalyst Project illustrates ways in which assessment can move beyond tests, measurement, and large-group comparisons to assessments that capture aspects of student performance that may otherwise be overlooked.

        "description":"This report on the supply of newly qualified teachers (NQTs) is based primarily on data from the Recent College Graduate Study of 1987. The survey, which was originally designed to provide information on NQTs alone, was expanded to cover graduates in all major fields of study; however, it continues to emphasize graduates qualified to teach at the elementary school or secondary school level. For the 1987 study, newly qualified teachers were defined as: individuals who received a bachelor's or master's degree between July 1, 1985 and June 30, 1986; who became eligible or certified to teach during that same period; and who had not been employed as teachers before receiving their degree. The number of NQTs who graduated from the nation's colleges and universities increased from  105,000 in 1984 to 126,000 in 1986 after declining for almost 10 years. The number of NQTs at the master's level increased by 124%, from 6,300 in 1984 to 14,100 in 1986. Nearly 73% of the NQTs at the bachelor's level in 1986 were women. An average of 48% of all other bachelor's degree recipients were women. Forty-eight percent of NQTs reported grade point averages of 3.25 or higher, compared to 42% of other bachelor's degree recipients. Fifty-seven percent of the NQTs in 1986 majored in education, a large drop from 1984 when 71% majored in education. Eighty-nine percent of the NQTs were employed 1 year after graduating from college. Only 3% were unemployed, and 8% were not working and not seeking employment. Only 61% of the NQTs in 1986 were teaching in April 1987. Seventy-four percent of  the NQTs were certified in the field they were teaching. The average annual salary for NQTs who were employed full time was $16,000 in 1987, compared to an average of $20,700 for other bachelor's degree graduates. Ten tables and 3 graphs present study data. Appendix A contains technical notes for the survey, Appendices B and C provide, respectively, nine tables containing standard errors for data categories and two additional tables on teacher characteristics, and Appendix D presents the 1987 survey instrument.

A total of 373 questionnaires was returned for a response rate of 33%. Among the respondents, 198 were considered media active and 175 were counted as &quot;less active&quot;. The respondents generally had 5 or fewer years of teaching experience; they were less experienced and generally younger than the average teacher in their school systems. Teachers rated television as the medium most used by students, followed at a great distance by  video/computer games, movies, and radio. Teachers were most likely to use personal computers as media in the classroom. Over two-thirds of the teachers considered that students spent too much time using media. Teachers generally considered students quite competent in the operation of most consumer-oriented media equipment, but considerably less than competent in media understanding skills. About two-thirds of teachers reported teaching about media as part of another subject. Between 25% and 33% of the respondents had discussed the role of media in society or the role of advertising with their students. Most of the teachers (86.6%) would have liked to teach about the media more often, but barriers included lack of time and lack of materials. The results highlight the need for more and  improved media education materials. Survey results are presented in 21 tables. The survey instrument is included. (SLD)",

The Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics of the National Research Council has decided to initiate a project to articulate issues relating to guidelines and to determine their priorities. Because there has been a proliferation in statistical software, more statistical work is being done by people with little or no training in statistics, a fact that makes guidelines increasingly important. Benefits of the proposed guidelines for users, consumers, producers, and the scientific community are considered. The aspects of statistical packages that require guidelines include: (1) coverage; (2) numerical accuracy; (3) graphics; (4) data retrieval and data manipulation; (5) data transfer;  (6) documentation; (7) user interface; (8) device interfaces; (9) speed; and (10) extensibility. Guidelines have at least four important purposes: to provide a commonality to enable consumers to share knowledge; to help code existing knowledge; to raise consumer expectations; and to provide some long-term stability in a rapidly changing environment.

Throughout the history of the U.S., the census has provided both the data that drive the economy and the numbers for equitably apportioning political power. The census reflects the fact that changes in population concentration identify growth markets. Growth is not merely geographic; the census identifies the various segments of the population and the rates at which they grow. Social and economic changes are foretold through changes in age distribution, the number of households in proportion to the population, and the changing composition of households. Other social changes that the census has reflected include: (1) a move from the farm to  blue-collar work to white-collar work; (2) increasing literacy; (3) changing spending patterns; (4) the numbers of women in the work force; and (5) income differences among population segments. It is concluded that the census will continue to offer the same types of information, and that new technology will make it possible for many more individuals and groups to use the information for decision making. Eighteen figures illustrate the discussion. (SLD)",

The &quot;1/Y&quot; versus &quot;1/chi&quot; plot had undefined expected values, and this problem worsens as sample size increases. The use of non-linear least squares is recommended. In non-linear regression, it is demonstrated that a design that gives at least a local minimum of the generalized variance of the parameter estimators is one where half the observations are taken at the maximal value of &quot;x&quot; (termed &quot;x-theta&quot;) and half of the epsilons equal half their maximal value. The use of such an extreme design is optimal in simple linear regression; however, it is  curious that this design is optimal in non-linear Langmuir's model.

Analysis of statistical data on the white male labor force drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) indicates that the reduction of the incidence of unemployment is far more important than the reduced duration of unemployment in creating educational differentials in unemployment rates. The lower unemployment incidence of the more educated workers is due equally to their greater attachment to the firms employing them and the lower risk of becoming unemployed when separated from the firm. The lower frequency of job turnover of more educated workers, which creates fewer episodes of unemployment, is in large part attributable to more on-the-job training. The following factors may  explain the lower conditional unemployment of educated workers and the somewhat shorter duration of their unemployment: (1) more educated workers appear to search for new employment while already employed, which is less costly than searching for employment while unemployed; (2) more educated workers are more efficient in acquiring and processing job search information; and (3) firms and workers search more intensively to fill more skilled vacancies. Statistical data on seven tables are included. Discussions of two of the equations used in the analysis and a list of 24 references are appended. (FMW)",

In 1985, CAS was awarded a National Diffusion Network (NDN) 4-year replication grant to disseminate the model to other schools and districts throughout the country. During 1988/89, its fourth year of implementation, CAS/NDN sought to replicate its model at 12 sites in different parts of the country, focusing special attention on at-risk students. Objectives included follow-up activities at the sites, development of materials for in-service teacher education, and modified &quot;turn-key&quot; training of replicator staff to become disseminators themselves. This evaluation found that the project's ongoing outreach efforts, focus on at-risk students, and  in-service training objectives were achieved. The remaining objectives were only partially met due to limitations of time and resources. The following recommendations for improvement are suggested: (1) develop a plan for monitoring the progress of replicators at each site; (2) develop assessment measures based on student behavior, such as credits earned and attendance; (3) continue efforts to develop new disseminators in a large number of states and a higher number of inner-city schools; (4) attract more ninth- and tenth-grade students to the program; and (5) continue to update the program and develop financial independence.

For mothers and stepmothers, the percentage is 63.0. The language of greater comprehension of the majority of Hispanic parents is Spanish. Typically, their jobs do not allow them the flexibility to attend meetings or teacher conferences. Although the parents value education and encourage effort, they are unable to assist their children with homework or provide basic resources for study at home. It is recommended (1) that educational agencies collect more accurate data on Hispanics  by origin; (2) that the problems of Hispanic parents be addressed; (3) that typewriters, calculators, dictionaries, and tutoring assistance be supplied; and (4) that the data in the present study be expanded and continued in order to track this cohort of students through their school careers.

        "description":"This document explains an intergenerational literacy project, established by the Kenan Trust in 1988, in which more than 300 adults and children have participated at 7 pilot sites in North Carolina and Kentucky and for which an additional 22 sites in 11 states are planned. The first section relates one participant's experience with the project. Section 2 describes the project's model that focuses on family as the critical context in which learning is either stimulated or stifled. (With this model, undereducated parents and their preschool children go to school together: the parent for adult literacy and prevocational training, the child for early childhood development classes, and both together for classes on how to create in the home an atmosphere that supports learning). A  rationale for the current attention focused on literacy development is followed by discussion of the necessity of an integrated program designed to meet all of the varied but interrelated needs of the disadvantaged family. A typical day for project participants and the origin of the Kenan model are described. New cooperative relationships among service providers are suggested in order for the model to work successfully. The last sections of the document cite test results and quotes parents and teachers about the success of the project, describe the mission of the National Center for Family Literacy, present a thank-you letter and poem written to project staff from a program graduate, and list the project's staff, adjunct training faculty, and advisory board.

        "description":"The first part of this two-part paper provides a general review of adult development and is premised on an understanding of andragogy. Andragogy is the art and science of helping adults learn. It is based on the following four assumptions about adults: (1) as people mature they become less dependent and more self-directed; (2) experiences serve as resources for learning and help establish identity; (3) the readiness of adults to learn is closely related to the developmental tasks of their social roles; and (4) adults are more problem centered than subject centered in learning. When working with adults, teachers should do the following: (1) define the course goals and objectives clearly; (2) include an appropriate amount of material, avoiding too much or too little; (3) schedule  the class lessons to include time for questions, participation, and enjoyment; (4) limit the number of facts, figures, or points presented at one time; (5) provide an adequate amount of time for discussions; (6) design the scope of the course with the learners in mind; (7) limit the student preparation time required prior to class; (8) smile, nod, and use positive reinforcement to encourage students; and (9) use open-ended remarks and comments to stimulate more discussion. The second section of this paper consists of discussions of the following specific theories of adult development: Maslow's hierarchy of needs; Rogers' fully functioning person; Kohlberg's stages of moral development; Nelson's steps in becoming self-directed; Erikson's stages of psychosocial development; Levinson's life  structure; Loevinger's stages of ego development; and Piaget's developmental stages.

Thirty-two 45-minute tape-recorded interviews were conducted in three areas: an inner-city area, a rural area, and a mixed area of large towns with a rural hinterland. The interviewee group included 21 part-time adult educators and 11 immediate employers or trainers. Four broad categories of training needs for part-time adult education workers were identified: (1) an introduction to the setting in which one is operating; (2) the development of key basic skills necessary to perform the job of part-time adult educator; (3) refresher courses for experienced workers; and (4) specialist courses such as counseling, assertiveness, and computers. Existing training was  perceived as successful by the part-time workers when it included opportunities to meet other part-time staff, was content-relevant to the work situation, included practical activities, was not too time consuming, and was delivered by those with recent experience in adult education. Although few of the interviewees had experienced modular training, there was considerable support for a modular approach from part-time staff; however, full-time staff voiced many doubts about it.

One class studied involved class teaching by the tutor and speakers; the self-study course used multimedia materials backed up by tutor telephone support. Three main dimensions of effectiveness for students were identified: learning about the feasibility of setting up one's own small business; learning about the world of small business; and gaining a  sense of purpose in life.

Draft modules were sent to about 40 individuals or organizations in the field for comment on their structure and relevance. Each module was piloted at two different sites in urban, rural, or intermediate areas in Scotland. To assess the suitability of the modules for training in community education, researchers interviewed a sample of the participants and all of the trainers. Overall, trainers were very satisfied and regarded the modules as effective. Modules were perceived as flexible in terms of form, content, adaptability to a variety of local  contexts, and needs of individuals with different educational experiences. Trainees named as positive features of the modules the range of teaching methods used, courses relevant to perceived needs, opportunities to practice skills needed for their jobs, and opportunities to meet with other part-timers. Respondents mentioned these drawbacks and problems: lack of challenge, irrelevance, duplication, and venue. (Four references are cited. Interview schedules are appended.) (YLB)",

The study began with a review of literature that clearly showed the need for attention in the area of establishing credentials to reflect the quality of training experiences, particularly in the work-based format because of its inherent variability of content. In an effort to obtain more recent information about barriers and opportunities in establishing a credentialing process in new and emerging occupations, two data collection efforts were made. The first was a formal survey of 39 representatives of the various constituencies interested in or related to the apprenticeship system. The second type of data collection involved informal discussions  with 10 opinion leaders in the employment and training areas. Data from both collection efforts were integrated to define the reactions of the various apprenticeship communities to the prospects for a national work-based training initiative. Possible problems were identified and two strategies were proposed to assist the DOL in overcoming them. The strategies were: (1) work-based training in a demonstration project and (2) a comparative examination of work-based training.

Data were collected through two questionnaires completed by teachers and students respectively. The teacher questionnaire sought data about selected teaching practices, selected teacher characteristics, and selected characteristics of vocational agriculture departments. The second instrument was designed to obtain selected characteristics and the SOEP scores of senior students. The instruments were mailed to 38 teachers in a representative Ohio district. Usable data were received from 33 teachers and their 283 students. The study found that typical  teachers in this district in Ohio had 4 years of high school agriculture and 11 years of teaching experience, lived 12 miles from their schools, found their training to be somewhat appropriate, and had extended contracts. The study also found that teachers spent 5 or more days supervising SOE programs at fairs and shows, made 2 or more SOEP visits to students in the summer, and varied widely in the percent of the student grade they based on SOE. Most teacher characteristics were found to have a low relationship with a better SOE, while the selected teaching practices were found to be associated with better outcomes of SOE programs. Characteristics of the vocational agriculture department associated with students' SOE scores include type of teacher preparation and number of teachers in the  department. Students with agricultural career plans, farm residences, and supportive parents tended to have better SOEs. (KC)",

Data represent the responses of a national sample of new business owners (N=2,994) who were members of the National Federation of Independent Business in May 1985 and had been in business for no more than 17 months with the average respondent owning the business for 11 months. An 11-page summary of data discusses results pertaining to the type of people who form businesses, the firms they form, the business climate, changes in the businesses, and attitudes of owners after 3 years. Appendix I sequentially presents every survey question posed during the entire project and the new business owners' responses to them. It also presents firm or environment data that did not require the owner to  respond but for which there were data from another source. Data are provided in unnumbered tables, identified in the upper left hand corner by the year in which the survey was conducted. Forty-nine pages of tables are provided. Appendix II is a note on sampling and methodology. Appendix III contains the regression results of selected \"predictors\" of new business survival and growth. Appendix IV consists of the three survey questionnaires used in the 3 years of the study. (YLB)",

        "author":["Fulton, Rodney D."],
        "description":"The question of how important place is to learning is one that has fallen in and out of vogue during the past 40 years. Despite frequent statements of its importance, there has been a continual lack of attention to the physical environment of adult education. Under the leadership of John Becker, an architect from Cincinnati, the Adult Education Association's Commission on Architecture published &quot;Architecture for Adult Education&quot; in 1953. Individuals' reactions to their environment have often been thought to be idiosyncratic. However, a preliminary investigation seems to suggest a continuum in individual response to the physical attributes of the environment. Research has not yet clearly delineated what aspects of the environment can be controlled nor how they should be  controlled. Karen and Jim Leed, two architects from Cincinnati, have recently published &quot;Building for Adult Learning,&quot; and appear to be well versed in adult learning theory. They state that an adult learning facility should meet basic comfort needs, feature and reinforce a nonjudgmental climate of trust and sharing, maximize social contact and exchange of information, meet the learners' highest expectations of quality, and truly inspire learners to greater achievement. Sporadic, individual efforts need to be orchestrated so that national attention and funding can be sought to support continued work to answer the questions arising from a thoughtful consideration of how adults are influenced by their environment. (Sixteen references are cited and a comprehensive bibliography on place and  learning is appended. (CML)",

Following these sessions and group discussion, the conference participants suggested ways to improve the image of public service in order to attract and retain more qualified employees. Among issues addressed were the need for innovative strategies for recruitment and hiring, for improving and workplace  environment, for accommodating family-work life needs and to offer other benefits now commonplace in the private sector. The participants also suggested ways to address the many social and technology-related issues that impinge on the work force. Finally, local, state, and federal participants meeting separately set objectives for each level and suggested action steps for the future. (KC)",

The BEST model focused on job-related instruction. The goal of the program was to achieve increased safety, productivity, and employee morale with decreased absenteeism as a product of improved employee basic skills. Areas of innovation included having multiple employers receive all ABE services simultaneously, determining a class schedule that accommodated workers' schedules without release time, and using a screening tool to identify learning disabled/dyslexic adult remedial readers. Vanderbilt University's evaluation of the program's first 15 months showed that 152  employees and immediate family members were enrolled in basic reading, math, pre-General Educational Development (GED) test preparation, and GED instruction. The program maintained a 73 percent employee retention rate and achieved statistically significant grade-level improvement in reading, language, and math. Eighty-two percent of GED test examinees passed. Employer and employee satisfaction was high and community support was excellent. (Most of the document is composed of appendices that contain project forms (including survey forms), materials lists, GED and pre-GED syllabi, and a suggested teaching format for reading tutors.)

        "description":"European cooperation in vocational counseling is today no longer a matter for specialists alone. Parents, teachers, and trainers are increasingly finding themselves confronted with young people considering the option of taking a traineeship or employment abroad. The counseling available in such cases, however, is often still inadequate. A large number of obstacles on the path toward the &quot;Euro-conseiller,&quot; the European counselor, have already been removed, but there are still many hurdles to cross. It is not merely a matter of the national vocational counseling services having the explicit desire to cooperate. Much also depends on the awareness of a &quot;European labour market&quot; and the demand for &quot;European&quot; vocational counseling from parents, teachers, trainers, and all the other  persons engaged in some way in initial and continuing training. Recomendations made in 1986 were mainly concerned with the formal framework for institutionalized cooperation. In 1990, it is recommended that projects, studies, and conferences on themes of shared interest be supported. Topics proposed included the following: the structures and operating models of counseling services and their respective advantages and disadvantages; the use of electronic data processing; the establishment of an information system on vocational counseling issues; and the establishment of transnational counseling and placement systems and the preparation of printed counseling documentation based on an analysis of pilot projects in border regions.

Results addressed perceptual differences of male and female managers regarding job characteristics, communication in the organization, outcome factors, development needs, and demographics. Findings revealed fewer female managers overall and significantly fewer females in middle and top management positions. Although female managers felt their job objectives were clear and in writing, they indicated they receive more  information from the grapevine than they prefer, and they do not receive sufficient downward and upward communication through channels. Female managers were less satisfied with their participation in decision making and chances for advancement, and they did not feel they received sufficient management training before assuming their job responsibilities.

Instructional strategies examined included time of day classes were offered, location of class, instructional setting (classroom/individual), and format (technology/teacher intensive). Surveys were administered to administrators, teachers, tutors, and students participating in existing programs in rural areas and referral agency personnel working in rural areas. The study found that transportation or subsidies and child care provisions should be made to maximize participation. Public buildings are the preferred places for classes or tutorials. Evening classes or tutorials are  preferred, but some morning or afternoon classes would be attended, especially by unemployed students. Monday through Thursday are the preferred days for instruction. Classes or tutorials should meet twice per week and last 2.5 to 3 hours. Teachers and referral agency personnel indicated that providing telephone contact with teachers about lessons would improve participation. Teachers, tutors, and referral agency personnel indicated that more combinations of regular classroom instruction and one-to-one tutoring would be best, although the students favor more one-to-one tutoring and videotaped lessons for home use. Computer and correspondence lessons should also be made available to students. (Appendices include the questionnaire and tables summarizing results.) (KC)",

        "description":"In a workplace literacy program designed by the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen and the International Masonry Institute, the basic skills of 615 participants were assessed in mathematics, reading, writing, presentation, listening-responding, and problem-solving at sites in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. Available data indicate that 116 individuals participated in workplace literacy skills instruction during the program's fourth quarter. Eligible participants worked in the trowel trades (bricklaying, tile setting, plastering, terrazzo work, stone masonry, cement masonry, marble masonry, pointing, cleaning, and caulking). The three delivery systems used to deliver instruction were videotape technology, individual tutoring, and computer-assisted  instruction. Participants liked the videotape delivery system in that they could be trained at home on their own schedule. Participants suggested that the time needed to request tapes be shortened, that they be allowed to watch the tapes with another participant, that the tapes be better matched to the individual's skill level, and that the tapes be based on the individual's particular trade. The tutoring delivery system was considered supportive by participants but also inconvenient. Participants suggested group tutoring might be more effective than individual tutoring. The computer-assisted instruction was the least successful method, with participants indicating a continuing fear of using computers and finding the software unsuitable for adults. Once software appropriate for adults and  specific to the trades was found, greater participation was reported. (A sample individualized learning plan and a literacy assessment instrument are included.) (CML)",

The programs examined are those of Holland College, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada; Northeast Metro Technical College, White Bear Lake, Minnesota; and Richmond College of Technical and Further Education, Victoria, Australia. Data were gathered during site visits in 1988 and 1989. The paper first defines competency-based vocational education and outlines its characteristics through a review of literature. It then examines the three colleges' programs and describes their teaching systems, instructional materials, and curricula. Based on observation of the three programs, the paper offers  some implications: (1) competency-based instruction has potential for training in both industry and colleges; (2) the self-pacing aspect appears to develop characteristics of independence and self-reliance; (3) a number of inherent problems and potential pitfalls in the CBVE approach need to be addressed; (4) adequate learning materials and resources are essential; (5) staff development must be an integral part of the program; and (6) learners must be prepared for change from the traditional approach to a CBVE approach.

The report is based on a study that assessed and presented the views of Black and Latino community-based organizations and interests regarding the future direction and governance of the Madison Park/Humphrey Center. Data were gathered through workshops and meetings of parents, teachers, and community and business representatives set up by an advisory committee. The two governance recommendations, aimed at establishing accountability for results in vocational-technical education, are that an independent  vocational-technical education school district be established in Boston through a Home Rule petition and that a strong form of school-based management be established for the Madison Park/Humphrey Center. The 19 programmatic recommendations revolve around basic skills acquisition. professional development of educators, educational articulation and cooperation, technology education, a preengineering program, part-time and evening programs, an equal opportunity employment office, a humanities module, student/teacher visits to worksites, curriculum evaluation, and grantsmanship.

It is therefore incumbent upon all educators to modify traditional curriculum to reflect contemporary technology. School technology education programs today are being developed to reflect the needs of our technological society. In the immediate past, teaching content for this field was derived from the traditional industrial trades and called industrial arts. Now, teaching content is derived from modern industry, encompasses a broad, holistic approach to education, and is called technology education. Technology education provides a balance between the intellectual and the applied phases of student experience and establishes a platform  whereby all curriculum areas can be integrated together and commonalities explored. Technology education as a teaching strategy can be used in a myriad of ways to enhance classroom teaching. It offers teachers the opportunity to integrate various areas of study and brings to the learning environment practical and realistic possibilities for student learning. (20 references) (CML)",

Four Sheraton Hotels in Waikiki participated in the project. The program was planned, staff and volunteers were recruited, and marketing strategies were employed to recruit and retain students. Classes were scheduled during working hours to accommodate employees. The program featured individualized programs of instruction; practical and job-related materials; in-house training, instructors, and tutors; flexible scheduling, open entry/open exit; and confidentiality. A total of 338 employees participated in the program, most from entry-level positions, and most nonnative English  speakers. Project outcomes included improvement in attitude and job performance, increase in advancement opportunities, and improvement in literacy skills, especially speaking skills and job-related skills. Evaluation of the program showed that it met original objectives of literacy improvement, although gains in reading and writing were small. It also demonstrated the feasibility of partnerships between universities and businesses. In a discussion of problems and recommendations, suggestions were made to involve unions in future partnerships, to avoid project staff turnover, and to keep all classes small. (KC)",

Section 1 on displaced homemakers focuses on three areas. The first part presents a demographic profile of displaced homemakers: their marital status (how they became displaced homemakers), race, and family status (whether they have children). The second part focuses on their economic status, including their employment patterns, educational attainment, and the incidence of poverty and near poverty among displaced homemakers. The third part discusses homeownership rates and living arrangements, particularly the phenomenon of &quot;doubling up&quot; (displaced homemakers who share the housing of relatives and nonrelatives).  A fourth part shows distribution by state and region. Section 2 provides the same analyses for single parents as are found in the first three parts of the section on displaced homemakers. Section 3 is a demographic profile of women raising children alone. Thirty charts are included.

National trends and issues related to the employment and education of teachers are discussed with emphasis on influential factors and events such as enrollment declines and changes in the demand for public school teachers. Factors and events influencing changes in home economics and home economics education, including enrollment trends, the labor market for home economics graduates, and overall changes in the field, are examined. The relationship between home economics and home economics education is discussed. The paper concludes that the field of home economics education is in a state of transition, even more so than the broader  field of education, and that changes in opportunities for women have affected both of these fields.

POWER is an acronym for Partnerships for On-site Workplace Education and Retraining and the objectives of the program, which officially began in October 1988 and ended in March 1990, were established to meet regional training requirements. The objectives were: (1) to increase existing coordination between education, business, and labor; (2) to increase the number of companies and, subsequently,  the number of employees who participate in workplace literacy programs; and (3) to increase work-related literacy skills of employees to officially establish performance levels needed for the job. The classes were planned cooperatively by Triton College and the companies. They were held within the company, meeting twice per week for 2 hours per session, for 10-15 weeks. Classes are work related, use work-release time, are free, provide child care and transportation assistance as needed, offer academic and personal counseling and tutors, and provide confidential assessment results. Benefits to participants include improved communication on and off the job, better job options and opportunities, increased promotability, preparation for technological advances at work, and improved confidence.

Section 2 includes suggestions for one-to-one goal setting conferences and for using individual learning  contracts. Three short group activities for introducing the individual activities and evaluating the progress of the group are also in this section. Section 3 contains group activities to help participants and tutors examine their reading history, activities to acquaint students with what good readers do, and other reading-related activities teachers can use with individuals or groups of students.
