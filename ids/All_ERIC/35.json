          "Coreil, Judith"],
        "description":"This booklet examines the need for school evaluation in the Catholic elementary school, the basic steps in the evaluation procedure, relevant evaluation criteria, and various evaluation instruments. The document suggests that regular school evaluation is needed to facilitate improvement, to provide a means of accountability, to foster community involvement, and to build public relations. To evaluate a school, educators must decide when to evaluate, determine the scope of the evaluation, review applicable criteria, select an appropriate instrument, identify persons to be involved, plan communication, complete the self-study process, verify the self-study report, design and implement the improvement plan, and review progress. Educators should also remember that evaluation is a  continuing process. Evaluative criteria to be considered are personnel, the instructional program, religious formation, community, social ministries, and worship. The final sections of the booklet consider evaluation instruments developed by the National Catholic Educational Association and by other Catholic elementary schools in the United States. A glossary of terms is provided. (PB)",

        "description":"The principles and practices of Catholic school supervision, as distinguished from school supervision in general, are predicated on a special Christian view of education, emphasizing the unique value, diversity, and personal growth of pupils and teachers alike within a mutually caring Christian community. Accordingly, an approach is developed for combining four different kinds of supervisory support, depending on the needs of the teachers. The first, \"clinical supervision,\" is a systematic program of intensive support to help beginning teachers improve professional skills. The supervisor visits classrooms frequently, reviews plans and objectives, analyzes data, and confers regularly with the teacher. The second, \"collaborative professional development,\" involves small groups of  teachers working together for their mutual improvement. The third, \"self-directed professional development,\" is a process by which a teacher systematically plans and carries out a professional growth program. The fourth, \"administrative monitoring,\" involves brief but systematic classroom visits by administrators to assess the educational climate and informally evaluate programs. Remaining chapters are devoted to strategies for implementing this differentiated program and to a resource guide to Catholic educational administrators throughout the country. A bibliography is included. (TE)",

Section 1 discusses catechesis in the Church today, the DRE as minister of the Word, and fundamental qualities suggested by authoritative Church documents to be characteristic of the life and work of the DRE. Section 2 explores the functions of the DRE in the parish community, policy-making and management responsibilities, and the three major roles generally accepted as designating parish leaders in religious education programs: director of religious education, coordinator of religious education, and administrator of religious  education. Section 3 advises prospective DRE's on methods of choosing a parish, job interviews, and contracts. Section 4 offers a rationale for providing adequate compensation for DRE's and examines specific provisions of a comprehensive job description (salary, personal and professional benefits, and working environment). Section 5 discusses evaluation of the DRE by and for the parish community and the DRE's responsibility in evaluation. Five appendixes provide a bibliography, parish profile, methods for developing a job description, projected budget, and sample salary scales. (PB)",

        "description":"The reluctance of the Southeast to increase educational spending is closely linked to the region's lagging behind the rest of the nation in quality of education and hence in overall standard of living. Six &quot;myths&quot; about educational spending, widely held in the Southeast, are here addressed: (1) That educational expenditures, worthwhile in the long run, are burdensome in the short run. In reality, dollars spent on education create jobs, purchase goods and services, and contribute to local economies. (2) That educational spending has greatly increased. In truth, increases have been modest relative to inflation and new demands. (3) That higher salaries have improved the economic status of teachers. In fact, because of inflation, teachers' purchasing power has declined, and too  little has been spent for support services. (4) That the Southeast spends proportionally more than other regions. Actually, expenditure per capita corresponds to the national average. (5) That the Southeast has been closing the gap. In reality, unless spending increases dramatically, the region will remain in last place. (6) That the Southeast cannot afford increased educational spending. On the contrary, one cent more per dollar of personal income could turn mediocrity into excellence. (TE)",

        "description":"Through a number of measures, both quantitative and qualitative, this progress report explores the achievements of Southeastern public schools in meeting the continually expanding goal of quality education for all citizens. Quantitative figures are shown, regionally and state by state, for ages of compulsory attendance, public and private school enrollments (1980), public school enrollment per population, and literacy of population (1900 and 1980). Qualitative measures of educational progress are provided by graphs and charts illustrating percent of high school graduates in the United States population (1870-1970), high school graduates 25 and older (1970 and 1980), median school years completed (1950 and 1980), public kindergarten enrollment (1970 and 1980), black adults  completing four or more years of high school (1970 and 1980), percentages of nonwhite populations, numbers of exceptional children served in public school programs, percent of children served in different educational environments, pupil/teacher ratios, minimum competency testing, and per capita personal income levels (relative to the nation as a whole). Conclusions derived from these statistics suggest three major challenges confronting education in the Southeast: (1) overcoming the legacy of poverty, (2) helping the nation compete in a highly technological world society, and (3) providing quality education with decreasing public resources.

        "description":"Based on data from document reviews and interviews from 12 school districts in 3 states, this interim report presents findings from the first year of implementation of Chapter 2 of the Educational Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) of 1981. The initial section of the report examines the redistribution of federal funds to local districts, the attainment of national education priorities, local flexibility in decision-making, and the reduction of administrative burdens. The second section, based on the premise that the local context significantly mediates Chapter 2's effects, presents case studies of five school districts that lost funding in the switch from antecedent programs to the block grant. These districts are examined because the current mood in Washington still  supports funding cuts for social services and because adjustments in Chapter 2 being discussed at the state and federal levels appear to focus on ways to compensate losers. The third section provides a discussion of the case studies and tries to account for differences in impacts the systems felt. The conclusion examines subsequent policy adjustments. Two appendixes provide research methods (the study's general approach, data collection procedures, and analysis methods) and capsule descriptions of the 12 school districts. (PB)",

Outlining computer-assisted learning (CAL), the author delineates two types: tutor mode CAL (the computer imparts knowledge to the student) and tutee mode CAL (the student directs interaction with the computer). Discussing the use of computers as an aid to problem solving in the classroom, the author predicts it will substantially change parts of the curriculum. The discipline of computer and information science is a new and important discipline, and high schools may  need to provide such courses as part of computer literacy.

The features of computers are then covered in two chapters: the first on the history and distinctive functions of computer systems, and the second on the properties of computer hardware and software, including the general problem solving strategies used by programmers. The three main instructional uses of computers--in computer-assisted learning, problem solving, and literacy--are then explained, with discussions of the realistic goals for computers  in education and the esential elements of a successful programming curriculum. The author also points out what parents can do to help their children learn about computers, including using computers in the public library or science museum, or placing computers in scout troops and summer camps. To facilitate computer education at home, the final section discusses the major considerations in buying and using a home computer.

The objectives were to determine the educational quality of DoDDS, the relation of student progress to expectations, the availability of resources and facilities, the effectiveness of the organizational structure, and future factors affecting DoDDS. Data were obtained from a multidimensional matrix approach involving a mail survey of principals, selected site visitations, and indepth case studies, along with a comparative survey of stateside resources. The result is a four-volume report, the first of which presents the findings of the study in 14 chapters covering the following  topics: (1) study methodology, (2) quality of education, (3) special services and programs for students with special needs, (4) special education, (5) testing and evaluation, (6) student achievement and attitudes, (7) staffing and staff development, (8) physical assets of DoDDS, (9) pupil transportation, (10) other aspects of support services (support of the military community, student feeding programs, advisory bodies, (11) stateside resources comparison, (12) budget and finance, (13) decision making and policy development, and (14) structure and organization.

Chapter 2, &quot;Changing Teacher Population,&quot; considers the complex interaction between teachers' career intentions, hiring methods, and DoDDS experience to derive projected teacher populations for each region. Chapter 3, &quot;Technological Advances,&quot; considers the problems, needs, and promise inherent in introducing computer technology  into DoDDS. Chapter 4 concerns &quot;Parents' Attitudes toward Education,&quot; based on a comprehensive survey and a comparison thereof to a national sample. Chapter 5, &quot;DoDDS and the Military Mission,&quot; addresses the relationship between parents' attitudes toward DoDDS schools and their decision to reenlist or accept overseas assignments. It also discusses major trends in military commitments and policy that will influence DoDDS. Chapter 6, &quot;Strategic Planning Processes in DoDDS,&quot; describes a system whereby DoDDS management can stay abreast of changing conditions.

In the first case, the quality of educational opportunity in DoDDS was found to be higher than that of stateside schools, although the smaller schools may lack diversity, and special education needs are not always met. Student academic progress was found to be well-correlated with student needs and educational expectations, though the high turnover rate results in less school spirit and a more serious, individualistic approach among students. Resources and facilities are in need of  repair and replacement, but serve most students well. The organizational structure and management practices of DoDDS, however, need to be improved. The study recommends establishment of a centralized management information system, with district-level supervision of schools, to give principals more time for instructional leadership. Finally, demographic trends, technological advances, and changes in military policy will have major impacts on DoDDS. Related recommendations pertain to accreditation policy, student testing, curriculum development, staff quality, facilities, pupil transportation, student meal program, and issues concerning a proposed transfer of jurisdiction to the Department of Education.

Of the families interviewed, about 88 percent had children in public schools; about 12 percent had children in private schools. Following a discussion in chapter 1 of the study's methodology and survey sample characteristics (region, income, race, parental education, residence, and religion), chapter 2 presents the study's findings concerning parental choice of schooling. Chapter 3 examines parental inclinations to transfer children to a different school under a tax credit. The fourth and last chapter  discusses the implications of parental preferences and the likelihood that parents would or could actually transfer their children to private schools under a tax credit. Survey findings indicate that a tuition tax credit could result in significantly higher private school enrollments in grades 1-12 with more students from minorities and less from affluent backgrounds, though private schools may be unable to absorb large enrollment increases in the short run. The study includes seven appendixes and numerous tables and figures. (JBM)",

A brief historical review of educational service delivery models for the severely handicapped is provided. These include: (1) no schools; (2) segregated private schools; (3) segregated public schools; (4) regular, but chronological age inappropriate, schools; (5) chronological age appropriate regular schools in accordance with the natural proportion; and (6) chronological age appropriate regular schools in accordance with the natural proportion and instruction in nonschool environments. Discussed are the educational implications of such learning and  performance characteristics of the severely handicapped as the number of skills that can be acquired, the number of instructional trials needed to acquire skills at meaningful performance criteria, instructional inference (transfer of training), skill complexity, retention-recoupment, synthesis skills, and generative skills. The authors compare four instructional location strategies (school instruction only, consecutive instruction in first the school and then the nonschool environments, concurrent instruction in both environments, and nonschool instruction only in appropriate natural environments). For students under the age of 18 concurrent instruction is recommended, though older students should receive most or all of their instruction in the nonschool environments in which the student  is expected to function.

Lessons are based on a direct instruction model involving a six step procedure: (1) etablishing the need, (2) identifying skill components, (3) modeling the skill, (4) role playing the skill, (5) practicing the skill, and (6) generalizing and transfering the skill to other  settings. Instructions are given for assessing student needs and for carrying out the lessons. Suggestions are also given for followup and performance deficits including use of a token economy, behavioral contracts, peer instruction, cognitive behavior modification, and home contingencies. Suggestions are also given for creating more lessons. Sample lessons include the following: attending to teacher during instruction (primary), taking turns in games and activities (primary), completing work on time (intermediate), asking peers for help (intermediate), dealing with embarrassment (junior high), initiating conversations (junior high), using free time productively (senior high), and negotiating on the job (senior high).

The battery was intended to meet the need created by the Education for All Handicapped Children Act and provide data for the assessment of recreation and leisure functioning as part of the student's overall individualized education program. Two versions of the leisure diagnostic battery (LDB) were developed: one for disabled students (9-15 years old) with normal cognitive development and one for 9-15 year olds with educable mental retardation. Project objectives and tasks for the 3 years are detailed, and a summary charts the project's evolution by year. The LDB's conceptualization and development are discussed in terms of its  basis in perceived freedom and leisure (with implications for perceived control, competence, and intrinsic motivation); its process of assessment through remediation; and the components, purposes, and domains of the LDB scales. Field test data for reliability and validity of both versions are reported. (CL)",

A state-wide sample of severely handicapped, behavior problem children (2-8 years old) was observed longitudinally in their public school program. Real-time observational techniques using microprocessors recorded percent duration of over 95 inappropriate behaviors as well as teacher and environmental variables. Excess behaviors showed small decreases over 3 years, as contrasted with previous epidemiological findings for institutionalized children. For a subsample of the Ss individual interventions were undertaken to determine whether response patterns could be  identified. Although reliable clusters proved difficult to identify, both the child studies and investigations of teachers' decision making suggested that programing based on the acquisition of functional skills was the most valuable strategy for reducing excess behaviors. A model was developed to help teachers and other clinicians choose interventions. (Author/CL)",

In the third project year decision-rules were formulated to help teachers identify problems in acquisition, fluency building and compliance from the students' performance records. Effectiveness of teachers who used the decision-rules was analyzed in terms of improvements in pupil performance and/or rate of progress. In year 4, teachers applied a revised set of decision rules based on questions concerning pupil data. Problems with  noncompliance in children were noted and interventions attempted. Decision-rules were integrated with a minimum acceleration procedure in which the teacher specifies a minimum rate of change. Year 5 activities examined the learning of the decision-rules by 81 teachers in a wide variety of settings with varying amounts of training and assistance. Adoption of the rules resulted in successful decisions and reduced planning time. Cost data were also examined. Four site reports are presented in the document's conclusion. (CL)",

Dyads engaged in a semi-structured free play activity followed by a structural block sorting task. An observation system was used which permitted coding of verbal behaviors in terms of linguistic forms, communicative functions, and content references. Results of analyses of variance revealed that the activity factor had the greatest impact on the expressed behavior. The  activity influenced both parent behavior (including frequencies of initiating, asking questions, and giving orders) and child behavior (such as soliciting, requesting or providing substantive information, and cooperating). The only behaviors differentiating groups of parents and their children were their verbalizing and references to spatial relationships and classification. The activity also exerted the most influence on sequences of behaviors. Few parent sex/role differences were observed. (CL)",

Suggestions are given for developing and implementing an overcorrection procedure, as well as for assessing the treatment's effectiveness. Clinical examples of the approach used with such maladaptive behaviors as vomiting, food stealing, and self-injurious behavior are cited. Punishment is defined and two types of  aversive stimuli (primary and conditioned) are described. Characteristics of punishment are noted, and the major types of punishment programs (response cost, time-out, and primary aversive techniques such as electric shock and ammonia inhalation) are considered.

Among considerations in using the DI are that the DI should be computed within and across domains to reveal a more accurate and reliable picture of the child's functioning and that the cutoff  point should be moved upward to safeguard against overlooking delayed preschoolers.

Detailed observations, interviews, and questionnaires were used to collect data on the structural characteristics of the Ss' networks, use of ties as coping mechanisms, nature of transactions between study participants and ties, and the qualitative aspects of specific critical social ties. Results indicated reliance on kin ties to provide a variety of support and suggestded that degree of familial embeddedness was a primary determinant of the extent to which non-kin ties were developed. Successful adaptation to independent living and a more balanced network structure appeared to be  related to the degree of responsibility given and contributions made in the home. The need for preparing retarded adults to form rewarding and useful non-kin ties were pointed out. (CL)",

A segment of a study that examined business and engineering graduate students' language difficulties and faculty perceptions of the students' language deficiencies and language skill needs in pursuing academic study is summarized. Priorities for testing are outlined, including: greater knowledge of student characteristics and the role of English in their  daily lives; support for research that can be translated into terms useful for administrators; improved linkage between administrators and field specialists; evaluation of the tests now used, from linguistic, psychometric, and practical perspectives; and improved dialogue between teaching and testing specialists.

        "description":"The Adult English as a Second Language Diagnostic Reading Test was developed under Adult Education Demonstration Funding. It is designed for English as a Second Language students in adult education or community college programs. The purpose is to diagnose reading strengths and weaknesses for a student or groups of students as well as to provide teachers with suggestions for planning appropriate instruction. Included in the User's Manual is a Locator Test, the AESL Diagnostic Reading Test, Sample Strategy Lessons, how to administer and score the tests, and a technical section. The Locator Test is used to accurately determine which level of the AESL Diagnostic Reading Test is most appropriate for the student to take. The Locator Test is in a cloze format with 55 blanks and requires  forty-five minutes to complete. The AESL Diagnostic Reading Test has a beginning and an intermediate form; each form has two passages in a maze (multiple answer cloze) format. The number of blanks per passage ranges from 96 to 128. Each passage requires one hour to complete. Diagnosis is based on the percentage of identical responses and the percentage and type of errors made on the two passages of the maze test. The four error types are: semantically appropriate, semantically inappropriate, partially acceptable, and minimal units. After tabulating the percentages of identical and error responses for an individual or group of students, the teacher will have the information needed to develop a reading &quot;profile&quot; for an individual or group. This profile is then used to determine which  Reading Strategy Lessons will be most helpful in meeting the students' needs. (Author)",

Most second language learning studies cited in the literature concern acquisition of English in English-speaking communities, and most American studies of Filipino language acquisition are superficial, consisting primarily of morpheme analysis. The Philippines are an excellent laboratory for language acquisition studies because of the multilingual context. Within the country, research on the nature of Filipino language acquisition is a top priority, because 60 to 70 percent of Filipinos are non-Tagalog speakers. Also, most non-Tagalogs learn two languages simultaneously: one at home and the other (Pilipino) taught in school and used in the community. Research in early childhood  bilingualism in this situation would be revealing. Philippine data could also be used to study universals in second language acquisition for development of a general theory. (MSE)",

Systematic use of CAI was found only in large Chicago-area schools, with few foreign language teachers  using the available resources. Lack of software emerged as a significant obstacle.

It includes three years' instruction, in addition to the two years required for admission. Three levels are offered, and although students may take the proficiency examination at the advanced level, most choose either to study abroad or enroll in post-advanced courses first. Six categories of linguistic goals are specified (reading comprehension, listening comprehension, grammar and word order, vocabulary, pronunciation, and fluency) with five competence levels established. The foreign service content component is less specifically articulated by levels. The proficiency examination is  separate from the final course examination and is recorded separately in each student's official transcript. The proficiency examination consists of a reading comprehension component and a free oral examination, and each student is evaluated by two faculty. The proficiency-based approach has increased awareness of goals and appropriate instructional materials. Students have strongly supported the approach, and both student and faculty morale and goal-orientation have been enhanced by it. Although the testing method is cumbersome and of limited application, it has served as a good reflection of faculty, students, program structure, materials, and methodology. (MSE)",

        "description":"Research into process-oriented writing instruction for native speakers of English can improve instruction in writing for students of English as a second language (ESL). Process-oriented instruction focuses on the processes of writing rather than on the finished product. A comparison of writing samples of native speakers from remedial courses and ESL students shows that despite differences in the types of grammatical and syntactical errors made, significant similarities exist. The ESL writer and remedial writer both approach writing in a linear fashion with preconceived ideas, and arrive at a conclusion too soon and without sufficient illustration or detail. Prewriting exercises in internal conversation are important for ESL students to develop rhetorical skills. In addition,  instruction in two major native speaker composition skills, freewriting and problem-solving, are applicable to ESL writing instruction. Freewriting is a technique for exploring and synthesizing original ideas, helping to break down inhibitions about expressing ideas by deemphasizing correctness of surface structures. The problem-solving technique approaches a writing task as a problem to be solved, considering desired outcome, intended audience, and potential problems, much like notional-functional considerations identifying content and purpose. Each technique may have specific application to cultural groups. Additional classroom practices include using real communicative situations, sentence-combining exercises, teacher writing samples, and active revision. (MSE)",

To give recognition to bilinguals' existing linguistic repertoire, \"biloquial\" approach is taken, placing value on both the students' existing language and the standard Spanish being taught. The aim is to build on students' substantial Spanish skills rather than trying to eradicate nonstandard usages. Written work is emphasized. Students are graded on progressively higher expectations, and are taught that effective communication rather than perfectionism in composition is valued.  (MSE)",

        "description":"Despite considerable linguistic diversity in Kenya, the country is increasingly trilingual, with individual Kenyans tending toward varying degrees of proficiency in the vernacular, Swahili, and English. The vernacular is acquired at home and in the neighborhood with co-ethnics in both rural and urban contexts. Swahili is typically learned informally from other nonnative speakers who speak a wide range of varieties of it, but there is a trend toward more formal instruction in school. English is learned within the school system, with English proposed in official policy as the medium of instruction from the fourth year of the system upward. English is used as the standard language of government and business communication. In Africa as a whole there is a tendency among African  writers to write in their own languages at the cost of reducing their potential audiences. This tendency will increase vernacular prestige and increase competition with Swahili and English. With increasing literacy in Kenya and heightened pan-African awareness, it is not unlikely that this movement will take a stronger hold there, resulting in enhanced vernacular literacy. (MSE)",

Textbook treatments of the constructions are reviewed, and the common limitations found include partial explanations, misleading information such as the use of incomplete English translations, erroneous information, and drills that do not help the teacher recognize student problems. The proposed approach focuses on the order of presentation of the categories of uses and on the nature of the drills and practice items. The categories are  grouped for presentation in this order: reflexive of change, preferably presented separately for animate and inanimate subjects; change of meaning; reflexive-only and optional; reflexive of interest and consumer; and \"do-it-yourself\" and reciprocal.

Twelve male and 8 female college students were asked to describe each of the photographs. Picture type was rated as high in interest to males, high in interest to females, or high in interest to both. Responses were scored for five categories of language use: word production (number of words, self-references, and color references); weakeners (self-deprecation, qualifiers such as \"kind of\" or \"looks like\"); fillers (\"um,\"\"er,\"\"okay\"); paralinguistic features (question inflection, laughter); and queries or comments to the experimenter (task-related or task-irrelevant). Picture type was found to affect length of description (shortest for  female-interest pictures), color references (most for female-interest), and question intonation (most common for male-interest). The use of self-reference and self-deprecation were both associated with question intonation and laughter. Results suggest that while topic affects speech style, gender does not. (MSE)",

Bilingual education programs were broadly defined to include transitional, maintenance, or other programs in English and/or native languages for children of minority language backgrounds not proficient in English. Also included were non-English language programs for children who may or may not be proficient in English. The process included (1) a review of the literature, convening of an advisory committee, and preparation of a descriptive brochure; (2) a search for programs, including nominations from organizations, idea sessions with nonpublic school  educators, and followup monitoring; and (3) site visits to the programs. This process is outlined and findings are presented in the form of site visit profiles, general findings, and specific conclusions. Policy issues discussed include language values, conditions for developing new instructional practices, private schools as a governmental category, private values and public aid, negativism about bilingual education, and integration in private schools. It is concluded that although language training in these schools may reflect the state of the art, it is not influencing important breakthroughs in techniques or methods. The private schools studied appear to attract students as much for the values associated with private schools as for the benefits of the language programs.  (MSE)",

For each skill, the primary research question was the degree to which the students' first language (L1) performance was predictive of their second language (L2) performance. Subjects were from bilingual education programs in two southern California school districts, in kindergarten through sixth grade. Comparison groups of monolingual English-speaking students were used. Students answered comprehension questions about modified versions of Aesop's fables. General results indicate that for both skills, use of previously acquired knowledge is about the same for L1 and L2. This is  limited only by the child's code breaking skills for L2, in listening comprehension for younger subjects, and in reading comprehension for older children. Once the basic parsing skills are acquired, the higher order comprehension processes are similar, whether material is presented in L1 or L2. Comparisons with monolingual English-speaking students indicate no negative effect of dealing with both Spanish and English in school. There was some indication that bilingual students with training in Spanish as a second language were slightly more proficient in English than their monolingual counterparts. In addition, English performance of the students of English as a second language equaled that of their monolingual counterparts by the fourth grade, and L1 performance of the two groups was  equivalent at all levels. Pedagogical implications are discussed. (MSE)",

The initial task was an ethnographic survey of the community, focusing on its language activities and values. Four families were studied and compared, and the parents' perspectives examined. Based on these findings, appropriate writing activities were developed for this group and formulated into instructional modules, for which seminars were held to familiarize teachers with the materials and techniques. Modules were designed with content and activities relevant to students' everyday concerns and communication needs. The writing  modules were then used in 3 junior high schools with 293 students. Evaluations of over 1,000 pre- and post-course writing samples showed a significant achievement gain during the period of the study. It is suggested that the potential role of ethnography in instructional reform is great, providing a key to instructional, motivational, and sociocultural congruence in the classroom for both teachers and students.

Additional suggestions are as follows: faculty evaluation should focus on the teaching performance and not on the faculty member's scholarly reputation or productivity; faculty evaluation should be the responsibility of those administratively responsible for faculty performance; evaluation by students and colleagues has severe limitations if evaluation is to serve the improvement of instruction;  evaluations should be conducted in a systematic, objective, valid, and fair manner; the results of faculty evaluation should be specified in advance and be acceptable to the faculty being evaluated; faculty evaluation must be tied to the institution's incentive-and-reward system; and evaluation should be supported by means of faculty development in the form of instructional resources that facilitate classroom instruction.

These issues are considered in a WICHE conference paper, commentaries from four panelists at the WICHE conference, and a summary of the major points made during a question and answer period. It is noted that regional cooperation can ensure that: not every state or every institution needs to be comprehensive in its higher education offerings; high-cost, low-demand programs are not duplicated; resources are allocated or reallocated more efficiently across the region, or among groupings  of states; institutional resources are combined or coordinated to improve program effectiveness; and student access to uncommon programs is protected. Among the activities of WICHE are professional student exchange programs, cooperative manpower planning, and interstate program coordination. Additional topics include the nature of retrenchment, telecommunications, cooperative programming, and the role that WICHE might play with policy-makers.

UCB's international activities are not shaped by any official campus plan, but result from the efforts of individual scholars and various campus organizations. Four broad types of internationally-focused activities at UCB are as follows: academic exchange programs; the exchange of ideas and experience through conferences, seminars, and workshops; technical assistance involving a variety of experts and specialists; and extracurricular education such as music, film, art, theater, and sports. In contrast to the pattern for foreign students coming to UCB, 92 percent of local students who go overseas from UCB are undergraduates, and most of them major in the social sciences, languages, and  humanities. In 1981 about 2,100 immigrant foreign students and 1,860 nonimmigrants were attending UCB, and most were studying engineering and the sciences. Of the nonimmigrant foreign students, the majority were male graduate students. Foreign scholars who are involved in teaching or research at UCB represent 72 countries and totaled 1,512 in 1981, most in the fields of science and technology. Technical assistance by UCB involves the transfer of knowledge, skills, and technology, often to the Third World countries. (SW)",

Four basic demographic characteristics important to understanding and planning for state educational support are addressed: population, income, enrollment, and state expenditures. Separate tables for elementary/secondary education and for higher education include the following subcategories: state support in millions, the percentage change from 1977-1978 to 1982-1983,  state support as percent of state expenditures, support per pupil, support per capita, and support per $1,000 personal income. Finally, the relationships between state support for elementary/secondary education and state support for higher education is examined, and the states are classified in terms of whether support for one level of education is being provided at the expense of support for the other level.

For the faculty advisor and consultant, participation offers the opportunity to gain professional business experience and contacts. It is suggested that the consultant is an active faculty member in teaching, publication, and scholarship. Cooperative education is the student's first experience in searching for a career. At the end of the experience, the cooperative education program serves as a transition to the  workplace, and permanent employment with the employer may occur. It is noted that the writing talent of English majors is valued by groups within large organizations, such as corporate relations, marketing, advertising, information services, personnel, and human resources.

One approach for improving students' problem-solving skills rests in the application of cognitive development theories to instruction. Instructional strategies that facilitate cognitive development can be categorized into two groups: instruction that challenges the student's cognitive structures or creates disequilibrium, and instruction that provides support such that the student will engage in the opportunity created by the disequilibrium. Four types of instructional strategies that have been used successfully to introduce disequilibrium are considered: creating dissonance, direct experience, diversity, and social transmission. Three strategies that increase the probability that students  will engage in the learning process and attend to the cognitive disequilibrium are also discussed: structure that focuses the students' attention on the disequilibrium, psychological support to help students manage the ego-threatening activities of learning, and \"plus-one\" instruction designed to tune into the students' level of thinking. It is suggested that some combination of instructional methods under certain conditions can facilitate cognitive growth. (SW)",

Views and suggestions were provided on learning, clinical education, college preparation and admission to medical school, and faculty. It was suggested that despite the enormous amount of time devoted to instruction, medical school students are not necessarily prepared to be independent learners who can apply critical, analytic abilities to problem-solving. Concern was expressed regarding the emphasis on memorization of factual details and the need for faculty to identify essential concepts and principles. More small group instruction and more time for independent learning were  also recommended. The contribution of computer technology and overall impediments to change in medical education were also identified. The clinical component was characterized as permissive, often poorly-integrated, and frequently undersupervised. Another concern was the debate regarding a balanced preparation for medical school (i.e., sciences versus humanities). Greater recognition for the educational efforts of medical school faculty members was suggested in order to accomplish changes needed in the general professional education of the physician. (SW)",

A statewide population survey of all high school counselors in New York yielded 660 usable responses (20 percent). Attention is focused on quality estimations of four criteria for 15 institutions. Quality assessments of faculty, programs, students, and selectivity were made for each of the 15 institutions. Regional and statewide comparisons were developed to allow monitoring changes in particular geographic areas of interest. From the survey data, a current image or college profile was developed to serve as a comparative baseline in successive years as the State University of New York College at Brockport attempts to increase standards  and to improve the quality of its entering classes. Based on the findings, it was concluded that Brockport needs to improve its image among its clientele. College admission counselors can effectively enlist the assistance of high school guidance counselors to further its goal. (SW)",

        "description":"Enrollment patterns for the University of Wisconsin, Madison, for the period 1983-1995 are projected. Three possible scenarios, each representing a different set of assumptions concerning factors that affect undergraduate enrollment, are presented. The projections are based on demographic and secondary school enrollment data, and on historical patterns in the institution's enrollment. The cohort-survival technique was employed. It is projected that the university's undergraduate enrollment will probably decline slowly over the next 10 to 12 years and then begin to increase again. The decline is smaller than would be expected by Wisconsin demographics and is built on the assumption that the proportion of 18-year-olds who attend the university will continue to increase, and that  the nonresident undergraduate enrollment and nontraditional age enrollment will remain constant or increase. The use of more optimistic assumptions regarding the enrollment of women, minorities, nonresident students and older students projects an even smaller decline. Patterns in the enrollments of these subgroups are examined in detail. Graduate enrollment is projected to remain at approximately the current level. Statistics for projected enrollments are appended. (Author/SW)",

A sample of 43 undergraduate teacher-made examinations was obtained from two colleges and three universities. The sample included midterm and final examinations and quizzes. The tests were written by 36 faculty members, including 9 assistant professors, 23 associate professors, and 4 full professors. A total of 1,220 multiple-choice questions were evaluated based on 10 test-wiseness criteria (Millman, et al., 1965). It was found that 44 percent of the items contained a test-wiseness clue, and 70 percent of these items could be answered correctly by applying a clue. The clue discovered most often was \"direct  opposites\" (i.e, writing an alternative directly opposite to the correct answer). The overall most successful clue was \"key word association.\" It is suggested that college teachers need to consider how to avoid these clues when developing examinations. Implications for college personnel responsible for student academic improvement and faculty development are addressed. Explanations of the 10 test-wiseness criteria are included, along with information on the data analysis procedures. (SW)",

Three types of computer applications are examined: learning about computers and their relation to society, including computer programming; learning through computers, which includes drill-and-practice, diagnostic testing, and tutorial programs; and learning with computers, which is using the computer as a tool of instruction and creating an environment where learning may occur. Some fear that in the rush to include computers and computer literacy in the school curriculum, the teaching of reading, writing, and mathematics will be put aside. Another issue is that access to computers in schools may differ along socioeconomic lines. The proportion of  elementary and secondary schools having microcomputers for instruction is increasing in the 1980s. However, southern elementary schools are less likely to have a microcomputer than elementary schools outside the South. Colleges and universities are moving to include computer training for teachers at both preservice and inservice levels. Nationally, several states now have teacher certification in the area of computer education. To address the problems of inadequate software, district, state, and national level efforts are underway.

It is suggested that before educators can provide quality instruction, they need to differentiate practices that are conducive to learning. Evaluative criteria are needed to make such decisions, as well as to design and evaluate experimental investigations. Particularly important are the following: (1) sampling considerations, including a representative study population, randomization, analysis of covariance, and internal validity; (2) independent variables; (3) training in the teaching technique under analysis; (4) instruments that are adequately described and appropriate to the task; and (5) data analysis techniques that are appropriate for the experimental  design. To bridge the gap between practice and theory, cooperative research ventures between instructors and researchers must be undertaken. It is suggested that college reading staff need to: understand the contributing role of research, develop the skills necessary for evaluating and conducting studies, and continue to seek the institutional support (release time, seed money, assistants) necessary for conducting applied research.

However, neither low demand nor low quality is sufficient for program discontinuance without a judgment on the criterion of the centrality of the program to the institution's core mission. Colleges' retrenchment and survival mechanisms must: (1) be selected from a wide range of possibilities that include short-, medium-, and long-term tactics; and (2) be congruent with a reaffirmed or newly-revised mission. To use the demand and quality criteria to the exclusion of centrality is to misunderstand the nature of colleges and universities. The steps ought to be: (1) recommit or revise the institutional mission; (2) design a curriculum directly related to the mission; and (3)  compare the present curriculum with the ideal. In addition to the fact that consideration of demand and quality issues alone may lead to programmatically debilitating decisions, restricting programs to one institution within a region will lead to inequality of opportunity. The cost of attending an institution farther from home will keep some lower-income students out of certain programs or out of postsecondary education altogether. (SW)",

The younger students were matched with the older groups on four characteristics: sex, major field of study, semester credit load, and class standing. All 56 participants were undergraduate students (sophomores or juniors) who were registered for the fall 1982 term. The participants kept running records of their study habits, patterns, and difficulties for an academic year. In general, older and younger students showed similar patterns in terms of how much they studied, what activities were engaged in while studying, the time distribution, and places for studying. There was some evidence that older students studied slightly more per credit  hour than did younger students. While the total number of difficulties encountered in studying were about the same for both groups, the character of the difficulties was noticeably different. Both older and younger students reacted very favorably to having a mixture of the age groups in their classes. Recommendations for working with adult students and suggestions for further study are offered. Appendices include interview schedules and a study log form. (Author/SW)",

These ideas are more fully described, and it is proposed that even with various definitions of management styles in the literature, the key to a productive organizational system is the type of administrative style that directs the organization, not the organization that governs the people. If the organization is too autocratic, it may be because of the attitudes of the chief administrator. Based on the literature, a profile of an effective administrator is suggested.

        "description":"The text of a Supreme Court case that determined whether Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 applies to Grove City College is presented. The opinion was written by Justice White. Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance, and stipulates that assistance to a program be terminated when noncompliance is found. Grove City College accepts no direct assistance but enrolls students who receive federal grants that must be used for educational purposes. It was held that Title IX coverage is not foreclosed merely because federal funds are granted to the students rather than to the college's educational programs. However, the receipt of federal student financial aid by some of the college's students does not  trigger institution-wide coverage under Title IX. In purpose and effect, federal student aid represents financial assistance to the college's own financial aid program, and it is that program that may be regulated under Title IX's nondiscrimination provision. The fact that federal funds eventually reach the college's general operating budget cannot subject it to institution-wide coverage. A refusal to execute a program-specific assurance of compliance warrants the department's termination of federal assistance to the student financial aid program. (SW)",

Topics include: the desirability of establishing territorial monopolies for student loan guarantee agencies, the views of the Higher Education Assistance Foundation and the United Student Aid Funds organization concerning the proposal to prohibit lending or guaranteeing loans across state borders, views on Utah's Law School Assured Access Program, and results of a study of the coordination of interstate activities in lending and loan guaranteeing. A primary concern of the hearings is whether state guaranteed agencies are meeting the borrowing needs of students, as specified in the Higher Education  Act. Questions are raised concerning public accountability of private lenders, whether better services could be provided to the public through multiple guarantors in a state, and whether new proposals would erode participation by the smaller size lender. Additional topics include participation by United Negro College Fund colleges in the Citibank higher education assistance foundation program, and the role of the Law School Admissions Council in assuring that students accepted to law school will have the resources to attend.

        "description":"Hearings are presented on the Collegiate Student-Athlete Protection Act of 1983, a bill designed to encourage college student-athletes to complete their undergraduate education before becoming professional athletes. This legislation addresses the relationship between professional sports league eligibility rules and the antitrust laws. The eligibility requirements are based on elapsed time from high school graduation. The legislation makes clear that professional sports leagues and associations have the legal authority to promulgate rules regarding recruiting and eligibility without being faced with antitrust charges. The proposed legislation was prompted by the signing of the University of Georgia's football star, Herschel Walker, by a member team of the United States Football  League. The scope of the hearings is confined to the public policy issue of whether antitrust laws should bar professional teams from policing themselves. The effect, however, is a broader public policy issue--whether college athletes will, at the least, be free from pressure to abandon their education. While Congress cannot force athletes to follow this course, it can provide the most favorable environment for doing so. Witnesses include representatives of professional leagues and associations, athletes, and a sports attorney. (SW)",

The primary objective was to provide an opportunity for black scholars to participate in research with emphasis on issues confronting black communities in the 1980s. The focus was to enhance the research skills of the scholars and to create a positive climate to promote research activities. Five research teams were organized, with a total of 13 faculty members and eight students. In addition to team research activities, six seminars/workshops were sponsored. A 90 percent participation level by faculty and students was achieved. Outcomes of these activities include the following: four proposals were written and submitted to outside  agencies for funding; participants took part in faculty development activities (e.g., postgraduate courses) for the purpose of enhancing their research skills; one participant presented a paper at a national conference on blacks in higher education; the faculty retreat research activity has been institutionalized; and a new curriculum for preparing teachers has been instituted.

It is claimed that if these offenses are categorized as disciplinary misconduct, students are entitled to some due process. However, if cheating and plagiarism are classified as academic evaluations, students are entitled to little, if any, due process. The courts may enter the picture if it can be shown that the actions of the school, including actions of faculty as agents of the institution, are clearly unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. Allowing faculty the right to judge what is cheating or plagiarism is a problem that is further complicated when faculty are also given the right (responsibility) to decide what sanction or punishment is  appropriate. It is suggested that if cheating and plagiarism are examples of code of conduct breaches, all such cases should go before a hearing board. These offenses would then be matters beyond an individual faculty member's right to decide. A questionnaire about what qualifies as cheating and a \"Cheating Quiz\" are appended. (SW)",

In Phase 1, principals were surveyed for background information, while Phase 2 involved observation, interviews, and surveys in schools and special education settings in the Toronto elementary school system during the 1982-83 school year. The analysis of the data obtained is based on the concept of preparedness context, which refers to people in educational settings and their preparation for new technology. The first section of this report describes and discusses the results of the  survey conducted in Phase 1. Results of the Phase 2 fieldwork are then organized around a specific preparedness context: grassroots preparedness, uneven preparedness, unallied external preparedness, and experimental preparedness. Typical patterns of interaction are traced and linked with preparedness through a description of each awareness context, an examination of the structural conditions that enter into the context, and examination of the consequent interactions, tactics, problems, and solutions. Appendices describe data collection methods and include the collection instruments used. (LMM)",

Cataloging principles ascribed to Berman include naturalness and fullness of language, file integration, findability (exemplified by a rich multiplicity of added entries), and fairness (nonoffensive, noncritical cataloging). It is asserted that Berman lacks familiarity with general scholarly practice and with the theoretical foundations of cataloging. Berman's attitudes on descriptive cataloging and his attack on Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd edition (AACR2) are described, as are his proposals for avoiding subject headings offensive to groups of  persons. A case study in Berman's use of nonoffensive cataloging is given, with comments on Berman's lack of concern for systematicity. Also described are Berman's attitude toward the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) as a system, his views on syndesis and the improvement of subject heading systems, and his opinions on the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system. The style of Berman's book is also reviewed. A series of heated responses by Sanford Berman and J. M. Perreault, a brief editorial comment, and the authors' vitae conclude the publication. (ESR)",

        "description":"Based on the concept that library use measurement should have as its basic starting point the individual patron, a method of data collection and analysis has been developed that explores individual patterns of borrowing over time. The method accounts for the number of visits on which borrowing takes place, number of items borrowed per visit, and total items borrowed over time, and it relates these to personal characteristics such as gender and distance of residence from the library. Four &quot;core groups&quot; can be identified from this analysis: core borrowers, heavy visitors, heavy borrowers, and light users. The study of individual user patterns results in a variety of potential applications for library decision making, such as a revised look at reciprocal borrowing policy, new  knowledge of patron characteristics in relation to library use, and more information on the proportion of community residents who borrow, the variations in use patterns by day of the week, and the use of multiple units in the same library system. This publication describes the basic principles of individual use measurement, methods of data collection, illustrative findings from two different library systems, practical applications of individual user measurement, and areas where further research and development of the methods will be necessary. Also presented is the author's vita. (Author/ESR)",

The course is based on a workbook adapted from the one used at Pennsylvania State University and students are required to complete workbook exercises and to compile a bibliography on 1 of a possible 25 topics. Based on t-test analysis of pretest and posttest results from an experimental group and a control group and on results of the administration of a Semantic Differential scale, it was found that there was a significant, positive gain in student knowledge of the library and student attitudes toward the library as a result of the course. One puzzling finding was that the pretest scores of the  experimental group were much lower than those of the control group. This paper describes the study methodology and results, and also presents information on the history of library instruction at SRU and the objectives and design of the SRU library research course.

Institutions included were adult correctional facilities, youth facilities, mental health/mental retardation facilities, and veterans' homes. It was found that institutions serving total annual populations of 150 or more residents generally had created staff positions for librarians; institutional librarians were responsible for library services to both staff and residents; generally only one librarian was employed, with no salaried support staff; library collections were inadequate in both quantity and quality; and libraries were located in areas not designed for library service and in spaces too small to  allow for the development of adequate collections, services, and programs to meet national standards. This report describes the survey methodology and findings and the impact of Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) funds on the development of library services to residents of institutions. Comparisons are made to a 1967 study in order to measure institutional library development during the past 15 years. A sample self-evaluation form and profiles of the 15 institutional libraries, with comparisons to national standards for collection quality and size, are also provided. (ESR)",

It is noted that when thinking in terms of I&R systems, attention must be directed to the overall quality of the structures and processes involved in I&R delivery and that a strategic approach to building I&R systems must be adopted. Key elements of sucessful I&R systems are described as quality coverage of I&R for the service area, quality support functions for all I&R services within the system, and the development of I&R policies and practices. Operated by public agencies, public libraries, and private nonprofit agencies, the seven I&R systems described are  located in Connecticut, Memphis (Tennessee), Summit County (Ohio), Los Angeles (California), Metropolitan Denver (Colorado), Southeastern Virginia, and Humboldt/Del Norte Counties (California). Centralized and decentralized systems and relationships between component parts of systems are also discussed. A list of questions for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of an I&R system concludes the pamphlet. (ESR)",

Responses were received from 62 (89%) of the libraries in the sample. Based on a weighted analysis of responses to determine a statewide estimate, it was found that 79% of the adults located what they wanted in the library on the day of the survey; that the next thing patrons reported they would do to locate material or information they wanted but did not find was to try another library (27%), try the same library again (51%), or try some other means (22%); and that while 36% of those surveyed  requested no changes in their local libraries, the most desired change requested by other respondents was more or different books and periodicals. This publication describes survey methodology and results. Bar charts show responses by level of library usage and age of respondents, while tables present the distribution of responses by geographical area and community population size, whether patrons found what they wanted and their level of library usage, and the sex and age of the respondents.

Results of telephone surveys of approximately 450 DTIC users indicate that in 1982  there were 12.4 million readings of Department of Defense (DoD) technical reports identified through various channels including online searching of the TR database, use of CAB, and use of TAB; and that there were about 14,000 users of the management databanks. Expressed in terms of willingness to pay for its products and services, the value of DTIC to the user is indicated as $367 million, while its value to the funders, expressed in terms of savings resulting from reading of DoD technical reports, is estimated at $37.5 billion.

Academic, school, public, and special libraries participated in the project. A major project objective was to determine whether the sharing of an OCLC terminal by two to five libraries in close geographic proximity could significantly cut costs and yet provide acceptable service. This report describes specific cluster work arrangements for cataloging and interlibrary loan, including cataloging at the host library; cataloging from printouts; cataloging by the host library; conducting part of the cataloging procedure at the guest library and the rest at the host library; limiting interlibrary loan  activity to lending of materials requested via OCLC; lending and borrowing through the host library; lending and borrowing by the guest library; and dial access interlibrary loan use and shared use of a portable terminal. Financial and physical considerations of these cluster arrangements are described as are the reactions of librarians and staff. It is concluded that clustering provides a good way to introduce libraries to OCLC use, but that any cluster arrangement will probably result in quest libraries deciding, if at all possible, to purchase their own terminals.

Though strong technical programs are an important part of what urban community colleges offer to their students, access to the baccalaureate degree remains the most important opportunity these institutions can provide. Colleges seeking to advance the transfer function have attempted to correct some of the mistakes that have been made in the interests of increasing enrollments and maintaining fiscal stability. Some of the most promising directions being taken in this area are: (1) colleges are beginning to reemphasize the importance of the transfer  function; (2) they are beginning to require the same literacy skills and academic preparation for those who enter transfer programs as for those entering career programs; (3) they are re-establishing strong orientation programs for students who intend to transfer; (4) they are working with state coordinating boards, urban universities, and feeder high schools to establish clearly defined and better supported paths to the baccalaureate; (5) they are emphasizing skills that are required by advanced courses in remedial programs; and (6) they are concentrating available resources on students with the willingness and ability to use them to greatest advantage.

        "description":"A study was conducted at Phillips County Community College (PCCC) to analyze the impact of freshman orientation classes on students' persistence and academic performance. The participants in the study were all first-time, full-time freshmen who entered PCCC during the fall 1982, spring 1983, or fall 1983 semesters. During the registration process, students were encouraged to enroll in an 8-week orientation class that included information on academic policies, college regulations, career counseling and testing, placement, financial aid, student services, and study skills. Performance and persistence data were analyzed for an experimental group of 337 students who successfully completed the orientation class and for a control group of 433 students who either did not enroll in or  did not complete the class. Study findings revealed that: (1 ) 79.7% of the experimental group had been retained at the end of one semester, compared to 43.1% of the control group; (2) at the end of one academic year, 45.3% of the fall 1982 experimental group had been retained, compared to 23.2% of the control group; (3) the combined first semester mean grade point average for the experimental group was 2.28, compared to 1.72 for the control group. Based on study findings, increased efforts to enroll freshmen in orientation classes, improvement in the consistency of those classes, and promotion of the classes among faculty and staff were recommended. A review of the literature, a bibliography, and the orientation class syllabus are included in the report. (HB)",

        "description":"A language skills program was developed at Lake City Community College to increase remedial students' chances of academic success in college courses. The program concentrates first on developing students' speaking and listening skills and then proceeds to more complex reading and writing skills. The program provides 16 weeks of developmental study for academically underprepared students, during which skills in oral communication, listening comprehension, grammar, punctuation, spelling, sentence structure, paragraph writing, reading comprehension, vocabulary development, and study skills are approached in an integrated manner. An evaluation of the program involved two groups of students: an experimental group (N=26) of students who completed the language skills program and  subsequently the college's basic English course, and a control group (N=25) of students who completed only the basic English course. The groups were compared on the basis of pre- and post-test measures of vocabulary and reading comprehension, and final grades in the English course. The results indicated that the experimental group performed better on both the vocabulary and comprehension tests and averaged a full letter grade higher than the control group in the English course.

Topics addressed in the report include the development of the CFC, controversy concerning the admission of advocacy organizations in the CFC; conflict between the OPM and the PPFA during 1982, conflict between the OPM and the PPFA during 1983, questions the OPM required the PPFA to answer in an attempt to discover some technical flaw in their application, and problems relating to the existence of a double set of guidelines  for accounting and financial reporting.

Specific objectives of the study were to (1) describe the child care use patterns among families with varying demographic characteristics and with children of various ages; (2) explore parental satisfaction with current care; (3) describe how families find and select care; (4) explore the circumstances of and attitudes toward self- and sibling care; and (5) describe  the community context for school-age care and explore ways in which communities meet their child care needs. Data were collected in the following ways: computer-assisted telephone interviews with a random sample of almost 1,000 households having school-age children; face-to-face discussions with parents, children, day care providers, and state and local officials; and group discussions with parents. Findings, based primarily on results of the telephone survey, indicate overall similarities between the two states. Additional findings are summarily discussed. (RH)",

A total of 24 kindergarten and 28 first graders of middle socioeconomic status were interviewed individually during a 35 to 45 minute session. The assessment instrument consisted of two sets of tasks: those measuring social concepts and those measuring basic concepts. No significant differences were found for race or sex. However, significant differences were found between the two grades in both total basic concept and total social concept scores. First graders obtained higher scores than  kindergarteners on both measures. It was also indicated that knowledge of social concepts developed in tandem with basic concept growth and that concept development remained about the same from kindergarten to first grade. Results suggested that this line of research will provide needed clarification of the parameters of young children's social studies concepts and provide empirical information to guide the choice of key concepts for social studies instruction.

        "description":"A review of college admissions standards and practices during the past 25 years illustrates the degree to which higher education has influenced curriculum characteristics at the secondary school level. The cooperative relationships that existed between the two sectors in earlier years gave way to campus pressures in the mid l960s. College enrollments expanded, and priorities shifted from high school/college articulation matters to student restlessness, impatience, and activism. By the early 1970s, campus activists had gained a strong influence on college curriculum and grading systems. Higher education became more stable in the mid-1970s, while high schools became more flexible by incorporating less demanding curricula. College and high school pendulums were thus out of  synchronization. In the late l970s and today, college academic demands are frequently too severe for the quality of students admitted. At this point, local initiatives guided by flexible models, visible incentives, and standardized displays of results should be encouraged so that students and educators are motivated to exceed rather than conform to minimum standards.

Many teacher education programs are in disarray due to inept staff and curricula that have not kept up with research results. In addition, many state agencies have set teacher certification requirements that are political in nature. From current analyses of teacher education and recent research on effective teaching and learning, one can derive at least 10 criteria by which to judge the quality of teacher preparation programs. These criteria can serve as guidelines for the redesign of teacher education. In conclusion, the reform of education and the improvement of teacher education must go hand in hand. (BJD)",

        "description":"The primary aims of this paper are to (1) clarify what is meant by an action theory perspective on the study of human development, and (2) report a series of developmental studies focusing on social cognition. In particular, it is pointed out that theories, methodologies, and empirical strategies realize an action theory perspective if human beings are assumed to be potentially reflective and to act intentionally with reference to the environment. An action theory perspective on psychological development regards development itself as actively initiated through intentional, goal-directed actions and interactions of the developing subjects themselves. Methods consistent with the perspective include a combination of systematic observations and self-confrontation interviews. Specific  studies reported were undertaken in three interaction contexts to evaluate the role of thinking about action. Contexts involved action accompanying social cognition in children's traffic behavior, in referential communication between parent and child, and in trainer/trainee interaction between adults and adolescents. Concluding remarks focus on potential contributions of the redefinition of social cognition as thinking about action. (RH)",

        "description":"Highlights of the historical development of structured and creative/free dance experiences for children within the curriculum of early childhood education in the 20th century are sketched. Although some educators dissented with the practice, in the 1920s most dance activities for young children were structured. The following decade was characterized by a gradual shift toward freedom of movement and a recognition of individual rhythms. In the 1940s, during World War II, there was a hiatus in developing new creative movement programs. The 1950s brought an emphasis on freedom of movement that extended to the nursery school level. Exchange of ideas between early childhood educators and dance educators began to increase during the 1960s. In the 1960s and early 1970s, dance experiences  were characterized by freedom combined with a small amount of structure. Presently, early childhood and physical educators agree with the idea that movement (1) plays an integrated part in the curriculum for the young child; and (2) should be construed as a way of knowing, finding out, testing, and expressing oneself that is reciprocally and causally linked with feelings.

One question focused on how important it was for their children to become either very masculine or very feminine. It was predicted that the less parents stressed the importance of gender appropriateness, the less they would view their children in a traditional sex-stereotyped fashion. This prediction held true only for fathers of girls. Mothers of girls actually showed a trend toward the opposite tendency, while mothers and fathers of boys revealed no distinct overall patterns. For fathers but not for mothers, ratings of the importance of their children's developing gender appropriateness, independence, and high achievement were significantly positively correlated.  More research developing and refining the concept of parental cognitive commitment to the sex of the child was recommended. (Author/RH)",

Two studies were conducted. The first study employed a cluster-analytic approach to a pool of 136 noncognitive behavior-marking items that had been sorted and grouped into homogeneous sets by 16 psychologists and educators. In the second study, a total of 59 elementary school teachers rated a 32-item subset of the larger marking item pool on three scales. Specifically assessed were the degree to which items reflected (1) classroom or task-oriented adaptiveness, (2) interpersonal relationships and skills, and (3) personal adjustment and psychological self-concept. Cluster-analytic and  analysis of variance results suggested a general dichotomy in the classification of items: quality of task orientation versus quality of interpersonal relational skills. Disagreement was found between the participants of the two studies in their classification of items dealing with students' self-regulatory behavior and acceptance or practice of normative patterns of socialized conduct.

Factors under consideration included family background, existing informal supports, attitudes toward mental health professionals, and perceptions of the specific postplacement service. The service under investigation was an adoption bonding program, a variant of family therapy designed to help the family adopting an older child readjust as a new system and build new relationships. Each adopting family was administered an interview schedule and questionnaires were developed specifically for the study. Each question investigated one of three dimensions: (1) availability and use of supports, (2)  perceptions about childrearing and mental health, and (3) perceptions about the bonding program. Several factors were found to be related to participation in the service program, including ethnicity, marital status, availability of supports, and impressions of the program assessed. It was concluded that findings suggest the importance of considering such factors in the design and implementation of postadoptive placement supports. (RH)",

Assessments at each age were designed to indicate how the child was resolving salient developmental issues. To determine adaptation at 12 and 18 months, the quality of mother/child attachment was assessed. At 24 months, the children were videotaped with their mothers while performing tool-using/problem-solving tasks of increasing difficulty. At 42 months, children were observed with their mothers in four learning tasks requiring mothers to use teaching strategies. Finally, preschool children were rated on  several dimensions, including agency, ego control, dependency on teachers for support and nurturance, social skills in the peer group, positive affect, negative emotional tone, and compliance with teachers' directions and suggestions. In addition, teachers were asked to complete the Preschool Behavior Questionnaire and a problem behavior scale. Children securely attached at 12 and 18 months were judged to deal more effectively with important developmental issues at later stages than were anxious-resistant and anxious-avoidant children. Results were also interpreted to provide some evidence for continuity of adaptation in high-risk children. (RH)",

A questionnaire about these assumptions and about planning programs based on them was sent to 55 black scholars of whom  35 (63 per cent of the sample) responded. There was generally high agreement among the scholars, specifically concerning the importance of cultural heritage, family, and community, and the development of unique black strengths. Items generating low agreement concerned the importance of monthly workshops, familial styles and structures, employment of teachers from the community, and acceptance of black children's language in school. Staff members of eight black participant programs were also interviewed; their responses revealed that most programs made no effort to consider black sociocultural background as a necessary part of educational needs.

ISP implementation is covered in workshop material focusing on analyzing tasks, writing activity charts, and planning the classroom environment and schedule. The final workshop focuses on &quot;transitioning&quot; (i.e., helping handicapped children make the transition into the public school system). Six appendices provide references, excerpts from related books, guides to screening and assessment activities, and directions for developing ISP packets and videotapes.

Eastern Oregon State College has risen to the challenge of delivering services in a variety of ways. To improve instruction in reading/study skills, rural teachers and administrators should: develop a resource network; be aware of professional organizations; take advantage of small classes; be aware of their role in  the reading/language arts scope and sequence; consider peer tutoring or cross-grade activities; obtain a wider skill range of materials; discuss the district's reading/language arts program; create inservice time; seek workshops as a group; target reading/study skills as an inservice focus; develop a parent-volunteer program; create communication between itinerant specialists and teachers; subscribe to professional journals; use regional college libraries; adapt instruction for gifted students; explore research in learning and teaching styles; share successful activities; look at the value of microcomputers; read current literature on reading instruction; and get additional training in reading.

        "description":"Intended for people working in drug abuse prevention or trying to help American Indian youth feel pride in themselves and their culture, the booklet provides specific guidelines on how to use tribal stories in preventing drug abuse. Following a brief introduction to drug abuse problems and prevention strategies, the booklet explains three kinds of American Indian stories: the \"How It Came to Be\" stories, which explain almost everything; the Hero stories, which tell how young people overcome great obstacles to achieve their goals; and the Trickster stories, which are humorous reminders not to take life too seriously. According to the guide, the stories are good drug prevention tools because they touch the heart, spirit, and mind; give examples of how to deal with problems; help  develop self-awareness and self-esteem; and can be the basis of many activities. The booklet includes specific guidelines for telling, dramatizing, collecting, and illustrating the stories. It includes four sample stories to use in drug abuse prevention: the Cherokee story \"How the Raccoon Got Rings on His Tail,\" the Nez Perce story \"Coyote Breaks the Fish Dam at Celilo,\" the Blackfeet story \"Scarface,\" and the Micmac story \"The Invisible Hunter.\" (SB)",

        "description":"Analysis of recent literature on experiential education provides material for a model for learning experiences in experiential education. The model is constructed from six interconnected and overlapping parts, ranging from the profoundly foundational to the more specifically tactical. First, the learning experience attends to the human condition. Second, the learning experience transcends the boundaries of academic or other disciplines. Third, learning experiences are rich in group interaction while simultaneously promoting autonomy and independence of individuals. Fourth, the learning experience is risk-laden. Fifth, the experience involves a 3-part learning sequence: readiness, action/performance, and reflection. The final characteristic of a learning experience is the high  degree of concreteness or reality of the action phase. A university English course called \"Self-Reliance in a Technological Society\" provides a check on the model. In the course, students read and discussed a variety of literature on self-reliance, while simultaneously buying, renovating, and selling a small house; all six critical ingredients of the model were present in the course.

Also, 37 universities and colleges across the country agreed to field test 10 preservice curriculum modules developed by the National Rural Project and to modify them to suit their needs, with the modifications recorded via cassette tape logs. The modules are based on competencies designed for infusion into ongoing  special education programs, and include personal development skills and effective survival strategies, alternative instructional arrangements and delivery systems for low-incidence handicapped students, involving citizens and agencies of rural communities in cooperative programming for handicapped students, working with parents of handicapped students, working with peer professionals in rural environments, creative resource identification, and a rural preservice simulation. Personnel specifically trained to work with rural handicapped populations will have greater personal as well as professional success.

Relationships between leadership skills, resources, and community and school system infrastructures must be taken into account when solving such problems. Marrs' Law of Non-Absolutes is contained in two axioms which must be considered: (1) Everything in life is on a continuum, and (2) There is no such thing as a pure model. The leadership skills dimension includes 10 components, each possessed to some degree by most special  educators: interpersonal skills, negotiation skills, creativeness, logical abilities, self confidence, assertiveness, proactive planning, organization development, communication, and self-renewing abilities. Consideration of community and school system infrastructures requires understanding of formal and informal organizational structures, communication networks, raison d'etre, service/social/professional organizations, and movers and shakers. The resources dimension includes not only four traditional resources (budgets, personnel, time, space), but also requires attention to external funding, collaboration, community involvement, flexibility, recruitment/retention strategies, and technology. Successful rural special educators integrate these factors to serve the best interest of the  handicapped. (MH)",

Traditional service delivery models are inadequate in rural areas where many levels of the traditional service continuum and adequate staff and funding do not exist. Because of the diversity of rural communities, no one service delivery model can satisfy all situations. Instead, planners must design service delivery models specifically for the system and subculture in which they will be implemented. When designing service delivery systems for rural handicapped students, planners must consider 15 community and district factors, their interrelationships, and their combinations. The  factors include population, climate, geography, economic lifestyle, student ages, disabilities, cost efficiency, personnel attitudes, resources, distance to services, language spoken, cultural diversity, district-resource relationship, local communication and power structures, and district special education history. Planners must also consider 10 district variables including equipment, facilities, finances, staff development system, transportation, staffing, parent involvement and training, community involvement, governance system, and interagency collaboration. The article summarizes 10 successful service delivery models for serving rural children with low-incidence handicaps. (SB)",

The CILSDS, staffed by citizen volunteers and professionals, are currently located in 20 communities and are linked by a network of individual volunteers, existing service and social clubs, libraries, churches, country stores, volunteer fire departments, and numerous other agencies and organizations that wish to help their disabled neighbors lead relatively independent lives. Project staff spend time in each community identifying residents who have disabilities and  determining their independent living needs, as well as assessing community volunteer resources. Creating CILSDS is a natural extension of dynamic and community-responsive public school special education programs. Involving trained volunteers in the provision of services to people who have disabilities can reflect positively on schools and human service agencies. The CILSDS can become focal points for total community interdependence across a wide band of services.

However, little information about rural special education is available prior to the late 1970's, partially because federal agencies lacked a working definition of &quot;rural.&quot; Although rural and urban special education service environments vary greatly (especially in personnel turnover, transportation, community structure, geography, students served, communication, teacher qualifications, and resource availability), urban service delivery models historically have been recommended and unsuccessfully applied to rural schools. A study of special education services in 75 rural districts and cooperatives in 17 states shows significant improvements in the programs  and services offered and in the types, ages, and numbers of students served after implementation of PL94-142. However, major service delivery problems remain in the areas of funding, staffing, teacher certification, and preservice education. In addition to reducing resistance to change, special education collaboratives can help solve rural service delivery problems by offering cost savings through shared staff, programs, and resources. However, collaboratives must be carefully operated; successful strategies will involve decentralized services, staff roles that emphasize networking, and clearly established goals and responsibilities. The report concludes with 13 recommendations for rural special education policy. (SB)",

However, implementing technologies in rural environments involves problems because of the state of the art of advanced technology (lagging software development, equipment incompatibilities, computer system constraints), fiscal inadequacies, staff development needs, and adverse  rural attitudes. Rural school systems seeking to initiate the use of new technologies should seek external financial aid, consider local rural culture and norms, create community understanding and support, involve teachers in planning processes, build staff skills to implement technologies in unique rural special education situations, and design ways to ensure student participation. Eleven successful models of using technology to solve rural service delivery problems include obtaining information about service delivery and prescriptive programming and services; organizing and providing instructional programming information; parent training; community involvement; curriculum development; saving staff costs; improving communication between service providers and administrators; and serving  homebound gifted, remotely located students in their own communities.

Principal implications for policy and future research are also stated: school decision makers must consider school system structure to  determine the most effective means of meeting short- and long-run educational objectives when allocating funds, and research is needed to help school administrators minimize costs when faced with excess capacity and reduced enrollments. Also recommended are expenditure analysis to identify local factors that community leaders can modify to deliver education at least cost, research on relationships between local economic growth and local education, and consideration of local, private, social, and spillover benefits of education when determining total returns to education.

EOPS programs were established by the California Legislature in 1968 to recruit high-risk minority and low-income students and provide them with financial assistance, peer and professional counseling, tutoring, and other services to help them succeed at community colleges and perhaps transfer to 4-year colleges or universities. In 1976, 70% of EOPS students cmae from minority backgrounds; 33% were Hispanic and 30% Black. The EOPS study resulted in identification of five key variables: program leadership/philosophy, organizational structure, college environment, faculty  input, and community influence. The majority of EOPS directors have at least postgraduate work or master's degrees; Hispanics represent the largest group of EOPS directors, followed by Blacks and Whites. EOPS organizational structures demonstrate either self-determination (separate entities with their own financial aid and academic and personnel support services) or integration (EOPS students integrated with the regular student population). Research indicates that supportive college environments enhance academic performance of minority students. Faculty on some campuses is more actively involved than on others. EOPS advisory committees, composed of students, faculty, administrators, and community people, vary in their degree of activity. (MH)",

        "description":"The volume on University of Saskatchewan graduate theses related to Canadian native peoples (Indian, Inuit, Metis) contains a brief introduction, followed by abstracts of 62 thesis projects (1912-1982), and a final section of statistics, charts, summaries, and discussions related to the abstracted research. Each research abstract consists of three sections: description of the study, research procedures, and findings. The majority of the theses described were written in the 1970s; 31 were in education fields, 10 in archaeology/anthropology, 5 each in history and psychology, 4 in geography, 2 each in sociology and law, and 1 each in economics/political science, English, and social and preventive medicine. Of the theses dealing with specific peoples, eight were on the Cree, two each  on the Chipewyan, Inuit, Iroquois, Dogrib, and registered/treaty Indian people, and one each on urban, Slavey, Dakota, Ojibway, Dene, Saulteaux, Metis, and Blackfoot people. The majority of the studies (78%) are descriptive, with 17% historical and 5% experimental. Subjects range from descriptions of prehistoric sites, through community perceptions of important tasks for rural reservation schools, content analyses of depictions of Indian people in elementary textbooks and western comic books, and cross-cultural studies of testing and language perception.

The project revealed three goals for Native American studies programs in the 1980's: (1)  research must become a primary concern for students in Native American programs; (2) communication must be a more vital part of the education of students in Native American programs; and (3) Native American studies programs should assume the role of mediator and translator of academic research for their broader ethnic community. To accomplish these goals, Native American studies programs must overcome a growing anti-intellectual and anti-research orientation in the Native American community. The report urges a collaboration between academia and ethnic studies. (SB)",

Of 30 children originally chosen to represent lower, middle, and upper development levels, 6 became the focus of in-depth study. Researchers collected data from observation; videotapes; interviews with parents, children, and teachers; and debriefing notes. They also studied 300 English language texts (over 17,000 words) produced by the children in regular classroom settings to determine the status and development of the orthographic features (spelling, punctuation), syntactic features (clauses, phrases, terminable units),  and semantic and pragmatic issues including textual cohesion, contractions, dialect, metalinguistic knowledge, and overt behaviors accompanying writing (such as revision, subvocalization, rereading, interruptions, resource use, stop and think). The report describes the findings and the educational environments in the children's classrooms. It includes detailed analyses of the development of the writing process of each of the six children studied in depth. The analyses include information regarding the children's background, samples of the children's work, excerpts from the interviews, and descriptions of the various aspects of the writing process.

At that time, three teachers took a course offered by the University of Alaska via computer and audio-conference on the subject of using computers as communications tools. The teachers altered the increasing reliance of the schools on audio-conferencing for administrative and instructional uses. They began to use computers to communicate with supervisors in other locations, to teach math drills and practices, to teach science, and to improve research projects. However, the most interesting use of the computer was as a communications tool for instructional and  administrative purposes. Using the computer and one of many electronic networks, students exchanged information with students in California; teachers exchanged information with other teachers and with supervisors; administrators sent notes regarding travel schedules, book orders, test scores, and evaluation procedures; and university instructors presented information about the academic consequences of computers. Wainwright teachers expected to expand computer use for the language arts program and social studies. Special education, staff training, and software use were key issues in the move to computer communications. (SB)",

Supported both by oldtimers and by newcomers, the board acquired new administrators, purged the faculty, and acquired $15,000 for three Apple computers which were the basis of the computer program. The district hired a zealous computer instructor who, over the next six years, organized a computer room at the joint site of the elementary, middle, and high schools, and expanded it to include 20 Apple microcomputers and a wide variety of software. Always full of students, the casually-run computer room became the site of much learning for elementary, secondary,  and special education students of all abilities. The computer instructor developed and taught an introductory computer course for the faculty and established an elaborate K-12 computer curriculum. Beginning in kindergarten with games and minimal word processing, the curriculum advanced students to subject area software, LOGO, and word processing during the elementary school years, started them programming LOGO in grade 8, and continued teaching them BASIC and PASCAL programming and independent studies in high school.

The county was characterized by its very enthusiastic administrators and by their willingness to experiment and make mistakes. It successfully focused its initial efforts on using computers to improve administration and special education. An evaluation visit to four of the districts revealed that most districts used computers for administrative purposes but that computer instruction was growing. Elementary schools offered some programming and many high schools offered computer literacy, word  processing, and programming courses. One alternative high school offered an extensive program of creative computing including music and graphics generation. Despite tight economic conditions, the county managed to find funding for computers from state and federal sources, grants, and discretionary funds. The county spent about $1,000,000 for hardware and software from 1980-1983 and decided to budget $175,000/year to maintain the equipment. The effect of geographical isolation on the desire for information was seen as significant to the county's successful move to computer use. (SB)",

        "description":"The Crosby Independent School District near Houston, Texas, planned to introduce microcomputer instruction to its nearly 3,000 students in slow stages that had teachers and students learning at the same time. The initial impetus for computers came from an administrator who found useful information at a Regional Service Center of the State Education Department. The Center, known for its emphasis on technology, offers training, purchase assistance, software information and exchanges, library materials, trade shows, time-sharing, and workshops to help introduce computers to area schools. Using federal and grant funding, the district purchased 12 Radio Shack microcomputers. The vendor assisted in staff training and software choice. By the spring of 1983, seven microcomputers were  used in the high school to teach computers as a tool. Courses in computer literacy and basic programming were available. Student interest was high but teacher interest was low. In the elementary school, five microcomputers were used to augment remedial math with practice drills and to augment the gifted and talented program with BASIC programming. The district planned to add 20 microcomputers during 1983-1984. Crosby's plan to purchase hardware and introduce it slowly had both advantages and disadvantages. The most important variables in shaping the plan were district size, finances, and location. (SB)",

Although specific objectives are given for each activity, the unit has two general objectives: (1) to help students develop improved knowledge about marine fish, and (2) to develop increased awareness of the beauty and complex interrelatedness of marine fish. Students learn about these complex interrelationships by studying fish shapes, classes of fish, sharks, bony fish, fish feeding, commercial  fishing, recreational fishing, deep sea fishing, fish aging, and growth. The bulk of the unit consists of student materials and activities including arts and crafts, creative writing, fish in literature, a lesson on cleaning and preparing fish, visual aids, games, fish observation, dissection instructions and diagrams, identification keys, tables, and checklists. Teacher resources include recipes, organizational resources, a directory of fish packers, and an annotated bibliography of books and films. (LH)",

In addition, current and projected supply of and demand for scientists in the biomedical and behavioral fields is assessed. These fields include the clinical sciences, basic biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, health services research, and nursing research. Research and training funding, involvement of Ph.D. scientists in clinical investigations, expansion of the postdoctoral population in basic medical sciences, and career outcomes of former National Institutes of Health predoctoral trainees and fellows are among the other areas assessed. In addition to specific  recommendations related to each field, three general recommendations are presented: (1) the primary emphasis of National Research Service Awards programs should continue to be on postdoctoral rather than predoctoral training in most fields; (2) training grants should continue to be the dominant mechanism of support (the institutional component of such grants providing badly needed support to department programs); and (3) clinical investigators are still in short supply and efforts to attract them to research careers should continue. Supporting documentation and detailed data used in analysis leading to recommendations are included in appendices. (JM)",

Each category was then related to one of three major intervention objectives and an associated group. These categories, grouped by objectives are: (1) interventions increasing amount of time students are engaged in learning science (increasing student requirements); (2) interventions increasing quality of instruction (preservice education; enhancing teaching as a career; improving instructional practice; inservice education; improvement of materials, facilities, and equipment; and assistance from business and industry); (3) interventions to increase the &quot;match&quot; between actual classroom objectives with objectives most appropriate in today's world; and (4) facilitating interventions  (improving local leadership, testing programs, and public education). Analyses were conducted to determine the cost of implementing each intervention and to determine a rating of its effectiveness based on research data and other available information. The major conclusion reported is that solutions to problems in science education must be sought in the form of combinations of interventions with full regard for the interactions among these interventions. (Also included are modifications of analyses as they pertain to mathematics education and a delphi study on interventions for improving science and mathematics education in Colorado.) (JN)",

These phases parallel Piaget's functioning model of assimilation, disequilibrium and accomodation, and organization respectively. The learning cycle perceives students as actors rather than reactors to the environment. Inherent in that perception are three assumptions, that: (1) each of the three phases is necessary; (2) the sequence of phases must be exploration, conceptual invention, and expansion of the idea; and (3) the form of the exploration is student investigation with materials. Seven experiments were conducted to ascertain the impact of each assumption on students' achievement of conceptual understanding of and attitudes toward selected concepts. Concepts and  principal variables (assumptions) tested were: physical and chemical change (sequence); conservation of weight and atoms (necessity); simple chemical reactions (form-lesson control); redox reactions (necessity); reaction rates (form-data presentation); heat laws (sequence); and Arrhenius acids and bases (form-lesson control). Among the conclusions drawn are those indicating that the sequence of an activity appears to be important, the laboratory as an instructional format for the learning cycle is effective and highly thought of by students, and that teachers utilizing reading with learning cycles shouldn't expect them to be effective.

Among the programs reviewed are those sponsored by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Department of Energy (DOE), and the National Science Foundation. Also reviewed is the government response to the Arab-imposed oil embargo, formation of the Federal Energy Office (FEA), absorption of the FEA and AEC into the Energy Research and Development Administration, and the eventual  establishment of the Department of Energy. In addition, government-sponsored efforts at articulating a coherent set of ideas related to energy education are reviewed. These efforts are reflected in such reports as &quot;Fundamentals of Environmental Education,&quot;&quot;Energy Education Workshop Handbook,&quot; and &quot;A Conceptual Framework for Energy Education, K-12.&quot; The latter is a detailed outline for curriculum specialists, textbook writers, and producers of other forms of energy curriculum materials.

        "description":"Through a Chicago Public School Program fifth-grade students from different cultures and backgrounds were brought together to experience and learn about a forest environment. These urban students (N=269) completed a brief questionnaire about their previous experiences, perceptions, and expectations regarding forest resources. Findings indicate that most children had been to an urban or rural forest and had enjoyed and learned from the experiences (which usually involved walking or hiking), that most students who had not visited a forest probably would enjoy such an experience, and that previous forest/woodland experiences of these students differed by sex and ethnic background. Although most students felt safe in the forest and in their own neighborhood, blacks reported a larger  number of dangers in each environment. These and other findings have implications for urban education programs that focus on forests and related resources. When developing such programs it is not enough to study only the children's reaction to the forest. The home environment must also be considered in order to relate the educational program to concepts the children can understand and to comprehend the children's reaction to the material being presented.

The underlying theme in most studies was the interplay of language in various problem-solving tasks. Studies examined: (1) predictors of academic achievement (as measured by grade point average); (2) ability of students to translate word problems into appropriate mathematical equations, with an emphasis on identifying errors caused by misinterpretations of the problem statement as opposed to errors caused by mathematical deficiencies; (3) extent to which students' academic, motivational, and socioeconomic characteristics mediated their performance in various cognitive measures; and (4) the ability of students to solve  logical reasoning problems containing multiple negations. Findings indicate that Hispanic students are underprepared in comparison to Anglo students. Areas in which Hispanics displayed underpreparation are algebraic skills, language skills, and problem-solving skills requiring substantial amounts of linguistic processing. Differences in socioeconomic status between Hispanics and Anglos were also found. In addition, findings indicate that various errors committed by the Hispanics in solving mathematics and logics problems are the result of semantic difficulties and not necessarily the result of difficulties in the content area.

Also presented is an introductory chapter which outlines overarching themes that become apparent when the eight fields are considered as a whole. These themes include changing perspectives on health care,  faster pace of technological innovation, importance to scientific and engineering progress of the effective use of new communications technologies, emergence of research-based technologies, need to examine federal policies regarding research and development considered as a whole, and the quickening dissolution of the traditional boundaries between the fields of science and between science and technology. In addition, this chapter discusses the relation of work in the eight areas to the congressional aim of drawing more fully the relation of science and technology to the large and kaleidoscopic agenda with which the nation must deal.

        "description":"To provide information to the Congress in its continuing debates over improving science and mathematics (S/M) education as well as to education policymakers, the General Accounting Office (GAO) synthesized past evaluation and research studies and used other methodologies to examine four issues: (1) the nature of the problem and its remedies; (2) prospects for upgrading existing S/M teachers; (3) prospects for reducing the S/M teacher shortage by retraining teachers from other subject areas; and (4) the current ability to evaluate the quantity and quality of S/M teaching. Observations on the implications of this work for S/M education legislation are included. GAO does not find evidence that training programs to upgrade existing S/M teachers will improve teaching effectiveness.  Such programs are a prominent part of proposed federal legislation. Teacher shortage problems, which are also addressed in the proposed legislation, may be easier to solve. Programs to retrain teachers of other subjects to teach science and mathematics classes seem to be one viable solution to technical teacher shortages. In addition, gaps in information available to policymakers are so severe that GAO could not determine if there are net nationwide shortages of S/M teachers and if the quality of technical teaching has declined in recent years.

Forty first-grade children were individually administered tests of conservation of length and number, transitivity of length, information processing capacity, and basic length measurement concepts. The Piagetian measures of logical reasoning were positively correlated with information processing capacity, but the measures of information processing capacity failed to account for much of the variability of performance on the logical reasoning tasks. Some children at the highest levels of processing capacity failed the  logical reasoning tasks and some at the lowest level passed them, suggesting that the logical reasoning tasks are not simply measures of information processing capacity. Furthermore, information processing measures accounted for 25% of the variance in performance on the linear measurement tasks, and length conservation accounted for an additional 23%. Although these two measures accounted for almost half of the variance, it is not clear that they represent prerequisites for learning basic length measurement concepts. Some children at low levels on both measures successfully completed the measurement tasks. (Author/MNS)",

        "description":"The research described in this paper leads to an instructional design approach which is an alternative to the consideration of such issues as mathematical skills or level of cognitive development. The approach uses an analysis of traditional instructional tasks to specify the underlying cognitive processes and structures necessary for the successful completion of the tasks; that is, a cognitive analysis of instructional tasks, rather than a logical analysis, is used to arrive at appropriate instructional goals. The approach involves taking a standard form of a question and converting it to a qualitative problem. Appropriate levels of existing relevant knowledge and experience are then determined, and a series of questions and specific, single-observation laboratory exercises are  used to gradually develop a schema for the problem solution. The interaction implicit in the strategy allows for the retention of appropriate aspects of existing schemata and the modification of conflicting aspects. Two broad aspects of differences between physics experts and novice physics students relevant to physics problem solving are considered in the approach. These aspects come from recent cognitive psychology research into processes and structures used by experts and novices in physics problem solving and from science education research into student world views.

Among the findings reported are those indicating that: misunderstanding of science is widespread and public understanding of chemistry is poor; too few high school chemistry teachers are well grounded in the subject; laboratory exercises are slowly disappearing from general chemistry in high school and college; and that applications of both information technology and discoveries about learning are occurring haphazardly. Conclusions drawn from those and other findings take the form of 40 principal recommendations and numerous ancillary ones. Recommendations  focus on the concern for the nationwide low level of public understanding of science and on problems and issues related to education at all levels, as well as to the following: science education in elementary schools, high schools, two-year colleges, colleges and universities; careers; continuing education; and role of the chemical industry. Recommendations include a minimum of three years of high school laboratory science for admission to college, a national effort to add science to the present basic triad of school subjects, and development of a model science program for each elementary school grade level.

Among the findings reported are these: although software development is expensive and risky, software production is high; while a large amount of software is available, more high quality and classroom usable software is needed; both normative and descriptive software evaluations are greatly needed; many channels for software dissemination are inadequate to keep teachers  fully informed about available software; schools allocate inadequate resources for software acquisition; microcomputer software can increase the range of science and mathematics topics successfully covered; and appropriate software can improve student performance in current courses. Broad improvements in teacher knowledge about the technology and the topics it facilitates, software dissemination, and classroom implementation are recommended to meet identified needs. These recommendations include developing software that teaches problem-solving skills, empowers students, and addresses process objectives. (JN)",

The first chapter focuses on the representation of women and minorities in S/E employment and differences in employment characteristics between sex and racial groups independent of the overall employment levels. The second chapter considers measures that indicate underutilization of those with scientific and engineering skills, with particular attention to differences between the sexes or among racial/ethnic groups. The third chapter examines the acquisition of scientific and engineering skills,  highlighting differences in academic coursework, performance on achievement tests, and undergraduate and graduate degree production. Data within each chapter are presented first for women and then for racial minorities and Hispanics. The physically handicapped in science and engineering are also considered in the first chapter. Among the findings reported are those indicating that despite substantial gains over the past decade, women and minorities are still underrepresented in S/E employment and training, and that their rates of participation in precollege science and mathematics courses and in undergraduate and graduate S/E education are lower than those of men.

Thirty-four high school students served as tutors for 34 sixth-grade students. During an 18-week pre-tutoring period, the high school students were trained to be tutors using microcomputers. During the 18-week tutoring period, the high school students tutored the sixth-grade students. Pre- and post-treatment data were collected on the mathematics achievement and attitudes of both groups, as well as data on  attendance and enrollment. The methodology used is described, and the results, conclusions and recommendations are presented. The combinational strategy had no noticeable effect on the achievement of the sixth-grade students. Their attitudes toward mathematics, computers, and science and technology were positive, but not influenced by the tutoring; the high school students' attitudes toward computers became significantly more positive.

HMSA's are defined by federal legislation to include urban and rural geographic areas, population groups, and facilities with shortages of health manpower. The report is organized into three major parts. Part 1 provides essential background information on HMSA criteria and designation process. Part 2 presents results of the detailed technical analysis undertaken. Part 3 presents major conclusions and provides a series of  recommendations, both for specific improvements in the HMSA criteria and for further research. The most important conclusion emerging from the findings is that the HMSA criteria performed best of the various alternatives in terms of measuring the basic shortage concept they were designed to measure--the density of physicians in an area.

The next five articles discuss the basics: the role of computation in the curriculum, the basic nature of measurement, the increasing importance of estimation, experiences with finding and using data, and the scope of problem solving in the curriculum. Section 3, on the tools of technology, contains suggestions for using calculators and a discussion of the increasing importance of computers  in school mathematics.

By completing activities in the units, students learn about study skills needed for mathematics and practice those skills in a mathematics environment. The program addresses a wide range of student needs, providing an introduction to specific skills for students who have little sense of a particular study skill, providing a learning experience of initial mastery for students who are ready to acquire a skill, and offering review and reinforcement for students who have mastered a given skill. Topic areas of the units  include: listening as a mathematical skill, problem solving, understanding the language of mathematics, learning from homework, using formulas, estimation, preparing for a test, and taking a mathematics test. This guide contains strategies for teaching these units, suggestions for further instruction in each study skill area, and an overview of study skills. It is strongly recommended that the units be taught within the context of an ongoing mathematics course rather than in separate settings. (JN)",

        "description":"This paper attempts to reformulate some assumptions of contemporary social science so that its knowledge becomes directly applicable in social action. A schema is presented for the interpretation of social experience in which sociological, anthropological, and psychological knowledge and knowledge of the physical and biological world enter into a concrete, aesthetically patterned, social totality incorporating the moral ordering and emotional commitment necessary for action. The philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead is used to present the dilemma of seeking the concrete from the abstract, that is, of interpreting social knowledge and social action. Tactics developed by social scientists for meeting this difficulty are sketched and the question of why the transformation of thought  into practice necessitates a philosophical revolution is considered. In the course of answering that question, a more detailed statement of the basic terms of Whitehead's conception of events is provided. Finally, a discussion of changes required by social science methodology is presented. Discussion closes with a consideration of the aesthetic principles in the order of nature and society.

Recent developments in cognitive and social psychology and in microsociology have shown that ethnic prejudices or attitudes are both cognitive and social results of social information processing in intergroup relations. Ethnic prejudice, formulated in terms of attitude schemata about minority groups, can be categorically organized in terms of their major social functions: dominance, differentiation, distance, depersonalization, diffusion, diversion, and the various forms of daily discrimination. Ethnic groups are represented according to prototypical characteristics, e.g., origin, appearance,  socio-economic position. There are many strategies which can be used to manipulate these cognitions, including irrelevant participant categorization, use of negative prototypical properties of minorities, favoritism in ambiguous situations of ingroup members, and negative information spreading. How everyday talk exemplifies many of these cognitive and social strategies of prejudice is shown. (RM)",

        "description":"The narrative conventions of romance which flourish in Lawrence Cremin's &quot;Transformation of the School&quot; show that stylization does occur in historical writings. People often talk about stylization in visual forms; but stylization in the verbal arts is relatively undefined. To structure his recounting of the progressive story, Cremin drew on the genre of romance. Aspects of the genre upon which the coherence of his book depend include: (1) the motif of amnesia; (2) the polarized moral universe in which the dramatic action takes place, along with the characteristically abrupt nature of the narrative movement within it; (3) the adventure quest at the center of the action; and (4) its ideal of heroism. The irony of the situation is that, for the last 20 years, we have all been  quoting Walt Whitman with a moralizing flourish: &quot;There is no more need for romance,&quot; we say with the poet from Camden, &quot;Let facts and history be properly told.&quot; Meanwhile, the narrative conventions of romance flourished unrecognized in &quot;The Transformation of the School,&quot; a book widely hailed as the premier example of the explanatory dividends which a revivified, academically respectable history of education had to offer.

Paul Riesman examines the relationship between the Fulani people of West Africa and their environment, paying particular attention to the people's cultural and environmental ties to their cattle. Gregory Finnegan and Christopher Delgado discuss the relationship between the Mossi farmers and the Fulbe herders in Upper Volta. The changing significance ethnicity has in the  various power relationships of the aristocracy of the Sokota is presented by Joyce Hendrixson. James Vaughan examines intersocietal relations of two groups, the Margi and the Fulani, from a historical perspective, focusing on the reasons for cultural barriers against the Fulani. Chantal Collard discusses the various neighbors of the Fulbe, and Emily Schultz is concerned with perceptions of ethnicity in Guider Town, Cameroon.

Section 3 discusses types of activities emerging and a proposal for a common project. Section 4 focuses on legitimation of the Consortium  by the OECD. It suggests that the Consortium is reaching a point where it will soon be regarded as legitimate in its own right.

Of late, the latter group has gained dominance. This paper, by presenting a rhetorical analysis of individualism in regard to rights, rejects the limiting of rights to distinct persons. Analysis is divided into five stages. A discussion of the phenomena of group rights precedes examination of the theoretical restrictions of rights of individuals. Various individualisms are distinguished and discredited. The author then highlights the relevance of \"group rights\" to current issues of ethics, politics, and law, outlining the potential contributions of this concept to current  projects in political theory. Finally, the notion that rights are political rather than philosophical is presented. (Author/LP)",

Studied were the rate of growth and change in the number of institutions and in their levels of output, employment, income, and expenses. Conclusions are presented regarding the overall arts picture, each of the five major artistic disciplines (symphony orchestras, opera, theater, dance, and museums), and data collection in the arts. Compared to preceding years, the decade of the 1970's showed the same range of growth for all the disciplines, except the young modern dance companies. All performing art forms, except opera, grew at a slower pace in the 1970's, especially symphony orchestras. The need for financial  management was recognized. Art organizations need to be systematically classified by some widely accepted taxonomy. Appendices conclude the report. The first appendix is a listing of criteria used by art organizations for membership or inclusion in a survey. The other appendices are discussions on: the imputation and correction of data, the calculation of growth rate, the economic behavior of arts organizations, and performing arts sponsors and presenters.

        "description":"To determine the status of humanities education in American public schools, the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) conducted a survey of State Education Agencies (SEAs) in 1982. Data gained through a questionnaire sent to each SEA concerned humanities policies in the areas of organizational structure, general educational goals, curriculum, testing, textbooks, graduation requirements, funding, and current educational developments. The following findings were indicated. While SEAs express strong support for humanities instruction, they pinpoint several problems in program implementation, chief among these being the need for a common definition of the field. Only 20 percent of the states possess a unit entitled \"humanities,\" and less than half include humanities in their  statements of educational goals. While 25 states have competency-based educational programs, only 8 of these include humanities. Less than 10 of the states having uniform graduation requirements demand any music, art, or foreign language coursework. The SEAs' assessments of the direction for furthering humanities instruction are summarized in six recommendations. Among these are the need for states to develop specific humanities education policies, establish a core of common learning to which the humanities are central, participate in national and regional meetings concerning humanities, and work with state humanities councils to develop elementary secondary education projects on the humanities. Appendices include the survey instrument. (LP)",

Although the citizens of each of the countries have their rights protected through their respective constitutions, there is some variation in the interpretation of the human rights concepts. It is generally through the area of elementary and secondary social studies that the countries are attempting to educate their citizens concerning peace and human rights. Although teaching methods are not reported on in detail, where reference is made it appears that a variety of strategies is being practiced. Some teacher education is being implemented. The areas that are least reported upon are  research and evaluation. Chapter 2 contains a summary of the discussions that followed each country's report; these discussions concerned how to improve social studies/civics/moral education. Suggestions for future action at the national and regional levels are discussed in the concluding chapter. Appendices include the agenda, the participant list, and the inaugural address. (RM)",

This review of both national and state survey data indicates problems in both teacher preparation and curriculum. Teacher weaknesses include lack of preparation in the content area, lack of use of appropriate teaching strategies, and reluctance to take additional coursework. Curriculum problems include the limits of time in teaching economics at the elementary level and absence of economics as a separate course offering at the secondary level. Teachers at all grade levels expressed the desire for easier access to economics  curriculum materials. In attempting to upgrade economics instruction, the next step for researchers should be an extensive national effort to obtain more reliable input and output data about economic education in the schools.

        "description":"Addressing professional and popular concern about identifying and adequately rewarding excellent teachers, the authors describe a proposal for selecting master/mentor teachers and utilizing them in demonstration schools. There are six specific elements that should make any master teacher proposal realistic and educationally and economically defensible: (1) initial planning; (2) indepth preparation and training; (3) documentation of skills as a basis for ultimate selection; (4) significant school district support; (5) major inservice focus; and (6) constant evaluation. A proposal which includes those characteristics is aimed at improving the quality of teaching as well as rewarding excellence in teaching beyond what currently exists. The Kentucky plan, like those in North Carolina  and Tennessee, includes a career ladder. However, it differs from other plans in that it also incorporates the notion of demonstration schools and classrooms, staffed by master teachers who take major responsibility for the inservice education of other teachers in the school district. In this description of the proposal, discussion centers on the major elements of the plan--demonstration schools; and a career ladder involving master/mentor, master teacher, and master teacher candidate roles; internships; criteria for selection; and continued evaluation. Included with the proposal are 45 criteria for master and master/mentor teacher selection; 2 figures depicting program progression; and a table of 14 roles and functions of master and master/mentor teachers.

Two types of pauses have been identified: the pause after teachers pose questions and students respond, and the pause that takes place when students hesitate momentarily in their replies. Typically, pauses between teacher and student remarks average approximately 1 second. Even though 3-second pauses in classroom interaction have been shown to be important, most efforts to train teachers to use wait-time effectively have met with little success. An electronic device, which provides automatic, continuous monitoring of pauses in classroom dialogue, consists of voice-activated switches, a variable timer, and  a system of red and green lights. A red light is activated when a person is speaking, while a green light signals whenever sustained silence occurs. Field testing has indicated that using the device helped teachers to prolong wait-time in questioning. A diagram of a &quot;wait time feedback&quot; device is included with the description. (JD)",

In an overview, the task force defines the role of teacher certification and chronicles briefly the historical evolution of teacher licensure and certification concepts. The second part of the report examines relevant research studies to document the empirical basis for the claim that fully certified teachers are more effective as teachers and more satisfied as professionals than those with substandard qualifications. The third part of the report identifies questionable practices which raise qualitative issues: (1)  assigning certified personnel to teach out-of-field; (2) issuing emergency certificates to unqualified persons; and (3) seeking alternative routes to certification which weaken or eliminate pedagogical competency. A comparative analysis is made of temporary procedures used by other professions. Eleven recommendations are suggested as alternatives to granting emergency teaching certificates to unqualified personnel. Appendices include: (1) summary of professional organizations' positions on emergency certification; (2) questionnaires sent to state directors of teacher certification and state AACTE presidents; and (3) the AACTE resolution on emergency certificates for teachers.

There will be an increased need for more learning for more people for more years of their lives. There will also be an increase in the number and types of organizations providing education and the development of a worldwide perspective on lifelong learning. Among the ways in which the role of colleges and universities is changing under the impact of the \"learning society\" are: (1) higher education no longer enjoys a monopoly on the provision of educational services; (2) the roles of educational providers are increasingly blurred, e.g., the distinctions between education and training and between credit and non-credit courses are difficult to maintain; (3) higher  education no longer has the full-time commitment of students or of faculty; (4) learning has become a lifelong necessity for almost everyone since there is a constant need for upgrading of skills and knowledge; and (5) a major revolution involving the creation, processing, and distribution of information is taking place in society. These changes will necessitate sharing and cooperation in education; will increase competition among providers of credentials; and will require acceptance of learning as a lifelong process.

        "description":"Developed for newly appointed or experienced college instructors, this monograph presents a process for specifying instructional objectives. After chapter 1 provides background on the process of writing learning objectives, chapter 2 defines the terms, \"goals,\"\"objectives,\"\"instruction,\" and \"learning.\" Chapter 3 provides the instructor with a programmed lesson in how to write objectives, while chapter 4 expands on the topic in narrative form, focusing on terminal, interim, and out-of-class objectives. Implications of the process of specifying objectives are examined in chapter 5, which addresses questions concerning who should write objectives, sharing of objectives, wording of objectives, specificity of objectives, detailing outcomes, frequency of revision, student abilities,  informing students, student expectations, additional uses of objectives, and grading. Chapter 6 discusses common criticisms of the process, focusing on the effort required, unanticipated outcomes, problems in establishing causal relationships between teaching and learning, and the desire to enhance the individuation process. Finally, 100 sample objectives, classified according to subject area and level of complexity, are presented. Appendices outline methods for determining student understanding of the objectives, reporting student achievement, sequencing objectives, and determining class criteria. A list of available course objectives and a 33-item annotated bibliography are also appended. (LAL)",

First, &quot;Strategic Management in the Community College,&quot; by Gunder A. Myran defines the concept and demonstrates the need for the approach in the two-year college. Next, James Gollattscheck examines &quot;Strategic Elements of External Relationships,&quot; asserting that positive relations with the community, region, and state are key in determining a college's future. &quot;The Strategy of Internal Communications and Working Relationships,&quot; by Dennis Bila, focuses on various administration-faculty structures and the  options available for a shared governance model. &quot;Strategic Planning,&quot; by Warren Groff, focuses on external assessment, internal audit, and goal setting as essential planning components. The interrelationships between institutional goals and financial resources are discussed in Albert Lorenzo's article, &quot;Strategic Elements of Financial Management.&quot; In &quot;The Critical Link: From Plans to Programs,&quot; George A. Baker and Kay M. Moore discuss strategic elements in program and service development. Next, Nancy Armes and Terry O'Banion examine &quot;The Role of the Chief Executive Officer in Strategic Staff Development.&quot; Finally, Jim Palmer provides an annotated bibliography of relevant ERIC documents.

Seven teachers from three departments and a team of researchers worked together to develop a plan that included activities to help teachers: (1) be better organized through, for example, distributing syllabi and course and topic outlines; discussing grade policy, course requirements, and learning resources; outlining attendance policies; and discussing course objectives of the first 3 weeks; (2) be student oriented by, for example, allaying anxiety and tension in the classroom, appearing relaxed, having students introduce themselves, and collecting student data  forms; (3) encourage student participation by stressing the importance of asking questions, discussing student involvement requirements, and assigning students to study groups; and (4) provide feedback and correctives for homework assignments and quizzes. Faculty reactions to the treatment, as determined through interviews and questionnaires, were generally positive. All of the teachers agreed on the importance of the overall plan and its positive effects on the students. They did note that more training was necessary in order to plan adequately for the first weeks and that it was difficult to implement all of the activities.

Early studies of mastery learning at the colleges comparing student grades in mastery learning classes to control classes in which these techniques were not used demonstrated a positive effect, with significantly more students earning credit grades in mastery classes than in comparable non-mastery classes. A recent study sought to determine whether differences in the amount of exposure to mastery learning methods could be related to performance. The colleges' computer-based student recordkeeping system provided information on students' grades and the instructional method used in their  courses. A comparison of the earned credit ratios (ECR's) of students taking no mastery learning classes, one mastery learning class, and two mastery learning classes revealed: (1) in eight of nine comparisons, mastery learning sections had higher ECR's than comparable non-mastery learning sections; (2) students who took no mastery learning classes had an overall ECR of 64%, while the ECR of those taking one mastery learning class was 59% and that of students taking two mastery learning classes was 66%; and (3) there were no significant differences in the average difficulty of the non-mastery learning classes taken by mastery learning students and other students.

The workshop structure provides an opportunity for parents of preschoolers to contribute to growth in conversation and to help in the development of literacy skills. Arranged into five sessions, session 1 instructs leaders on planning and setting the tone for the workshops. In sessions 2 and 3 parents share their reactions to the assignment, analyze their observations, and learn new ways of responding to children. Sample transcriptions are provided to illustrate what can happen when an adult consciously uses conversational responses to extend, clarify, and share in the child's point of view. Session 4 focuses on reading with  children. Parents are asked to complete an assignment in which they are given an opportunity to observe systematically and participate in the story making process. In the final section, parents analyze their stories with respect to: (1) reading a story, (2) identifying the story elements, (3) the child's mastery of the story, and (4) suggested strategies the parent might employ to encourage further development.

        "description":"Presented in this paper are a selective review and summary of recent research findings concerning the adult's role in infant development. After an introduction setting forth assumptions guiding the selection of issues and findings, the first section discusses research on parent/infant interaction. Some of the classic concepts of infant development, such as bonding and fear of strangers, are critically examined. Also discussed in the first section are the early relationship between parents and their infant, early forms of self-regulation, interaction at a distance, the beginnings of infant initiative, coping with an expanding awareness and new emotions, and the beginnings of self-assertion. The second section examines the role of nonfamilial caregivers, specifically in relation to  group care contexts and their impact on the infant and on the parent-infant relationship. Specific attention is given to the effects of day care on cognitive development and the role of other children in group care settings. The third section considers issues related to lasting effects of the infant's early experience with adults. Discussion focuses on infants at risk, effects of the physical environment, and the need for improved research. Finally, several conclusions based on the reviewed findings are offered. (RH)",

        "description":"The \"focus group discussion,\" a qualitative technique often used in market research, has been a useful tool in corporate exploration of employee child care needs and preferences and has led to the development of management policy regarding child care. The child care focus group has helped the employer learn more about employees' child care concerns and the extent and urgency of these concerns. In addition, these groups have assisted management in addressing parents' needs. The group process, which involves 8 to 10 employees in a 2-hour discussion of their experiences as consumers of child care, has been divided into three distinct phases: the preparation, the group discussion, and the subsequent report. The company and a facilitator usually decide upon child care topics to be  discussed in the session. Employee satisfaction and dissatisfaction and available and affordable care are considered.

This final report highlights work conducted during 1980-81 in seven member countries of the Asian Program of Educational Innovation for Development (APEID): India, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, the Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Chapter 1 of the report discusses reasons for, different aspects of, and the meaning of curriculum integration. Chapter 2 deals with different forms of integration, such as integration by broad fields of subject areas, by themes, by projects, and by emerging interests and concerns of children. Chapter 3 provides an account of approaches  to integrated curriculum development, including centralized, decentralized, and mixed approaches. Chapter 4 focuses on organizational structure, implementation processes, roles of teachers and other personnel, and strategies for curriculum implementation and for insuring continued interest in innovative projects. Chapter 5 discusses purposes of evaluation and aspects of formative and summative evaluation. Chapter 6 describes the support system necessary for curriculum integration, and chapter 7 briefly discusses research and development activities related to implementation of the integrated curriculum. The concluding chapter indicates participating countries' future plans and the implications of such plans for APEID. Appended are a chart depicting the status of each country's project and  a list of program participants. (RH)",

Children, distributed approximately equally by age and sex, responded to four photographed scenarios of conflicts in which a depicted child could respond with a facial expression that was discrepant from internal affect. This procedure previously had yielded significant age differences in reasoning about the dissociation of  affect and expressive behavior. In addition, children were asked about the justification for regulating expressive behavior, the interpersonal consequences of regulation, and the ways they balanced showing or not showing real feeling. The children's parents responded to the Parent Attitude toward Child Expressiveness Scale, to Snyder's Self-Monitoring Scale, and to Moos' Family Environment Scale. Data were analyzed by means of stepwise regression analyses for each of the three child variables. As expected, age was found to be signifiantly related to all of the three variables. Additional results indicated the effect of maternal and paternal attitudes on children's beliefs. (RH)",

The first approach, computer assisted instruction, includes drill and practice programs, tutorials or programmed instruction, and simulations or games. Computer awareness or literacy, the second approach, often emphasizes computer information rather than skill with computers. The third approach, computer usage, recognizes that computers are a tool and prepares the student to enter that world with skills and understanding. LOGO, a new computer language, is simple enough for preschool children and also encourages creativity and exploration of concepts. Five goals are specifically recommended for  early childhood personnel: (l) learn about computers for yourself by reading computer magazines; (2) learn about LOGO; (3) learn about computer software; (4) say &quot;yes&quot; to computers, but choose wisely; and (5) remember early childhood goals.

A total of 36 teachers who strongly emphasized parent involvement in home activities and 46 teachers who did not were surveyed about their attitudes toward, and techniques for, promoting involvement and about factors they perceived as influencing parent participation. Teachers in different school districts emphasized different types of parent involvement. Urban teachers used home learning techniques and conducted more workshops for parents at school. Suburban teachers frequently used parents as classroom volunteers. Rural teachers  conducted more home visits. Responding to questionnaires, most parents indicated they were never involved at school; a large percentage of parents did not receive basic, traditional communications from school to home, such as notes, conversations, phone calls, or conferences with teachers. Parents' experience with techniques teachers use to involve parents in learning activities with their children at home was found to vary from frequent interaction with specified learning activities to no involvement. Findings suggest that optimal programs for parents result from teachers' frequent involvement of parents in learning activities at home. (BJD)",

The two samples differed considerably in terms of education, age, race, and socioeconomic status. The first group, high school educated, averaged 24 years of age, and, if married, had spouses with blue-collar jobs. The second group, college graduates, averaged 34 years of age and had spouses who held professional/academic jobs. An open-ended interview consisted of l2 questions designed to elicit samples of parental reasoning. The mothers' answers revealed four common patterns of thinking: anchors, attributions, covariation or causal analysis, and anticipation. The most frequent mode of thinking involved attributional analysis (46 percent), or reflection on the origin of certain  behaviors. There was frequent use of anchors (22 percent), or comparisons made across children or across age. Covariations, similar to attributions but including articulation of antecedent-consequent relationships, accounted for 22 percent of statements. Anticipation, or statements made about the future, composed l0 percent of the categorized comments. Analyses of mothers' speech and the ease with which their reasoning was elicited suggested that parents commonly engage in such deliberations. Few differences emerged between the high school and college educated mothers. The only mean group differences indicated suggested that, while the high school educated mothers used more anchors and anticipatory references, the college educated mothers made more attributions.

The United States Chamber of Commerce has had an active educational committee involved in shaping federal education policy since the l960s. Local and state school systems, along with business leaders, parent-teacher associations, advisory boards, and school finance committees have also developed business/education partnerships. Three conditions have been identified that highlight the new challenges facing business and education leaders. First, there has been an increase in teen and adult illiteracy rates in the United States. Second, this country is facing severe shortages of skilled workers due to the shift from industrial to high technology jobs. Third, the United States is encountering  unprecedented international competition. In recent years, educational improvement &quot;success stories&quot; have included activities such as adopt-a-school systems, fellowships and internships for teachers, loaned equipment, and initiatives for support of new school financing. Some partnerships between business and education are (1) Tenneco Oil Company and the Houston, Texas, Independent School District; (2) Pinellas Suncoast Chamber of Commerce and the Pinellas, Florida, Public School System; (3) the State of Mississippi and the Mississippi Economic Development Council; and (4) the State of California and the California Business Roundtable.

Also examined was the role these play activities have in the development of literacy. Data were collected through focused nonparticipant observations of children's preschool activities, parent observations, and informal discussions. Results indicated that each girl engaged in playful literacy activities in both pretend and nonpretend contexts. When new information about literacy artifacts was presented, the girls gradually incorporated parts of that information into their play. This new information was eventually consolidated into larger  units of play behavior and then repeated several times. When play concerned familiar or known information, subjects voluntarily elaborated and extended that information into new contexts. Whether or not the girls incorporated new information or elaborated on known information seemed to be related to the saliency of the information and their current level of skill development. Preliminary data raised questions about the role of play in children's learning of literacy. (Author/BJD)",

A study explored such associations in a sample of 48 white middle class third and fourth graders (24 boys and 24 girls) and their mothers and fathers. Each child received a battery of five cognitive and achievement tasks. Teachers were asked to rate the children on their classroom behaviors, including learning effectiveness, memory, attentiveness, and cooperativeness. Both parents were interviewed, asked to keep diaries of time spent with their child, and requested to record their child's activities. Parents specifically indicated indirect, direct, or available  time with their children. Results indicated large interfamily variability but no differences in the time parents and children spent together with respect to the sex of the child. In addition, it was found that mothers' available time for contact with the child exceeded the available time of fathers. Finally, while a positive relationship was found to exist between the amount of time fathers spent supervising their children and teacher ratings of the children's cognitive abilities, the inverse was true for mothers' time. These and other results suggested the relationship between parents' time and children's development was not straightforward, nor was it the same for mothers and fathers in this sample. (Author/BJD)",

        "description":"A study investigated developments in reasoning and memory as reflected by the discovery strategies of children taking part in a manipulative categorization and recall task. A total of 40 children (8 each of 18, 24, 30, 36, and 42 months of age) participated. Stimulus materials consisting of blocks, toy plates, discs, and plastic trees were presented to subjects in two phases: a presentation and a test phase. The presentation phase involved play and discovery of items tagged with stickers depicting apples. The test phase involved a direct search for tagged items. Every move a child made to check an item for a sticker was transcribed and analyzed. Children from 18 to 42 months of age located tagged items in fewer moves in the test phase than they did in the presentation phase.  Older children, in contrast to younger, conducted class-consistent searches, a phenomenon suggesting the possibility of rule use. Compared with younger children, older children in the presentation phase engaged in more class-consistent searching of both tagged and untagged items; however, in the test phase older children did not handle entire groups of untagged items. This latter finding suggests that a new strategy for learning about and encoding the environment begins to appear at around 3 1/2 years of age. (RH)",

        "description":"The resource allocation practices of New York State school districts were examined to determine how certain structural features of school districts can either create high tax rates or reduce educational opportunities for students. Study results indicated that rural districts spend less on instruction than do otherwise similar districts; however, rural taxpayers spend as high or higher a percentage of their income on education as those in nonrural districts. Rural districts also offer lower starting salaries to their teachers, operate with higher teacher-pupil ratios, provide fewer incentives to their teachers to obtain additional training, and rely more heavily on paraprofessional teacher aides. The inability or unwillingness of small districts to participate in Board of  Cooperative Educational Services programs can have adverse implications for both students and taxpayers. Sparsely settled districts spend more per pupil on transportation than do more densely settled districts. Rural school officials and residents attribute the increase of property wealth in their districts to speculation rather than to real growth. Because districts with the same property wealth but different levels of income receive roughly the same amount of operating aid per pupil, any movement toward an increased use of an income-based measure of wealth will be advantageous to most rural districts.

Data from a survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census included each state and the District of Columbia but not Puerto Rico or other United States territories. In 1981, most farmworkers were under 25 (55%), white (73%), and male (77%). Hispanics comprised 13% of the workers; blacks and others, 14%. Workers averaged 98 days of farmwork; earned an average $4,299 annually, of which $2,659 resulted from farmwork; and had a median education of 11 years (7.1 years for Hispanics, 9.6 years for blacks, 11.7 years for whites). Demographic data indicated that at survey time, most farmworkers were in the South  (40%) and the North-Central Region (28%). Migrant laborers, 75% of whom were white, accounted for 5% of hired farmworkers, a decline from recent years. Since 1971, the number of farmworkers between ages 18 and 44 increased, the number between ages 14 and 17 decreased, and the number of days spent at farm work increased.

The battery of standardized and specially constructed inventories measured the moods, personality, socialization, values, self-concepts, activities, and self-report indicators of 12 Outward Bound and 12 non-Outward-Bound undergraduates at the beginning and again at the end of a 3-month period. Results indicated no change over time nor difference between groups on personality, socialization, values, or self-concept inventories, but evident differences  between groups in mood states. As the academic term progressed, all groups showed increased depression, dejection, and tension, and decreased self-acceptance and sense of well-being. The control group demonstrated increased anger and hostility while the Outward Bound group remained the same on these scales and also spent more time in recreation. Overall, the standardized tests showed fewer changes than the specially constructed inventories. Also, the more subjective the inventory, the greater the differences revealed. Recommendations include conducting studies of long-term effects over a longer period of time. (SB)",

The superintendent, one principal, and three teachers in each sample school district completed a questionnaire focusing on three areas: curriculum and instruction, administration, and professional preparation and development. For all respondents, the most important issues concerned classroom management and school administration. The least important issues concerned curriculum offerings and instructional methods. Over 77% of the items were perceived both as important and well performed. However, 12 items seen as important but poorly performed  constituted definite areas of need. Of these, most were in the professional preparation and development category. The top five needs were developing student motivational strategies, providing training in fostering positive student self-image, identifying strategies to deal with teacher burnout, providing professional development incentive programs, and providing programs for gifted and talented students. Although few differences existed between the perceptions of superintendents and principals, significant differences existed between teachers and the more positive administrators.

        "description":"Prospects for Illinois public school revenues and school district reorganization in the 1980's, considered in the context of prospects for the Great Lakes region as a whole, are affected by fundamental demographic and economic changes. The region has had a lower population growth rate since 1970 than the rest of the country, and a slower growth in per capita income. Between 1970 and 1980, Illinois had a 15.9% decline in enrollments, a 13.5% reduction in number of public schools, and a 14% reduction in number of school districts, compared with 10.7%, 5.1%, and 11% respective national decreases. Illinois school revenues between 1970 and 1980 shifted from less local funding (-5.9%) to more federal (+4%) and state (+1.9%) support. Changes in Illinois school funding since 1969  included increased, then decreased, state support. A 1973 study recommended school district reorganization based on minimum enrollments, but was not implemented. The 1981-82 Illinois Public School Finance Project proposed a Resource Cost Model for school finance (based on cost of education indices and program cost differentials) which would adjust state aid to local districts according to costs of local educational programming and differences in local tax bases. A 1977 state law on farmland tax assessment procedures could prompt considerable school district reorganization. (MH)",

Eight recent reports on the state of public precollegiate education in the United States address the need for better educational quality. Although the eight reports vary in emphasis, viewpoint, and recommendations, most discuss the need for improved curricula, standards, teacher quality, and finances in the nation's elementary and secondary schools. Educators can respond to these reports by considering changes in educational organization. Local school districts can be restructured through consolidation or cooperative arrangements to influence the flow of educational resources. Examination of the structure of school and  student activities can lead to altering the lockstep approach to the school day, varying time blocks for certain subjects, and improving the use of teacher time. Restructuring the educational professions can build specializations and professional advancement for teachers. The federal government must maintain educational access for minorities while supporting research leading to educational reform. State governments must ensure that state statutes and educational goals work together. State boards of education must ensure high standards. Local school districts must consider innovative and flexible reorganization. A comparison of recommendations from four major reports is included. (SB)",

The resource book presents an in-depth discussion of teaching strategies; steps in  learning development; the language of the classroom; preparation for reading; early and later reading levels; the diagnostic teaching of reading; writing instruction; and supportive services for teachers, students, and parents. The appendices include information about health concerns of native Indian students and about the use of wordless picture books and programs, as well as lists of locally developed curricula related to native life and culture, books and materials related to native life and culture in British Columbia, and suggested materials and programs.

        "description":"A report on Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) plans to consolidate off-reservation Indian boarding schools resulted from a request by 26 Representatives that the General Accounting Office review the 10 BIA schools, in order to assess the basis for school closures and BIA plans for student placement. Randomly selected student files (210) indicated educational criteria were the primary reason for student admission at 5 schools and social criteria at 4 schools. During 1982-83, eight schools offered at least three major special education and social programs, and two offered two; these programs included remedial learning in mathematics, reading, and language for students performing two or more years below normal grade level; handicapped education (basic subjects, special training); and  intensive residential guidance (counseling, supervised study, recreational activities) for students who had problems staying in school. Between 1978 and 1983, staffing decreased at eight schools and increased at two, resulting in changes in courses offered. In the same period, enrollments declined at 6 schools and increased at 4; largest decreases (46%, 57%) were because no 1982 freshmen were admitted to 2 high schools BIA planned to close. Appendices contain summaries of the 10 schools, with information on history, student social/educational characteristics, special programs, physical condition of school, staffing, enrollment, and dormitory/classroom space.

Characteristics of many rural areas (such as high non-enrollment rates, rising service costs, resistance to outside interference, geographic isolation, low salaries, high unemployment, local pride, provincialism, lack of comprehensive human services, and limited educational resources) combine to create severe teacher recruitment and retention problems. In addition to facing the general problems of rural education, rural teachers of learning disabled, severely handicapped, and sensory impaired children are isolated in the service delivery system and must integrate  information and knowledge from a variety of fields without the help of support personnel. Rural districts alleviate the resulting shortages in trained personnel in many ways, including offering extension, in-service, off-campus, and summer training courses; providing consultants; employing and training local residents; providing programming based on needs assessment; providing broad-based training across handicapped populations; supplying professional support systems; organizing practica; waiving training tuition; offering training stipends; and developing realistic rural curricula. Teacher preparation curricula should tie competencies, objectives, and activities to rural problems and their solutions. (SB)",

In 1981, Congress had requested that ARC prepare a plan for completion of the Appalachian highway system and for a 3 to 5 year ARC finish-up development program. Activities under the last year of the traditional program included highway construction, a survey of local development districts (LDDs), the Alabama basic skills improvement program for elementary schools, and a Mississippi pilot project to upgrade training and development of vocational education teachers through inservice training. The finish-up program, begun at the end of fiscal 1982, included completion of 666 miles  of highway, a regionwide jobs and private investment program, a health program for areas lacking basic health care or having high infant mortality rates, and a special program to aid the 67 most distressed and underdeveloped Appalachian counties. ARC received funding of $155 million for fiscal 1983. Report sections discuss objectives and activities, finances, and projects (by category); provide maps, county population change data, and program categories and funding for the 13 Appalachian states; and include an address list and map of Appalachian LDDs.

        "description":"The Ganado (Arizona) Primary School, located on the Navajo Reservation, instituted a successful English writing project for kindergarten children that illustrated that young children should be allowed and expected to develop as writers because they are capable of real writing. Teachers encouraged children to complete drawings and writings in journals, providing them with correct spellings initially but encouraging their own inventive spellings later. To supplement the journal project, teachers regularly read to the children; discussed the children's paintings, drawings, and clay sculptures; taught the children phonetics and some sight words; and developed stories cooperatively with the children. The quality of the writing that resulted varied from child to child. Taken as a  whole, the work illustrated five developmental steps towards writing, as the children's writing moved from mimicry through shape and linearity to meaning, word inventories, and short expressions. The project showed that to promote language proficiency at the kindergarten level, teachers must believe that the child is capable of developing language, expect the child's participation, be prepared to risk, and constantly give children opportunities to test their developing theories of language. A collection of 73 of the children's pictures and writings with transcriptions to adult spellings is included. (SB)",

Despite the limitations of the study due to small sample size, the unrepresentative number of Hispanics included, and the omission of Puerto Rico, results indicated that Hispanic students tend to have a different experience with career education than do Blacks or Whites. Student data indicated that Hispanics, especially females, sought career information from counselors and parents less than did Blacks or Whites and that they turned to teachers, friends, and other resources more than Whites. They also sought different kinds of  information. School data indicated that schools with high Hispanic enrollments were more likely to have career education directors, school-made career materials, and Spanish-language career materials, and less likely to have access to computer terminals. Field reviewers recommended changes in the structure of career information systems and delivery of services; the role, training, and selection of counselors; the type of materials and resources selected; and the type and degree of parental involvement.

Although important to agricultural experiment stations, rural development research has received limited funding. A heterogeneous research program including human resources development, economic development, community facilities and services, environmental improvement, family and youth, natural resources and recreation, population, and small farms has received less than 5% of available resources. Further, rural development research is characterized by small commitments from relatively few people. Nevertheless, significant achievements have been made in several areas including documentation of rural conditions, rural  industrialization and job development, community services and local government finance, rural youth and youth in agriculture, and needs assessments. Rural development research must balance the priorities of both the research community and the public. While little information about public priorities is available, researchers are apparently focusing on five research issues: the impact of growth and development on demand for and cost of services, water resources, health care, the impact of energy shortages and inflation, and the rural labor market. Trends in rural development research include collaboration, evaluation and estimation of program impacts, and implications of &quot;New Federalism.&quot; (SB)",

Rural needs identified by a public participation process are grouped under improvements in facilities and services including education, local government, housing, and employment and income. The Reagan Administration's governing philosophy, the New Federalism, is  outlined. The Administration's strategy is described, including the Federal-State Block Grant Program to improve facilities and services; efforts to reduce reporting and regulatory requirements for rural development programs; the proposed Technical Rural Assistance Information Network, Rural Resources Guide, and rural data collection improvements; rural housing block grants; proposed rural enterprise zones, reform and expansion of trade to develop foreign markets for rural products; and efforts to increase availability of credit for rural development.

About 45% of farm residents lived in the North Central region, 35% in the South, 13% in the West, and 7.5% in the Northeast. Whites comprised 96% of the farm population and Blacks, 3.2%, versus 85% and 12.1% of the non-farm population, respectively. Only 2.3% of the farm population was of Spanish origin. Compared to non-farm residents, farm residents were slightly older and more likely to be married and living with a spouse. Farm women bore significantly more children than non-farm women. Farm population labor force participation was  higher than for non-farm residents, especially among men and in the West and North. The unemployment rate of 3.6% was relatively low. Most farm men were employed in agriculture, but most farm women were not. Self-employment was higher and median income was lower among farm residents. The report contains supporting statistical tables, definitions, explanations, and a statement regarding the source and reliability of the estimates. (SB)",

Sources were summarized as to author(s), publication date, focus (rural-urban comparison, rural sociology, rural health/mental health, rural human services), basis for defining rural, statistics employed (none, narrative, descriptive, univariate, multivariate), and findings. An unstated definition was used by 43% (77 sources); 19% (33) used verbal definitions, 15% (27) utilized homemade quantitative definitions, and 23% (41) used external quantitative definitions. Of 101  sources which defined rural, 22 used multiple components, but only 5 sources using homemade quantitative and none using external quantitative definitions employed multiple criteria. Rural was defined in terms of population by 90 sources (verbal = 25, homemade quantitative = 25, external quantitative = 40), but with little consensus on population criteria. The most common quantitative external population definitions, both based on census data, were those of the Department of Commerce (Rural versus Urban) and Office of Management and Budget (Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area). Other criteria included occupation (14 sources), socioeconomic information such as education and income level (19), values (7), isolation (5), and government (4). (MH)",

Any transition to a more energy-efficient society depends on a massive effort to educate and mobilize all American people, in particular women. It is believed that, given the educational tools, women will lead the movement for the wise use of vanishing resources and for the development of clean, renewable energy sources. For this reason, CAN has undertaken an Energy Project for Women. This document discusses the rationale for and development of the project. Topics discussed include: role of women in a new  energy era, women in science, CAN's Energy Project for Women, women and solar employment, Energy Project takes shape, community projects, a conservation and solar path, and giving women the tools. These &quot;tools&quot; are do-it-yourself guides on how to save money and energy. Lists of CAN's publications and educational/technical training programs in solar energy are provided in appendices.

An experiment is described using a 4 (graph type) by 3 (question) within-subjects design, each subject (N=10) participating under all conditions. Thirty-six graphs were displayed completely at random. Subjects were informed that the purpose was to test perception of certain display properties and told to respond as quickly as possible without making errors. A graph was shown and subjects executed the response. The  experimenter recorded latency and noted errors. Tests were then administered, one to recall a missing property, the other simple recognition of graphs rated on a confidence scale. The results support the hypothesis that incongruency between information to be communicated and its graphic representation leads to reparsing and better memory.

The compatibility function is an empirical definition of a perceptual category representing the grade of membership of an implied physical attribute into a corresponding conceptual category, measuring the degree of compatibility between a particular level of attribute and a category. Adults (N=24) were asked to categorize lines as sharply or slightly increasing when presented with line and bar graphs with slopes from five to sixty degrees in five degree increments. Crossover point and precision parameters are discussed as part of the statistical analysis. This experiment established compatibility function values for the categorical  terms sharply increasing and slightly increasing. A graph designer having an inventory of such functions plus the operations that can be performed on them can weight the information to be presented by manipulating various aspects of the graph, specifically the framework and/or specifier. This would allow graphs to be designed to meet specialized requirements. A list of twelve references, figures showing the types of graphs used, and the compatibility functions established fo the categories of interest to this experiment; and a table summarizing parameter values for the mathematical models are attached.

The method for encoding feature identification, primary encoding features, and the question of whether or not configural superiority can be modified are discussed. The subjects (N=12) were adults with no prior experience in card sorting tasks. The task required subjects to classify stimuli that vary in two of their properties - speed and accuracy. A previous task with stimuli varying in only one dimension served as a baseline. Results indicate that the configural property of intersection  is perceived directly rather than constructed from the stimulus components. Modifications to configurations, the experimental methodology and statistical analysis including error analysis are described. The geometric concept of intersection is described as analogous to the statistical concept of crossed interaction and to its mathematical interpretation as a departure from parallelism.

        "description":"A comprehensive development process for display design, focusing on computer-generated cathode ray tube (CRT) displays is presented. A framework is created for breaking the display into its component parts, used to guide the design process. The objective is to design or select the most cost effective graphics solution (hardware and software) to meet any problem situation. The framework is divided into informational structure/medium of display; these are broken into constituent elements and discussed with associated design issues. The informational structure includes content, format, and organization. The CRT is analyzed for display design criteria such as light, geometric parameters, and CRT display properties. Viewing area criteria are discussed. The components of medium and  informational structure provide the framework for specifying hardware/software requirements for graphics systems. The process of display design is presented, beginning with feasibility studies, resulting in a set of useful solutions. Steps to obtaining a 'best' solution are summarized, creating an optimal candidate system which is physically realized and tested through detailed design activity. Results may indicate a need for revision/redesign requiring alternative solutions. The criterion for selecting the most effective solution is based on integrity of design. A list of 24 references, 18 figures and 6 tables are attached. (JM)",

A psychological theory of knowledge of the reader and the mental events which occur in attempting to read a graphic display are the two focal points of the book. A comprehensive research program aimed at various levels of difficulty of charts/graphs intended for a wide range of uses and a review of most of the existing literature on charts and graphs (85 references listed) are provided. The literature review is used to develop the analytic scheme/theory and to justify the methods chosen by the research team. A psychological approach is taken because of recent advances in cognitive science which allow a  modeling of visual interpretation as something more than a simple recording system. The authors indicated that this is the first attempt at a comprehensive application of applied cognitive science, proving the usefulness of the knowledge being built up, supporting cognitive science in the sense of building a technology on it, and allowing deeper insights into human products and how to make them better.

Three questionnaires were created to directly address the goals and objectives of ensuring availability of trained manpower to develop energy resources and improve conservation endeavors. Information was gathered over a 2 year period, evaluated by ORAU's Manpower Education, Research, and Training Division (MERT); and this report was prepared on the basis of the assessment. The 1981/1982 Faculty and Student Research Participation programs provided research opportunities for 86 faculty members and 164 undergraduate  students at 12 DOE facilities. The responses to surveys conducted with each group indicate the programs were a rewarding experience for participants and DOE scientists. Further, the programs fulfilled the objectives ORAU determined; in fact, in some cases these objectives were realized by almost 100 percent of the participants. The report contains: participant entry, exit, and follow-up survey results; research collaborator survey results; selected survey data comparisons; program objectives; copies of survey questionnaires; tabled evaluation information; and titles of faculty research participants' publications resulting from this experience.

Experiment 2 identified sources of individual differences in rule use. Undergraduates were not significantly different in mathematical background, aptitude, or interests, but sex differences were found. Experiment 3 expanded the introduction and simplified question syntax with young students. Experiment 4 used young students to explore a training paradigm for rule use, finding the comparative aspect of judgment a key obstacle to rule use.  Experiment 5 investigated undergraduates' judgment of response-outcome correlation using a sum-of-diagonals rule; training was effective. Experiment 6 studied methods of information presentation to undergraduates, finding that presentation conditions affected judgment. Undergraduates showed marked judgment differences, depending on sampling period, in experiment 7. The final experiment found little improvement when undergraduates added summary information to line-interval judgments. (JM)",

This research investigates method of assessment as one possible source of this low consensus. A set of problems was developed in such a way that different judgment rules would produce different decisions about the relationships between events. College subjects judged these problems, then were asked to explain their judgment strategy. In addition, they were shown model strategies and asked to choose the one like their own strategy and the model that would be the best strategy. Subjects whose judgments indicated use of the most sophisticated strategy were quite accurate in reporting their judgment rules. Subjects using the less accurate rules most commonly reported using  strategies which could not have produced the obtained pattern of problem solutions. These findings suggest that self-report is a weak basis for conclusions about sources of error in covariation judgment. (Author)",

The present experiments use a rule analysis methodology to investigate covariation judgments of children in this age range. In Experiment 1, children in second, third and fourth grade judged covariations on 12 different covariation problems. Children's performance patterns on the problem set showed an increase in the use of systematic judgment strategies in this age range. Systematic rule users most commonly compared contingency table cells &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in judging the event covariations. In Experiment 2, a training paradigm was employed to investigate possible origins of systematic rule use. First and second grade unsystematic, strategy O and  cell-a children were either directed to attend to cells &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; (Attention only), were additionally offered explicit instructions to note which of the two cells had more events (Attention-plus-more) or were given no training (control). Posttest performance showed that the Attention-plus-more condition was the only treatment to reliably elicit a-versus-b rule use. It is concluded that simple covariation judgment rules can be used by children in the early elementary school years. (Author)",

A strong developmental trend was found, with students using increasingly sophisticated rules with increasing age. Current efforts are focused on trying to account for trends, noting knowledge differences between age groups that may be implicated in the differences in rule use.

Subjects were asked to judge the effect of a discrete response (tapping a wire) on the occurrence of a brief outcome (a radio's buzzing). Pairings of the possible event-state combinations were presented in a summary table, an unbroken time line, or a broken time line format. Subjects judged the extent to which the response caused the outcome or prevented it from occurring. Across all methods of information presentation, judgments were a positive function of response-outcome contingency and outcome probability. In the unbroken time line condition, judgments of negative response-outcome contingencies were less extreme than judgments of equivalent positive contingencies. Judgments of positive and  negative relationships were generally symmetrical in the summary table condition. Summary table judgments were less influenced by the overall probability of outcome occurrence. These judgment differences among format conditions suggest that, depending on the method of information presentation, subjects differently partition event sequences into discrete event pairings.

Approximately 95 percent of the 1982 recipients of the Ph.D. and similar doctorates responded to a survey questionnaire. Data also include information for nonrespondents obtained from public sources. Recipients of first-professional degrees such as the M.D. are not included. Among the findings highlighted are those indicating that: the 1982 S/E doctorate of 17,600 was virtually unchanged from 1981, remaining 7 percent below the peak reached in 1972; that the representation of women continued to grow such that during the last 10 years the  number of female S/E doctorates increased by 100 percent, while S/E doctorates awarded to men fell by 20 percent; and that non-U.S. citizens accounted for about 23 percent of new S/E doctorates in 1982. In addition, although doctorates with specialization in science/mathematics education peaked at 364 in 1972, they declined to only 136 in 1982; among those with definite employment commitments in the last three years, about three times as many had commitments to colleges or universities as to elementary or secondary schools.

Following an introduction, the report is divided into five sections, addressing respectively: the necessity of recycling; waste paper recycling; aluminum recycling; iron and steel recycling; and three steps to a \"recycling society.\" These steps include: (1) requiring that consumers pay full costs of materials they use and requiring efforts to reduce energy price subsidies; (2) building world markets for scrap paper, aluminum, and iron/steel; and (3) efforts to insure greater collection of wastes. Incentives, information, or the threat of fines and non-collection of garbage are suggested as ways to implement the latter step, one which would also reduce environmental subsidies, promote international scrap trade, and  soften the impact of higher energy prices. Potential for recycling, recycling trends, and special technical and political circumstances are among the topics discussed in the sections on the recycling of waste paper, aluminum, and iron/steel.

Individual interactivity as a function of group size was investigated by focusing on various modes of interaction available to students while they completed activities using a computer. The activities, which involved manipulation of pictures of batteries, bulbs, and wires on the computer screen to perform simple experiments with simple direct current (DC) circuits, involved high-level learning (reasoning skills and conceptual understanding). Achievement was measured by administering brief paper and pencil tests and individual interviews. Data were also collected for subjects (N=58 seventh and eighth grade students) on age, sex, grade point average, and family income. The study also investigated  students' grasp of concepts being taught by having them apply their knowledge to appropriate non-computer tasks, and certain global aspects of the group session to provide generalizations of typical social and psychological behavior in the computer-based learning environment. Among the findings reported are those indicating an advantage of small group usage (two to three students per group) over individual usage of highly interactive computer-based instructional materials and that students working in such groups seemed more likely to interpret program questions as the authors of the materials had intended.

The first study, &quot;Writing to Think About High School Chemistry,&quot; was conducted by a high school English teacher who enrolled in a high school chemistry course. The course was typical with the exception that students were encouraged to keep a journal in which they were to write whatever they wished, or whenever they were confused or the teacher thought they had gone over difficult material. Analysis of three student journals (including the author's) indicates that writing provoked these students to reflect on their own thoughts, take responsibility for their own learning, and begin to raise and answer their own questions. The second study, &quot;Using Expressive Writing to Teach Biology,&quot;  examined use of writing assignments (reading logs, notes, practice essays, summaries) in two high school biology classes. It was predicted that writing encourages students to think about subject matter and to discover and clarify points of confusion. Although posttests showed generally similar levels of achievement for experimental (N=69) and control (N=67) groups, the experimental group appeared to do better on the delayed posttests.

        "author":["VanLehn, Kurt"],
        "description":"A theory of how people learn certain procedural skills is presented. It is based on the idea that the teaching and learning that goes on in a classroom is like an ordinary conversation. The speaker (teacher) compresses a non-linear knowledge structure (the target procedure) into a linear sequence of utterances (lessons). The listener (student) constructs a knowledge structure (the learned procedure) from the utterance sequence (lesson sequence). Speakers unknowingly obey certain constraints, called felicity conditions or conversational postulates, which help listeners construct an appropriate knowledge structure. This research has shown that there are felicity conditions on lesson sequences that help students learn procedures. Three felicity conditions were discovered, forming  the central hypotheses in the learning theory, which was embedded in a model, a large computer program using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The model's performance was compared to data from several thousand students learning to subtract multidigit numbers, add fractions, and solve simple algebraic equations. A key criterion for the theory is that the set of procedures that the model &quot;learns&quot; should exactly match the set of procedures that students actually acquire. Both testing the predictions and arguing for the validity of the theory are included in the report. (Author/MNS)",

More than 1200 children in grades 3-8, including over 220 learning-disabled students, were tested and/or interviewed. Story problems were in the usual format found in textbooks, an abbreviated verbal format also found in some textbooks, and a format in which a drawing carried much of the information about the problem. It was found that, for most children, the abbreviated format did not result in better performance. The drawn format helped some children, especially those at the lower ends of scales measuring cognitive restructuring and reading comprehension. Learning-disabled children experienced some success, even with  problems containing extraneous information. Overall, females scored higher than males on a reading test, but males tended to score higher on problem and cognitive tests. Limits of working memory and deficiencies in understanding the meanings of operations are hypothesized to explain some of the results. (Author/MNS)",

Data from these two studies were used to form six groups differing in cognitive capacity, and the remaining three studies each used a sample of students from these groups. The third study examined the performance and strategies used to solve a structured set of verbal addition and subtraction problems. The fourth study involved repeated assessment of performance on a set of items measuring objectives related to addition and  subtraction. In the last study, the children and their teachers were observed to see how addition and subtraction were taught and whether instruction varied because of the children's cognitive capacity. Differences in capacity were reflected in performance, but instruction did not vary. The capacity of children for processing information, the procedures students have invented to solve a variety of problems, and the way in which instruction is carried out in schools did not appear to be related to each other.

        "description":"This monthlong interdisciplinary, award winning project was designed to help kindergarten children in Kentucky understand basic economic principles that affect their daily lives. The children study about the poverty-stricken people of the Appalachian mountain area of the state. Through the operation of a classroom coal mine and company store, the children learn that Kentucky is the major coal producing state in the country. They develop an understanding of many basic economic principles, including scarcity, goods and services, and opportunity cost. They form their own business, called the Kentucky Kinder Crafts, and, as the people of Appalachia have for decades, use resources at hand to produce unique items and then sell them to the general public. Other project activities  involve students in viewing filmstrips and films, working in learning centers, listening to stories and guest speakers, and putting on an Appalachian folk festival. Project evaluation reveals that students increase their knowledge of basic economic concepts as a result of this project. Print and nonprint project resources are listed. (RM)",

Chapter 1 proposes a teaching/learning strategy which asks students to assess the logical adequacy of statements selected from common sense, journalism, and sociology. Presented are pre- and posttest data from three classes which provide tentative support for the claim that rational thinking skills can be effectively learned in a social problems course. Chapter 2 provides a comparative framework for analyzing common sense, journalism, and sociology. The third chapter contains  guidelines for critical reasoning which will help students analyze the adequacy of statements about social problems.

Following an introduction, which provides a course outline and objectives, nine study units cover geography, migration, canoe building, land division, society and government, agriculture, fishing, shelter, and traditional cloth-making. Each unit is organized according to the following format: overview, rationale, teacher background information, generalizations, concepts, objectives, reference index, resource bibliography, and extensive development of lessons and activities to supplement the unit. Drawings also supplement curriculum materials. Appendices provide additional background material, including  readings on folklore, the traditional extended family, traditional social mores and responsibilities, religion, social classes, and symbols of royalty. An index to references concludes the guide. (LP)",

        "description":"In July, 1982, letters were sent to the social studies coordinators in all 50 states requesting a list of high school geography texts approved for use in those states and information on the selection process used. The response rate was 100%. Information acquired from the 20 states that have statewide adoption policies constitute the basis of this paper. The most striking study result was the spatial pattern of states that have state adoption policies. They are almost all in the South or Mountain West. With the exception of Indiana, no state in the Midwest, plains, or Northeast has a statewide adoption policy. Reasons for having statewide adoption might include lack of confidence in local leadership or social and political conservatism. It was also found that large textbook  adopting states, especially Texas, have little influence on the current adoption policies of geography texts in other states. The textbooks chosen by the adoption states consistently followed what can be considered the traditional world regional geography format. These texts are listed, along with the name of the publishing company, their publication date, and the number and the names of the states which have adopted them. (RM)",

The first of six sections provides an introduction to the curriculum for teachers. Section 2 examines the Southern black female identity through a presentation of basic concepts and terms and an exploration of the experiences that have shaped the Southern black woman's coming of age. Section 3 traces the roots of this culture from West Africa to the American South and then throughout the United States in order to convey the context in which the creativity of these women has developed. Arts and crafts, music, religious customs, and oral traditions are  considered. The essays in section 4 examine each genre of creative expression, considering its West African precedents, cultural continuity, connections with women's life situations within the black community, and individual creativity within the artists themselves. Each of the preceding three sections is composed of two parts: approaches, which offers suggestions for class discussion and student activities; and materials, which contains essays describing the best multidisciplinary scholarship and resources. Section 5 introduces students to fieldwork techniques. A final section lists print and media resources and distributors' addresses. (LP)",

Information was sought on the reasons for offering PFFP, where it was located in the teacher education program, and how it was included. Of the 436 member institutions responding, 76 indicated that PFFP was part of the program. This report is limited to information provided by these institutions. Results are reported in clusters to give a picture of the way these institutions offer PFFP, and provide data on: (1) extent of inclusion of PFFP; (2) reasons for including PFFP; (3) location of PFFP in the program; and (4) PFFP as  a separate course or unit within a course. A profile is drawn of programs that require PFFP. It is concluded that little PFFP is included in teacher preparation programs other than in home economics education, and that the majority of PFFP programs are offered in the state of Oregon. The second most likely location of PFFP in a teacher education program was in business education, followed by elementary education. The survey instrument and cover letter are appended. (JD)",

Descriptions and explanations are given of theories on the effectiveness of questioning strategies in four types of classification systems: (1) hierarchical, non-context bound; (2) hierarchical, context bound; (3) non-hierarchical, non-context bound; and (4) non-hierarchical, context bound. Seven implications for teaching questioning strategies to preservice teachers are  drawn. Preservice teachers should: (1) be instructed to ask a variety of questions; (2) incorporate higher level questions into lesson plans; (3) pay attention to the quality of each question; (4) take into account the students' ability to respond before asking a question; (5) become knowledgable about the theoretical components of questions so they can adapt and modify questioning strategies to fit their teaching style; (6) learn to ask effective questions through practice; and (7) learn questioning strategies which are effective in specific content areas.

        "description":"A district-based leadership program has been designed to train teachers in self-assessment so they may independently improve their instructional skills. Teachers are trained to analyze their behaviors objectively through the use of audio and videotape. Instruction is also provided in creating and using checklists to assess classroom instruction via audiotape and/or videotape playback, and in strategies for dealing with input from students relating to teacher instructional performance. The district-based leadership hierarchy, which sustains this type of staff development program, is divided into five levels: (1) superintendent; (2) staff development director; (3) staff development steering committee; (4) building-level adminstrators/partner-teachers/demonstration  teachers/consultants; and (5) classroom teachers. The functions and responsibilities of individuals at each level of the leadership hierarchy are discussed in this paper. (JD)",

Subjects included all the volunteer coaches in a 13 team, softball program for 10-12 year old girls. The season consisted of a double round-robin schedule, with no post-season tournaments or all-star games as part of the program. A modified version of an event-recording instrument was used to collect coaching behavior data. The instrument included a total of 10 different behavior categories; among these were 4 categories that dealt with responses directed at opponents or officials, and 2 categories reserved for miscellaneous behaviors. The instrument was comprised of four&quot;positive&quot; and four &quot;negative&quot; behavior categories. An analysis of data revealed that: (1) 99 percent of all feedback was related to performance; (2) only 3 percent of the coaches' behaviors was categorized as negative; and (3) response rate nearly doubled from early season to late season. Subsequent analysis of winning and losing coaches' behavior indicated that statistically significant different profiles could not be established for winning and losing coaches based on type and rate of feedback and that no differences could be established between whether the team was ahead or behind and the rate of feedback behavior.

        "description":"Four annual surveys of the 50 states provide data for analyzing nation-wide trends in competency assessment of teachers. Most state plans for teacher competency assessment include testing one or more areas of basic skills, professional or pedagogical skills, and academic knowledge. The testing occurs at the entry level--admission to the teacher education program--and/or prior to certification. A growing number of states require an internship or beginning teacher year with appropriate assessment before initial certification can be awarded. Precis are presented of information on teacher assessment from each state. Data analysis appears to justify the following conclusions: (1) State competency assessment of programs has grown rapidly over the last 6 years and may be expected to  continue to increase; (2) Trends continue to emphasize testing in the basic skill areas to be used for certification purposes; (3) Fewer states are using legislative action to mandate competency assessment of teachers, and more states are using state department of education regulations; (4) States are increasingly mandating an induction year prior to the issuance of a certificate; and (5) More states are choosing to use nationally standardized tests rather than develop their own. Several tables detailing each state's position on different types of competency assessment of teachers, as well as contact people for each state, are included. (JD)",

Critical reflection, however, requires various forms of assistance. The use of &quot;clinical supervision&quot; over 6 months in 1982 with 14 teachers in 4 primary schools and a high school, was based upon cooperation, consultation, observation, and feedback among teachers. The method used was neither &quot;clinical&quot; in the pathological sense, nor &quot;supervisory&quot; in the quality control sense. Rather, trusted teaching colleagues assisted each other to analyze their teaching through cycles of observation, analysis, and discussion of data to establish shared frameworks of meaning within which improvement was  possible. The effect was that teachers were able to exercise a greater degree of control over their work environment, and the direction and pace of their own professional development. Through clinical supervision, teachers became active and conscious agents in the determination of their own practice, rather than passive channels for other people's agendas. (JD)",

Clinical supervision seeks to promote a form of teacher development that is descriptive and formative. Teachers were involved in a process of assisted self-reflection about their teaching, with the aid of a colleague (i.e. &quot;supervisor&quot;) who listened supportively to plans before a lesson, and followed through by collecting an observational record of classroom issues and events of interest to the teacher. This activity was seen as a systematic, critical, and reflective process, assisting teachers to articulate their aspirations and teaching intents, collecting data about the teacher's area of classroom interest, collaboratively analyzing the data  for what they revealed, and formulating and implementing future action strategies. Being able to exercise governance over what passed as inservice education, particularly being able to ensure that it was an integral and on-going part of actual teaching, was considered by teachers to be the greatest benefit of clinical supervision.

A study was developed to: (1) determine the type and extent of any state and local law enforcement training needs as perceived within the context of their individual organizational missions and environments; (2) identify any differences in the nature of the training needs at the various demographic levels of relevance; and (3) provide training needs information which would facilitate any Federal Law Enforcement Training programs developed to meet state and local law enforcement  agencies' needs. Questionnaires were developed and mailed to all state and local law police problems and skill areas. Examination of data also reveals that (N=7,292). An analysis of the findings suggests that the majority of training needs given high priority by law enforcement agencies involve basic police problems and skill areas. Examination of data also reveals that a number of task activities not considered high priority by some sizes or types of agencies were given high priority ratings by others. This document, an executive summary, includes an introduction, review of the literature, discussion of methodology, findings, and conclusions as well as a list of references. (JMK)",

The major emphasis of this package is to provide elementary school students with the knowledge needed to make informed food choices and thereby enable them to become responsible for their personal nutritional health. Nutrition concepts classified according to four major health content areas (mental health, physical health, safety, and community health) are identifed in the individual lesson plans included in this package. The teaching package begins with a section on &quot;The Big Picture&quot; that provides an overview of the major concepts and generalizations of nutrition in health. The first section  is followed by seven sections, divided by grade level, of detailed lesson plans for K-6 teachers to use with their students. Appendices of additional resources are also included.

The developmental and ethnocultural problems that children experience (whether they are rooted in the passage, the tasks, or the entire item) are discussed. From a passage-based perspective, the items are presented according to the various kinds of incomplete narratives that the passages convey and the various kinds of shifts that the passages (expository as well as narrative) require readers to make. From a task-based perspective, ways of classifying the tasks are developed with particular attention to the functional demands that they make. This developed framework helps to examine more broadly the passage-based perspective. The passage/task configurations are delineated that are particularly troubling from developmental and ethnocultural perspectives. This presentation allows for a cumulative grounding of the theoretical points made, and the detailed exposition of 22 items (consisting of nearly 400 pages) demonstrates how much goes into reading what is an apparently simple passage.

Teachers and psychologists commonly assume that minority language students have become &quot;language proficient&quot; when they have acquired peer-appropriate fluency in everyday communication. The dangers of such assumptions can be seen in a study in which the psychological assessments of over 400 minority language students were analyzed. Two continua (context-embedded and  context-reduced language proficiency) were used to show the relationship between language proficiency and academic achievement. Research suggests that the acquisition of meaning in context-reduced classroom situations requires more knowledge of the language itself than is typically required in context-embedded face-to-face situations. By eliminating &quot;lack of English proficiency&quot; as an explanation for low achievement in bilingual students, educators risk creating academic deficits by attributing low academic performance or test scores to deficiencies in the student or in his or her background experiences.

Instructional clarity was defined as the interaction between what a teacher does or says and the student's perception of that behavior. This summary of the PAR findings lists 11 specific behaviors of elementary teachers with good instructional clarity that were identified by students. The behaviors include making sure that explanations are clear and understood, providing adequate practice time, synthesizing ideas and demonstrating relevancy, adjusting teaching to the learner and continuously monitoring students, emphasizing important ideas, and  demonstrating a high degree of verbal fluency. For teachers who want to increase their instructional clarity, it is suggested that they tape-record and analyze their instructions for a lesson. Four impediments to instructional clarity are described: fillers; vague or garbled instructions; inaudible pitch; and mazes (combinations of the three previous impediments). Examples are provided of the right way and the wrong way to introduce a lesson. (DC)",

        "description":"The Education Voucher Demonstration began in the Alum Rock Union Elementary School District during the 1972-73 school year. Under the voucher concept, parents freely select a school for their child and receive a credit or voucher equal to the cost of the child's education that is paid directly to the school upon enrollment. It was presumed that this form of school finance would foster competition among the schools and improve the quality of education by making schools more responsive to students' needs. An initial external evaluation at the conclusion of the first year found, however, a relative loss in reading achievement for students in the six public schools that participated in the voucher demonstration. The present report reexamines some of these data using a  quasi-experimental design involving multiple pretests and individual students' test scores (rather that school means) as the unit of analysis. The results appear to indicate that the deleterious reading effect of the voucher demonstration was confined to a few within-school programs featuring nontraditional, innovative curricula. (Author)",

Each of 200 participants spent two and one-half days per week engaged in education and career-planning activities, and two and one-half days per week engaged in work experience activities designed and implemented by the Atlanta Public School System in conjunction with the Atlanta Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) office. Students received instruction in the areas of communications, computations, and career planning; and were placed for 20 hours of work experience on public and  nonprofit work sites located throughout the Atlanta community. All students successfully completing program requirements received 10 hours of academic credit. The 187 participants completing the program improved their scores on posttests of computation and communication. Career area posttest scores failed to improve, although more than 50 percent of the participants mastered each of the career objectives. Improvements in work-site supervisor ratings indicate that the project served to have a positive impact on pertinent work behaviors. (PN)",

The purposes were to provide a comparison of student performance over a period of time and to identify educational, social, and personal conditions that relate to performance on a test of Natural Science, Social Studies, English and Mathematics. Data were collected through the Decade Study Test; school records; and a set of information about students, their families and home environments, and their schools, obtained from questionnaires included in the 1981 administration of the battery. The results of the Decade Study indicate that performance of high school juniors was significantly lower in 1981 than it was in 1970. The school variables that most critically  affected achievement were enrollment and dropout rate. Three aspects of family life were also strongly related to achievement in 1981: father's education, mother's education, and talking to parents about school. In terms of motivation, three features were strongly related to 1981 student performance: the students' estimate of success on the Mathematics subtests, the number of mathematics courses taken by students, and students' belief in their own abilities and efforts to perform well in school.

The total scale includes seven relatively independent subscales designed to reflect the residuals (part conflicts) of Erikson's psychosocial stages of development. An initial item pool of 194 items has been reduced to 113 items by means of judgemental and statistical analyses. Internal consistency of the total scale is acceptable (Alpha .91, N = 94, and Alpha .836, N =120 at different administrations). Internal consistency for all but two subscales (3 and 6) is also acceptable (Hoyt range is .69 to .84). Test-retest reliability is .72 for the total scale. Significant correlations in predicted directions are achieved with measures of anxiety, self-esteem, ego-control, and social desirability. Construct  validation is quite promising thus far, and additional analyses with a large group of young adult subjects are also being performed. (Author)",

Materials and procedures designed to reduce or eliminate the influence of these confounding factors included a series of filmstrips, audiotapes, and workbooks to teach  students test-taking skills; a set of seven practice tests; a self-charting procedure designed to motivate students' test-taking; and workshops and exercises to improve teachers' skills as standardized test administrators. Each of these components is described in detail. The contradictions with previous research and teachers' perceptions of the value of the materials and procedures suggest further evaluation of the project materials is necessary before final conclusions are drawn.

The four steps include: (1) identifying the factors that describe the curricular domain, (2) constructing a test with items representing all possible combinations of content and cognitive factors, (3) determining which factors and interactions among them produced variations in students' scores using generalizability theory, and (4) determining the minimum number of items needed to obtain a generalizable measure of each skill in  the diagnostic profile. This paper contains three studies: \"Optimizing the Diagnostic Power of Tests: An Illustration from Language Arts,\" by Noreen Webb, Joan Herman, and Beverly Cabello; \"Diagnosing Student Errors: An Example from Science,\" by Steve Shaha; and, \"Task Structure Design: Beyond Linkage,\" by Eva Baker and Joan Herman.

Raters assign points to each of several aspects of a student's composition, providing a rating of the overall quality of the written product as well as ratings on specific elements. The authors believe that the greater cost and time commitment required by analytic rating is offset by instructional advantages.

        "description":"The Center for the Study of Evaluation, of the Graduate School of Education at the University of California at Los Angeles (CSE) hosted a two day conference on &quot;Paths to Excellence: Testing and Technology&quot; on July 14-15, 1983. Attended by over 100 educational researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, the first day of the conference focused on issues in educational testing; day two explored the status and future of technology in schools. This document presents the collected papers from the first day of the conference. Presentations focused on CSE's study of teachers' and principals' use of achievement testing in the nation's schools. The study provided basic data about the nature and frequency of classroom testing, the purposes for which test results are used, principals' and  teachers' attitudes toward testing, and local contexts supporting the use of tests (e.g., amount of staff development, testing resources, leadership support). The findings were presented at the conference, and presenters were asked to provide their interpretations of the data and their perspectives on their implications for national, state, and/or local testing policies. One speaker, William Coffman, was asked to provide context for the conference by considering the study in the light of the history of research on educational testing. (PN)",

The report's impetus is the role that existing data plays in current efforts in local school districts and the possibilities for the future. To a great extent, however, we will have to rely on experiences from other areas of social inquiry outside of education and on national and state practices (rather than local) in education. The record of local district practice in maintaining and using data archives is limited to date while extended, multipurpose secondary data examination is commonplace elsewhere. Nonetheless, we assume that the current state of affairs in information maintenance and use  in local districts is more a happenstance of competing priorities for economic and human resources and limited technical expertise and support than a conscious judgment that current practices exhaust the benefits that might accrue.

The three variations included in the study were the hot-deck random, the hot-deck sequential, and the hot-deck distance. The properties of these methods were investigated under three levels of the proportion of incomplete records and four levels representing the number of missing values in a record. The sample size and the covariance in the samples generated remained constant throughout the study. Each cell of the design matrix was replicated 500 times. The three hot-deck variations were found unbiased estimators of population means. Compared to two other variations, the hot-deck distance method performed better in retaining the population covariance structure in imputed samples. In  terms of the quality of missing value estimates, the hot-deck distance seemed better than the hot-deck sequential and the hot-deck random methods. The results of this study were found useful in choosing the appropriate hot-deck variation for imputation. (Author)",

The philosophy of bilingual education employed in IMPACT is transitional, and a major goal is to mainstream students within an average of two years. Students receive classroom instruction in four categories: English as a second language, native language, content-area courses, and mainstream classes. All IMPACT students are enrolled in mainstream art, music, and health education classes; entry into other mainstream classes is dependent upon English proficiency and, sometimes, content-area proficiency. IMPACT's noninstructional component includes the development of curriculum materials and new course  offerings, supportive services, staff training, encouragement of parental participation, and encouragement of student participation in schoolwide and citywide activities. In the 1981-82 school year, IMPACT students showed meaningful gains in English reading and comprehension. More IMPACT students passed a standarized native language test than did mainstream students. Data for math, science, and social science were mostly unavailable. IMPACT students had a higher attendance rate than did the school as a whole. Overall, the project progressed toward its major goal of expediting acquisition of the English-language skills necessary for full mainstreaming. (CMG)",

In response to a need for basic bilingual services not available in participating schools, the project provided tutorial services to limited-English-speaking Haitian students on a voluntary basis. Evaluation of the 1981-82 school year showed that project staff continued to develop a rapport with project students and the Haitian community. Communication with parents and with school administrators was weak. Documentation of project activities in nearly every area was incomplete and thus hampered evaluation efforts, since it was impossible to gauge the extent or substance  of tutorial services, or the number of students actually tutored regularly. There was little evidence of parental involvment or curriculum development. Staff development activities apparently took place, but records were not available. Conclusions must remain largely impressionistic: all three schools attempted to provide intensive instruction in English-as-a-second language, and achievement at the two sites for which test data were reported appeared to be satisfactory. Linguistic issues related to teaching the native language (Creole) were not addressed. However, the project did fulfill a critical need for services previously unavailable at the three schools and provided individual attention to participants. (CMG)",

According to this evaluation, the project instead served students in critical need of basic skills and remediation. The following points are made: (1) The project was planned to function in conjunction with ongoing bilingual education programs which were not in fact in place. (2) On-site staff developed excellent working relations with students and mainstream staff but were hampered by being accountable to an on-site supervisor and a central project director. (3) In several areas there was insufficient documentation to assess whether the project's objectives had been attained. It  was difficult to ascertain how many students received services, and how often, or the subject matter covered in tutorials. Entry criteria varied, and neither exit criteria nor follow-up had been specified. Staff development apparently took place but was not documented. (4) Where documentation was available, as in career orientation and curriculum development, implementation fell short of objectives. (5) Achievement data were available for only one site, making evaluation of instructional achievement difficult. (6) The project did not develop a language development and use policy.

Three groups of subjects are included in the program: English as a second language, native language arts, and content-area subjects.

In addition, bilingual teachers prepare students for mainstreaming by gradually increasing the extent of English usage in content-area classes, and by moving toward greater sophistication in remedial English courses. Three community resource centers provide services for project students from all school sites and act as focal points in relations between the school, the students, their parents, and the local community. In the school year  1981-82, when it served approximately 700 students, the program met most of its instructional objectives. Problems of testing and/or data reporting made assessment of students' development of English syntax skills on a programwide basis difficult, although students seemed to be making more progress than pre-post tests adequately measured. Students at all school sites made statistically and educationally significant gains in reading in their native language and did very well on cultural heritage tests.

First, it enabled students to prepare for the high school equivalency exam, improve their English language skills, and explore academic and vocational options.

The focus of the instructional component was the development of basic skill competencies through instruction in the dominant language. English-as-a-second-language instruction was also given. Intern training combined staff development activities with courses in the master's program in bilingual education at the City College of New York. By the end of its final year, 1982, the TELE program, coupling college courses with on-site assistance and inservice workshops and encouraging a linkage between  the practical and the theoretical in teacher training efforts, had established itself as a model for diversified teacher training.

        "description":"This study examines the effects of racial composition of a classroom on students' cross-race and same-race friendships. Two &quot;theories&quot; of interracial sociability are discussed. The first argues that interracial friendliness is affected primarily by the number of opportunities students have for cross-race interaction relative to same-race interaction. It predicts that students in the numerical minority are likely to make more cross-race friendship choices than those in the majority. The second claims that the racial minority is socially threatened by the majority and tends to isolate itself from the more dominant and powerful other race. These predictions are examined in a longitudinal data set on 473 elementary school students in 18 desegregated classes over a school year. The  results provide strong support for the opportunity hypothesis and show little evidence that being in the minority diminishes interracial friendliness. (Author/CMG)",

        "description":"The decision by the National Institute of Education panel on the effects of school desegregation to select (for meta-analysis) a small group of preferred studies based upon criteria chosen in advance of examining the studies was, in principle, a mistake. One usually cannot know until the data have been examined which of several competing methodological criteria are most important. In the case of the effects of desegregation on minority achievement, Crain and Mahard in their 1982 review of 93 desegregation studies found a methodological error so specific to desegregation research that it was not even recognized as an error until the review was done. The error was that studies of the effects of desegregation on minority achievement will underestimate any effects when using subjects  who have not been in desegregated settings since kindergarten or Grade 1. Whereas Crain and Mahard found 20 studies of blacks in desegregated settings since kindergarten or Grade 1, the panel discarded all but one of them because they did not fit their chosen-in-advance criteria. Of the 20 studies identified by Crain and Mahard, 16 showed consistent positive outcomes and only 2 were negative. If the principal function of selecting a superior subgroup of studies is to find the consistency of results which is masked by error in an unselected sample, Crain and Mahard succeeded, and the panel did not.

The 19 studies selected for review and analysis by the NIE panel did not include cross-sectional studies or longitudinal studies without a control group; all the selected studies fulfilled a quasi-experimental design, with pre- and post-tests as well as a segregated control group. Analysis of the studies in terms of each reseacher's own significant tests and the meta-analysis technique  employed by the NIE panel shows no significant and consistent effects of desegregation on black achievement. There is virtually no effect for math achievement. For reading, the best that can be said is that only a handful of grade levels show substantial positive effects, while the large majority of grade levels show small and inconsistent effects that average out to almost zero. The fact that only a small fraction of these studies show substantial effects strongly suggest that factors other than desegregation are the real causes of the large achievement gains that are documented.

It is stated that, overall, the results show that reading achievement improves somewhat as a result of desegregation but math achievement does not. The author notes that there is a basic problem in evaluating desegregation programs in that there is great diversity among programs, which accounts for the diverse results obtained in different studies. It is suggested that desegregation has not increased black self-esteem, and in some cases has decreased it; tentative conclusions suggest that racial relations have not been improved by  desegregation. According to the author, research, and particularly long-term research, is still needed on the effects of desegregation on students and communities, as well as studies that examine under what conditions desegregation does work.

        "description":"This paper analyzes the 19 studies presented to the National Institute of Education's (NIE) panel on the effects of school desegregation on black achievement and discusses the author's own findings. The author concludes that desegregation did not cause any decrease in black achievement generally, nor did it cause any increase in math achievement. Although desegregation increased mean reading levels, the distribution of reading effects appeared to be skewed, with a disproportionate number of school districts obtaining atypically high gains. Studies with the largest gains were characterized along a number of methodological and substantive dimensions (none of which could be isolated as causes of the atypically high reading gains) including: small sample size, two or more years of  desegregation, desegregated children who outperformed their segregated counterparts even before desegregation began, and desegregation that occurred earlier, was voluntary, occurred in schools with larger percentages of whites, and was associated with enrichment programs. Because of the small samples in the NIE project, and the apparently non-normal distributions, the author states he is not confident that anything has been learned about desegregation's effects on reading on the average. Across the few studies examined, he found that variability in effect sizes was more striking and less well understood than any measure of central tendency. The paper ends with a review of the implications of the findings for various interest groups and a summary of the implications the NIE project has for  theories of research synthesis. (CMG)",

        "description":"Although school desegregation was initiated to address a social inequity--segregated schooling was seen as stigmatizing blacks as a social group--research has focused primarily on desegregation's effects on black academic achievement and self-esteem. Two problems have made this research difficult: the ambiguity of the term \"school desegregation\" and the quality and characteristics of the research designs used to study it. In this meta-analysis of 19 desegregation studies prepared for the National Institute of Education, the effect size method is used. Results show that the effects of desegregation on verbal tests is significant as is the pooled verbal and math effect size, but the math test effect size is not significant. Analysis of white achievement gains in three of the  studies shows that black gains relative to white gains are small, thus suggesting that black gains are not attributable to desegregation per se. Other factors affecting academic outcomes in desegregated settings--anxiety and threat, self-concepts and aspirations, peer comparison, expectations, peer relations, school effects, teachers, and students--have diverse effects on and are affected in diverse ways by desegregation. Although desegregated schooling has only a moderate positive effect on black achievement, desegregation is nevertheless a requisite if the social issue of interracial acceptance is to be addressed.

Information about the schools was obtained through ethnographic case studies. Data were synthesized to describe each school and to identify potential stressors, with emphasis on the identification and description of stressors related to the context or culture of the school and the system, i.e., the work environment. These data were then analyzed within a psychological anthropology framework. Specifically, drawing from previous studies, it was postulated that once basic human needs are met, individuals (in this case school personnel) seek  security, status, and sociability in their culture, society, occupations, and personal lives. In addition, eight universal aspects of behavior were examined (value system, cosmology or world view, social organization, technology, economic system, governance, language, and socialization process). Comparisons of findings across schools resulted in five major categories of stressors: (1) security; (2) governance/leadership; (3) budget cuts; (4) staff relations; and (5) student issues. Student issues, however, were found to be stressors only in the two high schools. This report is organized as follows: Volume I includes an introduction to the study, a literature review, description and analysis of stressful conditions in the schools studied, conclusions regarding the findings' significance,  and recommendations for policymakers and practitioners concerned with reducing stressful conditions in schools. Volume II includes the full case studies of each of the six schools, and a report on extensive interviews with the schools' principals. Volume III contains a detailed discussion of the research methodologies, as well as the instruments utilized for data collection. (GC)",

During the study, questionnaires were administered to training sponsors, teacher-coordinators, and students from 80 high schools in Arizona, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia. All vocational program areas were included in the study with a mixture of participants from small, medium, and large high schools. Based on the study findings, the researchers recommended that teacher-coordinators be hired on not less than 10-month contracts and that they devote at least 65 percent of their contract day to coordination responsibilities with the balance of time spent maintaining contact with the classroom setting. They further suggested that the related class be  given a time allocation of not less than five hours per week for the expressed purpose of providing the bridge needed by students between vocational classroom training and the world of work. Because of the importance of working with special populations, the researchers also recommended that teacher-coordinators be given inservice training on how to work with handicapped or disadvantaged students in cooperative programs. Finally, they encouraged administrators supervising cooperative programs to develop guidelines to provide opportunities for students who are potential dropouts and in high unemployment areas.

        "description":"A field study examined the Public Service Employment (PSE) Program's intergovernmental effects. Addressed during the study were such questions as whether the program creates jobs in local government, whether local governments give preference to disadvantaged persons, and what kinds of services are provided. To collect these data, a network of field researchers each devoted an average of 30 to 60 days observing the effects of PSE in a representative sample of jurisdictions that accounts for approximately 10 percent of PSE enrollees. Contrary to what others have said, designers of this study found that the PSE program has not resulted in the displacement of many local jobs by federally supported jobs. In addition, 86 PSE dollars out of 100 are stimulating the economy directly by  providing salaries. While PSE was originally initiated to combat countercyclical unemployment, research indicates that in many jurisdictions the program also shows considerable potential for alleviating structural employment. Furthermore, PSE workers are providing many primary services that are important to local communities. Examination of PSE in the nonprofit sector suggests that while these organizations have a great potential for creating jobs, they do not achieve the targeting objectives of PSE as well as do local governments.

        "description":"A study examined the predictive efficiency of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) for adult learners in the University System of Georgia (USGA). Also investigated during the study were the effects of variables such as age, sex, and race on the performance of adult learners on the SAT and in college and the relative academic performance of adult learners and traditional college-aged students. Based on an analysis of data collected from various subpopulations of the total population of 1,694 adults who were identified as adult learners enrolled in the USGA, the researchers concluded that while the verbal and math SAT scores of adult learners correlated significantly with their grades, the coefficients of these correlations did not match what is customarily found in traditional  college-aged populations. The usefulness of the SAT in predicting adult learning lies, as it usually does, in the incremental effectiveness of verbal and math scores when they are used in conjunction with high school grades. These conclusions led the researchers to caution admission directors, registrars, and testers who combine verbal and math SAT scores for a total SAT score that they are destroying valuable information about the learning competencies of learners.

During the project, 354 telephone interviews were conducted with adults in nine cities in California. About 42 percent of those interviewed had participated in at least one course, class, or other organized learning activity during the previous year. As compared to nonparticipants, the average participant in adult learning activities was more likely to be under 55 years of age, live in a suburban city, have higher levels of education and income, and be employed full-time in a professional job. With respect to learning activities in the previous year, the average number of courses taken was three; about a fifth of these were business courses, and over three-fourths of them were taken on a part-time  bsis. While over half of the courses were taken for credit and for job improvement or self-development, employers only paid for about 20 percent of them. Over half of those interviewed planned to participate in some learning activities in the coming year. Mentioned as the major barriers to lack of participation were lack of time and cost. The most desired supportive services were job placement, counseling, and financial aid. (MN)",

        "description":"Two studies were conducted to examine the problems experienced by special needs students in the process of making the transition to postsecondary vocational education programs, to develop a model of the transitional process, and to empirically examine that process via instruments related to the concept of educational adjustment. The first study was a statewide telephone survey of secondary education, postsecondary education, and vocational rehabilitation personnel in Minnesota. Based on this survey, it was concluded that the concept of transition is best viewed in terms of key persons, processes, and corresponding needs and resources that apply to students as well as to their educational environments. Thus, to enhance the educational adjustment of special needs students entering  postsecondary institutions, practitioners could utilize various correctional, compensation, and circumvention strategies to modify conditions that are difficult for the students to tolerate and to enhance the students' ability to overcome or avoid frustration. The second study, which examined the progress of 96 students at a small rural postsecondary vocational education institution in Minnesota, supported the assumption that instructional variables are more educationally relevant than typical student data such as gender, race, economic status, and previously received supportive services.

During the study, researchers mailed questionnaires to a stratified random sample of 1,500 employers throughout Oregon. In addition, they surveyed another 140 employers who were identified as hiring the largest numbers of vocational education completers in the state. Finally, interviewers spoke with representatives of 10 Oregon firms that employ over 55,000 people. Virtually all the employers interviewed indicated that many entry-level employees are deficient in basic skills. Other frequently mentioned problems were poor work attitudes and a general lack of understanding about the world of business. While many of the employers interviewed indicated that their firms provide at least some type  of on-the-job training, most agreed that additional training is needed in areas such as computer literacy, the need for retraining and lifelong learning, basic economics, and time management. When asked who should be responsible for performing these additional training functions, most of the respondents said that they should be the responsibility of educational institutions. Based on these findings, recommendations were made calling for increased cooperation between the educational and business sectors in areas such as job training and placement and for new legislation concerning tax credits to encourage businesses to donate equipment to vocational schools.

The researchers found that the factors &quot;escape&quot; and &quot;stimulation&quot; were of moderate importance to students between the ages of 18 and 45, of little importance to those in the midlife stage, and of above-moderate importance to those over the age of 55. While &quot;professional advancement&quot; and &quot;personal growth&quot; were of above-average importance to adults under the age of 50, a dramatic drop in ranking of scores for  these factors occurred for those in later years.

Current data on the military performance of enlisted Navy women recently graduated from recruit training were used to document reports of female-enlisted performance and define suggested problem areas in terms of observable behavior. Problem areas included military appearance, leadership, adaptability, pregnancy and child care, and military customs. Findings of a comparison of recruit training for men and women were that the Navy recruit training curriculum is identical for men and women; the same level of performance is officially required for all recruits; many staff members are unprepared for  leading recruits of the opposite sex; and differences in backgrounds of male and female company commanders result in different role models. These recommended changes in recruit training were suggested: a training program for division officers; expanded use of mixed general leadership of companies and divisions; instruction on wearing dress uniforms and grooming for female recruits; and improved technical training on military customs.

Twenty schools were randomly selected from the 66 Ohio secondary schools having vocational horticultural programs, and students were given questionnaires. From these questionnaires, five were selected from each school; five parents and five employers of students received questionnaires; all the teachers and administrators at each of the schools received questionnaires as well. Of the numerous results obtained from the analysis, the most significant were the following: (1) parents, vocational horticultural students, and employers  all responded that the summer program is an important part of the vocational horticultural program; (2) all four groups perceived of teachers as engaging in activities of supervising students' summer employment, advising summer Future Farmers of America activities, working with horticultural industrial employers, contacting community leaders, and updating and repairing school equipment; (3) students did not respond as strongly as parents and employers that knowledge and experience obtained during the summer were not obtainable during the school year; (4) frequency of teacher visits to job sites were viewed differently by students and employers, possibly because teachers paid more attention to employers than to students; and (5) all groups responded that the extended service contract  should be continued even if federal/state monies are withdrawn. Recommendations were made to increase knowledge of the summer program and to open lines of communication among the groups involved. (KC)",

The dependent variables were participation and nonparticipation; independent variables were educational attainment, anomie, life satisfaction, and certain learning-related factors. A survey instrument was used with 786 older adults in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. The participants differed statistically from the nonparticipants on each of the independent variables except life satisfaction. Participants averaged slightly above the 12th grade educational level, were less anomic, and were more likely to engage in self-directed learning experiences. Sponsors of educational activities in which they participated were  LaFarge Lifelong Learning Institute, local churches, senior centers, and local colleges. Subjects participated in learning activities because they enjoyed being with other people, liked the challenge of learning, and were attracted by the usefulness of the subject matter. Obstacles inhibiting participation were lack of transportation, night classes, uninteresting courses, high cost, and lack of time. (YLB)",

The academic performance and attrition rates of approximately 20,000 retrainees and 230,000 nonprior-service enlistees (nonretrainees) attending 272 schools were compared. Multiple linear regression analyses of data from historical personnel records examined the relationship among school performance criteria, retraining status, and aptitude as well as the amount of military service, career status, and background experience acquired prior to retraining. Results indicated the performance of retrainees was comparable or superior to nonretrainees with equivalent aptitudes. Among retrainees, performance generally  increased as more time was spent in military service before changing specialties. Retrainees who were career airmen with more than three years of service tended to do better than noncareer airmen in training. Experience in a specialty with the same aptitude index (mechanical, administrative, general, or electronics) as the retraining specialty typically facilitated performance. A characteristic increasing relationship between aptitude and success in technical training was found. (Technical specifications and data tables are appended.) (YLB)",

Because business education on the secondary level deals in part with numbers, measurement, word processing, and transfer of data by electronic means, it invites computer-aided instruction (CAI) and computer-managed instruction (CMI). The first requirement for the introduction of CAI is to develop teacher understanding of the computer. Higher education, inservice courses, and training programs are needed in keyboarding, word processing, spreadsheet, and database management. What is business education doing regarding use of microcomputers? It is not emphasizing the need for good keyboarding competence; it is neglecting English language instruction; it uses software designed for business  as courseware. Business education needs are development of computer-assisted diagnostic (CAD) and prescriptive instruction (PI) and courseware that contains teacher management programs. The leaders in business education need to design a new curriculum to reflect the infusion of the microcomputer. New course titles and outlines are needed. Courseware needs to be developed to incorporate CAD, PI, and teacher management programs, and teachers need to be retrained in the use of the microcomputer and its appropriate courseware. (YLB)",

Cooperating teachers and student teachers also rated the performance of university supervisors in supervision of student teachers, and university supervisors and student teachers rated the performance of cooperating teachers. Data were collected by mailed questionnaires, face-to-face interviews, and telephone interviews. All but two experiences expected during student teaching were considered essential, and the student teachers were perceived to be adequately prepared to teach. All assignments  were rated desirable except two that were rated essential. A majority of the assignments were rated as satisfactorily accomplished. Generally rated as above average, university supervisors needed more emphasis on prior evaluation of student teachers' lesson plans and service as a resource person for cooperating teachers. Cooperating teachers needed greater emphasis on feedback on lesson plans prior to teaching, evaluation of student teacher's performance, and provision for experience in adult and/or continuing education and supervised occupational experience visits. Better preparation of cooperating teachers and changes in assignments were recommended. (YLB)",

All thirteen of the math concepts examined in the study were consistently regarded as being of greater-than-average importance to students studying in vocational agricultural programs. The math and vocational teachers' responses provided significantly higher mean scores than did the students' and parents' responses. Based on the responses of the study participants,  recommendations were made calling for the following actions: inclusion of all 13 math concepts as part of the instructional program for vocational agriculture, with special emphasis on converting units of measure and on the use of whole numbers; recognition on the part of educators of the need to incorporate applied math concepts into the vocational agricultural course of study; and reliance upon mathematics teachers as a source of assistance for agricultural educators who are developing agricultural teaching materials and lesson plans incorporating applied math concepts.

First, the United States has helped create a world of open trade, and it is competing with underdeveloped countries who have an opportunity to industrialize very rapidly. Second, technological development is proceeding at a fast pace. High-wage industries in the United States, the Western industrial nations, and Japan will have to find profitable enterprises other than manufacturing because of the low-wage workers in the developing world. Economic opportunities need to be found in which American companies can do well enough to sustain present wage levels. The United States must cultivate or develop enough industries that are so technically advanced that they create near monopolies. Technical competence  must first be enhanced greatly at the highest scientific level in the universities. Then, vocational and technical education must be delivered early, in the grade schools, high schools, and two-year postsecondary institutions. This recommendation requires finding funds to acquire expensive equipment, to change the curriculum, and to hire people who can deliver technical instruction.

Apprentices receive training in small laboratories or workshops from a master, in larger companies from a special trainer, or in state or private workshops. Besides this job-oriented education, apprentices attend courses in vocational schools. Research in vocational education and work life in Switzerland is addressing these topics: vocational/professional education, adult education, education for special groups, humanization of work, technological change, unemployment, and new models for vocational education. The Swiss National Research Program focuses on three broad areas in vocational education. Research on personality development includes a learning-to-learn project for apprentices with  learning problems or disabilities, a longitudinal study of apprentices, and projects to develop methods to help apprentices cope with transition from school to apprenticeship. Research projects on the organization of vocational/professional education seek to improve teachers' training, to characterize the needs of individuals who try to change their professional activities, and to elaborate and evaluate a curriculum for education in elementary economics. Research on transitions includes projects on homemakers' reentry, technological and organizational changes that influence work, and counseling for farm families.

        "description":"Education is constantly criticized for its &quot;failures&quot;--its &quot;failure&quot; to produce literate graduates, its &quot;failure&quot; to prepare students for the jobs of future technology, and its &quot;failure&quot; to reduce unemployment and establish equity for all students. However, these &quot;failures&quot; are not solely those of the schools, but of the larger society--a problem of the home, the schools, the corporations, and the government together. One criticism that has been leveled at vocational education is that it is too narrow; yet knowledge, skills, and attitudes, regardless of where they have been acquired, are not automatically transferred to other settings. Training must occur where the skills will be actually applied in order to be effective. However, such approaches can be expensive and difficult to  implement. In order to serve students better, high schools should eliminate vocational tracking and provide both academic and vocational training for all students. Other factors that would enhance students' educational experiences would be changing courses to improve transferability of outcomes and acquiring better teachers and facilities through increased allocation of funding to schools. However, the schools cannot do it all. Home, school, work, and social groups must become true learning communities where youth have ready access to adult expertise, share their successes and failures, and where everyone has a proprietary interest in what goes on. These goals will not be easy to achieve, but they provide a vision toward which we can strive. (KC)",

        "description":"While many aspects of high technology may be directly applicable in the vocational agricultural classroom, the primary thrust of high technology into such programs, at least in the short range, will be centered around the microcomputer. Because of its cost and availability, the microcomputer will continue to play an ever increasing role in vocational agricultural programs in such areas as program administration, guidance, computer-managed instruction, and computer-assisted instruction. In addition, the microcomputer will become an increasingly important occupational tool that can be used in courses in word processing, computer literacy, computer programming, and data processing. As it is for educators in other fields, the microcomputer is a valuable resource that can help  vocational agricultural teachers improve their teaching. The most important application of the microcomputer in vocational agriculture is, however, in teaching students how they will use microcomputers in their jobs. One such relevant use of microcomputers is in the area of numerical analysis. A large variety of farm management and agricultural business management software packages are already available. The occupational aspects of the microcomputer in secondary level agricultural education are practically limitless.

        "description":"An exploratory study examined influences on secondary and postsecondary vocational and technical student time on task. In conducting the study, researchers recorded minute-by-minute observations of the interactions of 152 secondary students and their teachers and 328 postsecondary students and their teachers in a total of 25 classes that were located in an inner city, its adjoining suburb, and a midsized urban site. An analysis of the data collected during these observations revealed that the secondary students spent 71.4 percent of their time on task, whereas the overall proportion of time spent on task at the postsecondary level was 83.5 percent. The most important teacher behavior relating to student time on task was goal definition. Included among the other teacher-related  variables that were closely related to student time on task were planning and organizing, deliberate maximizing of available time, using appropriate teaching methods, and modeling the work ethic. Student grouping turned out to be the most important classroom variable. Based on these findings, recommendations were made for teachers to define goals clearly, consider time an important resource, ensure that students' tasks are meaningful, encourage student independence, and have positive expectations of students.

The challenge of training and retraining must be met by a partnership of the governmental, business, and educational sectors. A federal leadership role is crucial in guiding allocation of vocational education resources, establishing standards of excellence, and devising coordinated national strategies to meet the long-term skill development needs of the nation. The federal role should be to stimulate targeted efforts to enhance quality and improve equipment and facilities; keep curricula and personnel up to date; serve special populations; eliminate sex bias; and increase cooperation between business, industry,  education, and other training programs. In addition to a strong federal role, reauthorization legislation should emphasize flexibility in regulations; planning and evaluation; the determination of resource allocation at the state level; the concept of sole state agency; and autonomous national, state, and local advisory councils for vocational education.

To examine the procedural-distributive justice distinction as it relates to organizatonal behavior in terms of job satisfaction, conflict, evaluation of supervisor, trust in management, turnover intention, and stress, 2,822 federal government employees (55 percent female, 77 percent white, mean age 41.1) completed a seven-point Likert questionnaire assesing their perceptions of a major reform in the civil service procedures and traditional aspects of the work site. An analysis of the results showed that perceived fairness in  the workplace was significantly related to organizational outcomes. Both procedural and distributive justice measures significantly related to job satisfaction, evaluation of supervisor, conflict/harmony, trust in management, and turnover intention. Procedural justice accounted for significantly more variance than distributive justice for four of the five dependent measures. Only in turnover intention did distributive justice account for more variance than procedural justice. (BL)",

To investigate the relationship between clients' homework compliance and therapists' and clients' behaviors during therapy sessions and clients' intrasession tension and satisfaction, the marital and family therapy sessions of 24 nuclear families were audiotaped for a 10 week-period. Tapes were analyzed for therapist behaviors (clarification, interpretation, relationship emphasis, education, encouragement of affective expression, control, encouragement of specificity and clarity, and style) and client behaviors (emergency and welfare emotions, task orientation, blame, mutuality, clarity and specificity, and tone of  communication). Therapists kept records of homework completion and carried out midweek telephone interviews to assess family tension and satisfaction. An analysis of the results showed that several therapist and client session behaviors correlated with homework completion in the beginning phase of treatment. Homework completion was positively correlated with therapist educational behaviors and negatively correlated with clients' expressions of anger, stress, and blame. Although marital tension negatively correlated with homework completion in the beginning phase, in the middle phase homework completion and marital tension were postively correlated, suggesting that a certain amount of tension is needed to maintain motivation.

        "description":"The role of autonomic arousal in feeling states has long been of interest to psychologists. To examine the necessity of arousal for an effective mood induction, 60 college students were instructed either to exercise vigorously (high arousal group), exercise lightly with a rest period (low arousal group), or complete a questionnaire (no arousal group). Half of each group read either a sad or a neutral story, and either concentrated on the passage or simply waited. Although it was predicted that highly aroused subjects (via exercise) who had to concentrate on a sad story would report a significant increase and persistence in sad mood, results indicated that sadness seemed to be inhibited by exercise. Subjects in the high arousal group reported themselves to be less sad than  subjects in the low arousal group, who, in turn, were less sad than the no arousal group. An alternate hypothesis suggests that a persistence of sadness over time is a function of increased intensity of arousal. A mood induction without arousal may be effective but not as persistent as one including arousal. Prolonging transient mood states would provide a more reliable opportunity to study the phenomenon of mood. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"The field of education has largely ignored the concept of the dialectic, except in the Socratic teaching method, and even there bipolar meaning or reasoning has not been recognized. Mainstream educational psychology bases its assumptions about human reasoning and learning on current demonstrative concepts of information processing and levels of processing. Three current strategies based on these assumptions are serial listing of facts or topics; cause/effect relationships; and problem/solution methods. Research has shown that recall of prose passages is significantly greater with dialectical (or opposing points of view) methods compared to the other three learning strategies. Individual differences in the use of dialectical methods represent production deficiencies rather than  lack of capacity. If metacognition, the process of knowing about knowing, is to be a viable concept, it must transcend cognition, i.e., be &quot;otherwise&quot;. Metacognitive capacities therefore imply dialetical rather than demonstrative reasoning. Studies of learning disabled students have shown that such students evidenced deficits in this metaknowledge (knowing when one knows) relative to regular students. Future research may show that the conceptualization problems of the learning disabled are related to the lack of use of dialectical reasoning. (MCF)",

Employees completed the Bases of Managerial Power Questionnaire and subsections of the Psychological Climate Questionnaire, while managers completed the Rated Employee Performance. An  analysis of the results showed that relationships between managerial power and employee performance were positive and stronger under poor job climate conditions.

However, the analysis of 30 community-based residential programs in six metropolitan areas found that the community-based model of services is still a relatively untried experiment due in part to the lack of clarity in defining conceptual goals and organizational needs. Conceptually, community-based programs were designed to enhance community integration of delinquent youths and to facilitate family involvement. Economic, legal and community resistance factors have limited the effectiveness of these conceptual goals. The use of community resources tends to be limited to medical, police, social, and free  recreational services. Family involvement is absent, largely due to the limited avenues of involvement provided by the programs. From an organizational perspective, community-based programs suffer from fiscal difficulties, lack of control in placement decision making, high staff burnout and turnover, and low staff morale. Rather than furthering development of an alternative, community-based model, the adaptive mechanisms available to ensure survival have pushed these programs closer to the self-contained correctional model.

To investigate the cost effectiveness and ultimate influence on family intactness of home-based family crisis intervention, 77 low income, inner city families with an adolescent child at risk of placement into formal substitute care participated in a family intervention program for 8 to 10 weeks under one of three treatment modes: in home crisis intervention (IHC); IHC combined with didactic skill training; and IHC combined with a network approach. IHC is a generic brief therapy emphasizing structural family therapy, building parenting skills, exploring problem solving approaches, and improving family interaction patterns. Skill  training involved communication, self-care, and stress management. The network mode helped families coordinate their existing support systems or helped them build support systems. Demographic, pre-post therapy information, and follow-up data were collected on all participants. An analysis of the results showed that at termination of treatment 88 percent of the families were intact, representing a savings of one half million dollars in public funds. The IHC network approach was most effective, accounting for the smallest percentage of out-of-home placements. However, the network approach was the most difficult to implement due to the threatening nature of outside involvement and the lack of counselor control over the client and his network. (BL)",

Poetry therapists tend to follow either the strucutred approach of Leedy, in which poems are used as treatment, or the less structured approach of Lerner, in which poems are used as medium. Music, like poetry, also has been used in both structured and less structured ways, to help clients express their feelings through others' music or their own combinations, and to help the therapist express his perceptions of the client. In group and family counseling, the combination of poetry and music can facilitate the counseling process by providing a nonthreatening vehicle for cognitive and affective expression. Two techniques which have  been effective are reading a poem and inviting reactions, and creating collaborative poems. As in using any therapeutic tool, caution in regard to timing and appropriateness is necessary to ensure beneficial results. Limitations include a perception of the technique as academic and intellectual. On the positive side, poetry and music can help break defenses and expose material that may be overwhelming to the client at first. (A list of references is appended). (BL)",

        "author":["Jones, James M."],
        "description":"From its beginning, the United States has been a multiracial society, and from the beginning relations between and among the races have been strained by cultural, economic, social, political, and psychological conflicts. Social psychology came of age in the early 1900's as a disciplined inquiry into the psycho-social problems of the people, and central among them was the matter of race. The concept of race was intimately associated with the basic question of the nature of man. A review of the literature of Darwin, Binet, Terman, and the British Utilitarians shows that those who argued the question of social engineering for the betterment of society failed to appreciate the basic principle of the evolutionary theory, namely, that species survival was based on adaptibility enhanced  by variability and diversity. Race continued to be a vital concept in the foundations of social psychology as the genetic interpretation of human motivation and performance gave way to an environmental one. In more recent times, social psychology has begun to lose interest in the concept. This process can be roughly divided into 25-year cycles: (1) bio-eugenic origins and racial/cultural differences (1900-1925); (2) socio-cultural influences and socio-political action, the Negro problem (1926-1955); and (3) social integration and experimental control, diverging paths in social psychology (1955-1983). Currently the concept of race appears to be diminishing in importance as an experimental variable, a social/moral problem, and a theoretical concept. Yet social psychology has failed to  present a rounded, integrated view of the complex interactions of individual and normative factors in human behavior. The developent of a fully conceived, researched, and applied concept of race would make a great contribution to the maturity and significance of social psychology. (JAC)",

        "description":"Relationship dissolution is generally examined within the context of romantic involvement but rarely from the standpoint of friendship. To examine patterns of friendship dissolution in young adults, retrospective accounts of recently terminated or deteriorated same-sex friendships and changes in friendship networks over the last 5 years were examined for 155 college students. Four patterns of friendship dissolution were identified: physical separation, new friends replace old, growing to dislike the friend, and interference from dating or marriage. The transition to college resulted in a higher rate of deteriorated friendships than was evident during the high school years, particularly for women. Significant gender differences in patterns of termination were also found; physical  separation was more likely to precipitate dissolution in men's friendships, and dating or marriage were more likely to interfere with women's. In addition, women assumed significantly more responsibility for the termination than men. The findings suggest that previous experience with long distance or absent friends is a factor which should be considered when exploring termination patterns. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Previous research on friendship selection has failed to focus on how the selection process changes with age or in differently organized environments. This review of the literature takes a life-course perspective on the selection of friends, charting research results on three aspects of the selection process: (1) the number of friends and their proximity; (2) the visible features of friends such as age, sex, and race; and (3) characteristics of friendships and similarity of friends. Over 250 references were reviewed to examine how selection patterns change with age and under different environmental settings from preschool to postsecondary school settings. The results revealed important developmental patterns. With age and the development of cognitive skills and experiences, older  students tend to choose fewer best friends, make choices from wider boundaries, increase cross-sex choices, decrease cross-race choices, move toward mixed-age choices, reciprocate and stabilize friendships, and choose more similar friends. There were also important environmental effects on the choice of friends. For example, elementary, junior high, and high schools may be organized to reward or to ignore or punish cross-race or mixed-age choices of friends; or to emphasize differences or similarities among students. These and other environmental conditions affect selection in ways that revise expected patterns of choosing friends. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Short-term therapy is effective by focusing the therapy and employing an interactive style. However, the imposition of an arbitrary termination date appears to be an overreaction and overcorrection to drawbacks of classical psychotherapy. According to Mann, a proponent of termination dates and short-term therapy, the setting of a termination date forces clients to confront their separation anxiety and to deal with a dependent nature. However, arbitrary termination dates are unbeneficial, unnecessary, and counterproductive in that they provide negative experiences in dealing with arbitrary authority and reinforce cultural prejudices against dependent feelings. To deal with difficulties produced by the arbitrary termination date, Mann excludes clients with strong dependent longings  and discourages the client's arguments by taking an authoritative stance. Contrary to other beliefs, most clients gravitate toward short-term therapy, choosing to focus on and talk directly about their presenting problems. (BL)",

        "description":"The literature of antonymy, though disjointed and inconclusive, has found that opposition is important to development, learning, psychological health, and creativity. To investigate the role of dialectics in cognitive processes and human learning, four empirical studies were undertaken. In study one, to investigate the dialectic process in affective assessment, subjects learned opposite and same word associations that had been paired for liked and disliked words. An analysis of the results showed that both the same and opposite groups showed a positive reinforcement value effect. In the second study, to investigate the relational ties between items, the previously used paired associations were modified to link nonsense syllables with four affirmations. High school and college  subjects learned four affirmations for each of two root nonsense syllables. The results showed that both opposite and positive strategies facilitated learning. In the college sample, opposition was significantly more facilitative than all other strategies. In the third study, to investigate the linear quality of demonstrative reasoning, subjects learned triads of nonsense syllables from the middle range of associative strength. As in the other studies, a dialectical, oppositional strategy enhanced learning even in the absence of real semantic meanings. In the fourth study, an incidental learning paradigm using real words replaced the paired associate paradigm. Subjects learned the words intentionally or as part of an affective/nonaffective semantic task. The results showed that antonym  pairs were recalled much better by the two semantic task groups. This research demonstrates the validity of investigating the dialectic construct and challenges the traditional associationistic and cognitive models of modern psychology. (BL)",

        "description":"Group treatment based on cognitive-behavioral and social problem solving strategies has been found to produce significant improvement in aggressive children. To investigate the association between clients' initial behavioral and subjective characteristics and the degree of improvement displayed on behavioral measures over the treatment period, 76 fourth, fifth, and sixth grade boys, identified by their teachers as aggressive, were assigned to one of four treatment groups: cognitive behavioral (CB), goal setting (GS), CB plus GS (CBGS), and a no treatment condition (NT). The CB treatment consisted of 12 weekly group sessions which focused on the development of interpersonal, cognitive, and problem solving skills and on inhibiting self-statements. In the GS condition, boys  identified weekly classroom behavioral goals which were monitored by teachers and reinforced in group meetings. To measure behavioral change, both teacher and parental ratings of aggression and measures of self-esteem, socioeconomic status and problem solving skills were collected. An analysis of the results showed that in both cognitive behavioral conditions, greater reduction in rates of disruptive-aggressive off-task classroom behavior was predicted by having higher rates of these behaviors initially. Greater reduction in parents' ratings of aggression was predicted by having poor social problem-solving skills initially. Additional predictors of reductions in parents' ratings of aggression in one, but not both, cognitive behavioral conditions included having higher rates of somatic  symptoms and poorer social acceptance by peers. Improvement within the goal setting condition was most evident in those boys who had initially poorer self-esteem. Boys in the NT condition who demonstrated the greatest spontaneous improvement on these change measures were the ones who initally were the best problem-solvers and who had higher levels of self-esteem. The cognitive behavioral conditions appeared to have most impact with those boys who were the most in need of intervention. (Author/BL)",

        "description":"Recent research on teachers' expectations has begun to explore the factors underlying the link between expectations and performance. To investigate the relationship between the affective responses of teachers and students' attributions regarding effort versus ability, 130 college students (66 male, 64 female) were instructed in solving anagrams and subsequently solved three out of five anagrams. Upon completing the test, each subject received one of seven affective responses to his performance from the instructor: anger, pity, relief, positive surprise, negative surprise, pride, or no emotion. The subjects then completed an attribution questionnaire. An analysis of the results showed that emotional responses produced greater effort and ability attributions than did no emotion.  Responses containing positive emotions or positive feedback led to significantly greater effort attributions than responses containing negative emotions or negative feedback. The element of surprise in emotion reduced perceptions of effort attributions and also resulted in greater attributions to ability. Future research should focus on the impact on affect-attribution links of self versus teacher perceptions, various cultural and ethnic group memberships, and situational and contextual factors.

        "description":"Although the rate of divorce among older Americans has increased steadily, little attention has been paid to late life divorce. To describe the role of age and other factors which might influence adjustment to divorce in later life, data from a larger pilot study were used: 81 divorced persons over the age of 60 completed in-depth, structured interviews; and data were collected from records of 240 individuals filing for divorce, in which one of the spouses was over 60. Results showed that divorcing older adults shared many characteristics with younger divorcing persons, e.g., low occupational status, few assets, weak religious ties, urban residence, weak kinship ties, and early marriage. The cause often given for divorce was lack of emotional gratification, generally precipitated  by a particular stressful event. Although women were more likely than men to rate their marriage as of low quality, they reacted more negatively to the idea of divorce. Men were less successful than women in post-divorce adjustment. A divorce adjustment model developed to predict low post-divorce adjustment suggests a set of relationships between five predictor variables: anticipated cost, divorce experience, consequences, time, and sex. Sex, type of divorce experience, and overall consequences accounted for over half the variance in post-divorce adjustment scores. The findings sugggest that without the roles of wife and mother, older divorced women are ill-prepared emotionally, socially or financially to adapt to divorce. (JAC)",

To assess the major determinants of successful divorce negotiations between divorcing spouses and their lawyers, 90 recent divorcees completed a 14 page Divorce Settlement Experience Questionnaire (DSEQ). In addition, interviews were conducted with 14 of the subjects who represented six of the best and eight of the worst divorce outcomes. The DSEQ assessed 18 separate predictor variables. Both the DSEQ and the interview surveyed the same major areas, including characteristics of the spouses and their relationship, the role of lawyers,  and the quality of the divorce outcomes. A cooperative negotiating orientation by both the parties and their attorneys, resource availability, and client involvement in the negotiations were consistently associated with successful outcomes. Respondent dissatisfaction was most strongly associated with clients who viewed their emotional well-being as poor, clients who did not feel confident or knowledgeable during the settlement process, couples who were apprehensive about communicating with each other or had major differences over settlement terms, and lawyers who did not have a counselor orientation. Subjects with poor outcomes and a third of the good outcome cases were dissatisfied with the present legal system and often with the nature of their relationship with their lawyers. Several  respondents advocated some form of mediation as an alternative to the present adversarial system. (JAC)",

Research strategies for studying whole persons focus on symbolic structures, formulate specific questions in advance, study persons one at a time, use individualized measures, and regard participants as expert consultants. Two such techniques, Q-technique and the role repertory test, were used in a study of two college students with spinal cord injuries. Specific questions focused on a stage model of adjustment, the necessity of mourning loss prior to disability acceptance, and the manner in which values theorized to define disability acceptance change across time. A variation of the Critical Incident Technique was used to obtain descriptions of  course-of-life landmarks. Both subjects used a 48-item Q sort to describe typical and ideal selves at each landmark episode; the role repertory technique was used to determine significant persons and the constructs defined by their roles. Factor analysis of the Q sortings showed distinctly different ways of adjusting to a major life disruption. The results enhance the sophistication of the stage model of adaptation as applied to individuals, and build on existing methods to enhance the systematic understanding of individuals. (JAC)",

        "description":"Since the late 1960's, researchers have been concerned with the influence of teacher expectations on student performance. Teacher expectations generally can be categorized into three types: assessments of ability, predictions of progress, and natural discrepancies between teacher estimates and actual student performance. Expectations can have the effect of self-fulfilling prophecy or of sustaining expected performance levels. In a 1978 survey of the literature, 112 studies were found which investigated teacher expectations; 40 percent of those studies found significant support for the existence of teacher expectation effects. These expectations are communicated in the classroom through student and teacher interactions in the form of socioemotional atmospheres, verbal input,  verbal output, and feedback. In general, brighter students tend to receive more feedback and teacher interaction time than less bright students, resulting in the likelihood of sustaining expectation effects. According to the Expectation Communication Model (Cooper, 1979), teachers' expectations and the context of an interaction influence teachers' feelings of control over student performance. Teachers generally feel in control over high expectation students and over self-initiated interactions. Current research is focusing on the role of student thoughts in the communication process and the role of teachers' individual differences in expectation communication. (BL)",

To investigate the long term care system, its characteristics, trends, financing, policies, availability, and quality of care, 700 health care professionals, patients, families, social workers, state officials, and advocates from eleven states participated in discussions. The results of those discussions showed that long term care is not a program, but an assortment of government and private efforts to meet the needs of chronically ill or disabled people. However, although no explicit public policy exists, in 1980 long term care cost $32 billion in federal, state, and private funds. Families  remain the primary provider of health care, with institutional care seen as a last resort. With the decline in Medicaid and Title XX funds, reimbursement is the foremost concern of program administrators. The quality of care directly relates to reimbursement, with nursing home care generally considered to be good. Concern about privacy, independence, food, and personal attention outweigh medical and hygiene concerns. Staffing problems are widespread along the health care continuum, with disenchantment about nursing home licensing and certification very high. Placement decisions based on discharge objectives rather than long term planning are a continuing source of concern for both families and professionals. (BL)",

Results showed that, as predicted, psychotherapy clients who were more accepting of the medical model reported higher  initial expectancies for therapeutic gain, controlling for the value of making those gains, and terminated prematurely from treatment more often. Paradoxically, they were rated by their therapists as making more active attempts to address their problems both in and outside of treatment sessions. Clients who were more accepting of a responsibility/control orientation were judged as making less active attempts to address their emotional problems and as more dependent on their therapists; some discussion is given to this unexpected observation. The findings suggest that clinicians need to be sensitive to their patients' mental health ideology. (JAC)",

Statistics from the 1980 census are presented which show that 19.7 percent of children under 18 live with a single parent, who in the overwhelming number of cases is the mother. The document presents data on the economic problems, causes, and adjustment issues surrounding divorce. The impact of divorce on children is discussed as well as the particular needs of single parent families stemming from the dissolution of the marriage and the setting up of a new lifestyle. Areas of strain to the mother and to the father are identified. Problems inherent in remarriage are reviewed and intervention strategies are suggested. The helping role of society  is explored in the areas of legal services, custody laws, conciliation counseling, mediation counseling, personal counseling, and school programs. References and an annotated bibliography from the computer search of the ERIC database complete the document. (BL)",

To investigate the effect of teachers' locus of control and their expectations of their own effectiveness on student success, 77 female college students enrolled in undergraduate psychology classes were administered the Rotter Locus of Control Scale; subjects scoring in the upper and lower one third of the distribution were then assigned to one of four treatment conditions: positive/negative student expectation or positive/negative teacher expectation. They were then assigned as teachers in a contrived session in which each teacher taught a student confederate an eleven-word vocabulary  list and administered a quiz. After the lesson, teachers rated their attitudes toward the student, the lesson, and their performance. An analysis of the results showed that teachers in the positive student expectation group rated the student as having more ability than did those in the negative condition; and teachers in the positive teacher expectation condition thought they had significantly more ability than those in the negative teacher condition. Teachers in the positive teacher expectation condition also tended to rate their students more positively. Subjects with an internal locus of control were more susceptible to information about their students' competence than were subjects with an external locus of control. Neither internal nor external locus of control subjects showed any  susceptibility to information about their own expected ability. (BL)",

Although few stereotypes or generalizations apply to this population, older citizens still suffer from a societal attitude of agism. Studies on aging have demonstrated that chronological age does not predict physical condition or behavior. In fact, the current generation of older Americans are better educated, more economically independent, and are in better health than any previous generation. However, studies have shown that older citizens are concerned about their safety, identity, stimulation, transportation, and physical exercise. Research has found lifestyle to be the best correlate of health, exercise, and vigor. The Alliance Committee on Aging, begun in 1974, is devoted to expanding and initiating  professional preparation programs in health, physical education, recreation, and dance for service to the older population. Emphasis is placed on human movement, values, and stress management as life enhancing goals for older citizens. The Alliance publishes program directories and is instrumental in advocating guidelines, standards, and professional certification. (Guidelines for Exercise Programs for Older Persons is appended.)

To investigate parenting satisfaction and parental role responsibilities among employed parents, 166 Austin, Texas adults (98 female, 68 male) from dual earner families were interviewed in a door-to-door survey of preselected census tracts (to insure an ethnically representative sample). The survey collected data on parenting satisfaction, preferred parenting responsibility, preferred community-based resources, and demographic information. An analysis of the results showed that parents were moderately satisfied with themselves as parents but not particularly satisifed with the care offered by community-based  resources. Child-rearing was viewed as the purview of parents, with most of the responsibility apportioned to parents themselves, with the exceptions of teaching cognitive skills and physical health. Both spouses held conventional views about parenting but more egalitarian views about the allocation of role responsibilities within the family unit. Females reported higher parenting satisfaction and lower spouse satisfaction than males, and higher preferred parenting responsibility and lower preferred spouse responsibility. Work orientation and ethnicity were not differentiating variables. (BL)",

Two separate renalayses were completed in the present study, the first using cloze-comprehension correlations as a dependent measure and the second using correlations of cloze with each of the Bormuth question catagories--vocabulary, factual recall, sequential order, cause and effect, inference, and author's purpose--at each grade level. Results indicated that in both reanalyses, variable reliability and grade level differences accounted for some of the variation in correlations. The proportion of  comprehension test questions found to assess within-sentence information was found to be significant in the first regression analysis but not in the second. Results suggested that the limited construct validity of cloze as a measure of comprehension had a small but significant influence on the concurrent validity of cloze with measures of comprehension. Cloze predicted performance best when within-sentence comprehension dominated, but was less useful when students were expected to integrate information across sentence boundaries. (MM)",

Reasons for the project's success included the administration's commitment, parental support, and the  continuity and structure that the instructional model gave to a system with a high staff turnover rate. Evaluations conducted by a variety of sources indicated that P.S. 137 students' achievement scores compared favorably with students from similar backgrounds.

The evaluation results indicated that interdisciplinary staff development seminars can be beneficial to faculty from varied content areas. Recommendations developing from this seminar relative to the teaching of special students include the following: (1) the ultimate responsibility for teaching special students should be left to academic departments rather than nonacademic or service level agencies within the university; (2) basic reading-study achievement levels of all special students should be evaluated on entrance, interim, and exit bases; (3) faculty interested in  developing and maintaining instructional programs for special students should be identified and organized; and (4) specialized staff development seminars should be available to all departments within the university. The efficient utilization of available faculty expertise is essential if colleges are to develop inexpensive staff development programs. (MM)",

        "description":"Questioning strategies, whether teacher- or student-generated, can be a major tool in developing reading comprehension. Teachers can maximize the benefits of teacher directed questioning by (1) providing clues before providing answers to questions, (2) acknowledging appropriate responses with two or three seconds of eye contact, (3) allowing students to formulate several answers and then choose the best response, (4) using joint responses through a show of hands or finger signals, (5) allowing students five to seven seconds to answer questions, and (6) using the chalkboard or question cards to show questions and possible answers. Teachers can use these procedures in conjunction with such teacher directed strategies as the Question Answer Relationship (QAR). By accompanying  questions with the phrases &quot;right there,&quot;&quot;think and search,&quot; or &quot;on your own,&quot; teachers let students know whether they are asking a detail, an interpretive, or a critical thinking question. Student generated questioning strategies include ReQuest, based on student questioning of teachers for pertinent information, and SQ3R, in which students first survey and ask themselves questions about reading material, then read the passages and recite the answers to their questions. A final self-directed questioning method is called Structured Comprehension, which trains students to ask questions to ensure their comprehension of each sentence. (MM)",

Twelve storybooks were read to 41 preschool children during a two-week period preceding interviews. During the interviews, each child was asked to &quot;read&quot; a favorite storybook aloud to a stuffed animal and to the examiner. In 11 cases in which the child did not respond to this initial prompt, additional encouragements were given by the examiner, including reading the story aloud with the child. The videotaped interviews were examined for features thought to be related to knowledge about written language and reading. Preliminary analysis of the assisted storybook interactions indicated a variety of responses. Some children responded only nonverbally, for example,  by pointing to the picture. In contrast, other children became very involved verbally, recreating the story with adult assistance. Storybook interactions also varied in the type of language the children used. The responses of some children reflected oral language, containing conversational characteristics, while others resembled written language and contained fragments of the exact wording of the text. During further analysis of the assisted storybook interactions, responses appeared to fall into five categories: nonverbal, conversational, semantically equivalent, echo-like, and verbatim-like.

        "description":"In the study of perception during reading, the use of eye movement contingent control of the stimulus display has proved to be a useful research technique. With such a system, it is possible to experimentally manipulate, in real time, the characteristics of the stimulus display that is present on selected fixations as reading is in progress and to observe the effects of the manipulation on the eye movement pattern. The technique has been used in a situation where the display must be changed during the period of a saccadic eye movement and when it was necessary to make a change at some time after the beginning of a fixation. Among the instrumentation concerns that are important to consider when setting up a system to do this type of research are the following: (1) the eye movement  equipment must have fast throughput and low noise, and yield new information with high frequency; (2) the program must sample the eye position with a high frequency, detect saccade onset and make the decision about whether to initiate a display change as early as the study permits, and minimize the amount of computation involved in changing the image; and (3) the display device must be capable of being rapidly refreshed and of initiating the presentation of a new image part way through the refresh cycle.

The paper first traces the historical antecedents of schema theory, then outlines its basic elements, pointing out problems with current realizations of the theory and possible solutions. Following a consideration of the interplay between the abstracted knowledge embodied in schemata and memory for particular examples, it \"decomposes\" the comprehension process in order to examine components of encoding (attention, instantiation, and inference) and retrieval (retrieval plans, editing and summarizing, and  reconstructive processes). In conclusion, the paper evaluates the contributions of schema theory to the understanding of the comprehension process and speculates on the directions future research should take. (FL)",

The test, utilizing stories from the WISC-R picture arrangement task, was then employed in a developmental investigation with second, fifth, and eighth grade students. Each student completed the WISC-R arrangement task in its usual form in one session and ranked main idea alternatives associated with the picture stories in a second. In addition, a standardized measure of reading comprehension was available for most students. Results showed a clear improvement across the grades in children's ability to select the best topic statement for the picture stories. The high consensus alternative, which abstracted the main action sequence, was perceived as  best. The single picture alternative, which stated a specific action tied to one picture in the sequence, was perceived as second best. The setting alternative, which described some feature of the story's context or background, was perceived as the third best alternative. The wrong alternative, which stated an action inappropriate to the story, was perceived as the worst alternative. Developmentally, the younger children seemed to have more difficulty appreciating or detecting the &quot;completeness&quot; of action stated in the alternative and using such a criterion to discriminate the quality of the topic statement.

In the first experiment, 20 second and 20 fourth grade students listened to stories that contained a helpful (unique) or unhelpful (nonunique) clue and then drew inferences. In the second experiment, 28 third and 28 fourth grade students listened to stories with clues that varied as in the first experiment.

Subjects were 422 adults in three age groups--young (18-28 years), middle (40-54), and older (62-80). They were asked to read and recall in writing two 388-word prose passages and to answer questions about their background reading habits and recall strategies. The results indicated that while increasing age was associated with a decrease in recall, both verbal ability and education were better predictors of recall than was age. In addition, a recall strategy factor representing \"paragraph by paragraph\" retrieval produced the highest simple correlations with total recall and contributed significantly to the explanation of other  recall measures. Reading habit factors associated with recall reflected subjects' self-assessment as good and frequent readers as well as their need to know information. The reading and recall strategy factors proved to be better predictors of recall than the reading habit factors. While the findings confirmed the expectation that more practiced readers will recall more, the results also made it possible to refine understanding of the relationship between recall and reading experience. They also suggested that training in the use of reading and recall strategies may be used to improve recall in all age groups. (Extensive tables of data are appended.) (HTH)",

This phenomenon--sometimes referred to as natural literacy development--is not, in the strictest sense, natural; as the adult presents much of the literacy environment to the child in a socialized, mediated form, teaching is also involved. The implications for literacy development in early childhood are that a child is not given a preexisting literacy environment, but is actively involved in creating his or her literacy environment. The child's initiations, temperament, questions, and other actions or qualities actually affect the nature and frequency of literacy mediated activities occurring in the child's environment. To determine what role the child's  environment plays on literacy development, future research should carefully document (1) what information is in the environment for the child to assimilate, (2) how finely tuned the environment is to the child's development, and (3) what strategies the child develops over time for dealing with written language.

Taylor spent most of his productive years studying time and motion in an attempt to streamline industrial production so that people could work as quickly and efficiently as possible. Education embraced most of Taylor's principles in the early 1900s, and journal articles of the period have documented the extensive influence of this &quot;Cult of Efficiency&quot; on the thinking of educational leaders. It is more than coincidental that standardized tests in subject areas first appeared around 1910, when Taylor and his educational followers were most vocal. The essay test was also replaced with objective  tests that took little time to complete and less time to grade. Speed and factual recall, rather than critical comprehension, continue to represent the two most widely tested aspects of reading, although research has confirmed that speed is not an ample measure of reading ability. The question that must concern today's educators is whether the back to basics/competency testing movement is a return to that philosophy of efficiency. (HTH)",

        "description":"A variety of sources, including writing samples and videotapes of writing sessions, were examined to determine what speech events underlie the written compositions of students from fourth through twelfth grades. Findings revealed a correlation between different levels of writing competency and four types of speech events: encoding, conversation, presentation, and ritual. Typically, students based their early written work on the simplest form of communication behavior--encoding, which concentrates on processing letters, words, and phrases. Once they had mastered encoding, students began to model their writing on the more complex speech events of conversations and presentations, both establishing a close relationship between the speaker-writer and the reader through  conversationally structured writing and creating a greater distance between the two through presentations. The most advanced students used ritual, invoking authority through modeling devices such as footnotes and references. Awareness of the underlying rhetorical situations in student compositions can help teachers develop writing programs sensitive to students' developing abilities. (MM)",

        "description":"To do academic work, basic writers must know how to use the forms that express mature thinking. Accustomed to the demands of speech, basic writers often rely on unspecified context to relate ideas, thus failing to establish the connections evident in well-developed thought. While able to use certain cohesive ties such as repetitions, demonstratives, and associated terms, basic writers are less skillful with such manipulative ties as developing a comparison or contrast through contrastive conjuncts. In other words, they are less able to form their thoughts into extended rhetorical patterns. To help them learn to use the forms that express complex relationships, teachers might first direct students to sharpen their vague communicative purpose, then focus on the mental processes  required for the specific purpose, and provide a structured sequence of exercises to develop and practice those processes. At the same time, teachers could provide instruction on the grammar and punctuation used in those rhetorical forms. To help students create consumer reports, for example, teachers might provide instruction in the comparison-contrast framework. Exercises that familiarize students with this mode include asking students to identify similarities or differences among a list of items, sentence combining exercises based on original observations of comparison, and work with synonyms. (A list of ways to develop ideas with words is included.) (MM)",

In addition to emphasizing skill acquisition and flexibility, it stresses face-to-face evaluation of written work, and places heavy emphasis on writing as process instead of writing as product. To determine the center's effectiveness, instruction in the SPICE Center and in Southern West Virginia Community College's Individualized Learning Center was compared with conventional classroom instruction at the two colleges. The effects of the two modes of instruction on writing quality, the students' concepts of the nature of the writing process, and writing apprehension were compared in a pretest-posttest experimental  design. Results revealed no significant differences between the two groups in both holistic scoring of writing samples and mean T-unit lengths. These results might suggest that teaching methods are not of central importance in the teaching of writing. (HOD)",

It presents descriptions and analyses of seven occasions for writing that illustrate how teacher planning, prior experiences, conceptions of writing as a process, and beliefs about student abilities were reflected in the teaching of writing. The report also suggests the varied writing functions evident in different writing occasions: writing to know oneself and others, writing to occupy free time, writing to participate in the community, and writing to demonstrate academic achievement. It identifies a number of  issues as important challenges to writing instruction, including (1) developing a sense of audience, (2) using models, (3) instilling a sense of purpose in writing occasions, (4) setting expectations for writing performance, (5) evaluating students' writing, and (6) recognizing the classroom context as an influence on writing. The report closes with a discussion of the study's implications for teaching, curriculum development, and future research.

Each setting attempted to integrate classroom instruction in rhetoric and syntax with laboratory autotutorial work on standard written English. Success was limited at the union sites by participants' lack of motivation to improve their writing skills, at the high school sites by students' lack of motivation and difficulty in managing self-instruction, and at the manpower site by administrative instability. A successful continuing adaptation model, however, was established among the  highly motivated workers at the psychiatric hospital. An evaluation of project results indicates that adapted models of the course would succeed in efficiently operated social service agencies and in stable job training programs committed to developing literacy skills. Any model designed for learners of high school age and younger, however, would require an in-depth revision of materials and procedures and a reorganization of the curriculum. (MM)",

During a two-day workshop, the DACUM panel at Cincinnati Technical College identified 13 general areas of competency with 130 individual tasks. The first two areas of competency dealt with basic entry level skills: the ability to demonstrate technical expertise or aptitude and writing proficiency. The remaining 11 competencies included (1)  planning the project, (2) coordinating the project, (3) researching the project, (4) organizing the information, (5) writing the project copy, (6) planning the illustrations, (7) conducting the project review, (8) producing the document, (9) performing administrative functions, (10) continuing professional growth, and (11) training and supervising employees.

English department chairs completed a short survey on courses, staffing, and special projects, and structured interviews were conducted with these chairs and various other program coordinators from a subsample of 10 campuses. All writing instructors inside and outside the English departments completed a detailed questionnaire about such features as instructional practices and campus climate. From the interview data, five broad categories emerged for comparing writing programs: program goals, program leadership, procedures and policies for remedial writing instruction, adjunct writing assistance, and upper-division writing requirements  for graduation. The questionnaire data provided descriptive information about writing teachers and their attitudes, practices, and perceptions. The results indicated that few campuses had defined program goals or cohesive sequential curricula. The results also suggested that tenured faculty knew less about recent writing theory than did part time contract instructors, and that program coordinators' authority and power of persuasion over regular faculty were limited.

The traditional program's drill/memorization approach was ineffectual, incomplete, shallow, and uninteresting. Today, however, the study of language involves looking at all of its aspects, sounds, words, and symbols. Instead of throwing this progress away, language programs should continue to look at what linguists see as the eight dimensions of language: syntax, phonemics, graphemics, morphemics, semantics, history, lexicography, and dialectology. Language units should incorporate what is known about education and students in general with current understanding of the nature of language and language learning. Perhaps the best focus for this renewed study of English is  the dictionary. A project to develop a class and individual student dictionaries not only teaches students how to use a dictionary effectively, but also shows them that dictionaries are human rather than arbitrary creations. A less comprehensive approach involves short units on such topics as dictionary organization, definitions, derivations, and literary allusions. Dictionary study can also include an investigation of different types of dictionaries, a look at word meanings, discussions of the relationship between denotation and connotation, a spelling reform project, and a new look at prefixes and suffixes.

The discrepancy approach poses that the difference between what is sought and what is actually obtained, expressed effectively as a discrepancy score, significantly aids effects explanations. The transactional approach postulates that unique contributions of both sought and obtained variables may be masked when that difference is expressed in terms of a single discrepancy score. A study tested these competing models with regard to dependency on and frequency of viewing the network evening news and &quot;60 Minutes.&quot; Telephone interviews were obtained from 306 male and female heads of households. Gratifications sought and obtained were  each measured by 12 statements encompassing four categories of gratifications. Data analysis revealed that both models could be effective frameworks for understanding the role that gratification plays in mediating different effects. The transactional model explained program dependency more effectively than frequency of viewing. Conversely, the discrepancy model was more effective in explaining frequency of viewing than dependency. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study examined variation in code choice in the same speakers in two contrasting situations--interorganizational and intraorganizational bargaining. Naturalistic interactions between teams of teacher's union bargaining agents, role-playing teachers, and school board members in the two settings were coded, using measures of structural and lexical complexity, solidarity, and formality of structure, as well as indices of personal reference. Discriminant analysis revealed that a set of structural and lexical variables accounted for significant differences in the structuring of the two types of interactions. The two situations were also found to differ in expressions of solidarity and in structural cues. (An extensive bibliography and tables of data are appended.  (Author/FL)",

        "description":"The purpose of teacher feedback in the speech classroom is to inform the speaker of the audience's reaction to the speech, to make suggestions for improvement on future speeches, and to motivate the speaker to speak again or to enjoy speaking. To provide appropriate criticism, teachers need to understand the nature and the relative merits of various types of feedback: simultaneous, delayed, immediate, written, and oral. While studies indicate that simultaneous negative feedback by the audience has a deteriorating effect on speaker performance, work with verbal prompting through a transistorized ear plug has improved the speaking performance of graduate teaching assistants. Research suggests that audio and video recordings accompanied by positive feedback improve students' oral  interpretation skills. Classroom experience suggests that students remember criticism when it is immediate and accompanied by written comments and that the most effective written commentary is atomistic and impersonal, and may be either positive or negative. Studies suggest that oral criticism should stress positive features to promote favorable attitudes toward speaking. Though this is perhaps the most helpful form of feedback, it may have a negative influence on the performance of succeeding speakers. (MM)",

The first section of the paper examines the role and impact of debates in contemporary political campaigns, specifically the presendential campaigns of 1976 and 1980. The second section argues that debate could contribute more to politics, and blames flaws in procedure and format for its failure to do so. Noting that most political debates resemble press conferences more than debates, this section reviews the series of debates held in South Dakota in 1980 known as &quot;Election 80,&quot; which sought to implement and test procedure and format in  terms of specific criteria. The third section of the paper sets forth the following recommendations for improving political debate procedure and format: (1) the issue agendas used in political debates should be the public's and the candidates', not the media's; (2) questions to the candidates by the media should be phrased simply and clearly; (3)candidates should be told the topics in advance and should be allowed to use notes and other materials; and (4)the role the media play in political debates must be substantially altered.

The focus of the study was a new television station in central Illinois that offered itself as an alternative to commercial television and promised to feature religious and family programs. Prior to the station's broadcast debut, approximately 300 residents of the area were surveyed to ascertain their media use habits, opinions of commercial television, and demographics. The dependent measure was the perceived need for the proposed station in terms of its religious and family programs. A second survey took place  following the station's debut, with approximately 250 respondents supplying data concerning gratifications served by the news offered by the station. Data were gathered relating to their gratifications sought from news in general, and from the stations' news in particular. Results revealed that respondents thought there was a need for the station, but that its programing did not meet that need. News viewers were similar to general viewers in their opinions. Findings suggest that the gratifications sought and obtained model is not applicable to local news viewing and that gratifications sought and obtained are not valid predictors of news viewing behavior in general.

Not all of the patterns that characterize black English within the dialectal framework are equal in their social or ethnic significance--the speech pattern that has one meaning for one group of blacks may well have quite another meaning for another black group, and no special social significance for a third. It would be helpful to know what blacks consider negotiable or nonnegotiable language patterns, because such information would not only serve to strengthen theories of black linguistic acculturation but might also contribute to the development of better classroom strategies for  teaching standard English. Knowledge of black English characteristics would also help to illuminate issues and concerns relating to black performance within and adaptation to mainstream institutional life. Black culture values spontaneity, improvization, and intuition, and these modes cannot be realized effectively if individuals have no control over how they are to perform a task. To the extent that black culture produces an orientation or style that is not only functional for blacks within the context of their community but also singularly useful to the larger society, it becomes a professional responsibility to keep such modes alive and well.

        "description":"The field of interpretation needs to be more aware of and sensitive to the contributions of black culture and consciousness. The interpreter wishing to perform black poetry, for example, needs to recognize that the black aesthetic has its roots in African culture and traditions and does not always share the assumptions of the European or Euro-American literary traditions. Oral tradition, with frequent religious and musical overtones, influences all areas of black culture and art and exemplifies the collective nature of black expression. It creates an art form that is rhetorical and demands response. Rising from oppression, African and Afro-American literature have never accepted art for art's sake but have always worked to fulfill a function: to move the emotions, to become part  of the dance, or to make one act. The oral tradition is evident in the black poetry of the 1960s--its musicality demands that works be read aloud. As part of an effort to devote more serious attention to black poetry, critic Stephen Henderson developed three broad categories for defining the black aesthetic: theme, structure, and &quot;saturation,&quot; (in general terms, the communication of the black experience).

Parent interviews, week-long television viewing diaries, and children's Peabody Picture Vocabulary test scores for 237 children, aged three or five years, were subjected to stepwise discriminant analysis. Families were divided into four groups on the basis of the cable services they received: no cable, basic cable, cable and one movie channel, or cable and two movie channels. The results of analysis indicated that the father's educational level was the single best discriminator of television services received. Fathers of families receiving basic cable had more education but lower occupational status than those of either no  cable families or two movie channel families. The mothers in cable families were more likely to be employed than were those in non-cable families. The number of television sets in the home increased with the number of cable options, as did preschoolers' television viewing. The latter was most notable in basic cable and one movie channel families where higher levels of education would normally lead to lower amounts of viewing. Preschoolers in families with two movie channels had substantially lower Peabody vocabulary scores than those in any other group, independent of their parents' lower educational attainments. (HTH)",

        "description":"Designed for those interested in the possible effects of the tuition tax credit plan espoused by the Reagan administration, the document presents two polar views on the subject. Glazer's article, &quot;The Future under Tuition Tax Credits: The Case for Homogeneity in Schools,&quot; is presented from the perspective of one who favors such tax credits. A discussion about the necessity for homogeneity of educational values in schools is followed by predictions of possible enrollment shifts that would occur if the tuition tax credits were implemented. The author concludes by stating his opposition to the forced association of &quot;the aspiring and achieving&quot; with those who create an environment in which students can neither aspire or achieve. Breneman's article, &quot;Saying No To Tuition Tax Credits,&quot;  presents the perspective of one who opposes tuition tax credits. By examining the lessons drawn from the financing of higher education, the second author suggests that tuition tax credits would be inefficient, inequitable, and expensive without creating any offsetting social benefits. A consideration of possible enrollment shifts is followed by the author's conclusion that such tax credits would create losses greater than gains on both social and educational grounds by creating a split along socioeconomic class lines and by the seeking of private alternatives rather than dealing with the problems of public schools.

Part III considers the many educational reforms in Atlanta; the Chicago Otis Law; the contrasting policies of three Chicago superintendents who were all considered reformers; the Chicago financial crisis of the 1930's; and the relationship between the early years of America's urban educational system and the great growth and reform after World War II.

It describes hierarchy theory, systems theory, and mixed-level models of organization developed by organizational scientists. Hierarchy theory derives from the notion that complex systems exhibit hierarchical structure--a pattern of relations among levels--and offer a framework for cross-level predictions of organizational processes and activities. Systems theory describes similar characteristics of structure, process, and function shared by different entities. It can be used to derive organizationally relevant generalizations that include isomorphisms and processes operating at different  echelons. Mixed-level models include composition models, cross-level models, and multilevel models. Issues of level in organizational research are a new frontier and expand the model of organizational science by integrating research areas and providing specific models of organizational behavior.

        "description":"Six exploratory papers by different authors from both the corporate sector and the public school systems present several relevant perspectives on business/education collaboration. The first, by Dr. Marsha Levine (who also provides the introduction to the collection), suggests three analytic frameworks for planning and implementing public/private ventures: (1) interinstitutional collaboration, (2) public-private partnership, and (3) a systems approach, relating schools to external organizations. The second, by Maurice Leiter of the United Federation of Teachers, takes a pragmatic view of public and private entities' shared reliance on a prosperous economy. The third, by Larry Cuban, a former school superintendent, identifies conflicting interests in corporate involvement with  public schools, balanced by a shared concern for developing students' problem-solving skills. Richard Caldwell, in the fourth paper, identifies legal barriers to corporate involvement in public schools, the most significant being the question of equitable distribution of corporate resources in educational aid. The corporate view is presented in the fifth and sixth papers by representatives, respectively, of Control Data Corporation (Marcia Appel and Susan Schilling) and AEtna Institute for Corporate Education (Badi Foster and David Rippey). The former sees computer-based education as requiring fundamental changes in the relationship among education, business, and government, while the latter describes AEtna's external programs and establishes criteria for collaboration: accommodation,  reciprocity, standards, and communication.

        "description":"Examining student promotion standards in American education, the author reviews the origins and history of the shift between merit promotion (which advances students based on demonstrated skill competence) and social promotion (which advances students in response to their social needs). Case studies of promotional policies are provided for schools in Philadelphia, New York City, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Milwaukee; analyses of their promotional standards are based on seven criteria. While the national movement toward raising student promotional standards is based on the assumption that there is a relation between promotion and performance, the author outlines how research evidence is inconclusive. Current empirical literature on the subject leaves only one  conclusion: there is no valid evidence demonstrating that either promotion or retention has any significant impact on low achieving students. Nevertheless, the author provides suggestions for implementing higher standards in promotional policies. Concluding that there is an absence of evidence clearly defining one form of promotional policy as most effective, the author points out that the choices must be made on the basis of social values.

Pointed out as fundamental problems are: lack of integration of physical plant concerns with the institution's broader mission; the low priority given physical plant needs; the isolation of the physical plant director from institutional decisionmaking; lack of awareness of requisite funding; ineffective management of physical plant staff; and inefficient use of institutional facilities. When these issues have been addressed, facility requirements can be integrated into academic planning. It is recommended that a facilities  planning group be established to break down the isolation of the plant department and that the support of top administrators and trustees be enlisted. A thorough physical plant audit on which budgeting can be based is prescribed. Proposed methods of improving plant department management include setting work objectives, establishing training programs and advancement incentives, and considering contracting out services. Analyzing the fit between programs and facilities and allocating space accordingly are advised. A comprehensive energy management program comprising an energy audit and conservation measures is recommended, and some computer-based models for financial planning are described. (MJL)",

        "description":"Although federal involvement in education has been reduced in the 1980's under the Reagan Administration's &quot;New Federalism,&quot; it is far from clear that state and local governments are willing and able to adequately compensate for this decreasing involvement to ensure educational equity and quality. In the current debate over federalism, three types must be distinguished: &quot;doctrinal federalism,&quot; which describes how levels of government ought to relate to each other; &quot;functional federalism,&quot; which defines how such levels actually do relate to each other; and &quot;strategic federalism,&quot; which emphasizes the ways one level of government manages to influence another. The history of the enactment of the &quot;Education for All Handicapped Children Act&quot; (1976) demonstrates the extent to which  educational issues raised initially at local levels may assume national importance through court litigation. Recent research into the effectiveness of various intergovernmental grant proposals and the decision in the Minnesota case of &quot;Mueller vs. Allen&quot; in favor of tax deductions for parents sending their children to private schools suggest that responsibility for the future of education should be shifted away from the courts to become more a matter of public policy debate.

Seven dimensions of national social, economic, and political commitment that are linked to education are: (1) expansion of equality of opportunities for the disadvantaged, handicapped, and minorities; (2) promotion of economic growth and full employment; (3) minimization of spillover costs among states and regions; (4) maintaining cultural and scientific progress; (5) ensuring an effectively functioning democracy; (6) defense of the nation; and (7) educational research and development. Under federalism the responsibilities of government are divided and the federal government can only influence  educational policy indirectly. However, there are four policy levers that the federal government can use to meet national educational concerns: leadership, educational services, grants-in-aid, and litigation. (MLF)",

        "description":"The issues of achieving school desegregation and providing programs for students with special needs, while at the same time facing enrollment declines, have forced school administrators to improve techniques for projecting demand. This paper describes a new procedure that combines forecasting of enrollments and management of facilities and that has been successfully implemented for the Seattle, Washington, Public Schools. The Seattle system prepares its forecasts for a relatively small local unit called the &quot;small planning unit&quot; containing from 50-100 students each. Five-year projections are prepared for each small area, and are then aggregated to prepare forecasts for large geographical areas and for attending schools. Advantages to this approach claimed for planners are that  (1) it allows for easier simulation of policy alternatives, (2) small units provide a welcome sensitivity to neighborhood activity, and (3) the use of small-area forecasts allows continuous refinement of the models in response to actual results. Some results are reported that support the planning technique. The mathematical procedures for the forecasting model used with small planning units are in the appendix. (MLF)",

        "description":"Offered as a foundation for subsequent analysis, this report presents data on the frequency of teacher turnover in New York State districts from 1972 to 1977 and discusses the methods used for calculations from State Department of Education records. Data drawn from a 1-in-20 random sample totalling 13,000 teachers are analyzed in order to investigate three types of turnover: quits, or transfer of teachers between districts; transfers of teachers between schools in the same district; and changes in teacher assignment. Figures cited in an introductory literature review are used to check the validity of New York turnover rates. The following section provides turnover rates for the time periods 1972-76 and 1976-77, analyzed in terms of teaching experience, age of teachers, and  changes in district enrollment. The final section concludes that such factors as declining enrollment and seniority rules may determine teacher mobility and thus district staff composition, and that the turnover rates for New York do not differ significantly from teacher behavior in other states. Information on constructing the data set and on calculations of transfers and quits is appended. (MJL)",

        "description":"This paper extends research by Richard Murnane by analyzing the effects of specific teacher contract provisions on New York teacher turnover from 1972-76 and in the process assesses the validity of two theories explaining teacher mobility. The combination of the theory of human capital with the theory of internal labor markets analyzes teacher mobility in terms of the voluntary movements characteristic of the teacher shortage of the 1960's; however, a theory of institutional work rules is espoused as more useful in explaining teacher behavior during the teacher surplus of the 1970's, when job mobility tended to be involuntary. Data from a sample of 19,000 teachers from State Department of Education personnel files are subjected to logit analysis to estimate the effect of selected  variables on the probability of teacher transfers and quits. Variables include a contract provision limiting class size and a provision requiring that seniority be followed in staff reductions, as well as teachers' experience levels, racial composition of teachers and of students, district enrollments, and teachers' sex. Generally, class size provisions are found to increase the probability of transfers and reduce the probability of quits, but the seniority provision affects quit rates only in districts with rapidly declining enrollment. Results are concluded to uphold the explanatory power of both theories considered. (MJL)",

School boards should have open meetings to advise the community of the decision to sell or lease the property. Liaison committees should be established for communication between the school board and the city council, planning commission, and zoning board. Legal counsel can help the board through the legal and marketing phases of the project. At least two appraisals should be secured to help the board establish a fair market value, and an inquiry process is recommended to let the public and private sectors know that the district is seeking alternative uses of surplus properties. Finally, a marketing plan should be developed and a timetable established. The  appendixes (two-thirds of the document) contain sample forms of: a school board resolution authorizing property sale, a contract of sale, a bid form, pertinent sections of &quot;The School Code of Illinois,&quot; a section of an appraisal, questions to be ansered by potential bidders, tabulation of prospective purchasers, a notice of sale, and an advertisement for an inquiry period.

        "description":"This report on school finance trends in urban areas is based on an analysis of the fiscal and demographic features of 44 major U.S. cities, as these have changed between 1970 and 1980. During this period, urban school systems experienced a median enrollment decline of 25 percent (2.5 times the national average), as a result of declining populations in large cities and changing national demographic trends that reduced the ratio of children to the total population. At the same time, an increased concentration of minority and poor students, coupled with a proportional increase in private school enrollments, has resulted in a greater prevalence of needy children in urban public schools. The dramatic decline in enrollment has led to increased per pupil expenditure in nearly all the  sample cities, but the growth in state and federal aid to education has reduced these schools' reliance on local revenue. Because of higher birth rates among the increasingly dominant minority groups, a reversal of the declining enrollments is likely to occur during the next decade. Demographic and fiscal features of individual cities were analyzed in an attempt to identify funding prospects. Thirteen were identified as having good prospects (i.e., expenditures per pupil more than 10 percent above national average); 18 had average prospects (within 10 percent of national average, plus or minus); and 13 had poor prospects (less than 90 percent of national average).

Theories on the importance of decoding and morphological comparison in competent reading comprehension are reviewed, and studies on how successful deaf readers learn morphological cues are described. Findings show that deaf readers use systems analogous to \"sounding out the word\" (by mouth movements and translation into finger spelling). The use of the finger spelling strategy is suggested as a way to help deaf students identify more sight vocabulary. Further results are cited to show that deaf Ss can detect morphological regularities between words. The paper concludes with suggestions for helping deaf students improve both their finger spelling decoding and their  ability to understand morphological relatedness. (CL)",

It is suggested that in the absence of sound, morphological information can provide a compensatory approach to word identification and reading  comprehension. (CL)",

        "description":"The study examined the 2-year stability and validity of playroom observations of behaviors associated with hyperactivity in 48 boys who were evaluated originally as outpatients in a child psychiatry clinic, and seen again approximately 2 years later at follow-up. At both evaluations, the boys participated in two 15-minute playroom procedures: a relatively unstructured free play period; and a relatively structured, restricted academic period. The observation measures of gross and fine motor activity, sustained attention, and self-vocalization in both periods showed significant stability over the 2-year period, even after the effects of age and IQ were partialled out. Further, these behaviors generally showed significant improvement between the two observations. Thus, consistent  with previous research and clinical observations, behaviors typically associated with hyperactivity were found to show significant improvement as the boys got older, although their relative rank order remained stable. The results also indicated that a measure of hyperactivity generated at referral was significantly related to many of the observation measures collected at follow-up. Taken together, these results suggest that the present playroom observation procedure is measuring stable and valid aspects of hyperactive behavior among a sample of clinic-referred boys.

        "description":"The paper criticizes the practice of providing sheltered occupational environments to severely handicapped individuals and considers ways in which public school programs and adult service systems can be arranged to maximize vocational functioning. Following an operational definition of meaningful work, the chapter analyzes reasons for the restrictive nature of sheltered vocational environments, including that work related skills are rarely required or developed, instruction is not emphasized, deviant actions are tolerated, and opportunities to benefit from interactions with nonhandicapped workers are not available. Followup data is cited to show trends toward functioning in nonsheltered vocational settings. Among reasons suggested for the growth-promoting nature of nonsheltered  environments are availability of a continuous flow of meaningful work, greater opportunity to acquire and perform work related skills, and a social climate more conductive to success and personal growth. Relationships between meaningful work and pay are examined, and sheltered versus nonsheltered settings are compared in terms of cost, cost efficiency, and quality of life. Timelines for direct and indirect vocational instruction are offered. The nonsheltered vocational preparation program at the Madison (Wisconsin) Metropolitan School District is reviewed in terms of its development and its progression of services from middle schools to high schools and to post school services. Characteristics of successful delivery systems for severely handicapped adults are noted, including meaningful  coordination between school and postschool agencies and instructional program emphases.

In addition, syntactic characteristics were analyzed through the T-unit and syntactic density score and semantic characteristics through propositional analysis and text cohesion analysis. Hearing impaired and hearing Ss performed significantly differently across all language measures. In general, normal hearing Ss produced quantitatively more than hearing impaired Ss. Age differences on syntactic language measures were characterized by a linear development while age differences  on semantic measures were characterized by a quadratic trend for both groups. Four factors accounted for 77% of the variance of performance in hearing impaired Ss: the semantic component, syntactic component, hearing/speech component, and cognitive component. (Author/CL)",

A modification of a row/column scanning system was investigated to increase speed and accuracy of access to the communication system by six children with athetoid cerebral palsy. Four systems were compared: row/column directed scan (two switches); row/column auto scan (one switch); row auto scan (one switch); and column auto scan (one switch). Results revealed no significant differences among systems for scan time to select the correct target. The row/column auto scan (the most widely prescribed system for severely disabled persons) resulted in significantly more errors than any of the other three systems. It was also found that individuals  who would have been or had already been prescribed a single switch system were able to operate two switches. (Author/CL)",

Results are reported according to 18 research questions. Findings revealed no major difference between regular and special education teachers in terms of teacher stress (stress-prone personality, recent personal stressors, internal coping skills,  support within the environment, perception of work-related stressors, level of psychological symptoms of stress, level of physiological symptoms of stress, type of reactions to stress utilized, rate of absenteeism, intention to leave the profession, willingness to re-enter the field, and rate of burnout). In addition, both groups reported experiencing the same stressors and assigned nearly the same stress level to the identified stressors. Most frequently reported stressors for the entire group were lack of administrator support, working with other teachers, and discipline and behavior problems. Ss at or approaching burnout were more vulnerable to stress-related problems, more externally controlled, less likely to make use of support groups, more apt to find teaching extremely stressful,  more afflicted with both psychological and physiological symptoms of stress, and more prone to react negatively under stress.

The approach, based on role theory, examined the statistical independence of ratings according to six mutually exclusive categories (program type, geography/population, grade level, skill level, experience, and training). Results indicated that regular class teachers were implementing a variety of modifications of their regular programs to accommodate the special needs but a minority of the modifications were actually written into the records, suggesting the existence of serious policy issues. The regular class teachers were clearly  struggling to cope with increased demands related to serving special education students, had substantial discretion as to how they actually worked with students and specialists, and relied heavily on informal rather than formal processes to achieve progress.

Analysis of interaction and sociometric measures before and after intervention did not support the hypothesis that cognitive coaching would significantly improve social skills and acceptance as compared with individual instruction or no training. Analysis of teacher ratings in the three conditions revealed that a greater frequency of the staff in the cognitive coaching group evaluated their target children as  improved in the social area, while a greater frequency of staff in the individual instruction group evaluated their target children as improved in the academic area.

Statistical analyses showed no relationship between externality of locus of control and depression. Externality of attribution was found to be related to depression, contrary to previous studies which showed a relationship between internality of  attribution and depression. However, a significant interaction existed between attribution and locus of control, leading to the conclusions that individuals who are either internal or external on both locus of control and attribution are least depressed, while individuals who are internal on one and external on the other are the most depressed.

Subsequently they were administered a battery of questionnaires assessing personality traits and eating disorders including the Herman and Polivy Restraint Scale Revised; Hawkins and Clement Binge Eating Scale; Demand for Approval and the High Self-Expectations subscales of the Jones' Survey of Beliefs and  Feelings; Kurtz Body Attitude Scale; Levenson and Gottman Dating and Assertion Questionnaire; Rosenberg Self-Esteem Index; Spence and Helmreich Personality Attributes; and the Beck Depression Inventory. An analysis of the results showed that bulimic women with a prior history of anorexia were more depressed than nonanorexic bulimic women. Bulimic women with a history of anorexia also reported previous treatment for weight related difficulties and higher family incomes than nonanorexic bulimic women. Personality traits for both groups were similar, i.e., low self esteem, high need for approval, high self expectations or perfectionistic strivings, and a poor body image. All women recognized their eating habits as disruptive and expressed an interest in receiving treatment. (BL)",

Good relationships were characterized by sharing, encounter/encouragement, and congruent communication roles between student and teacher. Motives, behavior, and confrontation were used least in good relationships. Poor relationships were characterized by confrontation and behavior, with thoughts being used least often.

Intellectual ability in terms of recognition vocabulary, figure rotation, and letter/word series (adapted from the Primary Mental Abilities Tests on verbal meaning, space and reasoning) was assessed by corresponding  subtests of the Adult Mental Abilities test. Depression was measured by the Zung Depression Scale. An analysis of the results showed that older people who complained of memory problems had high levels of depression. Further, the bidirectional relationship that ensued between affect and cognition points to the circular pattern that develops between memory and depression once the first causal step is taken. Finally, the heterogeneous lifestyle of young-old adults (55-70) appeared to be related to the differences in psychological functioning in this age group.

In the second part, the occurrence of four stressors (role ambiguity, role conflict, responsibiltiy for people, and quantitative work overload) were rated on a five-point scale. An analysis of the results showed that a direct link did exist between perceptions of specific job characteristics  and high stressor levels. Role ambiguity and conflict were most frequently related to providing knowledge to incumbents, organizational procedures, and interfacing with other people. Responsibility to people was stressful in terms of financial duties. Work overload stress related to pressure and pace of work activity.

        "description":"The classroom environment elicits social comparison behavior in which a student uses peers' performance as a gauge for his own self-assessment. Social comparison as it relates to ability is a four phase sequential process. In phase one, stimulation of social comparison is elicited through developmentally-determined cognitive capacities and motives and situationally-elicited motives. Social comparison information begins to influence 7 and 8 year old children and increases dramatically thereafter. Once social comparison interest is elicited, the individual moves into phase two, in which he behaves in ways designed to obtain comparison information. This acquisition behavior is twofold: the choice of comparison person(s), and the timing and mode of information acquisition. An  individual's choice of a comparison person is based on the specific motive underlying comparison, the degree of satisfaction, and developmental/temporal needs. Once the comparative data are collected the individual enters phase three, in which he has a perception of his relative performance; i.e., superior, equal, inferior. The fourth and final phase of the process concerns the individual's reaction to perceived relative performance, both intrapersonally and interpersonally, on cognitive, affective, and behavioral levels. Intrapersonally, comparison information affects performance expectancies and attributes, self-concept, task performance, and self-reward. Peer performance attributes, attraction/popularity, competitiveness, aggression and classroom disruption are all possible  interpersonal responses to social comparison. Implications for classroom design and educational goals are discussed. Extensive references complete the article. (BL)",

        "description":"The study of causal attributions at the interpersonal level has been an integral part of attribution research. Unfortunately most attribution research has involved persons unfamiliar with each other. The marital relationship is an example of the need for understanding causal attributions among intimates. A striking feature of marital interaction is its reciprocal nature; relationship problems can occur when partners justify their own behavior in response to the other's prior behavior. Causal attributions can play a functional role in a real life relationship, as opposed to a laboratory situation, because there are usually a number of plausible causes for an event. Research has suggested that causal dimensions different from those traditionally used in individually oriented  research may be important in studying intimates. A second issue raised concerning the preventative role of causal attributions in intimate conflict is that causal attributions, as accounts which bridge the gap between expectation and action, suggest various points of possible relationship malfunction. It appears that research on responsibility attribution is more relevant to relationship dysfunction than the study of perceived causality as traditionally conceived. When couples in therapy present problems where causal attributions are central, one needs to focus not only on the attributions themselves but on the expectations that make them so important. (JAC)",

Since this rural labor force is composed mainly of the poor who have little schooling, formal skill training, or on-the-job training, they are generally hired for low-paying jobs. Thus, a need exists to improve vocational counseling for rural adolescents. This paper presents six suggestions for improving career counseling efforts for rural minority youths, based on a study of the career development of Black and Indian youths (N=800) from five rural counties in North Carolina. The recommendations are: (1) link career counseling for minority youths to economic and  industrial development in rural areas, e.g., facilitating understanding of \"high tech\" occupational opportunities; (2) promote the upgrading of math and science education for minorities, possibly through use of consultation with new industries; (3) involve parents in career counseling; (4) emphasize minority female career development, e.g., advocate equal participation in rural \"high tech\" opportunities; (5) counsel for rural minority entrepreneurship, emphasizing formal experiences in entrepreneurial development; and (6) provide greater access to career counseling for rural minority youths.

Information contradictory to an initial impression has relatively little impact on the impression and is particularly likely to be recalled. Possible resolutions on this paradox include: (1) the recalled information and the impression of the person are independent of each other; (2) people may link incongruent information to information they have that fits their initial impression, and the additional thought given to incongruent items reinforces the initial impression; and (3) people generally attribute behavior which is inconsistent with their impressions to situational causes. To examine more directly the amount of attention given to congruent and incongruent information as a function of causal attribution subjects were given  information about the behaviors of a target person which was congruent with their intial impression, except for one item, which was either congruent or incongruent and was attributed to a situational or dispositional cause. The behavioral information was presented on a screen controlled by a microcomputer. Subjects controlled the length of viewing time for each item, and the time was recorded by the computer. Although the correlation between recall and looking time was significant, looking time accounted for less than 4 percent of the variance in recall.

        "description":"Both British and American social welfare systems rely on volunteers during the financially constrained years of the 1980's. To investigate how London and New York agencies recruit, screen, train, use, and evaluate social services volunteers, surveys were completed by 44 New York agencies (a 46 percent response rate; 17 public, 27 private), and by 55 London agencies (45, or 28 percent were adequate for data analysis; 12 public, 32 private). An analysis of the results showed that more New York agencies (89 percent) used volunteers than did London agencies (66 percent). Overall, recruitment, screening, orientation/training, and evaluation/recognition methods were similar. For recruitment, both agencies used personal contact, churches, religious organizations, and brochures.  Prospective volunteers were asked for basic identifying information as well as interests and references. Agencies screened applicants by interview, application forms, and letters of reference, and in London through probationary periods. Orientation programs, consisting of on-the-job training and meetings/lectures, were provided in all London agencies, and by 32 of the 39 New York agencies recruiting volunteers. Out-of-pocket expenses were reimbursed in London but not New York. Volunteers were predominantly female and were supervised by a designated member of the professional staff; they provided direct services to clients and some clerical services. Observation was the primary method of performance evaluation and a letter of appreciation was the most popular method of recognition,  although New York agencies provided such recognition more frequently than London agencies. Future volunteer programs should take into consideration these variables in developing satisfying programs for their volunteers. (BL)",

In order to better understand the nature of negative schemata in depressed individuals, both depressed and nondepressed subjects participated in two studies in which they were required to name the colors of tachistiscopically-presented depressed-, neutral-, and manic-content words. In the first study, subjects were prescreened using the Beck Depression Scale to determine presence of depression. Only depressed (4 and below on the scale) and nondepressed (9 and above on the scale) subjects were included in the study. Subjects were presentd 50 words and were told to name the colors in which each word was printed. Subsequently,  the time interval (latency) between stimulus presentation and response was measured. In the second study, all subjects were nondepressed, but before being presented with the 50 words as in study one, they were exposed to either a positive, negative, or neutral mood induction. After the experiment the subjects completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist to assess the effects of the induction procedure. An analysis of the results showed that depressed subjects exhibited significantly longer color-naming response latencies for negative than for positive or neutral content words. Study two results indicated that the findings in study one were most likely not due to the effects of mood differences between the depressed and nondepressed subjects. (BL)",

To rule out perceived accuracy as an alternative explanation of the effects of concordance of causal understanding on interpersonal evaluations, 80 students participated in a study presumably concerned with jury decision making. The similarity, correctness, and importance of subjects' causal understandings were manipulated. The manipulation of importance consisted of telling subjects they would evaluate a real (high importance) or hypothetical (low importance) court case. After indicating on a 15-point scale the extent to which the individual in the case study  was responsible for the accident described, subjects were told a second observer either agreed or disagreed with them, and that their judgments were consistent or inconsistent with previous subjects. Subjects then rated the observer-confederate. Results suggested that similarity of causal judgments and social correctness were successfully manipulated. No significant results were found for the check on the importance variable. The findings suggest that perceived social desirability or correctness of judgments cannot account for the effects of concordance of causal understanding. (JAC)",

Mathematical psychology can contribute to support systems work in bridging the current gap between qualitative-theoretical emphases and quantitative-methodological emphases. Theory construction in the tradition of action research is seriously lacking in the field and is important for reasons of research adequacy. Theory construction tasks are unique, given that mathematical psychology is defined by the use of sophisticated mathematical methods rather  than a particular topic area. Mathematical modeling can make valuable contributions to the development of theory (discursive), can clarify and extend concepts (explicational), can describe data sets (representational) and formally can define concepts as related to data sets (theoretical-construct). These models can facilitate communication between applied researchers and target systems. (BL)",

In addition, the content area religion and ego development, as measured by Loevinger's sentence completion test (SCT), was examined. Thirty-one females and twenty-nine males participated. An interview format which applied Perry's unstructured approach to each of the four areas was utilized. Transcribed interviews and SCTs were rated blind. Structural as well as content analyses were performed. Structural analyses revealed no significant sex differences overall or by content area. However, multiple and step-wise regression analyses  revealed patterns in which male identity processes consistently focused upon occupational issues while female identity focused upon interpersonal and sexual issues. Content analyses suggest that women focus their interpersonal worlds developmentally upon issues of trust while men focus upon issues of rightness. Results are interpreted in the context of recent works by Chodorow and Gilligan concerning sex differences in development. (Author)",

        "description":"The increase in one child families in the 1980's is analogous to the one child family rate during the Depression years. Although family size was limited for economic reasons during the Depression, current increases in the number of one child families are attributed to advances in contraceptive technology, increased employment of women, inhibiting economic factors, and increased marital instability. The increased numbers of voluntory one child families, may result in a child psychologically different from the only child of past generations. The well-known confluence model of intellectual development, which posits that intellectual development is determined by the level of family intelligence, is currently in doubt due to the recognition of various confounding factors, (e.g.,  father absence, socioeconomic status), and subsequent research. Studies of achievement with only children have shown that only children perform better academically than others. Parental expectation, financial abilities, and an uninterrupted relationship with the child are possible reasons for this high achievement. Self-esteem studies have placed only children above, below, and at par with others. In interpersonal relations only children have been found to be less affiliative than others, which may be the result of the relatively large amounts of affection they receive from their parents, rather than a lack of social skills. Only children appear to be mentally healthy, with many studies indicating that only children are underrepresented in psychiatric literature. Future research should  focus on factors other than sibling absence in defining characteristics of the only child. (BL)",

Uniquely descriptive items took longer for self-descriptiveness decisions than for items that were descriptive of both self and other. Although unique features may be generated as descriptive of one's self, it appears they are accessed more slowly. This result is more consistent with a view that sees trait distinctiveness as computed rather than prestored.

The report first discusses the need to combine the hierarchical, bottom-up, sequential learning framework with the heterarchical, top-down, nonlinear creative model for reading, and to apply reality testing to both. It then describes how chunks of knowledge are connected and bracketed for meaning through such &quot;chaining&quot; activities as word recognition, syntactic processing, and semantic processing. After suggesting the  contextual component rendered by the reader in comprehension, it indicates parallels between reading comprehension and research: in both, configurations of schemata are developed by identifying, recognizing, accessing, and organizing information. Finally, the report discusses the bracketing process in greater detail, suggesting reasons why it may fail to occur, how it aids recall, and what makes it a creative act.

Sources of variation contributing to the unreliability of many measurements may be either (1) lasting and specific, (2) lasting and general, (3) temporary and specific, or (4) temporary and general. Lasting-specific sources of variations, such as observers' attitudes toward the coding system and differences between training conditions and actual classroom settings, can be controlled through appropriate criteria for observer selection and training procedures that are content specific to the actual observation tasks. Lasting-general sources of variation include observers' observation skills and the supervision condition, which can be controlled, in part, by  researchers and observers for discussing recently completed observations. Although temporary-specific sources of variation, such as observer fatigue, attention span, and memory, are not always under experimenter control, they can be managed with some success by such techniques as regulation of observation periods. Temporary-general sources, including location, surroundings, and physical condition of the observer, are more amenable to researcher control. If an observer is ill, for example, the observation session can be cancelled. The systematic consideration of these sources of variation is critical to understanding classroom interaction and behavior. (MM)",

        "description":"To examine the effect of structural factors on the development of story appreciation, a developmental model of story liking for suspense stories was tested by having second, fourth, and sixth grade children rate suspense stories on 10 affective scales. Specifically, the model predicted that (1) reader identification would increase with greater perceived similarity between character and reader, (2) increased identification would lead to greater suspense, (3) liking of outcome would be a joint function of character valence and outcome valence, and (4) overall liking of story would increase with greater identification, greater suspense, and greater liking of outcome. Results revealed four causal links that operated in the appraisal process of evaluating a story. First, similarity  was found to be a major basis for identifying with a character. Second, sympathetic caring for a strong character caused suspense when the character faced a significant consequence. Third, liking of the story's outcome was determined by resolution of suspense by a positive ending for young children and by the &quot;just world&quot; ending for older children. Fourth, overall liking of a story was found to be caused by identification with the story character, suspense, and liking of outcome. A strong developmental trend in evaluations of story endings was also found: young children preferred positive outcomes regardless of the valence of the character, but older children liked positive endings for good characters and negative endings for bad characters.

After the second section implements this approach to estimate the consumption benefits of acquiring literacy in nineteenth century England, the third section compares the estimate with the pecuniary value and costs of acquiring literacy. It argues that consumption benefits probably outweighed both the pecuniary benefits and the cost of literacy, and that changes in government  policy with regard to consumer benefits may have had a stronger impact on the rise of popular literacy than the policy measures usually emphasized, such as school provisions and child labor restrictions. The final section briefly considers modifications and extensions of these conclusions to developing nations in the twentieth century. (MM)",

        "description":"Publishers of basal reading series claim that beginning reading materials must contain primarily high frequency words and that new words must be introduced gradually. Inherent in their argument is the position that reading is based on the student's ability to recognize words and that short, phonetically regular words are easier to read. To examine this position, a study compared first-grade students' reading of a traditional basal story from a skills type basal series to their reading of student-dictated stories. The Spache Readability Formula was used to determine the readability levels of all stories. The Goodman and Burke Miscue analysis procedure was used to analyze oral reading performance, and story retellings were used to assess comprehension. Results showed that the basal  story miscues at the sentence level were semantically and syntactically acceptable, but were coupled with meaning change. The interrelatedness of syntax, semantics, and meaning change on the story level was ignored by students as a basis for correcting miscues to maintain meaning. On the other hand, student-dictated story miscues produced interrelationships that allowed little meaning change and no loss in comprehension. Although they were confronting a more sophisticated vocabulary and more complicated sentence structure, the children used more efficient strategies when reading the dictated stories. (HOD)",

Data on students in grades five and two in 11 different schools were collected from achievement monitoring tests, classroom observations, teachers' logs, and observers' interviews with teachers and principals. Analysis of the data, which failed to reveal significant, consistent patterns across the 22 classrooms, indicated that WDRSD use and reported IGE adoption were not good indicators of instructional patterns in reading skills. Although second grade classrooms emphasized word attack skills,  for example, fifth grade classrooms showed little consistent emphasis on any objectives. Classrooms at both grade levels revealed no linear relationship between time allocated to skill development and student needs. The lack of significant findings suggested that schools adopting the IGE system or the WDRSD materials may not always have reflected the underlying concepts guiding the developers of the programs or materials.

The psychology course emphasized research on attraction, romantic love, and interpersonal relationships, while the English course analyzed the literary representation of male-female relationships in short stories and novels. Psychological inventories were used with 18 students in the two courses to explore (1) a pedagogical hypothesis that Leary's Interpersonal Adjective Checklist would identify problem areas in student interpretation of character motivation in fiction; (2) a psychology-of-reading hypothesis that a significant  relationship would exist between a reader's view of human nature, as measured by Wrightman's Philosophy of Human Nature Scale, and his or her description of characters on the Leary Checklist; and (3) a literary hypothesis that the classic categorizing of characters into &quot;round&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; would be corroborated by reader perception of the character's interpersonal behavior on the Leary Checklist. Results supported all three hypotheses, indicated the potential value of using self-report inventories to understand fictional characters, and showed that the interdisciplinary approach enhanced both the teaching and the learning processes.

In the second experiment the target words consisted of those that were both semantically acceptable in the sentence and semantically related to the best completion words; words which were semantically acceptable in the sentence but not strongly related to the best completion words; and semantically unacceptable completion words that were not strongly related to the  best completion word. After the incomplete sentence was flashed on a screen, the target word appeared. Students were told to read the target word aloud as rapidly as possible. Results showed that contextual facilitation effects were observed both for highly predictable and for semantically appropriate (but less likely) completions. In both cases, the facilitation effect was much greater for children than for adults.

Studies were divided into four major research traditions: existential descriptions, existential proofs, pedagogical experiments, and program evaluations. An examination of these four frameworks revealed several generalizations. For example, existential proofs comparing good and poor readers or older and younger readers established that several behaviors related to strategy use and monitoring discriminate between mature and novice or good and poor readers. On the other hand, existential descriptions of classroom practices and manual suggestions revealed little explicit teaching of either comprehension or comprehension monitoring  strategies. The studies also indicated one model of instruction that emphasized guided practice, independent practice, and feedback. Using this model, teachers can train students to summarize an expository passage, ask questions about it, detect difficult portions, and make predictions about following passages, eventually assuming responsibility for monitoring these tasks themselves.

The question is if cohesion analysis, more than offering a linguistic description of text, can serve as a psychological model of comprehension complete with predictive power. The temptation exists to use the linguistic description as a text analytic device that partials out the cohesive aspect of the text thought to be causally related to the text's coherence. This concept, however, can lead a researcher to several false hypotheses, often because the cohesive tie, in and of itself, may or may not be explicit. Findings from several studies indicate that the cohesion  concept does not produce an adequate description of a text's unity. Attempts to maintain objectivity by measuring textual surface features appear to describe effects rather than causes of textual coherence. (HOD)",

        "description":"Proposing that teachers can help children learn more effectively by promoting metacognition and the acquisition of problem solving strategies, this report describes research studying the effectiveness of the experimental curriculum, Informed Strategies for Learning (ISL), in increasing third and fifth grade students' reading comprehension skills. Using a pretest-posttest design, the reported study revealed significant gains in reading comprehension and reading skills among the ISL group. The appendix of the report contains instructional materials, grouped in 14 comprehension skill training modules, designed to develop metacognitive awareness and reading comprehension. Each module includes graded skills to be targeted weekly, the rationale for teaching them, instructional  techniques, specific lesson plans for teacher use, and bulletin board ideas to supplement lessons. In addition, this section contains worksheets and assignments for student use. (MM)",

It then presents the methodology and the data collected from several related studies: (1) observer-child interviews that elicted information on students' general knowledge about written language; (2) observations of and discussions with the nine case study children as they first told, then dictated, then wrote two versions of an event; (3) records of students' efforts to adapt their writing to adult and child readers; (4) observations of children's writing on a recently shared event; (5) end-of-the-year interviews investigating  general writing knowledge; and (6) two follow up studies on the children's reading and writing progress in the first grade. After analyzing the data, the report produced a number of conclusions, including the following: literacy develops prior to conventional reading and writing, all children do not follow the same developmental sequence in learning to read and write, and the teacher's model of literacy has important implications for children's development. Extensive appendixes contain copies of testing instruments and transcripts of observer-child interviews. (MM)",

They are not, however, more sensitive to the general gist of a passage, and thus do not respond to priming from context more than do people of lesser verbal ability. People with good verbal ability are more aware of a passage's precise linguistic message and of the ways of manipulating it independent of context. Thus, verbally competent people are better able to respond to the meaning of the message itself and do not need to depend upon contextual clues to the same extent as the less verbally adept.

The Op-In procedure is a type of cloze procedure that deletes every other sentence ending from a passage. Three sixth grade level scientific passages were presented to 96 seventh grade subjects. Each passage was presented in three different ways: a conventional cloze procedure, an Op-In procedure, and a comprehension question task with emphasis on the main idea and topic related connections (global comprehension). Student responses were grouped into one of five categories ranging from &quot;same or similar to author's intent&quot; to &quot;fails to make sense, far off topic.&quot; The results indicated  patterns divided evenly among the 96 subjects: (1) interactive, using both author's and reader's schemes for meaning; (2) projective, using mostly reader's own scheme for meaning; (3) fragmented, using local context without integrating any scheme; and (4) no pattern determined. Those categorized as interactive received the highest score. The results indicated that the Op-In procedure exposed global comprehension as well as deviations from them.

Weaver used path analysis with data from 137 countries during four periods between 1950 and 1966 to test relationships between government control of the press and six other societal characteristics. The present study, which extended the time period of the original analysis by adding recently available data from 1979, constructed composite measures for the original variables whenever possible and then tested them for reliability and validity. These variables included government control of the press, accountability of governors, stress on government, mass media development, level of education, urbanism, and availability of resources. Results showed, first, that mass media development since World War II has been a response not so much to urbanism and to education  as to increased economic productivity. Second, it is clear that a government system accountable to its citizens contributes to the development of mass media. Third, as in the earlier study, evidence suggests that the more direct the governor's accountability to the masses, the greater the freedom of the press. But results also indicate that economic productivity and the level of media development are stronger predictors of lack of government control over the press than is government accountability.

Effects of the suspension on network advertising included (1) the disappearance of preclearance for commercials about cholesterol-related products and for advertising aimed at children; (2) the acceptance of some advertising, especially by local stations, formerly prohibited by the code; (3) a greater burden placed on the advertising industry's own regulatory agencies; (4) a lack of interest among top officials of the NAB in reformulating the code; and (5) greater efforts by the Children's Advertising Review Unit and by major networks to uphold the standards of the old NAB  code. Thus, while the disappearance of the television code brought some changes in advertising practices, a number of agencies have accepted much of the burden of reviewing and regulating commercial advertising.

They seem unaware that selecting a point of view is an important decision for a writer, because it controls the relationship between the writer, the reader, and the characters in a narrative. EXERCISES (excerpt): I ask each student to select a role--the paper rustler, the pencil dropper, the snoozer, the giggler, the note passer, the flirt, the egghead, the gum popper. Each student comes to the front of the class, stands behind the podium, and pretends to be the teacher. Once every student has become &quot;the teacher,&quot; I ask them to write a description  of the class from the teacher's viewpoint. Next I describe a particular situation; for example, a football game. One group describes the game from the perspective of the quarterback, the coach of the losing team, a cheerleader. After each group has made a presentation to the class from its particular perspective, we discuss how point of view can affect the basic facts of a situation. (KC)",

A work of fiction is an illusion of life in which characters attempt to transform basic reality by casting their desires and views upon it, thus creating internal conflict between elements of the real and the unreal. Characters must sort out through experiences that enable them to discover what truths finally exist. Every fiction has its own basic reality, through which the life of characters and their illusions are revealed, and from which past meaning often creeps into the setting. The task for any writer is to discover the &quot;reality tone&quot; of each work--the basis of truth upon which all variations on the whole language system are set. Tracking down the source of an idea and discovering the true components of a  fiction are intriguing work, but they are work that is, in a sense, a sideline and after the fact, for it is not necessary to know the source of an idea in order to expand upon it. To get an idea and from it create a system of illusion that readers accept as reality is the most exciting prospect of all. (HTH)",

Questions were designed to determine subjects' (1) issue salience, or how significant they considered energy conservation; (2) energy knowledge; (3) attitudes toward energy conservation; (4) thermostat setting; and (5) conservation efforts. Responses were correlated with three independent variables: media exposure, use of public affairs content, and interpersonal and mass communication on energy conservation. Results revealed that in both cities, most sources of  energy information were used relatively equally across status levels; associations among salience, knowledge, attitudes, and overt behavior were relatively weak; and interpersonal and mass communication were found to have moderate effects on energy conservation. The communities differed widely, however, in several significant relationships among variables. Higher status respondents were more likely to adopt energy conserving behavior in the upper income sample, for example, than in the lower middle income community.

        "description":"Although theories on developmental writing assume that basic writers do not write well because of cognitive deficits, recent research and classroom experience suggest that poor writers lack skill because they have not had sufficient contextually meaningful practice. Writing research indicates that the unskilled writer's tendency to write as if they were talking is not the result of a speech-dependent stage of writing development, but is the product of poorly constructed writing tasks, tasks calling out context-dependent, cryptic, and ill-formed writing from everyone. Furthermore, the experience of skilled writers suggests that the speech dependent stage of writing development is never outgrown--whenever the solitary act of writing about challenging topics becomes too difficult,  writers of all calibers express the need to talk about their work. As writing is significant only when it is part of a meaningful context, the value of assigning papers that have no contextual meaning for students is questionable. Although teachers may provide the cue for writing, they must let students determine the context and the text and then help the students transform these into academically acceptable writing. (MM)",

        "description":"To explore the concept of lexical collocation, or relationships between words, a study was conducted based on three assumptions: (1) that a text structure for a unit of discourse was analogous to that existing at the level of the sentence, (2) that such a text form could be discovered if a large enough sample of generically similar texts was examined, and (3) that such an analogous text form could be found by studying the relationship between lexical collocation and topic/comment sequence. Editorial columns from newspapers as diverse as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; were collected and read over a nine-month period. A team of readers was then asked to select 100 particularly well-written texts. Each selected piece was examined for the make-up and location  of each major lexical set; the location of topic and comment, theme and rheme, and agent and action within each sample sentence; and the way in which these major lexical sets were distributed within topic/comment, theme/rheme, and so forth. Results seemed to support the hypothesis that when a lexical set regularly occurs within the topic portion of sentences, the lexical set will be seen as the causal agent or structure principle of that particular text. Similarily, when a lexical set regularly occurs within the comment section of sentences, the lexical set will be perceived as representing the point of that text.

Three primary goals guide the project: (1) to develop the foundation for literacy in each of its students, (2) to expand and enrich the pedagogical competencies of each staff member in the teaching of the language arts, and (3) to develop and strengthen parental awareness of and support for school programing. Students are provided with opportunities for an abundance of writing, in many forms, for many purposes, and for many audiences. To encourage the students to view writing as a meaningful experience, books written by individual classes, by grade levels, and by schoolwide writing competitions are  regularly published at the district's curriculum center. During 1982, a newspaper was added to the project. In addition to books, newspapers, complaint forms, pen pal projects, and schoolwide competitions, the school has also sponsored the &quot;Joke of the Day&quot; and the &quot;Word of the Day.&quot; Teachers foster a writing environment that encourages composition by withholding extensive critical evaluations, by demonstrating sensitivity to the student's cultural identity, and by implementing frequent and varied writing and publishing experiences. Staff members' competencies are enriched through a series of writing seminars, a classroom support network, and the establishment of a professional library. In addition, student-created reading materials and school newspapers are sent to the homes of the young  authors. (HOD)",

The examination formats fall into three broad categories: 62% are essay only, 31% are essay plus objective tests, and 2% are standardized, machine scored tests. Half the colleges reported that over 70% of their students pass on the first try. Seventy-five percent of the schools use a holistic scoring technique for evaluating exams. The survey revealed that the recent interest in writing proficiency requirements is creating renewed interest in the writing lab as an important campus resource. Ninety percent of the schools have a  writing lab, and approximately 20% of those require students who fail the writing proficiency exam to attend a writing lab or workshop. These data suggest that the writing center/lab should do more than provide basic skill training in writing. Rather, the lab can serve as a resource for the entire faculty, helping them deal more effectively with writing problems in all disciplines by providing (1) writing across the curriculum seminars, (2) faculty training workshops in diagnostic procedures, (3) diagnostic materials and composition exercises supported by research on the relationship between cognitive development and writing ability, and (4) materials and workshops on problems confronting writers at all levels of writing ability.

Both chapters two and three contain descriptions of student writing tasks, copying and free writing skills, and school success and chapter four details three children's behavior while copying words. Chapter five records the study's findings,  which include the following: (1) written language is a system the children reconstruct as they interact with the environment, (2) children look for patterns in the construction of writing tasks, (3) the decontextualized nature of written language poses a significant problem for the children, (4) separating meaning from encoding in writing instruction does not help students learn how graphics and intentions are connected, and (5) personal interactions during writing affect writing strategies and outcomes. In addition, the report suggests the need to adapt school tasks to individual needs. Appendixes include observation sheets and recorded data. (MM)",

        "description":"The Primary Trait System (PTS) of scoring was devised by the National Assessment of Educational Progress to score large numbers of natural writing samples. Essentially, PTS permits evaluation of writing in an objective way, but one that does not rely on scoring surface features such as mechanics, grammar, or spelling. While the assessment value of PTS is clear, its instructional merits have remained largely unstudied. With this in mind, a study was conducted to describe the instructional uses made of the principles of PTS by 11 elementary and secondary school teachers. The teachers participated in a five-day workshop in which PTS was described theoretically. They also were given practice in using scoring guides related to PTS assignments and time to develop or adapt assignments  of their own. Back in their classrooms, the teachers kept activity logs on the assignments they used. They also participated in two &quot;booster&quot; workshops during the period studied. The teachers used PTS in their classrooms in a variety of ways, including the following: (1) to clarify lesson objectives, (2) to provide a way to formulate assignments, (3) to help students evaluate and respond to the writing of peers, (4) to assess students' papers, and (5) to improve reading.

Providing interactive practice with immediate feedback in a way that most students find motivating, microcomputers can help students build a solid foundation in such basic skills as punctuation use. In addition, word processing software offers students a holistic method of implementing basic language arts skills instruction. When used with the language experience approach to teaching reading, for example, microcomputers can easily record, store, and print student stories. Both increasing student awareness of the manipulative quality of language and facilitating revision, microcomputers can be used in creative or structured writing activities and  instruction in writing technique. Word processing programs can guide sentence combining activities. Although an effective instructional tool, microcomputers can neither teach nor evaluate writing content--teachers and students must work on that together. When selecting word processing programs, teachers should consider the clarity of instructions, the availability of directions, and the functions performed, such as making additions, deletions, insertions, word searches, and text movements.

A sample of 239 residents was asked open-ended questions about housing, crime, economic development, and school issues. A purposive sample of 52 leaders of neighborhood organizations interested in those specific issues was also interviewed, and two neighborhood newspapers were content analyzed for several months prior to the interviewing. The major findings were that (1) high levels of organized group activity were related to larger knowledge gaps, which was contrary to expectations; (2) high levels of community neighborhood  newspaper publicity about issues appeared to lead to reduced knowledge disparities; (3) contrary to previous findings, conflict appeared not to have contributed to reduced knowledge gaps; (4) distributing information more widely did not necessarily lead to equalization of knowledge; and (5) organized groups' information strategies may have contributed to higher knowledge levels among the least educated.

        "description":"Computers, if programed to respond to writer-generated content with heuristic strategies, can guide the writer in the prewriting stage. Heuristics are problem solving strategies that can aid the writer in exploring a topic either through a systematic posting of relevant questions or through an unsystematic process of free-association. To date the only experimental research linking computers and heuristics has been Hugh Burns's &quot;Stimulating Rhetorical Invention in English Composition through Computer-Assisted Instruction,&quot; which found that, in a 30-minute period, computer assisted systematic heuristics generated a greater quantity of ideas than traditional unsystematic heuristics. However, the study never determined if the use of computer assisted instruction (CAI) to stimulate  rhetorical invention actually helped the writer to write. In a current study, CAI instruction in invention is being compared with traditional classroom invention instruction. The study makes a distinction between systematic and unsystematic heuristics and will look at the quality of the ideas produced by measuring the proportion of ideas used in the actual writing that were produced in the heuristic exercises. This study may show not only that CAI employed during the invention stage helps writers write, but that CAI using systematic heuristics will provide the most beneficial combination.

        "description":"Instructors' knowledge of linguistics can affect the way they teach writing. For example, in traditional linguistics, O. Jespersen's important contribution is his descriptive rather than prescriptive study of English in a historical context. Writing teachers influenced by Jespersen will place students in writing situations where they do not rely on their conscious attention to prescriptive rules but rather practice writing according to the norms of acceptable prose. In structural linguistics, L. Bloomfield's and C. C. Fries' form classes may influence teachers to describe words and word sequences according to their functions and position in sentences. While ideas from transformational-generative grammar may seem more remote to teaching writing, the concept of linguistic  competence offers a good rationale for engaging students in writing tasks without offering them any prior, formal instruction in grammar. These connections between linguistic theories and teaching practices offer teachers a wealth of resources for creating writing pedagogies. One pedagogical model for writing that can help teachers plan their program is rooted in such linguistic theories as multidialectalism, code-switching, and sentence pattern analysis as well as in learning theories such as transfer learning, operant conditions, and sequencing. Such model building allows teachers to discover theories in writing education and translate them into justifiable teaching practices. (HOD)",

In one approach to college English, students spend most of the first semester studying nineteenth century novels. After having studied four such novels, each for between two and four weeks, students have acquired a confidence in their abilities to read and analyze the literature of another country. During the second semester, therefore, the students are able to survey an expanse of English poetry that previously would have crushed them under its metaphorical weight. Rather than having students study the poetry en masse, certain poems are selected and collected into six short units, chronologically ordered.  From there the students move into plays or short novels. In this way, they focus not on chronology, not on themes, but on the works themselves. By the time the students reach twentieth century literature, they can better appreciate it because they understand what precedes it.

Students begin by reading the &quot;New York Times&quot; the day of and following their birthdays. They isolate three or four news items that interest them, and are ready to begin research. After checking leads in periodical indexes, the card catalog, almanacs, and biographies, students limit themselves to a single topic. Their introduction to the library and its resources becomes a systematic process of  discovery. This assignment met several objectives. Students learned to use a variety of resources from the library, following a systematic course of investigation. They learned to limit a topic from materials gathered and to formulate a thesis. They learned about a time in their past lives that is meaningful to the present. But, most importantly, this project satisfed my desire of having a research project that is both relevant and interesting to my students. (KC)",

Data were gathered from 119 respondents concerning 34 access centers in major metropolitan areas in the United States. The findings indicated that the number of cable access centers is growing, and that the majority of them are funded directly by the local cable company (or indirectly through a city's use of franchise fees). Most centers have paid directors and staff and state-of-the-art equipment, but differ widely in their number of programing hours and the programing content. In addition, the study found that access coalitions existed in the majority of  communities with a center, and that at least half of the centers were required as a condition of the franchise agreement. Oversight by the local cable company appeared to be important to the level of activity of a center, and most centers engaged in public information practices, although the degree and techniques varied.

Effective use of the Japanese theatre's acting or production techniques requires knowledge of the forces producing its specific styles and techniques. Noh and Kabuki drama harmonize music, dance, and drama to create an awareness of elegance, form, the universe, peace, the role of humanity, and beauty. Scrupulously preserved over centuries, these plays try to reproduce an ideal form--never a major concern in western theatre. Western adaptations fail because they adopt the masks, costumes, and movement of Japanese theatre without considering the function these stylized elements were designed to fulfill. The search for an aesthetic as chronicled by the great  Japanese actors of the past offers valuable lessons to Western theatre. Anyone looking for guidance from the Japanese theatre or any foreign art form must assimilate a set of cultural realities first and then metamorphose that into an art form. In terms of technique, this requires total immersion in the culture's form and content, rather than imitation of its surface. (HTH)",

In addition, subjects were asked questions designed to measure their political knowledge and interest and their media exposure. The study revealed significant relationships between parents' and children's levels of political knowledge, discussion, and media exposure, indicating that children in families with concept-oriented FCPs tended also to become concept-oriented. In a surprising finding, the data showed that sociooriented FCPs--patterns emphasizing harmonious  communication--inhibited political interest only for the older children in the sample (those in grades 11 and 12 as opposed to grades 4 and 5), which suggested that until children reached the formal operations stage in cognitive development, they did not recognize inconsistencies between the conflict inherent in politics and efforts to maximize harmonious personal relationships. These results suggest that both the nature and the effects of parent-child communication may depend on messages stressed by parents and the children's own abilities and goals.

        "description":"On-campus credit courses for the professional development of community college faculty have proven to be a highly effective means of improving the quality of instruction at McLennan Community College (Waco, Texas). If carefully designed, implemented, and evaluated, these courses can provide an appropriate alternative to faculty enrollment in postgraduate courses at other institutions. A successful program of professional development courses must include a clear recognition of the faculty's instructional needs and interests; offer faculty members maximum convenience, economy, and time efficiency; and utilize appropriate evaluative procedures to determine the courses' instructional value for both the enrolled faculty members and their own students. (Extensive appendixes include  explanations of professional development requirements and salary schedule credits, a sample course proposal and prospectus, the syllabus and evaluation of a faculty workshop, and a list of noncredit seminars and credit courses offered at the community college.)

The content must also be balanced between the practical/professional and the abstract/academic aspects of the speech writer's function in society. In reality, corporate and government speech writers may have to perform many duties besides writing, write about unfamiliar topics for people they do not know or with whom they cannot consult, and accept criticism for poor speeches more often than praise for good ones. To take these realities into consideration and find the balance between professional and academic aspects of speech writing, speech writing  courses must ignore delivery skills and concentrate on structure, evidence, and style. A seminar format allows students to polish the organization of a speech and improve style through revision. (A course overview and schedule and assignments for a speech writing seminar are included.)

First, it clarifies the philosophical assumptions underlying different approaches to analysis, specifying a conceptual focus, particularly with regard to the situation and the inference of actor intent in the study of the structure of interaction. Then, using that focus, the paper draws upon previous negotiation research to propose a conceptual definition of negotiation as a type of &quot;situation set&quot; and a related definition of negotiation competence. It explores the areas of discourse work required for negotiating competently, deriving a set of constitutive rules for speech events at either end of a competitive  continuum. Finally, it discusses the usefulness of such a rules set and probes its implications for future research. (Author/FL)",

Using Jean Piaget's ideas that preoperational children both are unable to comprehend transformations and are &quot;perceptually bound,&quot; the study predicted that preoperational children would express more fear at the events depicted in the transformation and posttransformation segments, or whenever the &quot;Hulk&quot; was present in &quot;monstrous&quot; form. In contrast, it hypothesized that concrete operational children would express more fear during the pretransformation  segments, when the &quot;human&quot; hero--David--was in danger. Both predictions were confirmed, as was the theory that preoperational subjects would rate the two manifestations of the hero (David and the Hulk) as significantly more distinct than would concrete operational subjects.

        "description":"A review of the role of theory and research in the teaching of public speaking reveals that although speech models have been an important pedagogical tool since the beginning of systematic instruction in public speaking, research investigating the value of model speeches is limited. A 1966 survey of 861 instructors in public speaking indicated that while theorists agreed that both good and bad models should be used to illustrate the principles of speech making, few were able to offer specific suggestions on appropriate usage. The few empirical studies on modeling suggest that models enhance skill development but do not reduce performance apprehension more than other techniques such as thinking over speeches before giving them. A. Bandura's social learning theory, however, which  focuses on the role of modeling in human behavior, offers a useful framework for further research. It describes four basic functions in modeling (acquiring new, appropriate behavior patterns, facilitating appropriate behavior, removing inhibitions from fear-provoking behaviors, and promoting the direct or vicarious extinction of fear); presents factors influencing the effectiveness of modeling; and suggests variations in the process of modeling.

A communication apprehension measure and a questionnaire on perceptions of videotape use in class were completed by 230 undergraduate basic speech students. The findings demonstrated a moderate relationship between communication apprehension level and both willingness to be videotaped and attitude toward class use of videotaping. A majority of students' comments were self-related, focusing, for example, on how students might be viewed by others when videotaped, and indicating a connection between self-concept and degree of communication apprehension. The findings suggest that speech teachers should use  videotaping cautiously in beginning courses. Student skills are more likely to be enhanced in advanced elective courses where the levels of communication apprehension are generally lower. (HTH)",

Although overlapping at points, empathy and role taking/perspective taking appear to be, respectively, affective and cognitive subsets of decentering. In addition to indicating that self-other differentiation is a multidimensional process, the literature suggests that the intensity of this differentiation is variable and the relationship between communication and self-other differentiation  is not linear, for communication can occur without decentering.

Two-thirds or more of both sexes used 10 of these 19 descriptors to characterize their PCEs: a sense of the significance, beauty, and value of their communication; loss of awareness of time and place; an experience of spontaneity, and affection for and acceptance of the other person; and a recognition of the other person's uniqueness. Corroborating Maslow's speculation that males and females might not come by their peak experiences in the same ways, a larger percentage of females than males portrayed their PCEs as (1) seeing  the other in a richer way, (2) feeling that the experience was almost more than one could bear, (3) resolving opposites, (4) giving acceptance and love, (5) being released from fear, (6) experiencing spontaneity and effortlessness, and (7) feeling playful and creative.

In many cases the evaluation system used is the problem. This book discusses teacher evaluation by providing characteristics separating effective and less effective systems. It presents eight commonalities identified in effective evaluation programs. In building a system, three characteristics are desirable: an appropriate attitude toward evaluation, an evaluation model complementary to the desired purpose, and separation of administrative and supervisory behavior. Also, an effective system should (1) set goals (presented are three approaches: management by objectives, performance objectives, and practical goal setting), (2) focus narrowly on teaching, (3)  improve classroom observation skills, and (4) use additional sources of data (peer evaluation, student performance, parent evaluation, student evaluation, and self evaluation are discussed). After building an evaluation system, a training program should be designed that addresses the skills needed. Recommended training focuses on the teaching-learning process and on the enhancement of teacher-supervisor relationships. Included is an appendix giving an example of an evaluation system reflecting the commonalities of successful systems. (MD)",

The performance criteria used included performance ratings by three different groups (supervisors, teachers, and support staff) and school climate ratings from three different groups (teachers, students, and support staff). The results show a significant relationship between the assessment center placement recommendations and the supervisor, teacher, and support staff ratings. The school climate ratings (by group) did not significantly correlate with the assessment center ratings. The author notes that the data in this study represent the first validation of the use of assessment center technology in the selection of school  administrators and suggests that assessment centers should be useful selection devices in most educational settings. The report includes a list of references and six tables. (MD)",

Court opinions about religious observances and activities in public schools include decisions regarding Bible reading and prayer, the uses of religious holidays and symbols, the religious content of graduation exercises, and the distribution of religious literature in public schools. The author further examines the judicial balancing between the constitutional protections of religious exercise and the government's requirements for compulsory schooling and mandated areas of  curriculum. The legal challenges offered to public school curricula are also analyzed, including efforts to introduce the teaching of creationism and to censor instructional materials in public schools. Finally, the book addresses the problems in the relationship of the states and parochial schools by noting the judicial interpretations (both federal and state) regarding the various forms of aid to parochial schools--transportation aid, loans for services, tax relief for parents of parochial school students--and discusses the lawsuits and decisions relevant to the question of the state's authority to regulate parochial schools and home education programs.

These are based on the evaluation of finance plans in terms of the following stated principles: educational equality and financial equity, educational program and school finance, leadership, diversity of revenue sources, and local control. The Task Force, concerned with the issues of adequacy of funding and reducing the complexity of funding programs, concluded that there is a need for local access to a broader financial resource base and that the province should set a goal to improve four grant areas: small school assistance grant, small school jurisdiction grant, declining enrollment grant, and supplementary requisition equalization grant. The Task Force also found that  there is no acceptable definition of &quot;basic education&quot; and suggested an operational definition. It recommended further study of leadership and found no acceptable tax source for new revenue raising for school boards. The Task Force concluded that provincial controls on school board supplementary requisitions are inappropriate and recommended changes to simplify grant formulas while specifying that the grant purposes should still be fulfilled. The report includes a selected bibliography and three appendixes. (MD)",

He asked the Task Force to reconvene and consider the questions he raised. The remainder of this report is their reply. Reaffirming the recommendations in the 1982 report, the Task Force responded specifically to the minister's questions and concluded that (1) an 85/15 cost share ratio represents a long term goal achievable by methods outlined in the reply, (2) the province's annual education budget should not be a fixed proportion of whatever Alberta school boards choose to  spend, (3) some regulation of local supplementary requisitions is acceptable, (4) provincial &quot;financial&quot; control should be effected through the use of guidelines, and (5) the definition of an educational plan translatable into financial terms may be desirable.

Research reviews have shown specific elements of schooling at the classroom, building, and district levels that promote school effectiveness in the areas of leadership, school environment, classroom instruction and management, curriculum, and assessment and evaluation. Using a NWREL-developed &quot;Resource Kit&quot; of references containing specific methods and techniques, the team looks to the resources to better understand the methodology necessary to reach their previously selected improvement goal. As each  practice or group of practices is implemented, the leadership team monitors its progress according to its plan, the actual practices, and the changes in student achievement and/or behavior. As each implementation plan developed by the school leadership team is completed and practices are put into place in the school, the team once again begins the process, incorporating new research findings that may be available.

The paper presents a multidimentional analysis of school segregation and integration. Educational statistics are cited illustrating that academic achievement of blacks, who today comprise 20 percent of the students in Portland's public schools, is very low. Concern over racial segregation in the city's public schools first surfaced in the early 1960's. Conflicts since that time up to the present have generated numerous committees and commissions, a student transfer program, desegregation plans, and accounts of institutional racism encountered by black students bused to white schools. The final part of the paper  describes the Black United Front (BUF), which questions both the theoretical-juridical underpinnings and practical outcomes of busing. The BUF has demanded parent involvement in the education of children, in changes in the curriculum, and in selection of teachers and principals. (MLF)",

The paper first defines the concepts of organizational linkages, change implementation, and field agent strategies. Next, research procedures and background information are provided. Finally, the paper describes how different change strategies were appropriate or inappropriate in each subunit.

The Metropolitan Learning Center (MLC), while providing an alternative environment for learning, is significantly different from the other programs reviewed in that participation in the K-12 program is a result of intentional parental choice. Participation in the remaining seven alternative programs is usually a consequence of inability to succeed both  academically and socially in a regular school program. Each alternative program allows for a smaller, more family-like instructional setting. The Night School at Grant serves students who have already dropped out of regular high school programs. Two other programs provide part time supplementary education services as incentives to influence students to remain in the regular school; two operate full time schedules concurrent with the regular schools; and two provide comprehensive high school education in a separate physical setting.

The issues of the social forces influencing the reorganizations, the making of the decisions to create middle schools, and the planning stages lead to considering such policy influences as the effects of desegregation and declining enrollment.

Data gathering procedures included ethnographic observations and interviews of principals; principals' logs of time use; interviews with teachers, school administrators, and students; and faculty surveys. The findings were analyzed to identify &quot;cultural themes&quot; dealing with instructional leadership and to develop composite pictures of the principals' leadership. The bulk of the report consists of case studies incorporating anecdotal and quantitative presentations of such topics as the community, characteristics of the school, composition of students and faculty, a profile of the principal, the principal's exercise of instructional leadership, faculty and  student perceptions, the principal's interventions for instructional improvement and their effects, and the school's leadership structure, including the role of other influential staff. General findings indicate that principals can improve learning by establishing explicit policies for achieving clearly expressed goals, effectively using slogans in support of those goals, improving the learning climate, and having someone devote attention to the curriculum. The conclusion is that the principals studied give priority to student discipline and school management and need inservice education to become instructional leaders. Principals can provide general instructional leadership while support staff with special expertise offer more specific leadership.

The principals studied were selected with the help of expert opinion and student test scores. Data comprise ethnographic observations and interviews of the principals over 17 weeks; interviews with teachers, other administrators, and students; school observations; logging of principals' time use; school records; and faculty surveys. Results include the finding that principals in three schools focused attention on important instructional goals and used slogans as an attempt to rally support for those goals. In three schools principals created a more positive learning climate by establishing a  general appearance of cleanliness and sense of order and discipline. In every school attention was given to the curriculum, and these efforts were successful when closely monitored and led by someone respected by teachers. Teacher supervision was ineffective in most cases. In none of the schools was the principal perceived as an instructional leader; rather, other staff members were influential, and principals devoted their attention to pupil discipline. The concluding discussion recommends that principals function as generalists providing teachers with vision, direction, and coordination while assigning leadership responsibilities to competent support staff.

        "description":"A longitudinal, comparative case study examines the impact of enrollment decline on and the response to it by 15 suburban school districts in 2 metropolitan areas. Data were collected during 1978-81 through interviews, observation of public meetings, documentary and statistical sources, and case histories developed for each district from 1964-81. The central issues examined in this report are: the impact upon public school governance of the changeover from growth and relative affluence to declining enrollments and tight budgets; the effect of such changes on policymaking and conflict management in declining school districts; the characteristics of such districts in such key factors as socioeconomic status, fiscal circumstances and conflict propensity; and the perceived  consequences of decline for educational programs, educational service delivery, students and teachers. The study suggests that the rational planning approach provides more successful retrenchment decisions than those produced by more political or ad hoc approaches. Six tables include selected data on enrollments and community socioeconomic status, enrollment decline and fiscal strain, and changes in size, occupation, income, and education of population. Five appendixes summarize the original study, present interviews and fieldwork, examine measurements and causes of fiscal strain, outline problems and limitations of citizens' advisory committees, and list publications emanating from the project.

        "description":"This sourcebook presents results of a recent case study of how principals are selected in American public school districts. Part 1 (chapters 1-3) describes and evaluates conventional selection practices in 10 randomly supplied school districts according to a five-step process: vacancy announcememts, selection criteria, applicant pools, screening, and employment decisions. These procedures as currently practiced do not do justice to the importance of the principalship, nor do they manifest any consistent likelihood of attracting or selecting the best qualified candidates. Chapter 3, &quot;Pathways to the Principalship,&quot; provides case histories of five principals of varying competence, in order to illustrate the vagaries of the selection process from the applicants' perspective. Part 2  (chapters 4 and 5) describes three promising alternative procedures currently in use at five school districts: (1) assessment centers; (2) district operated internships; and (3) &quot;exemplary&quot; common practices. A comparative analysis follows, delineating the difference between the conventional practices described in part 1 and these alternatives. The essential advantages of the latter derive from sequential screening, which provides more objective, reliable, and comprehensive data for assessing applicants, so that appointments are based more on merit than on contingencies. The result is greater credibility for the selection process and a corresponding enhancement in prestige for the principal. Guidelines are included for developing or revising a principal selection procedure. (TE)",

The ongoing diagnostic process of identifying conditions that reduce the effectiveness of supervision is termed organizational learning. The importance of involving the entire school system is emphasized, and the initial participation of senior level administrators is stressed. It is explained that data collected at each level of the system could be used to construct an organizational map identifying conditions for error and the effects on the school's social system. Feedback and potential solutions are then considered. Conditions for implementing organizational learning are summarized. The author offers an example of such organizational learning  undertaken at a residential school for handicapped students.

The bulk of the document is composed of project evaluations, both internal and external, during the project's first 2 years. Internal evaluation included formative week-by-week feedback and summative pre-post data, while external evaluation relied on interviews with parents and co-trainers.

Hertlein begin with &quot;Integrating Remedial Education in Olympia Public Schools: A Consulting Service Model for Low Performing and Handicapped Students.&quot; They describe the model's staff development modules, instructional support strategies, and management procedures. T. Fairchild analyzes &quot;The School Psychologist's Role as an Assessment Consultant,&quot; which covers such aspects as instrument selection, staff development, acting as staffing facilitator, and information synthesis. B. Ehlert examines problems with the measurement of severe discrepancy in &quot;Identifying Learning Disabled Students in Idaho.&quot; In &quot;Social Behavior Survival: Preparing Handicapped Children for the Realities of Mainstream  Classrooms,&quot; H. Walker and R. Hersh focus on the importance of teacher social behavior standards and expectations. A model of assessment being implemented in American Samoa is described by C. Starlin in &quot;Observation + Screening + Assessment: Determining Children in Need of Special Education Services.&quot; The Resource Specialist Program for handicapped students with limited English Proficiency (LEP) is briefly described by O. Martinez in &quot;Issues in Assessment and Service Delivery to LEP and Bilingual Handicapped Children.&quot; In his &quot;Legal Review of Assessment Issues,&quot; S. Rosenfeld touches on court rulings and regulatory actions since the enactment of P.L. 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. G.

The authors discuss the integration efforts for two children with severe/multiple handicaps and one with autism and report on findings from site visits across the United States and intensive case studies in New York State. Among integration efforts noted are mainstreamed lunch, art, and music groups; shopping as a community skills program for high schoolers; and inclusion of multiply handicapped child into small group kindergarten play. Reluctance of some teachers and administrators is considered along with new ideas of education held by others who have successfully integrated severely handicapped  students. Three approaches to education (clinical-treatment perspective, functional life skills perspective, and developmental learner perspective) are discussed, and the advantages to integration of the whole life/functional perspective are stressed.

Research on referral addresses such aspects as reasons for referral, causes ascribed for difficulties, pre-referral classroom intervention, teachers' desired outcomes, and effects of institutional constraints and external pressures. Studies of academic responding time examined differences between students in regular and learning disabilities classrooms, with consideration of seven major topics including differences as a function of teacher-perceived academic and behavioral competence and students' reading group placement. The report recommends that classroom intervention be  undertaken prior to a comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation of the student and following a teacher's referral. Interventions, it is suggested, should be based on classroom ecological variables. A response by a school psychologist concurs with the need for classroom intervention and suggests that psychologists work individuallly with children and teachers to develop a solution to the problem.

Four basic categories of definitions were reflected in the categories provided by the 118 teachers: ability-achievement discrepancy, achievement deficit, test scatter, and processing disorder. Reported criteria were characterized by variability, even within states, as were the teachers' stated agreement or disagreement with them. Findings suggested that the characteristics of students declared eligible for LD services are situation specific and do not reflect current knowledge, and that the criteria are vague and nonspecific. The need for alternative approaches to the  identification of LD students was emphasized. (Author/CL)",

During instructional sessions, the boy was taught and measured on sets of difficult spelling words. Graphed data were analyzed using a concurrent schedule design whereby equivalent behaviors are treated simultaneously with different approaches to determine relative treatment effects. One treatment approach involved the following data-utilization rule: if the student's performance fell below the expected level on 3 consecutive days, the teacher made changes in the student's program. In the second treatment, the teacher made changes in the student's program every 5 to 10 days. Results indicated that, in the second data-utilization  condition, the student's trend lines over a 6-week treatment period were superior to trend lines in the first data-utilization condition.

A \"manual\" sample composed of four Special Education Local Planning Agencies (SELPAs) that did not use computers was surveyed and responses compared with SELPAs that did use computers. An analysis of computer programs available nationally was also made. (Descriptions are appended.) Among findings were that costs of an IEP varied from $35 to $720 depending on the number of professionals involved; that IEP manual paperwork and documentation were considered useful by parents, teachers, and administrators (with teachers having a more positive attitude than in an earlier study); that 30 systems were identified nationally as producing all or  part of an IEP; that computers have helped make the paperwork process more useful for daily instruction; that parents, teachers, and administrators reported satisfaction with computerized IEPs; that dollar and time savings were reported for annual review meetings using computer assisted IEPs; and that computer programs for IEPs were available for $99.00 to $9,995.00. Recommendations were made to administrators of SELPAs as well as to the California State Department of Education. A five-page executive summary precedes the report.

Studies are reported on the forms in which deaf readers recode the printed text. Findings noted include that deaf readers--specifically, second generation deaf readers whose native language was American Sign Language--did not recode phonologically but rather in sign, which was not judged to be the optimal strategy. A second topic of study, the purpose of recoding, is described in terms of the role of memory demands; conflicting results are noted. A final area of recoding research discussed is the use of morphological and phonological constraints in reading. Conclusions suggest that  an important purpose of recoding is to allow the use of one's primary language with its inherent advantages of memory and comprehension. (CL)",

Ss were categorized to examine effects of severity of seizure type, age of seizure onset, and sex. As a group, vocational interest scores on the General Occupational Theme Scales were not greatly different from normals. Results indicated that Ss with major motor seizures and males with early seizure onset showed less scientific interest, and that Ss with major motor seizures also indicated less academic interest than normals. The more impaired males appeared to be \"at risk\" for having their general interests restricted and in being less confortable in academic settings. Findings suggested that \"at risk\" males may benefit from specific  interventions such as supportive counseling. Explorative, \"hands on\" activities in vocational education courses and in household domestic chores should be encouraged. In comparing interests, future studies should further examine the influence of duration and degree of disablement as critical variables affecting vocational interests. (Author/CL)",

Based in part on B. Keogh and J. Margolis's component analysis of attending skills in learning disabled children (skills of coming to attention, sustaining attention, and making decisions and including educationally important behaviors such as impulsivity and auditory attending), the scale's preliminary version showed adequate interrater reliability and modest relation to observational criteria. The initial study involved two teachers rating 17 children in classes for the learning disabled. Results indicate the scale's potential usefulness in assessing attention deficit disorder if it can be further developed to  provide greater validity in assessing target behavior areas. (Author/CL)",

Eight programs are described in detail, and four are briefly covered. Descriptions touch on background, salient characteristics, and evaluation of the program. Projects described focus on daily living and vocational skills, cooperative vocational approaches in a rural area, prevocational experiences associated with community sites for mentally retarded students, work study experience programs, an employment exploration program, engineered classrooms, and a  multicategorical resource center. A concluding section summarizes 12 characteristics of successful programs, including a strong instructional staff, strong administrative support, effective communication skills, a curriculum based on developing independent life skills and preparing for careers, and support from community advisory and parent groups.

        "description":"The text examines issues in the roles of allied health professionals serving disabled children and youth. An introduction by C. Del Polito reviews the effects of negative public attitudes toward people with disabilities and describes an advocacy project to serve allied health professionals. In unit 1, J. Barresi traces the history of public policy regarding children with handicaps, describes the differences between federal and state law, and considers the future of P.L. 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, in light of court rulings and actions by the Reagan administration. A. Bashir examines the roles and responsibilities of health professionals in serving handicapped children and youth in unit 2. Emphasis on the importance of communication as a competence for  allied health professionals is addressed and suggestions for improving communication are presented by C. Del Polito in the third unit. Screening, assessment, planning and review of educational and health related services are focused on by A. Bashir in unit 4, with a section listing the definition, high risk indicators, behavioral indices, classification considerations, assessment issues, and intervention aspects for a variety of handicapping conditions. Strategies for referral, coordination, and management of services are considered in a chapter by J. Wittenmyer. Advocacy is the topic of the final chapter written by E. Ellis. Individual and collective advocacy are reviewed as are resources for effective advocacy. Appended information includes selected P.L. 94-142 regulations and a listing  of national and federal organizations and groups. An accompanying instructor's guide presents guidelines on preparing for and presenting a workshop on the text.

Helge), looks at recent improvements, remaining challenges, and current functioning; policy recommendations are offered for national and state policy makers; (2) \"Generic Problems or Solutions in Rural Special Education\" (by L. Marrs) suggests that though certain problems are universal in rural areas there is no agreement regarding generalizable solutions which will work in all rural areas; (3) \"Regional Rural Special Education Programs--A Case Study of Problems, Practices, and Positive Steps,\" (by K. Kirmer et al), uses the Central Kansas Cooperative in Education as an example  of how central beliefs, early structuring decisions, and operating procedures have aided in dealing with the rural regional special education delivery problems; (4) \"Models for Serving Rural Children with Low-Incidence Handicapping Conditions\" (by D. Helge) stresses that there is no single appropriate rural service delivery model and delineates factors that must be considered by the rural service delivery model planner; (5) \"Providing for Rural Gifted Children within an Assortment of Services Model\" (by G. Gear) notes the problems of programming for gifted students when numbers are low and stresses the need for staff to innovate and use existing community resources; (6) \"A Band Wagon without Music--Preparing Rural Special Educators\" (by L. Marrs) notes the irrelevance of many traditional  special educator preparation programs and identifies competencies and curriculum elements which should be in preservice programs; (7) \"Technological Tools for Rural Special Education\" (by A. Hofmeister) notes the potential of the new technologies if rural educators prepare themselves to capitalize on the advantages and avoid the problems they offer; (8) \"Technologies in Rural Special Education Problem Solvers--A Status Report and Successful Strategies\" (by D. Helge) discusses applications for instructional support, direct instruction, management, and staff development. The final paper; (9) \"Should a Special Educator Entertain Volunteers--Interdependence in Rural America\" (L. Marrs) describes the National Rural Independent Living Network and suggests strategies for designing a volunteer  program, for recruiting and training volunteers, and for linking volunteers with disabled persons.

It was expected that exposure to Latin would improve students' English reading and language arts skills. Participating teachers were provided with curriculum materials, staff development activities, and contacts with experienced Latin teachers. Of 60 participants, 32 successfully completed college courses offered under the program. Teacher participation was positively associated with improved student performance on two of four reading and language  arts tests.

        "description":"The third and fourth years of Project PACT (Parents and Children Together) were evaluated. The program was designed to involve Hispanic parents from an impoverished Philadelphia neighborhood in the education of their children in a bilingual school. The project consisted of two major components: a summer program to introduce parents to the school curriculum, and a school year program serving parents and other community members. Pupil performance on standardized tests, pupil attendance, and interviews with parents were used to assess the effects of parent participation in the programs. Parent participation in the summer program was associated with significant pupil improvements in reading skills, language arts, and attendance. Parents reported that they had learned ways to assist  their children with reading and mathematics school work.

        "description":"The vocabulary development in the first 11 weeks of English acquisition by a 5-year-old Japanese girl was studied. The girl and her mother (a linguistic researcher) arrived in the United States at the start of the study. Lexical data from a language diary kept by the mother and from adult and peer sessions were pooled to produce a chronological corpus of vocabulary acquisition. The words in the chronological vocabulary corpus were classified according to semantic class. Lexical acquisition proceeded more rapidly than in first language development, with 75 words acquired by 7 weeks and 171 by 11 weeks. General nominals constituted 48% and multiword gestalt type lexical items constituted 12% of the total lexicon. Verbs, modifiers, and pronouns were more frequent than typically  found in first language lexicons. Only 15% of the first 75 words and 11% of the total lexicon of 171 words were ever overextended. Overinclusive categorizing was less prominent and overextensions expressing presyntactic relations were relatively more prominent than in first language learning. It is concluded that vocabulary acquisition in second language development differs in a number of ways from first language lexical development. (Author/RW)",

The sample consisted of 14 Saudi Arabian nationals aged 18 to 21 years enrolled in college level technical vocabulary classes. The study involved three weeks of treatment followed by a test of retention. The superlearning approach involved the use of music, relaxation, and rhythmic speaking to increase retention of factual material. Results of using the superlearning approach were inconclusive. The data indicate no individual effects from the relaxation or the relaxation combined with background music treatments. Although a slight difference was found between the two groups on the posttest mean scores, the  cumulative effects of relaxation, background music, and special teacher phrasing probably did not account for this result. It is concluded that further studies are needed to create a valid comparison of the superlearning method with other methods. Such a study should observe larger numbers of students over longer periods of time. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"English for native speakers is compared and contrasted with English for non-native speakers by examining the influence of Moffett's (1968) structural curriculum for native speakers and the notional functional syllabus approach for second language learners. Both approaches are more rhetorical and less grammatical then the approaches that preceded them. The structural curriculum posits that the fundamental structure of discourse is a set of relations between sender, receiver, and message. In the notional functional syllabus, the learning units are not situations but semantic or notional categories such as time; space; and the sentential case relations of agent, initiator, and object. Structural curriculum strives to mirror the psychological growth of the learner while  notional-functional syllabi do not. The former approach also attempts to provide general linguistic skills (usually for children) while the latter works best with adults whose language needs can be precisely determined. It is concluded that teachers of both native speakers and of second language speakers can benefit from using certain aspects of the two methodologies. The structural curriculum approach can readily be applied to teaching the kind of communicative competence English as a second language progjrams strive for. Notional functional syllabi seem best suited to assist in the teaching of native speakers by integrating the study of grammar and the study of writing. (RW)",

Historical and comparative studies were conducted of medieval Jewish communities, the Navajo community, a northern New Mexico village, and the countries of Paraguay and Tonga. The goal of the case studies was to develop a model for the development of literacy in the vernacular that can then be applied to the education of minority populations. Papers generated during the course of the studies are reprinted in nine chapters. The implications of the case studies for the choice of a language for initial literacy in bilingual education are discussed. It is concluded that a sociolinguistic model for vernacular literacy should include such factors as (1) the nature and language of literacy introduction, (2)  the status of those accepting literacy, (3) the functions for which it is used, (4) the existence of political independence and control of the educational system, and (5) the continued use of the language. Necessary conditions for vernacular literacy include acceptance by traditionally influential members of the community, use for native functions, and maintenance by a locally controlled educational system.

Legal aid needs of off-campus students are greater due to possible disagreements concerning tenancy, security deposits, housing code compliance, utility bills, exterminators, and increased risk of traffic tickets and accidents. A free monthly legal clinic was founded by setting up a table for a lawyer and an OCC staffer in a highly trafficked area on campus. Tremendous response to the sessions resulted in making the &quot;Free Legal Clinic&quot; a weekly event with the later addition of evening legal clinics. For more complicated problems, students can set up an appointment with a community-recruited lawyer staffing the  clinic. There is a $10 refundable charge for the first 30 minutes, with any future meetings paid for by the students. In addition, OCC has published a small claims court handbook describing court procedures and encouraging people to prepare themselves for their day in court as well as a booklet which is a step-by-step guide to collecting the hard-earned judgments. The necessary legal forms are available at no cost from the clinic. (JW)",

Traditionally, the budget has been separated from performance evaluation, and state formulas have evolved from the need for funding to be objective, comparable, and predictable. The Performance Funding Project in Tennessee, which was started in 1974 by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, was designed to accomplish the following: to sharpen institutional mission, to complement the enrollment-based formula, to objectively measure educational outcomes, to measure the educational &quot;value added&quot; by each institution, and to promote institutional excellence without competition. After establishing pilot projects and developing assessment measures, the Tennessee  Commission established the performance concept within the state's budget formulas. To provide a profile for funding, an Instructional Evaluation Schedule was developed based on the following variables: program accreditation; program field evaluation, institution-wide education outcomes (general education outcomes, placements in vocational fields); instructional improvement based on referent group surveys (students, alumni, community leaders); and planning for instructional program improvement.

        "description":"The role of the U.S. government in higher education finance and the ability and willingness of the states to support higher education at past levels are discussed. In the United States, financing is decentralized and pluralistic: federal, state, and local governments--as well as students, alumni, and private enterprise--all contribute. The states, which have the basic responsibility for education, have organized their institutions and finance systems differently. In terms of each state's ability to support higher education, the support for all public services has been eroded by the tax revolt of the late 1970s and by inflation. In addition to enrollment declines, there are other reasons why higher education may face reduced state revenues, including the belief of some legislators  that many students can afford to pay more for their education and the fact that institutional budgets are not specified by statute. Four phases of federal activity since World War II illustrate how incentives have changed for institutions: (1) benefits for GI's, 1946-1957; (2) the reaction to Sputnik, 1958-1966; (3) access and civil rights, 1967-1980; and (4) and the new federalism under President Reagan, 1981-. The size of federal aid influences the state's design of its finance system. (SW)",

        "description":"Fiscal support for higher education and policy concerns at the state level during difficult financial times are discussed, with specific reference to the western states. States vary widely in several ways: the strength of their economies, the actions of legislatures and voters to reduce the revenues or the expenditure base of state and local governments, and the relative priority of higher education in competition for public resources. Some states in the West are expected to increase enrollments while others face declines. For institutions in states facing enrollment declines, fewer students usually mean fewer state dollars under enrollment-sensitive formulas. However, educational institutions can suffer with either more or less students. Areas of special concern to states are  student access and retention, which are affected by student charges and financial aid and by efforts to enroll minority groups and disabled students. The following recommendations are offered: charges should be established at levels which reduce the effect of price on student choice among the public segments, and some programs should be funded for longer than 1 and 2 years.

During the 1970s, the number of students increased by 24.3 percent, total educational and general revenues more than doubled, the state's proportion of these revenues rose by 5.2 percent, and the federal share fell by 6.1 percent. As a whole, the higher education institutions held their own throughout most of the 1970s. Two possible scenarios for the 1980s (pessimistic and optimistic) are considered concerning enrollments, curriculum and quality, personnel, relations with government, and the private colleges. It is argued that the ability of institutions to overcome key challenges will be the critical factor in  determining which scenario prevails. The following challenges posed by the American economy and society are addressed: demographics, economics, reindustrialization, and competition for students from business and industry. Additionally, the relationship between higher education and governments is discussed with respect to state-level formulas, demands for increasing accountability, and competition in the budget process.

        "description":"Basic values in higher education and the way that values are made operational are discussed in an article and three responses to the article. Conflicts among values in American higher education and the structures of accommodation are also addressed. In addition to valuing liberal arts studies, professional education, and research, competence in these pursuits is highly valued. Achieving equality and equity for students and staff is also desired, and another set of values links together choice, initiative, innovation, criticism, and variety. Expectations of individuality and self-expression are also raised by democratic values. Finally, there is always a body of interests that pertain to the operation of the state, particular regions, and the nation as a whole. The structures of  accommodation that abate conflict among contradictory values are many, within and among institutions. It is concluded that in the long run it is the structures of work and authority in higher education that largely determine who does what to whom, and what matters most about any structure are the values and principles it embodies. Structures can be studied at the level of national policy, state systems, and sectors. Brief responses to the article are provided by Hermann K. Bleibtreu, Charles E. Davis, and Fred F. Harcleroad.

Findings for the early 1970s include the following: the large increase in black college enrollment coincided with the expansion in both federal legislation and policies aimed at reducing barriers for minorities and low-income students; by 1975, the percent of black high school graduates who enrolled in college was the same as that for whites (although the high school graduation rates were still lower for blacks than for whites); and the increase in black college enrollment took place at the  undergraduate level. Among the findings for the last half of the 1970s are: the number of blacks who enrolled in college remained about the same, despite an almost 20 percent increase in the number of blacks eligible for college; and the number and proportion of degrees awarded to blacks remained about the same at the bachelor's, doctor's, and first-professional level, while there were substantial declines at the master's level.

        "description":"Approaches to develop a new understanding of academic careers are discussed. For many faculty members, a key issue is how to adjust their understanding of an ideal career to contemporary reality. During the 1970s, almost all of the professoriate saw its standard of living decline, a decline that stabilized by the early 1980s. Job mobility is seldom now a viable option. Under these conditions, tenured faculty may feel trapped at their institutions, and administrators also face a loss of flexibility in managing their tasks in the face of reduced funds. New information on adult development and new conditions for the academic profession have prompted efforts to revise the model of academic life established in the 1960s. The adult years are now seen as dynamic and marked by changes  that can be anticipated and identified by age, activities, interests, and psychological development. Recent thinking about careers stresses the need for progression, for changed roles and responsibilities. In addition to the common suggestion to promote teaching as an honorable calling, approaches to providing variety in the academic career include: providing opportunities for different types of teaching assignments, involvement in professional activities, special endeavors in research or curriculum development, and replacing tenure with a different evaluation system.

Faculty development is needed for at least three important reasons: knowing a subject does not mean an individual can effectively teach it; faculty need to learn how to teach and counsel adult students; and low enrollment and retrenchments result in heavily tenured faculty with few if any new faculty members added. Traditional faculty development has involved instructional development, personal development, and organizational development. Popular current approaches to faculty development include faculty growth contracts, instructional improvement centers focusing on human rather than material resources, and  the auditor-consultant program. The following recommendations to administrators who are responsible for faculty development are considered: involving the faculty in planning the program, attaining administrators' support, making the program comprehensive, and establishing a reward system. A comprehensive faculty development program will offer faculty opportunities to improve as teachers, to develop a supportive environment, and to develop personal values as a professional. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

Discussion topics included: who is responsible for stating expectations for student learning; whether expectations for the American educational system differ significantly from those of other advanced industrial democracies; and the impact of clarifying expectations on student performance and the behavior of schools/colleges. The panelists included employers from the public and private sectors; college faculty and members of learned societies representing the disciplines of biology, history, and foreign languages; state agency officials responsible for the oversight of requirements for diplomas; and representatives of  national independent educational organizations. Findings/themes included the following: expectations are a combination of objectives and standards; employers' expectations for postsecondary graduates entering white collar jobs reflect a desire for generalists, not specialists; there is considerable repetition in American education; and there is a national curriculum, with local and regional variations, that is reinforced by expectations implicit in the College Board Achievement Tests.

The following approaches that may help promote the transition to postsecondary education were addressed: modes to condense studies, including advanced placement and time-shortened degrees; programs that bring high  school students to campus for a combination of academic work, career exposure, and social activities; arrangements for sending college students and/or faculty to high schools on a regular basis for both academic and advisement purposes; offering high school students college courses that are taught by high school teachers; pre- and post-matriculation programs that address academic and personal development of college freshmen; and programs that serve underprepared students.

        "description":"The preparation of high school students for the transition from secondary to postsecondary education is discussed by an official of the Chicago public schools. It is suggested that access to postsecondary education should not be linked solely to test scores without regard to achievement within the child's environment. Recent statistics show that in Chicago's public schools, fewer students who have completed graduation requirements are planning postsecondary education and training. Of the students planning to enter college in 1982, most are academically strong and can assume high college costs. Preparation of students for college requires cooperation between colleges and high schools, along with the assistance of secondary and postsecondary school guidance counselors.  Additionally, technology allows students to interact with the computer to explore career fields and college choices and to obtain an explanation of financial aid. The effect of the recession on students' college plans has been significant, and many middle-class applicants are applying to schools closer to home, state universities, and two-year community colleges, or to the military. In this time of uncertainty and diminished opportunities, the poor cannot afford to attend college. (SW)",

The principle emphasis of the public hearing was secondary education.  Themes include the following: education has a significant and complex relationship to our national purpose; articulation is a diffuse and poorly understood concept; college admissions policies, particularly those relying on formulas, cannot play a significant role in the enhancement of educational excellence; and guidance and advisement are important supports for students; college-level programs offered in high school.

Faculty from the four smallest (undermanned) and four largest liberal arts departments at Central Connecticut State College were surveyed regarding their academic activities and their attitudes toward peers. Of 118 full-time faculty members who were mailed a questionnaire, 85 responses were received. The questionnaire focused on faculty activities from fall 1979 to spring 1982, including committee work, research activities, and teaching. Respondent characteristics, interpersonal relations within the department, and overall job satisfaction were also addressed. The strongest evidence of undermanning effects was found on  indices reflecting time and energy commitments to the setting and concerns about its maintenance, while perceptions of colleagues did not appear to be affected. Overall, the results support some aspects of manning theory. Faculty in small departments seem more committed to their setting, with fewer sick days, more concerns about enrollment, and more participation in committee work. (Author/SW)",

Specific concerns included admissions standards, housing needs, campus and community orientation, transportation, health care, academic and personal support services, and reintegration into the native culture. Foreign students who stayed for the required year of study successfully earned their master's degrees. Universities involved in exchange programs should do the following: prepare the foreign students  for the experience before they leave their country, assist the student to adjust to cultural differences, relate their academic experiences to their nations' needs, and maintain close contact with the sponsoring agencies so that the participants effectively can be integrated into the educational systems of their homelands upon their return.

        "description":"An approach to integrating formative evaluation into externally-mandated program reviews in higher education is suggested. Externally-mandated reviews are generally concerned with the summative evaluation of academic programs. The first step is to classify the mandated program review criteria using a two-dimensional model. This model is based on a cross-classification of the two major dimensions of program sequence and program participants. The model can be used to examine externally-mandated program review criteria in order to determine aspects of a college program that are not currently being assessed. The next step is to develop criteria that can be used to enhance the utility of the mandated evaluation for formative purposes. Through the detailed assessment of program review  criteria and the interrelations between these criteria, a view of statewide and institutional priorities can be developed. Data from a medium-sized urban university are used as illustration. One of the consequences of using this model in the case study is the identification of the great emphasis placed by the governing board on student/output criteria and administrator/output criteria, while two other possible program review criteria areas (student/process and faculty/process) are not assessed.

Developed by a committee of experts in computer technology drawn from the public school system, universities, and industry, the test permitted reporting of scores for 30 distinct computer science and computer literacy objectives. Nearly all groups studied showed a low level of understanding of the basic concepts of computer technology. Students who reported substantial programming experience were exceptions, and demonstrated a higher level of knowledge. Comparison of results with those from an earlier survey by the National Assessment of Educational Progress  showed considerable gains in awareness of computer technology over the last 5 years. Boys appeared to have more access to and experience with computers than girls. Both of these factors were associated with higher test scores. Students from families with more education tended to score higher than those from families with less education. This report includes 23 tables, 3 figures, and a list of computer literacy objectives for students. (Author/LMM)",

The major federal agencies involved in information policy are classified according to their role in information transmission; i.e., science, research, and technology; dissemination of information for education and training; information and the consumer; and international information policy and international trade. Recent federal legislation proposed to improve education  is summarized, and the role of state governments is shown through examples of special task forces that have been established in the region to attract high technology industries. The discussion of policy issues includes an examination of the skills students will need in an information-based economy; applications of information technology (teleconferencing, videotext and teletext, video, and microcomputers) for classroom instruction, teacher training, educational administration, and home learning; strategies for coping with shortages of teachers and funds; and equal access to information technologies.

        "description":"Concerned with the means by which distance education programs can be used to further social justice in various parts of the world, this paper considers both the generally recognized strengths of and some potential problems in three aspects of such programs--access, curriculum, and a monopolistic tendency. It draws on the experience of the Universidad Estatal a Distancia in Costa Rice to show that distance education can widen access to educational opportunities and particularly to the home-based learner. The author cautions, however, that it can also be used to control physical access to education and thus force the student to be an isolated, segregated home-based learner. Arguing that distance education can be used as a vehicle to spread education and enlightenment, the document  points out that such programs are also potentially a powerful means of propaganda and distortion. The high start-up costs of large-scale multimedia institutions are cited as the reason for current monopolistic tendencies, since most countries cannot afford to set up more than one at any educational level. It is also suggested that these costs may result in the development of more multinational institutions to serve the needs of several countries. Some of the problems such institutions can encounter are briefly noted, citing the experiences of the University of South Pacific, which reaches students from three different cultural groups speaking diverse languages, and the Instituto Centroamericano de Extencion de la Cultura, which operates in the politically sensitive region of Central  America.

        "description":"This paper questions both what was being tested in prior instructional media research on the educational value of film and television and the value of some of those findings. An alternative way of conceptualizing the communication process that occurs when students view an instructional film or television program is proposed, which places viewers in the role of active interpreters who construct meaning rather than as the passive recipients of a single message. It is suggested that many of the research studies on the use of instructional media are inconclusive, contradictory, and frequently based on invalid or simplistic questions. Two frequently-proposed arguments in support of the use of film or television are discussed: the claim that students learn more when they view film or  television than when taught by conventional classroom teaching methods and the argument that is based on the idea that \"one picture is worth a thousand words.\" After assessing what can be used from these traditional arguments, the final sections suggest some new justifications that can be developed from more recent research approaches.

Two main data tables reproduce responses to 16 of the 25 questionnaire items from 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities.  Selected variables are analyzed, and an explanation of the analyses and recommendations for further analysis are presented. A discussion of the survey methodology describes the development and distribution of the survey questionnaire, the handling of returns, and calculations. Additional sections point out limitations of the method and the survey instrument, and offer recommendations for future surveys. A sample PNLA (Pacific Northwest Library Association) library statistics questionnaire with instructions and 13 references are included. (LMM)",

        "description":"The Oklahoma State Capacity Building Project, Project SEEK (Sooner Exchange for Educational Knowledge) emphasized three approaches in working toward building a comprehensive dissemination system for Oklahoma's educators: (1) systematic information collection, storage, retrieval, and delivery to educators through state education agency information specialists, through assistance to regional education services centers staff, and through 400 local librarians; (2) assisting service centers in follow-up services, identifying information needs and producing new information; and (3) discovering information sources to assist educators in solving problems, filling needs, or building new programs. During the project, educational documents, publications, and periodicals were supplied to  educators through centralized access to the ERIC database. A linkage network was established with state government agencies, universities and vocational and technical schools, the state library, and the Regional Educational Libraries and Center. This report lists the project staff, advisory boards, information packets contents, and the major achievements for each year of the project. It touches on major components and activities, dissemination, institutionalization, equity issues, overall impact on practice, client responsiveness, significant learnings, and collaborative relationships. Also included are 1982 annual report totals, a 5-year comparison, and a list of miscellaneous staff activities for 1982. (LMM)",

        "description":"In this collection of interviews, the outgrowth of a symposium held in San Francisco, California, in July, 1981, librarians, students, and users of library services for blind and physically handicapped individuals express their thoughts and feelings about their experiences and about the attitudes they have encountered. Handicapped library users were selected on the basis of their frequent use of the subregional library in San Francisco, their particular life situations, and their willingness to participate in a taped interview in their homes. All of the patrons interviewed are visually impaired. Individual interviews with 15 members of this group and interviews with a group of high school students and a group of retirement home residents make up the first section of this book.  Interviews with 20 librarians, who were chosen to represent different points of view, are presented in the second section. The 15 library school students, whose interviews are in the third section, were recruited from two local schools, the University of California at Berkeley and San Jose State University, and one out-of-state institution, the University of Wisconsin at Madison. All interviews were tape recorded, transcribed, and edited to their present form. A concluding statement briefly discusses the current level of library services to the blind and physically handicapped and some of the reasons why such services are not as good as they should be. Education of all the groups concerned is suggested as the key to solving the problems with current services. (LMM)",

Five target populations were identified through data analysis (i.e., full-time day transfer, full-time day occupational, part-time day, part-time evening, and non-program students) and an action plan was developed for each group. Study data indicated that SRC does not have a major retention problem in traditional student populations, though differences in retention rates, especially  in the occupational degree areas, were considerable. The bulk of the report consists of summaries of data related to the five target populations giving retention rates, important demographic characteristics, retention objectives/approaches, and types of retention recommendations needed; a statistical comparison of the characteristics and performance of fall 1980 and 1981 entering cohorts; early warning referral data; and a transfer follow-up summary and questionnaire.

Introductory remarks focus on the educational implications of the transformation from an industrial society to a technological society based on information. Two facets of strategic planning are discussed next: external assessment, which involves needs assessment, market analysis, environmental scanning, trend and policy analysis, and issues management; and internal audit, which involves the evaluation of programs on the basis of quality, centrality, and market viability. The next section assesses the sophistication of vocational-technical education with regard to collecting the kinds of data that are useful in strategic planning. The following section describes two  recommendations: (1) the development of conceptual frameworks which would clarify the relationship between postsecondary education and the economy and (2) the clarification of the role of vocational-technical education in economic development. Finally, the paper presents a multi-year plan of action designed to synthesize research and development on selected topics, to assist institutions in planning strategically, and to reduce the lag time between research and development and its pilot application and dissemination.

Bill who go to any college has generally been low in states with high tuition; (3) many students at public colleges have parents who can provide little or no financial assistance and must earn a substantial part of their college expenses; (4) most Americans, including the great majority of minority  and working class students, are dependent on low-tuition public colleges for an education; (5) lowering tuition increases the number of students going on to college; (6) students from low-income families are more likely to go to college when tuition is reduced; (7) very few families have adequate funds to meet college costs; and (8) current federal and state student aid programs are not adequate to meet the needs of students from either lower-income or middle-income families.

The following section presents conclusions drawn from a study of the effects of the implementation of Standards of Academic Progress, highlighting: (1) the suspension of more than 12,000 students and the saving of more than $1.5 million in reduced full-time equivalent funding to MDCC; (2) a decline  in the suspension rate over the latest four quarters, indicating improved student performance; and (3) a retention/graduation rate for black students equal to or above the rate before the imposition of the standards. Finally, effects of the policy prohibiting the use of developmental/remedial courses for the fulfillment of graduation requirements are outlined. The report concludes by stressing the positive responses of faculty, staff, and students to the more rigorous academic standards instituted at MDCC. (HB)",

Following introductory material focusing on the organization and objectives of the module, resources required for its use, and key terms, the 11 units are presented. Each includes enabling objectives, activities to assist in objective fulfillment, and feedback devices. After completing the series, educators should be able to: (1) demonstrate knowledge of the essential elements and desirable characteristics of CBE programs; (2) determine how their institution should identify competencies for its occupational programs; (3) determine the best approach  to providing materials for the institution; (4) determine how students and teachers will be oriented to new roles; (5) plan for the development and use of appropriate evaluation instruments and grading procedures; (6) determine program features best suited to the needs and characteristics of the institution and its students; (7) describe options most appropriate for the institution's mode of operation; (8) determine strategies for implementing a CBE program; (9) prepare a total plan for program implementation; (10) complete the workshop evaluation form and submit a copy of the CBE implementation plan; and (11) within their own institution, develop and implement a CBE instructional program.

        "description":"The interrelatedness of the fields of nursing and sociology is discussed in this paper in an effort to encourage a sympathetic symbiosis between these two fields and between technical and general education. First, an overview is provided of recent trends in sociology, citing the influences of anthropologists and cultural historians on current views of U.S. society. Next, changes in the delivery of health services are examined, with focus on the implications of these changes for health services education. The need for health services personnel to understand and get along with people is underscored, and several key factors in this understanding are explored, including the importance of a patient's motivation, background, behavior, and involvement in the effective delivery of health  services; organizational characteristics of hospitals, such as limited resources, a racial and cultural caste system, work pressures, and management policies; and interpersonal relationships with colleagues, patients, and patients' families. The paper then suggests that learning experiences on such sociological topics be developed and integrated into existing technical courses. After suggesting steps for the development of such modules, a series of concepts are discussed around which learning experiences could be developed. These include power and authority, values and the process of socialization, ethnicity, religion, the aged, language, and wellness. Eight learning activities related to these topics are appended.

The student uses intuition, sense-memory, and imagination in a holistic approach to learning which teaches social skills while it teaches subject matter. Everyone can act and improvise; getting everyone involved is seldom a problem as long as the atmosphere is comfortable and nonthreatening. Objective and nonjudgmental feedback is important to the process. The best time for feedback is immediately after the game. Most theater games can include a whole class, although there may be occasions when it is necessary to divide the class into smaller groups. Props and costumes are not necessary, but they can add fun and can stimulate involvement. The final section of this  document describes two sample improvisational games, &quot;Ways of Getting There&quot; and &quot;Play Ball,&quot; and provides a source for additional games. (DC)",

The program (Social Science 100) emphasizes reading, thinking, questioning, writing, and student attitudes. A simple formula, &quot;five questions and a stack of books,&quot; is used as the framework for the course. Emphasis is on support systems and thought-provoking questions that best reflect five critical issues of the century: (1) spreading the American way over the rest of the world; (2) dealing with severe economic problems via socialist revolution, conservative rectification, or liberal reform; (3) policies  toward fascism and communism; (4) the &quot;liberation&quot; of the sixties; and (5) the decline or rebirth of the late twentieth century in America. Instead of textbooks, the program uses a variety of books about persons whose lives were intimately bound up with the issues of the times, thereby showing how Americans interrelated with the rest of the world. In addition, essay tests are used and teacher flexibility is encouraged. Students in this program show marked improvement in two areas: heightened political understanding and diminished ethnocentrism. (LH)",

        "description":"One philosophical issue underlying instructional evaluation arises from tension between the concepts of academic freedom and academic responsibility. Academic freedom can be cited as an argument against evaluating teaching in circumstances where evaluation genuinely encumbers the pursuit or dissemination of knowledge. Another source of tension centers around the notion that instructor's credentials, position, and expertise preclude evaluation. Some feel that until we know more about evaluation, we should do nothing. Others feel that failure to evaluate may lead to sins more grievous than would evaluation with uncertainty. In the face of increasing demands placed upon faculty to furnish more and more evidence supporting the amount, quality, and value of what they do, many faculty  members want to do away with intrusive evaluation policies, while students and administrators push for objective data to facilitate decisions and guarantee educational quality. A major psychometric issue in instructional evaluation is whether evaluation should focus on instructional outcomes or on instructional processes. The problems of evaluating teaching by measuring student learning are both philosophical and methodological. On the other hand, evaluating teaching by measuring course and instructor characteristics and behavior that are indicative of good teaching is no less complex. A reasonable goal would be to devise an evaluation plan that takes advantage of the strengths of process measures, but that also guards against their weaknesses. (LH)",

        "description":"Learning strategies can be defined as behaviors and thoughts in which a learner engages and which are intended to influence the learner's encoding process. Thus, the goal of any particular learning strategy may be to affect the way in which the learner selects, acquires, organizes, or integrates new knowledge. Good teaching includes teaching students how to learn, remember, think, and motivate themselves. Teachers enter the classroom with two distinctly different kinds of goals which are teaching students &quot;what&quot; to learn and teaching students &quot;how&quot; to learn. Some major categories of learning strategies are: (1) rehearsal strategies such as copying, underlining, or shadowing; (2) elaboration strategies such as paraphrasing or summarizing; (3) organizational strategies such as  outlining or creating a hierarchy; (4) comprehension monitoring strategies such as checking for comprehension failures; and (5) affective strategies such as being alert and relaxed. Many current approaches to classroom learning emphasize the role of the learner in creating, monitoring, and controlling a suitable learning environment. Learning strategies research, by providing strong evidence that these learning strategies can be taught, is creating a useful data base from which applications can and will be derived. (EM)",

A recent University of Texas study of literacy developed at the community college included a mini-study of attrition, probation, and literacy. The major findings of this mini-study are that students on scholastic probation make an inordinate number of nonproductive grades, frequently repeat courses, frequently enroll in courses without completing the prerequisites, represent the college population as a whole, overly represent the black and Hispanic student population, and report similar problems that led them to academic trouble. They frequently  are not aware of their probation status and/or do not know what it means to them academically. Those students who do acknowledge their scholastic probation standing often feel that the college has let them down. An additonal finding is that students seeking counseling and accepting placement advice are uncertain about their academic future. Studying scholastic probation in order to study attrition is a legitimate alternative to studying attrition &quot;after the fact.&quot; (EM)",

Checklist items indicated such behaviors as asking, protecting, comforting, lending, sharing, hugging, playing with, joining, laughing, smiling, looking at, performing request, leading, following, and conversing. Use of the instrument required that individual children be observed for 5 minutes four times in a 1-month period. Observers were directed to indicate behaviors they saw occur at least once. Observer training procedures developed in conjunction with the checklist consisted of three parts: (1) previewing and discussing instrument content and scoring directions, (2) viewing a 5-minute videotape of infant or toddler behavior in a center setting, and (3)  observing a selected child jointly and unobtrusively. Total training time varied between 1 and 3 hours. In a field test of the instrument, 39 boys and 33 girls between the ages of 5 and 39 months at the Berry College Infant Toddler Center were unobtrusively observed each week for a 12-month period. Findings revealed a steady increase in the number of adaptive behaviors enacted over the year.

Studies report a shift in more than 20 attitudes and values, most of which relate to the context of family life. Specifically, these include attitudes toward marriage, divorce, childbearing, childrearing, working women, family violence, female/male household roles, and parental obligation to children. Reports also indicate that many children prefer television to their own parents. The cumulative effect of these changes has not brought happiness or &quot;self-fulfillment.&quot; At least three areas need to be addressed: (1) the contemporary image of the family as a restrictive and uncreative environment, (2) the professional and bureaucratic structures with which we have  encircled the family, and (3) the need to evolve a new image of the family to preserve continuity and change. As a backdrop to these changes, the Framingham study, a 30-year investigation that has established factors connected to coronary heart disease, is of interest. While this investigation did not address psychological and social data as factors, medical practice should consider data resulting from it in terms of assumptions about causes of disease, the connections between disease and human relationships, consideration of familial life in health problems, and close physician contact with families. Reformation of medicine in light of familial principles should result in a reduced scale of operations, simple principles, lower costs, and rebuilt human exchange. (BJD)",

Subjects, 47 black third-grade children, were divided into external instruction, self-instruction, and control groups. In the self-instruction condition, children were trained to verbalize, monitor, evaluate, and reinforce themselves at different phases of responding; such self-instruction was omitted from the external instruction condition to establish a more passive involvement. All three groups were pretested and posttested. Children in training received additional assessments at 2 and 4 weeks and at 2, 3, 4, and 8 months following training. Generalization to an  untrained situation and transfer of training to a second in-school setting and to a home setting were tested on a noncomprehensive basis. Results indicated that both training methods resulted in high levels of skill acquisition, a slight decline in response maintenance over the subsequent 4 months, and a substantial drop in maintenance over the second 4 months. Scores of subjects receiving external instruction declined more during the second 4 months than had both groups' scores during the first 4 months; they also declined more during the second 4 months than those of subjects receiving self-instruction. A high degree of generalization to an untrained response, a high degree of transfer to the second in-school setting, and moderate generalization to the home setting were found for both  instruction groups.

        "description":"The potential impact of several maternal involvement behaviors on teachers' ratings of children's academic skills was examined through statistical analyses. Data, based on mothers' responses to selected questions concerning maternal involvement and on teachers' ratings on the Classroom Behavior Inventory, were obtained for 115 kindergarten children. Subjects' sex and the educational level of subjects' mothers were used as control variables. Although results did not support previous findings of a relationship between high maternal involvement and superior academic performance, one significant relationship was found: maternal help with sight words was associated with children's reading difficulty.

The legislative background of and justification for the resolution are stated, and its costs and inflationary impact are estimated.

        "description":"The extent to which children evaluated non-television advertisements differentially on the basis of performers' gender, expertise, and attractiveness was assessed. Participating were 56 girls and 47 boys attending first-, third-, and fifth-grade classes in Galveston, Texas. A total of 24 pairs of specially prepared advertisements were used as stimulus materials. On each pair, identical pictures of neutral products were shown; pairs varied in the gender, attractiveness, and expertise of the male or female models appearing with the product. Performer's expertise was indicated by a simple sentence included in the advertising copy. Results of chi-square and Z tests indicated that children's selections among advertisements were primarily influenced by the attractiveness of the adult  models who appeared. Expertise seemed fairly unimportant to children's judgments. The strength of selecting attractive models across the grades was essentially equivalent. It was concluded that even first graders apparently prefer attractive adult models and that the role of non-television media in attractiveness-based socialization may be extremely important. (RH)",

It was expected that, when rating attractive children, parents would give higher evaluations and have greater expectations than when rating unattractive children. It was further expected that parents would exhibit gender-based differences in their evaluations. Participating were 20 male and 33 female parents of preschool and elementary school children. A supplemental group of 38 male and 37 female nonparent adults was included for comparison purposes. Each participant read four short dialogues to which a color photograph of a preschool child was attached. Dialogues depicted children engaged in high or low rates of activity, friendliness,  independence, aggression, and honesty. The photographs depicted equal numbers of male and female children with no obvious disfigurements; in addition, none of the children wore glasses. Subjects were asked to rate each child according to a 36-item attribution questionnaire that included nine items assessing raters' expectations of the child's future success. Analyses of variance yielded numerous results. Overall, findings provided evidence that some differential attributions were made of attractive and unattractive preschoolers. This was especially so when children were depicted as acting cooperatively and in a nonaggressive, friendly manner; when children were depicted as dishonest, cruel, or antisocial, attractiveness was less important.

The first report concerned the integration of handicapped young people into ordinary schools. The present report deals with what happens to handicapped young people when they leave education and attempt to enter the labor market. How well are they prepared? What obstacles do they meet? How difficult is it to find employment? After a discussion of the objectives of transition and the enhancement of employability, the central part of the report is devoted to examples of arrangements in different countries and more general, related topics. Transition programs are discussed  in part 2: (1) The Years of Schooling and Transition to Work in the Departement de l'Orne, France; (2) Work Training in the Departement de la Somme, Northern France; (3) The Integration of Pupils with Serious Learning Difficulties into Normal Working Life in Norway; (4) The Integration of Handicapped Youth in Italy; (5) Developing Vocational Opportunities for Handicapped Persons; (6) Employing the Handicapped in Swedish Industry; (7) The Roles and Needs of Parents of Handicapped Adolescents; and (8) Alternatives to Work for the Handicapped.

A total of 54 students from 10 classrooms in 5 suburban elementary schools served as subjects. In each school, six students were randomly selected from each of two classrooms, resulting in a group of 22 third graders and 32 fourth graders (26 boys and 28 girls). Each target student was observed over the entire school day, and six event areas were recorded: activity, task, teaching structure, teacher location, teacher activity, and student response. An interval time-sampling technique was used to direct the recording of events in 10-second intervals over the entire day. Ten selected observers recorded data. Results were presented in five areas: the class  activity, the task used, the teaching structure, the teacher's location relative to the student, and the teacher's activity. Overall, results indicated that instructional variables do have an impact on students' academic responding. It was suggested that, through an awareness of the effect of different instructional variables on student academic response, results can be applied to increase the time students spend engaged in academic tasks.

        "description":"This ethnographic, longitudinal study investigates the home literacy experiences of low income children to gain insight into why such children generally do not learn to read and write as well as middle class children. Participating were 24 children, approximately 2.5 to 3.5 years of age, in groups equally divided by sex. Subjects were from three ethnic groups: Anglo-, Black-, and Mexican-American. To identify the sources of those life experiences leading to the development of literacy, extensive naturalistic home observations were made for periods ranging from 3 to 18 months. Observer-participants taking field notes described literacy events, specifically focusing on actions, the contexts of events, participants, co-occurring/alternating events, reasons events ended, and  subsequent activities. Over 1,400 literacy events were recorded and analyzed; both qualitative and quantitative analyses were made. In the quantitative analysis, the independent variable was ethnicity. The literacy event, the original dependent variable, was differentiated into two quantitative and three qualitative components. Quantitative components included duration and frequency of literacy events; qualitative components were participant structure, lesson content, and context. Many transcriptions of literacy events are provided in the text, and results and their implications are extensively discussed. A coding manual, the Literacy Event Observation System, is appended.

        "description":"Recent research indicates that a considerable number of children report extreme feelings of loneliness and that unpopular children are more lonely than popular children. The present study assessed feelings of loneliness in two subgroups of unpopular children: those who were rejected (low on positive and high on negative peer nominations) and those who were neglected (low on both positive and negative peer nominations). Data on popular, average, and controversial children were also collected. Results from 200 third- through sixth-grade children indicated that rejected children were the most lonely group and that popular children were the least lonely. Neglected, average, and controversial children reported intermediate levels. Overall, the results provided added evidence of the  utility of the distinction between neglected and rejected status and support earlier conclusions that rejected children are more at-risk than other status groups.

A total of 211 kindergarten through eighth-grade students were instructed to describe an adult they knew very well. Responses were classified into nine categories representing major descriptive constructs related to person perception: appearance, routine habits and activities, personal possessions, personality, aptitudes and achievements, personal attitudes, subjects' evaluation of the adult, social roles, and comparisons (references to comparative differences between people). A multiple analysis of variance (grade by sex by nine  categories) revealed significant increases in the use of five of the targeted categories by children in higher grades. A second multiple analysis (grade by sex by two categories) showed a significant increase in the use of central descriptive constructs by older children. Analysis of variance showed significant increases in the elaborateness of the categories used by older children.

        "description":"An exploratory study probed the extent to which children rely on category membership to guide their inferences. A total of 60 children, 4 years of age, were shown 20 sets of pictures of various animals, plants, and minerals. Each set consisted of representations of three objects having two salient features: perceptual similarity/dissimilarity and category membership/nonmembership. Given information about a category member (for example, feeding behavior of flamingos) plus information about a category nonmember (feeding behavior of bats), subjects were asked to draw an inference about a category member (for example, a blackbird) that was perceptually similar to the category nonmember (the bat). At least two possible responses existed: inferences based on perceptual similarity  (blackbird and bat) or on category membership (flamingo and blackbird). Control conditions were established to ascertain that the information given was unfamiliar to subjects and to demonstrate children's ability to perform when category information was not in conflict with perceptual information. Replicating the experimental condition, a second study asked children to justify their choices. Results showed that the category label had a powerful effect: 68 percent of the time preschool children preferred to draw inferences on the basis of category membership. Children's justifications provided converging evidence that they firmly believed in the importance of category name. No clear-cut item effects due to domain-specific knowledge were found. (RH)",

        "description":"Providing a framework for a symposium exploring the influence of physical attractiveness on the socialization process, this paper (1) offers a working definition of physical attractiveness, (2) reviews stereotypes associated with attractiveness, and (3) discusses a social network perspective on the influence of attractiveness. Physical attractiveness is conceptualized as being a personal physionomic attribute achieving status as high, moderate, or low as a function of cultural criteria. Attractive individuals are stereotypically perceived as friendly, popular, happy, nonaggressive, well-adjusted, trustworthy, and so on. Unattractive individuals are routinely viewed as unhappy, lonely, maladjusted, aggressive, and unfriendly. Research shows that stereotypes based on attractiveness  are fairly extensive, are biased in favor of attractive individuals, and are heavily endorsed by the American public. The social network view holds that socialization can be understood only when all salient socializers and the child are considered as reciprocally influential and only when the cultural context is taken into account. With respect to attractiveness, the social network view encourages the study of both the transmission of attractiveness stereotypes and differential reactions to children with varying degrees of attractiveness.

Participating were 64 preschool children and 9 teachers. Children, who attended a private preschool in Houston, Texas, were white, equally divided by sex and age, and from middle-income homes. A group of 30 adult raters determined the attractiveness of the children prior to data collection by rating standard posed photographs of the children. Nine student behaviors judged of interest were categorized as teacher/nonteacher directed, positive/negative, and proximal/physical. Teacher behaviors falling within five response categories were evaluated as positive, negative, or neutral. Observations were made during unstructured play times by 10  undergraduate observers trained in the use of a behavioral checklist; teachers were unaware that they were being observed. Results indicated that behavioral differences do seem to exist between attractive and unattractive children; specifically, unattractive subjects showed higher activity levels. In addition, teachers appeared to react more favorably to children rated as attractive than to those rated unattractive. (RH)",

Research questions were (1) At what ages can children state a self-definition of attractiveness? (2) Are self-definitions temporally stable? (3) To what degree are children's self-judgments similar to judgments made of them by socializers? and, (4) What is the relationship of children's self-judgments of their attractiveness to their behavior and to verbal reports of their behavior? A sample of 140 subjects included equal numbers of male and female white preschool children, 3 through 6 years of age, and their parents, teachers, and peers. Self-definitions of attractiveness were obtained by asking children to rate themselves on a three-point scale  while looking in a mirror; self-definitions were obtained again 2 weeks later. Children were also asked to rate their own behaviors and were observed for positive and negative behaviors during free play. Additionally, parents and teachers rated each child's behaviors, and peers rated each child's attractiveness. Results indicated that children at all ages seem able to report self-judgments of attractiveness and that such reports exhibit short-term stability. Other findings indicated that self-judgments were more related to verbal reports of behavior than to observed playground behavior and that age and sex differences exist in the relationship of children's self-judgments to judgments made of them by socializers and other adult raters.

The Girard school system (Kansas) has had two skills centers operating successfully since 1975. Individualized methods combined with group interaction are used to accommodate individuality and different learning styles. Girard uses units of instruction (mostly teacher-made) which consist of goals and objectives, pre-tests, information, exercises, post-tests, remediation, and additional post-tests. Supplementary methods, techniques, or activities are combined with the units to increase student motivation. The advantages of individualized instruction are that it allows students to work at their own pace, builds positive student attitudes, encourages  students to assume responsibility, reduces absenteeism, and allows teachers to measure specific learning. The disadvantages are that teachers who enjoy lecturing and leading large group discussions find that the individualized classroom is not a teacher-centered environment; and that an individualized unit program requires a great deal of preparation.

In the first study, county census data were analyzed to determine changes in the socioeconomic status of rural and urban poor between 1960 and 1970. In 1970, the poverty count in rural and urban areas differed by 16.6%, down 5.1% from 1960. Poverty was disproportionately high in rural counties, where the median family income of $4,591 was nearly $3,000 lower than in urban counties, and among rural blacks, whose median family income was only $2,931. Rural poverty was highly correlated with race, farm residence, education level, unemployment, age, and family structure. Little rural-urban difference existed in the regional distribution of income sources. In the second  study, researchers challenged Oscar Lewis' notion that a &quot;culture of poverty&quot; as related to attitudinal and value traits overrides basic ethnic orientation. Their findings indicated that race was likely to be a more significant determinant of attitude and value than was poverty. Data from a 248-household survey in Mississippi showed significant differences in responses between black and white samples and between black and poor samples. In general, rural blacks felt more fatalistic, suspicious, socially alienated, and less trusting than the rural poor whites. (SB)",

Classifying the variables by nature, researchers found that race emerged as the best predictor of community satisfaction, followed by life satisfaction, political participation, personal satisfaction, and positive self-respect. Except for race, socioeconomic and demographic variables were not efficient predictors of community satisfaction in rural Mississippi. To determine predictors of life satisfaction, researchers  studied responses to 51 questionnaire items plus scores for community satisfaction and consumer behavior. They found that age was the only significant predictor of life satisfaction, which was stable over time in rural Mississippi. Sociopsychological factors and personality had a more powerful influence than material or economic factors on life satisfaction.

Also, in-depth data for 150 students and dropouts were gathered from records and interviews. Results showed that although dropout rates fell in the 1980's, 20% of migrant students dropped out each year, usually in grade 9 or 10, coinciding with a drop in migrant student academic grades after grade 8. The poor academic performance of secondary students (averaging three grade levels behind in reading and two in math) contrasted with their unrealistically ambitious career goals, often influenced by unemployed parents. Only 3% of the migrant students were  in vocational programs and 16% in college preparatory programs, versus 75% in general studies. Most had misconceptions about the training and education required for their career choice and had only limited work experience as clerks or unskilled laborers. Averaging three years in the migrant program, half were Spanish-language dominant and in bilingual or ESL programs. Most received instruction in English.

        "description":"The report of a regional seminar on rural development planning specifies as its objectives: to study the problems of rural development planning, and to elucidate training requirements for managers of rural development projects, with particular reference to the links between education and productive work and employment. The first chapter gives highlights of 16 papers from 12 countries (Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Japan, Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, India, Republic of Korea, Nepal, Malaysia, and Thailand) on three issues: education and training of planners and managers of rural development programs; strengthening and linking the educational and training components (formal and nonformal) of rural development programs with productive work and  employment; and planning and management for enhancing the contributions of educational institutions, training centers, and programs (formal and nonformal) to rural development. The second chapter presents reports of two groups into which seminar participants divided themselves for in-depth study of the three issues. The third chapter lists key elements in research, evaluation, and training in which cooperation and exchange within and between countries should be increased: inter-institution communication/cooperation; evaluation of training programs; improvement of planning through decentralization, inter-departmental cooperation, and community involvement; and dissemination of information on innovative training programs, such as those described for Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.  Appendices include a seminar agenda and participant list. (MH)",

        "description":"Papers from India, Nepal, the Philippines, and the Republic of Korea, from a seminar (Bangkok, 1980) on new personnel profiles in relation to changes in society and educational systems, present studies dealing with national mechanisms for preparing and updating profiles of educational personnel. The Indian study indicates that: changes in educational structures flow from both planned and unplanned socioeconomic changes (including increasing migration to urban areas by rural youth), diffused educational decision-making authority has led to difficulty in developing monitoring/evaluation methods, and training needs are met through modified preservice and extensive inservice training. Changes listed in the Nepalese paper include emphasis on vocational education, improved  transportation/communication, improved teaching/learning methods, and involvement of people at grassroots level in development plans. Emphases for educational personnel include skill development and attitudinal change, linking training to rural development, and addressing training to specific personnel needs. The Philippine paper describes government emphasis on rural development, accelerated industrialization, and expansion of public services. Renewal of curricula, instructional materials/strategies, and personnel development programs is discussed. The Korean study notes increased industrialization, socioeconomic inequalities, rapid population growth and urbanization, value changes, mass media development, and new teacher profiles which will emphasize personality traits and professional  competencies.

The responses were analyzed and compared to role descriptions found in relevant literature. Associates described themselves as facilitators, social researchers, community educators, publicists, catalysts, process helpers, and resource links. The descriptions were supported by the literature. Their description of initiating, building, and maintaining PRI relationships served as the basis of a generic involvement procedure for field  program associates. The procedure had five phases: orientation and awareness, problem identification, alternatives identification, planning and implementation, and on-going support. The document includes 16 articles and excerpts that can serve as a beginning collection of resources for the personal and professional growth of the field program associates. The document also includes 99 tools and techniques for use by field program associates, a briefly annotated bibliography of 55 materials available from the American Society for Training and Development, and a list of 20 new books and materials acquired by PRI.

        "description":"Opinionnaires were mailed to 860 Wisconsin Indian college students and graduates, 189 of whom were also interviewed, to identify positive factors contributing to completion of college degrees by Wisconsin Indian people. The opinionnaire used for current students and those graduated from 1977 to 1982 differed from that used with pre-1977 graduates; the latter provided more open-ended questions. Usable opinionnaires (214) were 27.8% of those distributed. Financial aid ranked first as a factor contributing to college completion, followed by family support, having a personal goal, determination, and intelligence. Seven composite profiles of Wisconsin Indians who completed college degrees, derived from the opinionnaires and interviews, showed a number of commonalities: a parent or  parents who understood the value of a college education, no perception of discrimination before the high school level, discovery that college was more difficult than high school and less personal, pride in being Indian, and sense of purpose. Detailed recommendations from opinionnaire respondents discussed six sources that could encourage Indian students: parents, pre-college schools, tribes, colleges and universities, students themselves, and older Indian college students. A specific recommendation called for a state-wide conference on Indian education, followed by practical on-site workshops to help implement the study's recommendations.

        "description":"Recruitment of Native Americans to be foster or adoptive parents for Native American children involves careful planning, preparation, and work. In addition to making standard administrative decisions and maintaining required records, social workers must be sensitive to the attitudes, lifestyle, and culture of Native Americans recruited as adoptive or foster parents. Social workers can further recruitment in many ways, including distributing materials at Indian Center board meetings and pow wows, making and distributing posters of children, discussing needs on radio and television and in tribal newspapers, attending tribal meetings, distributing fact sheets on their programs, and visiting local agencies and public health offices to talk with staff and parents. Once parents have  been recruited, social workers must respond quickly and sensitively. Statewide identification of Indian parents, computer data bank information on available children and parents, and photolisting of available families can facilitate adoption of Native American children by Native American parents. Included are a list of five resources to contact regarding Native American adoption and foster care, a sample recruitment form, recommendations regarding permanency planning, and a 40-item bibliography of books, articles, tapes, and cassettes available on loan from the Region VIII Child Welfare Training Center in Denver, Colorado.

Between 1980 and 1983, researchers gathered and analyzed data from interviews and files of a stratified random sample of 115 Part A projects. The 1981-1982 median project served 119 students with a budget of $26,450, 1.4 professional staff, and active volunteers from the Indian community. Most project offerings correlated highly with educational needs voiced by Indian parents and communities. The most common activities were tutoring and academic services (80%), Indian history  and cultural instruction (64%), counseling and career guidance (48%), and home-school liaison activities (38%). Satisfaction with the program was high among parent committees, district administrators, principals, and project directors, but lower among Indian leaders. Program activities improved attendance, math and reading scores, and cultural interest of Indian students, but not school dropout rates. The program also increased Indian parent involvement and interest in the schools. Overall, the small supplemental program had a generally positive effect on Indian education. (SB)",

The committee defined rural schools as being outside the regular service boundaries of metropolitan areas; averaging no more than one classroom per grade level per school site; being geographically isolated; and being defined by state law as rural, remote, isolated, or small. The committee's rationale for research and development attention for rural schools included  lack of the human, fiscal, community, and professional development resources frequently available in metropolitan schools; inadequate teacher preparation for rural teaching; differing administrative roles and responsibilities; differing staff relationships; unique personal and learning characteristics of rural students; rural population increases; inadequate preparation for technology; and inability to duplicate metropolitan education in rural areas. The committee recommended that research and development for rural areas focus on finance, staff training and attrition, population trends, and access to information. (SB)",

Data are from mothers of 1,159 children, aged 5-9, from the 1976-77 Malaysian Family Life Survey. Results indicate that relationships among mothers' early life experiences and between those outcomes and expectations for children's education often differ by ethnicity and by child's sex. Modern-sector work  experience substantially increases mothers' expectations among Chinese and Indian women, but not among Malays, many of whom are from rural areas. Chinese mothers (but not Malays or Indians) strongly favor sons over daughters in expected schooling, but modern-sector work experience changes this pattern, dramatically increasing Chinese expectations for daughters' schooling, but not affecting expectations for sons' attainments. Government policies to improve Malays' social and economic standing have apparently raised expectations for their children's education, relative to Chinese and Indian expectations, as Chinese and Indian women expect their children to complete less schooling than Malays expect.

        "description":"The experiences of the 3-year Minnesota Severely Handicapped Delivery System Project have led to a model which utilizes resources of regional systems as key elements of a differentiated system for educational service delivery to the handicapped in rural areas and involves state education agencies, statewide regional centers, local education units, and the strengths and human capital of local communities. Problems rural areas have in delivering services to the handicapped are difficulty in attracting specialist teachers, travel costs to send children to specialized programs elsewhere, underidentification or inaccurate diagnosis of handicapped children, and lack of a clearly defined regional structure of service delivery for handicapped persons. The proposed model utilizes local  strengths to the maximum extent and relies on regional resources for special conditions requiring expertise beyond that available locally. The core of the model involves strengthening the role of regional units which provide professional guidance/training, technical assistance, and supervision to local staff, while simultaneously strengthening local skills and encouraging involvement of teachers, parents, and community members. The model also includes strategies to serve needs of underserved groups of handicapped persons, uses technology for all phases of service delivery to the severely handicapped, and incorporates a management information system and a component to evaluate impact and cost-effectiveness.

Over 75% of the respondents had lived in Fort Madison for at least 11 years and 64.2% were employed full- or part-time. Generally, their image of the city and its residents was very positive, especially among older respondents. They rated the quality of community services positively except for street maintenance, housing availability, and youth programs. Transportation was rated poorly as was school discipline. Respondents rated recreation  opportunities positively but faulted available entertainment, especially dining and movies. Many respondents shopped elsewhere for wider selection and better quality, service, and prices, especially when purchasing furniture or clothing. Respondents voiced support for new department and clothing stores; 66% favored a shopping mall. One third also obtained medical care elsewhere and 71% perceived a need for another physician in Fort Madison. Respondents were satisfied with available dental and pharmacy facilities but not with available hospital care or costs. An appendix contains complete survey results. (SB)",

The effectiveness of the beach is caused by its sloping surface which dissipates the energy of waves and by the flexibility of the slope which changes as the waves change. The process and rate of accretion and erosion are dependent on the size and frequency of waves, the formation of sand bars, and the tidal cycle. Littoral drift occurs when waves approach the beach at an angle. This can affect the beach when a barrier is put across the littoral zone causing sand to collect on one side and erode on the other. Sand dunes protect the land by acting as a dike during exceptionally high tide and as a reserve supply of sand in times of severe erosion. Their effectiveness can be destroyed by  pedestrians, vehicles, or housing construction, but these problems can be overcome. If the unique features of the beach are recognized, it can be enjoyed without interfering with its job of protecting the land. (DC)",

        "description":"Because the Soviet Union does not publish measures of economic growth and development comparable with those of Western countries, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided (by means of a large research effort carried out over many years) estimates of the value of the Soviet gross national product (GNP), its rate of growth, its size relative to the U.S. GNP, and its allocation among such end uses as consumption, investment, and government expenditures (including defense). Part 1 discusses the overall estimates of Soviet GNP by sector of origin and end use. The remaining three parts present detailed analyses of a major component of GNP: industrial production (part 2); agricultural production (part 3); and consumption, including education (part 4). Each of these studies includes  detailed compilations of the data used, their sources, and the methodologies used to combine the data into the aggregate measures. The goals of this document are to achieve a wider understanding of how the synthetic measures of Soviet economic performance are derived, to encourage their broader use in analyses of Soviet economic performance, and to stimulate discussion of ways to improve these measures and the general understanding of the Soviet economy.

        "description":"This report focuses on the supply/demand of mathematics/science (M/S) teachers in Illinois, evaluating four major assumptions made about these teachers. Each assumption is identified and examined in terms of whether the Illinois data support/reject the assumption. These assumptions are: (1) Supply of M/S teachers is insufficient to meet demand; (2) Turnover rate is higher for M/S teachers, and these teachers leave the profession to take jobs in private industry; (3) As a result of the critical shortage of M/S teachers, schools have vacancies; (4) Shortage of M/S teachers has resulted in local district administrators using minimally/poorly trained personnel to fill teaching positions. Analyses indicate that the shortage in Illinois is moderate and that turnover rates for M/S  teachers are lower than the average turnover rate for all teachers. Of those mathematics teachers who leave, approximately one-fifth resign to take different employment. Data do not show that physics, chemistry, or higher-level mathematics teachers leave teaching at a greater rate than other M/S teachers. Furthermore, information obtained does not support the belief that there are many vacant M/S positions. Lastly, the quality of staff used to fill M/S positions is not known but it can be assumed that persons hired have valid teaching certificates. (JN)",

The plan is organized into initiatives for these three groups. Federal government initiatives discussed include establishing a New Faculty Assistance Program, White House Engineering Fellowships, White House Professors, and a Federal Engineering Faculty Enrichment Fund. Academic community initiatives discussed include developing/implementing accreditation standards which establish  goals to alleviate the faculty shortage, endorsing a policy statement encouraging top quality students to consider careers as engineering faculty, encouraging employment of qualified professionals from the private sector in engineering education, and others. Industry initiatives discussed include increasing educational contributions to universities to assist young faculty members, expanding financial support for research at universities, expanding industry/university relationships (through consulting, summer employment, sabbatical opportunities), and others.

The sample was 149 students in seventh-grade classrooms in two schools, one practicing within-classroom grouping and the other using between-classroom grouping. It was predicted that, among students who frequently use social comparison information to evaluate their ability, self-concept of mathematics ability ought to be more strongly related to the level of one's group if one is in a school that practices within-classroom grouping by ability. Among students who do not use social comparison information often, self-concept of mathematics ability should be equally related to the level of one's group, whether within-or between-classroom grouping  practices are used. These predictions were partially confirmed, although complicated by interaction effects involving gender. The importance of these findings for the literature on social comparison of ability and on ability grouping in schools is discussed. (Author/MNS)",

Under these conditions psychological theory predicts that learning will be inhibited, a prediction consistent with both the experiences of physics teachers and the results of empirical investigation. Informed by cognitive research on problem solving, semantic memory, and knowledge acquisition, instruction has been designed to encourage the reconciliation of world knowledge and physics content among beginning physics students. These instructional objectives and strategies for mechanics instruction are derived from the analysis of the cognitive states of uninstructed students, novices,  and experts, groups who differ with respect to: (1) the quantity and extent of formal mechanics instruction; (2) experiences in solving mechanics problems; and (3) the extent of their verbal interactions about mechanics. Illustrative procedures which employ the strategies (also useful for other subject-matter domains) are included. (Author/JN)",

The ontology of a domain is significant for four reasons. First, ontology is a significant factor in forming analogies between domains, described in terms of two examples involving problem-solving procedures between domains: geometric proofs and subtraction procedures. Second, these entities provide arguments on which general reasoning procedures can operate directly; this is explored through physics problems; distance, time, and velocity; and sound transmission. That conceptual entities can enable more  efficient computation is presented in terms of monster problems, isomorphic to the Tower of Hanoi problem. Finally, the ontology of a problem domain has important effects on goal definition and planning, illustrated by studies of binomial probability. (MNS)",

Modules focused on concepts and operations for factors, prime numbers, and fractions. Task analysis and demand specification procedures were used to sequence instructional objectives within and across topics. Cognitive social theory provided a framework for the incorporation of attentional, retentional, and motivational variables into the video sequences. Results of field trials show that the modules were effective in teaching/reteaching mathematical skills/concepts to secondary school students  who had not made normal progress in mathematical learning. In the first trial, students who used materials gained a significant advantage over control subjects in skills/concepts involving factors and prime numbers. The pattern of gains attributable to these modules was replicated in a second trial, but without a control group. Comparable effects were also found to be associated with use of fractions modules, but these results should be interpreted with caution because of lack of a control group. Additional results indicate that the interactive computer-video modules had a beneficial effect on affective as well as cognitive outcomes. (JN)",

A novel type of graph was invented in which angles/lengths of line segments joined end-to-end represented variables of rainfall and temperature of a set of months. It was expected that questions about single values of a variable would be easier to answer when the variable was encoded as a segment length whereas questions about global trends of a variable would be easier to answer when the variable was encoded as a segment angle. Subjects' (N=14) response times when answering questions pertaining to such graphs demonstrated the interaction hypothesized. This was true both when subjects construed stimuli  as meaningless visual patterns and when they construed the same stimuli as graphs. Similar results were obtained regardless of whether subjects were explicitly instructed about how trends of the angle variable translated into geometric shapes. It is concluded that graph formats, and types of information conveyed by graphs, are not uniformly easy or difficult, but that a given type of information is conveyed efficiently in a graph format to the extent that it corresponds to a naturally perceivable visual pattern.

        "description":"Major revision in the U.S. mathematics curriculum since the 1960s have led to significant differences between the mathematics curriculum of the United States and those of many other countries. This study explored how eight Chinese immigrant students, with different cultural backgrounds, mathematics knowledge, and learning styles, learned in an Algebra I course. Three research questions were addressed: (1) How did students learn from the teachers and textbook? (2) What were the students' understandings of the algebraic concepts introduced in the class? (3) How did the mathematics they acquired in their home country affect their learning of the U.S. mathematics curriculum? A multiple-case study method was employed which permitted an examination of results across a number of cases  (individual students) and generalization of findings. Data were collected by classroom observations, teacher/student interviews, testing, clinical studies of students' heuristic processes in problem-solving, and by other methods. Results are reported and discussed under the following categories: teachers (indicating how teachers can affect curriculum), text, student characteristics, the word association test, the sorting test, understanding versus rules, effect of pre-U.S. mathematics learning, problem-solving characteristics, and graph comprehension. Recommendations related to teacher education, mathematics texts, problem solving, and teaching immigrant students are included. (Author/JN)",

It is based on the contention that university students drop out of mathematics as a consequence of prior socialization, educational career contingencies, and goal commitment and career aspirations, with the mix of these factors different for men and women. A life history approach was used, tracing any pattern of participation throughout a person's life which could be regarded as an aspect of the decision processes. Related literature is reviewed and the theoretical framework is described in chapter 2. Chapter 3 describes the procedures used to gather and organize information. Chapter 4 presents sample background characteristics, while chapter 5 lists the major  findings. Neither ability nor sex alone can account for the attrition process; rather, it is caught up in a complex pattern of interactive effects. These are presented in some detail (including 11 statistical tables) and conclusions are drawn in the final chapter. There is a 25-item bibliography and sample interview questions are included in an appendix. (MNS)",

Following an introduction (chapter 1), background information is provided in chapter 2, considering the importance of attitude measures in science education, reviews of research in science education, reviews of attitude research/instrumentation, and other areas. Chapter 3 discusses methodology used to identify potential source materials (in particular, machine searches of ERIC tapes) and instruments used in research, and how relevant instruments were distinguished from irrelevant ones. Chapter 4 discusses techniques used to subject these instruments to analysis which revealed information about their validity, reliability, and other characteristics.  Results are presented and discussed in chapter 5, focusing on: general features, reliability, and validity of the instruments; analyses of instruments for statement type and view of science; and evaluation of instruments by selected criteria. In general, it was found that the field of attitude measurement in science education is not one in which confidence may be placed because the instrumentation is weak on many counts.

        "description":"Research was undertaken to determine how differences in social status among various segments of the population in Mississippi contribute to differences in household energy costs and how socioeconomic differences coupled with social status have impact on energy consumption behavior. Two samples of the state's population were used for comparative analysis. One sample of female and elderly headed households was compared with a sample that represented the larger population of Mississippi which was stratified to be representative of the population on race, income, rural, and urban residency. Personal survey interviews were conducted with the heads of households. The questionnaire covered 11 major items concerning how the energy shortage had impact on families in general. Analyses  showed that impacts of energy costs are comparable for families in different socioeconomic strata. Findings included the following: households in Mississippi, regardless of their social status or socioeconomic conditions, have adjusted their energy consumption and expenditures in accordance to what they can afford rather than in accordance with any specific energy policies or in response to any specific energy conservation programs; the type and quality of housing consistently appeared as a major factor that affects energy costs for families in both samples. National policies are needed that would require energy efficiency standards for housing. Another finding that lends itself to public policy implications is the increased energy efficiency resulting from the numbers and kinds of energy  using features in households. Only a small percentage of each sample had used conservation measures (e.g., turned off lights, closed off unused rooms). Appendices include the survey questionnaire and tables of needed sample respondents. (RM)",

The correspondence thesis, which states that the schools perpetuate existing capitalist economic and social relations and serve as agents of reproduction, was the dominant paradigm of the last decade within the British sociology of education. This thesis has been bitterly contested, and, in recent years, substantially modified. Four developments within British social science over the last decade suggest a form of relative autonomy that grants considerable freedom to the educational system within British society to act either in a reproductive or transformative fashion. The four developments are: (1) the lack of fit between  what the educational system produces and the needs of the British economic structure, (2) recent findings in social policy studies, (3) the partial penetration of capitalism in Britain, and (4) the independence of the school. The relative autonomy theory may be a helpful method by which Marxists may cope with the empirical reality of the British educational system/economy relationship. It suggests not that humans are either free or determined, but that there are both determinations and freedoms. It may be the organizing framework around which to build an empirically valid, intellectually coherent, and policy relevant British sociology of education. (RM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to develop, validate, and describe indicators of educational disadvantage to be used in Australia to identify schools and students most in need of assistance from the Disadvantaged Schools Program. Initially, a detailed review was prepared of the resource allocation responses which have been made in Australia to the changing concept of equality of educational opportunity. Next a theoretical model was developed which was designed to quantify the optimal level of precision with which these responses could be used to allocate resources. The data obtained from a national study conducted during 1975 of the educational achievements of Australian 10-year-old and 14-year-old students in the areas of reading, writing, and numeration were then used to develop  criterion and validation measures for the construction of indicators of educational disadvantage. These data were combined with data from the 1971 Australian Census of Population and Housing which provided detailed descriptions of the students' neighborhoods. These combined data were divided according to age level and aggregated over schools. Following an analysis of indicator characteristics, the indicator with the best overall performance was examined with respect to the dimensions of residential differentiation associated with the Shevky-Bell model. It was demonstrated that neighborhoods associated with educationally disadvantaged schools were characterized by an overlapping network of social features associated with the socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and family living arrangements  of the community.

Much of history's trouble in the schools derives from a misunderstanding about what the subject is and what it is not. History is not social studies; it is essentially narrative. Through narrative, human experience is made understandable. If history is to assume its rightful place in the curriculum, teachers must be adequately trained. Teacher education should begin with a coherent, rigorous liberal education and should include a concentration in history, taught by professional historians and augmented by significant study in related fields. The preparation of history teachers should also include courses in the  writing of history, historical method, and writing and should include pedagogical training. At the elementary level, the irreducible minimum of a history program should acquaint students with the past through progressively sophisticated narratives. The irreducible minimum for secondary schools should include a topical study of U.S. history, a survey of European history, and a survey of U.S. history. Beyond the irreducible minimum for secondary schools, the history of a non-Western country or area should be included. Appendices describe aids for the teacher and recommend books for elementary and secondary students. (RM)",

        "description":"During the early decades of social science in the United States, the strong applied emphasis in sociology and the mutual interest of sociology and social work in social reform made these disciplines nearly indistinguishable. The dissolution in 1909 of the American Social Science Association began a period of divergence between the two disciplines that continued until recent decades, when the two disciplines began converging again. The trend in undergraduate education today toward applied sociology curricula should increase the advantages of cooperation for both sociology and social work. For example, social work students will be more effective practitioners if they are exposed to sociological theories and concepts that can be translated into terms usable in social work practice.  Four obstacles to cooperation are conceptions of differences between the two disciplines, overlapping interests of the two disciplines which blur disciplinary boundaries, competition for students, and departmental politics which impede cooperation in combined departments. Alternative paths to cooperation include merging applied sociology and social work into a single program, making social work courses available as options for applied sociology students, and incorporating social work courses as electives in the applied sociology program.

        "description":"Feminist Research Methodology Groups (FRMGs) have developed as a specific type of women's group in which feminist academics can find supportive audiences for their work while contributing to a feminist redefinition of research methods. An analysis of two FRMGs reveals common characteristics, dynamics, and outcomes. Both were limited to small groups which functioned without a leader. A different woman was responsible for the structure and content of each meeting. Discussion usually centered on how that woman's current research could be redeveloped from a feminist perspective. So that all could participate, subject materials were circulated prior to each meeting. Members noted several positive aspects of this format. Having no leader meant that no one dominated meetings. Members  were sharing and supportive, drawing each other out in an intellectual environment that was relaxed but challenging. While one of these groups is still in operation, the other has disbanded for several reasons, including divergent motivation, group dynamics, and turnover. However, in both cases leaving members felt they were graduating as resocialized feminist researchers. Women contemplating forming FRMGs should address several challenges, among them the need to develop a definition and paradigm for these groups. (LP)",

        "description":"The diagnostic testing component of the Critical Thinking Project of the Pittsburgh schools is described and a rationale for the project's particular choice of testing procedures is provided. The purpose of the project was to help students develop skills for thinking critically and communicating critical thought through reading, discussion, and essay writing within the social studies curriculum. The project defined critical thinking as a dynamic process of questioning and reasoning that reflects a trusting, yet skeptical orientation toward the world. Critical thinking skills are interdependent emphasizing both oral and written expression. Because no existing tests suited the project's conceptualization of critical thinking or met its practical needs, the project developed a  testing procedure that asked students to read passages relevant to their social studies curriculum and write essays in response to questions which asked them to do such tasks as evaluate or draw inferences from what they had read. Asking students to state their ideas clearly and to justify or defend those ideas with coherent explanations and evidence provides insight into the thinking process. An analytical scoring guide which teachers can apply to their student essays quickly to obtain relevant diagnostic information was also developed. Included are two sample essays followed by excerpts from the project's teacher training materials which provide the rationale for the scores given and suggestions for providing feedback to the students who wrote the essays. Appended are a field test  version of a critical thinking test and a detailed version of a diagnostic scoring guide. (RM)",

Concern over the growing nuclear arsenals has grown considerably over the last two years for several reasons, including the educational efforts of several anti-nuclear groups, and the publication of several books, such as Jonathan Schell's &quot;The Fate of the Earth.&quot; Until now, the anti-nuclear movement has, for the most part, been a reaction to an increasing climate of fear. The participants in this movement need to inspire in people confidence to rise above the situation; they need to turn the movement into a force for positive change, into a movement for world peace. To do this, the movement would have to become a global movement--and there are many signs that it is emerging as such. The anti-nuclear movement must  commit itself to a process that will bring civilization by degrees toward an ever-closer approximation of the ideal of peace. In the quest for peace, the art that must be practiced but that can never be perfected is nonviolence. The movement must, therefore, attempt to enhance the conditions under which nonviolence flourishes; it must call internationally for both justice and freedom. It must use education and the arts to encourage an understanding of peace. (RM)",

Women's studies is beyond the stage of compensatory work--the add women and stir method--and the debunking of the traditional disciplines. To provide students with the analytical tools necessary for a more thorough understanding of women's experiences, a gender relations approach--studying men in relation to women--is necessary. An analysis of gender highlights three variables that would structure the teaching of a women's studies course: (1) boundaries, or the structures which establish differences and commonalities between women and men, among  women, and among men; (2) the social processes of negotiation and domination; and (3) consciousness, the subjective understanding of gender upon which people act as women or men. Using gender relations also helps students deal with the &quot;not me&quot; phenomenon, which says that students are individually exempt from patriarchy. Moreover, a theory of gender relations allows for better comparisons with other systems of domination. (RM)",

Activities involve students in exploring their neighborhood, making a community quilt, examining systems to which they belong, and  examining lullabies from various cultures. The activities in the fourth part, intended for intermediate students, help students learn about the larger world, e.g., students examine poetry and short stories to see how people from different cultures like animals.

Focusing on the concepts of change, communication, conflict and interconnectedness, the lessons cover topics such as family conflict in the American Revolution, the Constitution, vigilance committees, riots, conflict in slave stories, girls on an assembly line, multinational corporations, and family histories. Each lesson follows a similar format: a teacher's section outlines the purpose, class time required, procedure and, where applicable, materials, evaluation, and alternative suggestions; and a student section provides a reading selection, study and discussion questions, and several group activities.

Part 2 compares different societies' world views. Readings on Pygmies, Eskimos, Moslems, Americans, and British are used to present cultural feelings about the earth and nature, and show how these views change over time. Part 3 explores  the &quot;style&quot; or overall design of various cultures through the following three categories of readings: background study, cultural similarities and differences, and an in-depth look at the styles of specific decades in American culture. Part 4, Living with Change, examines how people in different cultures respond to change and ways of expressing feelings about change. Part 5 presents readings and activities on sacred clowns, jazz and disco, and wall art, to help students examine the ways a society develops a sense of community. (LP)",

The study deals with feminist theory in the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States. The typology is based on the concept of difference. Two groups are used in the classification scheme: maximizers, those who believe that the differences between men and women are radical and should be emphasized and celebrated; and minimizers, those who would minimize the differences separating men and women and are concerned with integration. A spectrum of attitudes (both historical and contemporary) for each group, on the basis of their position on sex/gender difference and the ultimate goal each advocates for society is then  examined. Connecting links between these two groups are discussed. One example of a link is the contemporary black and Third World feminism which mediates between the struggle for socialist revolution (minimizers) and the specificity of the positive values and characteristics of women of color (maximizers).

Aumaugher states that concept-terms are not always, if ever, used to refer to a set of cases having a feature in common. But this is somewhat misleading, because there are many concepts which are classificatory in nature. Examples include tourist, cat, tax, and game. Aumaugher then goes on to say that Wittgenstein's work suggests that if we wish to teach a concept, we should not set out to look for a feature or set of features that is common to the concepts, but, instead, should examine  examples of the concept (games, for example) and look for a network of overall similarities. While there is nothing wrong or harmful in using Aumaugher's teaching approach, it may leave students without a basic reference point to use when trying to identify concepts. Furthermore, there are many concepts which do not lend themselves to being defined through the identification of attributes-in-common. (RM)",

        "description":"Professional teacher educators recognize that the body of knowledge about teaching and learning is today more substantive, consistent, and authoritative than ever before. It should also be acknowledged, however, that too little of that knowledge is incorporated into the preservice education of teachers. This volume, containing 12 papers presented by eminent scholars at the February 1983 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) in Detroit, Michigan, represents some valuable current research into essential knowledge for beginning educators--that is, what educators must know to teach effectively. This book concentrates on research into generic components of preservice preparation programs. Those elements, as identified by the program  committee of the AACTE meeting, include: (1) instructional planning; (2) management of instruction; (3) management of student conduct; (4) context variables; (5) diagnosis and measurement; and (6) evaluation. In this volume, as at the meeting, two researchers address each area. Also included in this work is a summary paper prepared for the AACTE meeting by B. Othanel Smith and an introduction by Virginia Koehler. The introduction presents a perspective on the evolving state of the art of research dealing with teaching and learning. The summary paper presents a statement and offers clear direction for the improvement of teacher education. (JMK)",

Consideration of the importance of process in such a situation derived from dissatisfaction with the lecture and tutor-led seminar methods, from the composition of the study body, a desire to link class work and the final evaluation, and the link between course content and methodology. A nine-step procedure was worked out consisting of teacher presentation and participation, small group study, reading, and presentation of several topics. The entire class was expected to be familiar with all the readings in order to be able to participate in the discussions led by the group that was responsible  for a particular topic. The final step was an entire class seminar. The procedure is considered preferable to a teacher-dominated class. Student evaluations indicated that the course had achieved its aims of increasing motivation and participation, and involving the students in the process of their own learning. It was also evident that there had been a considerable \"carry-over\" effect to produce a high level of content knowledge. (AMH)",

The studies were carried out to investigate the effect of dictionary use in examinations on students' test performance. In the study at Ben Gurion University, 9 classes, including 91 students, participated. At Haifa University, 5 reading comprehension tests were administered to 670 students, and 8 tests were administered to 740 students. The results of the 3 studies showed a preference for using bilingual dictionaries, on the one hand, and no significant correlation between dictionary use and test score, on the other. To attempt to clarify the test results and to  understand the underlying attitudes and expectations of dictionary users, the researchers at Haifa University administered a questionnaire on dictionary use and preferences. The results of this study may be applied to point out some misconceptions about students' usage of dictionaries and to improve teachers' explanations and dictionary exercises. The study suggests that the dictionary may be better used for the occasional unknown word rather than to create a context whose larger meaning and value is unclear to the reader. (Author/AMH)",

The role of code switching constraints in determining the way two monolingual grammars may be combined in generating discourse containing code switches is analyzed. Intrasentential code switching is characterized as a development requiring competence in the two component codes and skill in manipulating the codes concurrently. Based on code switches in recordings of 20 Puerto Rican bilingual or Spanish-dominant speakers, the distinction between surface and deep code switches, the free union of two grammars, a code switching grammar, superscript conventions, probabilistic grammars, code switching frequencies and rates, and rule frequencies are  discussed. Two linguistic constraints of code switching are identified: the free morpheme constraint and the equivalence constraint. The performance data provided quantitative confirmation of the validity of these constraints. (RW)",

Holes, on the other hand, are those verbs for which the presuppositions of the sentence necessarily form part of the speaker's beliefs. Adult native English speakers and adults learning English as a second language were administered a questionnaire with sentences containing plugs or holes. The subject's task was to judge for each sentence what the speaker of the sentence necessarily had to believe with respect to the presupposed information contained in the sentence. The  results indicate that for both groups, the theoretical distinction between plugs and holes was not real. Both groups treated all the verbs as if they belonged to the category of holes.

Phonological, morphological, and syntactic characteristics of Navajo English are noted. Navajo English also differs from standard English in its approach to time frameworks and tenses. It is suggested that much of the idiosyncratic tense usage found in Navajo English is due to the use of English tenses for the expression of Navajo aspects and modes. Repetition is also a feature of Navajo English discourse that is used as a rhetorical device. Attempts have been made to describe Native American English varieties as autonomous linguistic systems which receive input from both standard English and Native American Languages at the phonological,  morphological, syntactic, and discourse levels.

Eight brief samples of expository prose are examined in order to demonstrate the use of syntactic euphemism to manipulate communication in complex and subtle ways. Syntactic euphemism involves the use of the rules of English syntax for the construction of bias. It is shown that processes such as topicalization and the creation of surface subjects and objects can function to suppress or distort information. Manipulation of sentence structure in the effort to instill beliefs while appearing to maintain objectivity is an example of language use as a subjective projection on the part of the speaker or writer.

Females were more effective than males on component relationship organizing tasks. Multilingual females were the most effective across all measures.

In conducting a PR campaign, first programs and the public image are assessed, then goals are set, and finally strategies are developed. Possible activities include involving local businesses, government at all levels, and the surrounding community. Substantive issues can be presented to the public through forums in which educators and community leaders participate in panel discussions. Students can be involved through interdisciplinary minicourses such  as a combined journalism and foreign language class. The media can be used by sending press releases and letters to newspapers, working with television stations, and writing public service announcements for radio. These and many other ideas and strategies are developed in the articles and pamphlets listed in the references. (DC)",

A broad knowledge of several subject areas, plus schooling in a special translator-training program, are prerequisites for a career in translation. Nonliterary translation offers the most financial stability, with positions available in the federal government, United Nations, and international agencies. Though some private industries hire translators, most utilize the skills of bilingual employees or hire a freelancer and pay them by the number of words translated. A knowledge of Russian, German, Japanese, French, and Spanish is in greatest demand with an increasing need for a knowledge of Chinese, Arabic, and  Portuguese.

Cal-Soap is an experimental program that promotes interinstitutional efforts to increase postsecondary educational opportunities for low-income high school and community college students. The program provides information about postsecondary educational opportunities and is designed to raise the achievement levels of low-income students. Additional objectives are to reduce duplication in outreach efforts and to utilize low-income college students in peer counseling and tutoring for low-income high school students. Another approach, utilized by the  San Diego pilot project, is a student information system that can be used by individual colleges to focus their outreach efforts on potentially eligible students who have expressed interest in the college. The five pilot projects are regional interinstitutional efforts located in Santa Clara County (the Central Coast Consortium); Alameda and Contra Costa Counties (the East Bay Consortium); San Diego County (the Cal-SOAP Consortium); Solano-Yolo Counties (the Solano University and Community College Educational Support Services (SUCCESS) Consortium); and Orange County (the South Coast Consortium).

New issues that receive extensive treatment in the 1981 Plan are discussed: (1) the &quot;pro-competitive&quot; model of health care in the United States; (2) the need for mental health manpower; and (3) the need for geriatric manpower. The major portion of the report consists of detailed information on enrollments and the number of degrees conferred in the various health sciences disciplines and programs in California colleges and universities. Most data comparisons begin with the year 1975-1976, and two  student demographic characteristics are highlighted: ethnicity and sex. A broad overview of the size of educational programs in the various health fields by enrollment and output is included, along with data on changes in student characteristics.

Other relevant studies regarding recruitment and retention of engineering faculty are also reviewed, and recommendations for action by state government, industry, and higher education are offered. The 1982 survey of 109 colleges other than California public institutions covered the amount of engineering salaries, salary flexibility within engineering, range of starting salaries, graduate  assistant salaries, use of other faculty incentives, and outside income of faculty. It is concluded that improved recruitment and retention of engineering faculty can be accomplished through a variety of means, including nonsalary benefits, increased salaries, and graduate support for potential faculty.

The policies and procedures governing facilities maintenance and deferral in California's three segments of public higher education are examined. In addition, current efforts to resolve problems stemming from deferral and their potential impact in light of the likely future of higher education in California are addressed. The University of California has taken a decentralized approach to facilities maintenance, allowing each campus to develop its own administrative and procedural framework and resolve its problems  within broad policy and budgetary guidelines. In contrast, the State University is implementing a comprehensive systemwide program of facilities maintenance management. The challenge set by the facilities maintenance dilemma can be traced to three causes: insufficient funding, diversion of funding to other priorities, and inadequate maintenance procedures. Four possible sources of funds to support deferred maintenance are identified, along with procedures that are needed (e.g., preventive maintenance programs and accountability procedures). (SW)",

Various kinds of evaluative measures were employed, including measures of the appropriate technical knowledge for handicapped care, and attitudes about treatment of handicapped persons in actual practice. A second part of the evaluation effort was a followup survey of the graduates of the 11 target schools in the years 1974, 1976, and 1978 to determine the nature and extent of the handicapped patients in their practice. The data were supplemented by  observations made during site visits to the schools. In addition, graduates of 10 schools that had not been funded were surveyed in 1978 and 1980. Extensive data are presented concerning results of a knowledge test, clinical experience with handicapped patients, treatment planning alternatives, student background characteristics, and followup results. Followup site visits to nine schools who were funded to provide the special training revealed that each of the schools were honoring their commitment to continue the program with their own resources.

Professional development is depicted as a sequence of learning components: (1) broadened knowledge and comprehension; (2) improved application of that knowledge; and (3) an analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of knowledge bases and dissemination strategies. Within each of these three components, there are three levels of staff development: individual, group, and institution. In addition, each of these levels contain elements of personal and professional development. The matrix formed by learning outcomes and levels of development serves as a tool for the staff person and supervisor to determine the specific learning outcomes that are influenced by  individual and institutional needs. Therefore, the model assumes evaluation and self-assessment. A second underlying assumption is that the professional work unit has goals or other guiding statements. Finally, successful use of the model is dependent on institutional resources that are used to support the developmental activities. These include time, varying assignments, and financial and colleague support. (SW)",

To understand the needs and hopes of the faculty better, the current research on life cycles and career stages is reviewed. Characteristics of an academic career that differentiate it from other careers are also considered, including the following: a poorly defined professional identity and a long period of preparation that  focuses on research and ignores teaching. In addition, five stages of personality development of college faculty are identified, along with psychological outcomes of a faculty career. Traditional faculty development programs focusing on academic or scholarly development are distinguished from faculty career development, which includes faculty retraining in new high-technology disciplines, helping faculty move into the corporate world, and early retirement incentives.

        "description":"The causes and consequences of stress experienced by college faculty were investigated. Stress was defined as any characteristic of the job environment that posed a threat to the individual--either excessive demands or insufficient resources. In addition to identifying stressful job situations, attention was directed to ways that faculty members cope with stress, and the relationships between perceived stress and personal and professional factors (e.g., academic disciplines, rank, tenure, productivity, sex, age and experience). Questionnaires were mailed to 1,920 faculty members at 40 public and 40 private doctoral-granting institutions, yielding a response rate of 75.28 percent. Strong evidence was found that stress in university settings was common to all disciplines. Faculty  in a diverse range of disciplines reported similar degrees of stress associated with the teaching, research, and service functions, but teaching was designated as the most stressful activity. Factor analysis also revealed that the stressors associated with reward structure accounted for 55 percent of the common variance. In general, faculty reported that 60 percent of the total stress in their lives came from their work. The majority of the most troublesome stressors were related to time and/or resource constraints.

        "description":"A study of the impact of economic differentiation on institutional pricing and expenditure policies, higher education public policy, and governance in public colleges and universities is described. It is suggested that economic differentiation is a likely determinant of variation in institutional expenditure and pricing policies and higher education public policy among the states. A series of public policy initiatives are described that may affect the autonomy and governance of public colleges and universities in different states. Since attitudes and perceptions of government agency and institutional officials are the key ingredients in public policy research, a multifaceted research design is employed to ensure data validity. Research subjects include officials of the state  coordinating board, public college administrators, and higher education state committee members and support staff. Three research techniques have been selected to identify public policy initiatives and priorities of government agencies: absolute scale technique, rank-order technique, and open-end technique. In addition, published documents, survey techniques, and in-depth interviews are sources of research data. A matrix of research hypotheses, research indicators, and data collection procedures are presented. Finally, a discussion of the implications of public policy for institutional finance in the next decade is included. (SW)",

Interview protocols were coded by two rates, and the epistemological assumptions were categorized, following the Perry scheme, as dualistic, multiplistic, relativistic, or committed. Educational objectives were coded as knowledge of facts, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, or evaluation. Disciplinary division was found to be related to educational objectives, while epistemological assumptions were found to be  related to perceptions of student difficulty. Teachers attributions of the causes for student difficulties were as follows: effort (30 percent), personality characteristics (30 percent), talent (40 percent), study skills (55 percent), and concreteness (45 percent). Teachers who viewed the world in terms of absolute truths, attributed the difficulties of their students to the relatively stable causes of talent and personality. (SW)",

The mini-team training model was developed and used by faculty. In addition to 15 hours of intensive preservice interdisciplinary training, faculty participants were provided with a training and resource guide for curriculum improvement. Curriculum enhancement strategies covered in the training included the following: change in course content/emphasis,  development of new courses, interdisciplinary course teaching, field trips to developmental disabilities service sites, field placement and internships, and guest lectures. In addition, participants were acquainted with some institutional cooperative mechanisms to enable HBCUs to develop course content and training programs in the field of developmental disabilities.

One priority for the future--improving the quality of teachers beyond minimum standards--may be achieved through: rewards for excellence, teacher education programs, teacher certification, reciprocity agreements, and continuing  education of teachers. Additional priorities that need to be addressed are: selecting principals who are leaders, strengthening mathematics and science in the schools, and preparing youth for work. Units of high school work recommended or required for college admission in seven states are identified for: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and South Carolina.

The evaluation design includes the Discrepancy Evaluation Model, which describes differences between program standards and realities. A second evaluation focus compares the long-term effect on program participants vs. a sample of nonparticipant applicants. Results indicate that the program has successfully attracted students naive to biomedical research. All students reported adequate research supervision and instruction, although there was  significant variation in the extent to which students, preceptors, and other lab personnel collaborated. Students devoted the vast majority of time to conducting research, spending less time in the classroom and very little in the clinic. All students showed significant pre-post gains on tests that sampled knowledge about diabetes and research design. Finally, in comparison to nonparticipants, participants have published and presented more research papers, and are more interested in pursuing careers in diabetes care. (Author/SW)",

A schema for understanding and/or classifying different kinds of organizations is also considered, based on the typology of Jeffrey Pfeffer, who characterized organizations as one of four types: professional, collegiate, political/coalition and centralized/bureaucratic. The kinds of power that are available to deans, and  conditions that influence faculty perceptions of different types of power as legitimate are also addressed. To examine the idiographic influences on faculty perceptions of administrator effectiveness, Kilmann and Herden's theory of faculty personality predispositions is analyzed.

The objective of the interview was to determine details of everyday social interaction through which the student is able to construct and sustain a reality of the university. All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed onto a word processor, and content coded. In phase two of the research, verification and expansion of  existing patterns of behavior were sought. The interview topics then become more individualized and were covered in a more structured way. The outcome of these steps was a conceptual framework for understanding persistence among Mexican-American freshmen. Examples of data that were generated by this approach are presented.

The theory was developed from interview responses at six institutions as well as questionnaire results. In phase one, interviews were conducted with 26 key administrators centrally involved in budgetary decisions at the six institutions. A second study phase concentrated on 74 budgetary units within three of the institutions. Five theoretical concepts were proposed: centrality, resource allocations, environmental power, institutional power, and resource allocation strategies. In addition, propositions were developed about relations among concepts. Attention was focused on the interactive effects of a department's centrality, its ability to tap needed  environmental resources, and the strength of its institutional roots on the share of budget funds it acquires. Two kinds of organizational power, a unit's environmental power gained by its relative ability to tap into external resources needed by the organization and a unit's institutional power gained through the strength of its internal roots in the organization, combined to explain about two-fifths of the variance in budget allocation changes. Differences between core and peripheral units were also explored. (SW)",

The ways that these students coped with the dual student-spouse role and made meaning of their experiences were also addressed. Techniques of ethnographic interviews were employed in collecting and analyzing data. Four major aspects of the married doctoral students' experiences were used to described behaviors, attitudes, perceptions, and relationships: (1) support, (2) marital stability, (3) social relationships, and (4) status. The most important source of support for the student was the spouse, who provided  financial, emotional/psychological, and basic needs support. Factors that affect marital stability included differences in spouses' educational levels and interests, financial problems, time pressures, children, communication, sexual concerns, and role conflict. Generally, relationships developed within the college did not serve important support roles, and enrollment may have altered the student's perceived or actual status in either a positive or negative way.

Most states have applied a number of criteria in program review rather than a few--particularly, the number of graduates, students enrolled, student interest and demand, appropriateness  to role and mission, program quality, size of classes, and cost of courses--but consensus is lacking as to how qualitative factors should be used in program review. State-level recommendations resulting from program review may include continuation, modification, merger, or discontinuation. Additional considerations relating to state-level program review include: whether to review degree programs or departments, research and public service centers, and nonacademic areas; the accommodation between program review and specialized accreditation; the pattern of use of program review in other state-level decision making; expectations of other state-level authorities; and the nature of institutional leadership exercised.

        "description":"The joint effects of institutional and environmental factors on college enrollments on a year-to-year basis were investigated. The study population included all public and private two- and four-year colleges and universities who completed the Higher Education General Information Survey for 1975-1976 through 1980-1981. Four major environmental factors constraining enrollments were assessed: the size of the pool of potential students, the availability of resources for individuals wishing to enroll, the level of economic wealth within a region, and the level of economic activity within the region. Five institutional factors were also evaluated: program emphasis, size of the region served, admissions selectivity, type of clientele served, and price. For public institutions, federal  student aid and the levels of economic wealth and activity significantly affected enrollments. In addition, institutional selectivity and the type of clientele served, as measured by aptitude scores and the proportion of part-time students, were significant predictors of future enrollments. Idiosyncratic institutional factors seem to account for most of the variation in changes in enrollments among institutions. The enrollments of private institutions were relatively stable, and for the most part, appeared to be insulated from environmental conditions. (SW)",

To reduce administration costs and increase program credibility among respondents, surveys are distributed to students by students. Typically, a survey polls about 30 classes with a total of about 500 students, or approximately 2 percent of the student body. Surveys use multiple-choice questions whenever  possible and are formatted for direct data entry. Direct benefits of the program include: improved quality of the survey, improved sampling, standardized procedures, freedom of information, cost efficiency, and credibility.

To examine the explanatory power of the various theories and models, information from a program evaluation conducted at a small public liberal arts university is examined. The scope of this program evaluation is as follows: to obtain a systematic view of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each department, and to use the feedback to improve the programs; to have participants rank order each of the 19 academic programs on nine criteria; and to target future resource allocations to program changes. Attention is directed to the  following issues that may affect how evaluative information is linked to programmatic decisions: stages of the evaluation process, a distinction between the reasons and motives for the evaluation, involvement of the participants/decision-makers in the evaluation process, communication of the results, organizational setting, recognition of the subjectivity of the evaluation, and the role of the institutional researcher.

This analysis creates a matrix of questions directed toward identifying information and services. The questions can be grouped into four basic categories: type of decision (e.g., continuation, withdrawal); type of individual; circumstances surrounding the decision; and system response. Specifically, decision feedback questions (i.e., the issue matrix) help to identify the existing or  potential paths of individuals through education, occupation, and social service components. The reduction model uses the three basic systems of elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education. The combination of the reduction model and the issue matrix provides a method for rational assessment and planning. (SW)",

Uses of the state-level participation rates include: (1) enrollment projections and (2) as  a relative measure of access to and importance of higher education in the state compared to other states. At the institutional level, participation rates can be determined at almost any level, such as schools or programs.

        "description":"The role of institutional research in policy analysis regarding the operation of a computer model for delivery of financial aid to disadvantaged students is considered. A student financial aid model at Arizona State University is designed to develop a profile of late appliers for aid funds and also those who file inaccurate or incomplete applications. The unmet financial need of these students is then projected for the various campus-based aid programs, allowing the aid officer to inventory and stockpile such funds to later serve these students with special needs (usually disadvantaged students). However, although disadvantaged students may have difficulty in completing accurate, timely aid applications, most institutions have a first-come, first-served policy for obtaining  financial aid. Setting aside funds for late appliers involves many pragmatic, legal, and public relations matters. The involvement of an institutional research unit of any college using the model is likely to be central, and exemplifies the type of policy analysis implications inherent in any research activity that affects social policy. To respond effectively to the dilemmas identified, institutional researchers need to understand the decision-making framework and values of decision makers at the college. (SW)",

Five personal factors emerged: self-interest and institutional interest, discipline concerns, a pessimistic viewpoint of higher education, and perceived power of faculty. Three environmental factors also were found: facilities, quality, and financial support. Multiple regression analysis revealed two major factors: quality and pessimism. A strong faculty concern for quality in their students, colleagues, and work environment was found. In  evaluating the pessimism factor, a predictor indicating career/role dissatisfaction, concerns for quality again emerged. In short, faculty concerns for a perceived diminution of quality were a principal predictor of dissatisfaction with their place of work and career. The results held irrespective of age, sex, rank, security (tenure), and type of institution. More dissatisfaction was expressed with place of employment than with the career.

All 377 full-time teaching faculty and librarians (309 men and 68 women) employed by a public four-year college in fall 1981 were investigated. Four stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed. Rank, age, year of appointment, department chair status, librarian status, and sex all affected salary significantly; while tenure, race, and citizenship did not. Contrary to hypothesis, removing rank and tenure from the model did not unmask a sex effect. The uses of regression models in studying faculty salaries are  discussed, as are the following five weaknesses: (1) the validity of the model is affected by the choice of variables, (2) variables of interest may be difficult to operationalize, (3) regression analysis assumes all data are linear, (4) regression models with a large number of predictors have relatively poor power, and (5) intercorrelations among the independent variables may mask the true relationship between the variables and salary.

In considering different types of stressors and stress reactions, it is noted that stress from all sources is cumulative and cannot be ignored during the workday, and that both pleasant and unpleasant happenings can result in stress. One source of stress for the institutional researchers is their tendency to work with and depend upon a number of other persons and offices without having any direct control. In addition, there is little extrinsic recognition for the work of institutional researchers, which often involves sensitive data and issues that must be treated neutrally without publcity. Physically, excess stress causes such symptoms as fatigue, muscle tension, and  susceptibility to illness. Prolonged stress can lead to depression, boredom, and negative attitudes about work and others, as well as poor performance (i.e., burnout). Five suggestions for managing stress are offered. The following conclusions are offered: stress is real and can become serious; family stress cannot be ignored during working hours, and job tensions cannot be left at the office; and stress cannot be avoided, but must be managed.

Of the 18 responding offices, 9 indicated that their institutions utilized a marketing approach to planning. Of these 9 offices, 56 percent reported formal utilization of the marketing approach to institutional planning, while 44 percent reported informal or partial usage of this approach. Marketing functions were scattered throughout the institution with little reported integration as a whole marketing or strategic marketing system. The findings also indicated that IR offices were not performing many of the strategic marketing functions that can be readily assimilated. Indications were found that  most IR personnel are not familiar with the basic terminology used in marketing (and business in general). The possibilities of incorporating a strategic marketing focus within the domain of institutional research are addressed. It is suggested that a strategic marketing model be followed and that IR offices be involved in the development and evaluation of: promotional strategies; product/service opportunities, pricing strategies, distribution strategies, and internal and external environment changes and projections.

Within the University of Utrecht, this means the end of a mentality that equated autonomy with isolation.

        "description":"The Information Exchange Procedures (IEP), which were developed through a project sponsored by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, are briefly described, and the application of the IEP in Virginia is examined. The IEP were designed to enhance the institution's ability to identify alternatives in the allocation of resources and related management functions. The procedures for IEP consist of merging three categories of data: course enrollments, faculty activities, and financial expenditures. In the mid-1970s Virginia adopted the IEP costing procedures (with some modifications) to provide information on modified direct cost. A study was conducted to evaluate the stability and consistency of IEP unit costs and productivity ratios for two major research  universities for 1978-1979 and 1980-1981. It was assumed that figures for comparable activities at similar universities would have consistency and similarity over time. Two indices were obtained: direct cost per student credit hour and student credit hours generated per full-time equivalent faculty position. The assumption of comparability was found to be less valid than stability over time, since errors over institutions were larger than errors over time. This finding casts doubt on the reliability of comparing IEP indices across research universities. (SW)",

A total of 139 freshmen at St. Edward's University in Texas were surveyed at the beginning and end of the freshman year, using the Survey of Entering Freshmen and the End of Freshman Year Survey. Significant differences were found between returners and leavers on grade point average, perceived difficulty of courses, students' satisfaction with the availability and variety of courses, expectations of finding people to date, finding their classes challenging, and expectations of the university in general based on the catalog. While students' intentions regarding enrollment at entrance did not appear to be related  to their sophomore year enrollment status, intentions measured at the end of the freshman year were fairly accurate predictors. Those students who were dissatisfied with university life, and especially with social activities and with courses available, also appear to be potential leavers. In addition, students who were not continuing in required courses for the degree may be potential leavers. (SW)",

Types of student data that institutional researchers should address include: entrance tests scores, retention rate, student outcomes, location and recruitment of graduates, results of licensing examinations, scholarship recipients, and student activities and national recognition. In promoting the quality of an institution, factors to consider include: faculty awards of fellowships, number of faculty with advanced degrees, years of teaching experience, full-time faculty, scholarly activity, accomplishments of students, and student evaluations. The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards for College Libraries provide for the evaluation of collection  adequacy, as well as for staff and facility assessment. Additionally, qualitative standards for measuring library resources are also being used. It is concluded that institutional research (IR) should view the assessment of institutional quality as a priority management task. Criteria and data profiles that answer questions of both internal and external constituencies should be developed by IR offices. (SW)",

Specific objectives of the study were as follows: to test the ability of Vroom's valence model to predict student satisfaction, to test the ability of Vroom's force model to predict student effort toward the achievement of certain academic and personal development goals, to test the ability of Vroom's performance model to predict academic motivation, and to predict student grade point averages from the interaction of ability and motivation. The study populations were 210 students from an urban, commuter campus and 152 students from a residential multiversity. Moderate to high support was  found for the expectancy theory models as predictors of college student satisfaction, participation, and achievement (as indicated by grade point averages). The data suggest that students who expended more effort into academic work, and into personal development activities, felt a greater sense of satisfaction with the environment than did students in a below-average effort group.

The study population was 319 public two-year colleges, 189 of which had faculty bargaining units and 130 of which did not have faculty bargaining. Findings include the following: both groups of institutions devoted the majority of expenditures to instructional costs; faculty at colleges with unions earned a  higher average salary and taught fewer students than faculty in similar institutions without unions -- this resulted in a higher cost of instruction at colleges with unions; institutions with collective bargaining raised a greater percentage of their revenues from tuition and fees and state and local appropriations, while nonunion colleges received higher percentages from grants, gifts, contracts, and endowment income.

Using critical event cycles as a unit of analysis, attention was focused on distinctive patterns of institutional adaptation. Based on site visits, a list of 33 critical events at the 17 campuses was developed, from which 13 critical event cycles were identified. The most pre-emptive pattern associated with organizational change (in 6 of the 17 colleges) was the prominence of the enrollment shortfall followed by the presidential shake-up cycle. All of the colleges experienced a financial crisis in the early 1970s, precipitated largely by unanticipated enrollment shortfalls. All appointed new presidents between 1971-1975, who were granted broad powers for restabilizing the  institution. Patterns associated with persistence and stability were also identified. The picture that emerged was generally one of institutions driven primarily by external forces/actors and student consumers, and only sometimes by powerful presidents. Changes in Carnegie classification in 1970, 1976, and 1978, as well as substantive changes in curriculum and student and faculty composition during the 1970s, were also analyzed. Lists of the critical events and cycles are appended. (SW)",

The adaptive model of strategy, based on resource dependence, involves managing demands in order to satisfy critical-resource providers. The constructive model of strategy, based on social constructionism, involves managing meaning in order to enhance the organization's legitimacy. Interview data, published and unpublished materials, and Higher Education General Information Survey results were evaluated. Variables for the adaptive model related to responsiveness in academic programs, organizational flexibility, diversity of academic programs, and efficiency. Variables for the constructive model were fund-raising and  marketing, professionalization of the management team, focus for the academic program, and improving and involving the trustees. The adaptive model of strategy was followed by most members of both groups of colleges: the &quot;more resilient&quot; and the &quot;less resilient.&quot; The adaptive model appeared to assist in the recovery efforts, but did not account for the faster recovery of the more resilient set. The constructive model of strategy was followed by most of the more resilient colleges but by few of the less resilient colleges. (SW)",

A major research question is whether the study of institutional effectiveness can identify indicators of long-term organizational viability. In 1980, organizational effectiveness was measured in 29 of 41 schools that had been studied in 1976 (Cameron). Institutional representatives were administered questionnaires that required them to provide descriptive information regarding the extent to which their institution possessed characteristics indicative of effectiveness. The same nine dimensions of effectiveness emerged from this study as have emerged in past research. Factors accounting for high scores on the nine  effectiveness dimensions are identified, along with factors accounting for improvement or decline in effectiveness scores. Attention is also directed to characteristics of institutions that improved in their overall effectiveness as compared to those that remained stable or declined in effectiveness. Based on the findings, the importance of environmental factors and managerial strategies in organizational effectiveness is discussed, and the effectiveness of specific types of management strategies are distinguished.

Hermon Road, Suite 207, Scotts Valley, CA 95066. EVALUATION COMPLETED: January, 1983 at the Oakland ISD in Pontiac, Michigan. COST: $45.00. ABILITY LEVEL: Grades 2 to 8. SUBJECT: Language Arts. TOPIC: Spelling. MEDIUM OF TRANSFER: 5-1/4&quot; flexible disk. REQUIRED HARDWARE: Apple II, 48K, single drive, color monitor recommended. REQUIRED SOFTWARE: Applesoft, DOS 3.3. INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSE: Standard instruction. INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES: Remediation, drill and practice, tutorial, authoring. DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE: In program--sample program output, student's instructions. In supplementary materials--sample program output,  program operating instructions, teacher's information, resource/reference information, student's instructions. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES: (INFERRED) To increase the users spelling skills. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: None. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: This package is a spelling drill and practice that employs sound, color graphics and a special &quot;mind's eye&quot; technique to help recall words. POTENTIAL USES: Supplement for individuals or pairs of students. Good for anyone with spelling difficulties. Especially good in reading lab or special education class. Easy entry of weekly spelling lists. Menu option of adding individual word lists with sentence practice. MAJOR STRENGTHS: Presents spelling words in unusual and attractve format. Students intrigued by need to visualize words forwards and  backwards. Hi-res displays change very quickly--much faster than many other programs. Good techniques for spelling words. Good reinforcement with several program options. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: Learner must make many choices before program starts. Student must indicate: A) name, B) favorite color, C) upper or lower case, D) right or lefthanded, E) sound or no sound, F) choose word list from menu, G) choose from menu of five options. Program would be better if some choices could be preset by teacher and retained on disk (choices C,E, F and G). Program may be too long for regular classroom use. No choice on which program to use for reinforcement. The user must go through all of them, which makes program lengthy. OTHER COMMENTS: The producer indicates that the package is intended to teach a new  method of learning (neurolinguistic programming) rather than strictly content area material. EVALUATION SUMMARY: Evaluators indicate they would use or recommend use of this package with little or no change. (Author)",

PRODUCER: Davidson and Associates, 6069 Groveoak Place #12, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90274. EVALUATION COMPLETED: January, 1983 by the Oakland ISD of Pontiac, Michigan. COST: $70.00. ABILITY LEVEL: Secondary. SUBJECT: Reading. MEDIUM OF TRANSFER: 5-1/4&quot; flexible disk. REQUIRED HARDWARE: Apple II, 48K, single disk drive. REQUIRED SOFTWARE: DOS 3.3, Applesoft. INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSE: Remediation, standard instruction. INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUE: Drill and practice. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVE: (INFERRED) To increase reading speed. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: None. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: Using program and data diskettes, the user is given various exercises designed to improve  reading speed. Documentation summarizes disk program content for each exercise and prescribes passage through package. ESTIMATED STUDENT TIME REQUIRED: 30 minutes, twice a week. POTENTIAL USES: Using this package in the classroom is difficult since it requires a quiet atmosphere for concentration. However, it covers valuable reading skills (rate and efficiency) which are more easily taught via the computer than via the former tachistoscope. Speed reading is most appropriate for individual or small group usage, which makes it excellent for secondary students in a reading/study skills lab. The program can be used by average or above-average secondary students who wish to independently improve their reading rate and comprehension. With more teacher involvement and direction, remedial  students could benefit from some of the drill exercises. MAJOR STRENGTHS: Once the learner understands the purpose and operation of the program, he/she can run it easily himself each time--no more teacher guidance would be needed to advance with the program. This program forces the learner to &quot;keep up&quot; better than a print speed reading program can. In other words, the learner cannot &quot;cheat&quot;. The practices are to be limited to one per day (maximum time of 30 minutes) and as few as two sessions per week. Thus, boredom or &quot;burn-out&quot; probably will not occur. The package has good manual and user documentation. Its content is accurate and feedback on the student's progress is accurate and immediate. Exam units are included. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: The text selections are not motivational or  plentiful. They are void of explanations and activities for adjusting speed/method of reading for specific content. EVALUATION SUMMARY: Evaluators indicated they would use or recommend use of this package with little or no change. (Author)",

EVALUATION COMPLETED: January 1983 at the North Clackamas School District, Milwaukie, Oregon, and at Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, Portland, Oregon. COST: $32.95. ABILITY LEVEL: Grades 3 through 6. SUBJECT: Language. TOPIC: Parts of Speech. MEDIUM OF TRANSFER: 5-1/4&quot; flexible disk. REQUIRED HARDWARE: Apple II, 48K, 1 disk drive, monitor, printer (optional). REQUIRED SOFTWARE: Applesoft, DOS 3.3 or 3.2. INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSE: Standard instruction, assessment. INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES: Instructional management, authoring, drill and practice, tutorial. DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE: In  program--student's instructions. In supplementary materials--suggested grade/ability level(s), instructional objectives, program operating instructions, and teacher's information. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES: (STATED) To provide drill and practice on recognition of common and proper nouns, possessives; nouns and pronouns; noun plurals; and identification of pronouns and antecedents. The objectives are more precisely stated in the manual. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: (INFERRED) The student should have some prior instruction to the objectives. A student planning option is available to assess the student's progress. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: The package covers identification of nouns, plural nouns, possessives, identification and use of pronouns and pronoun antecedents. The student is presented  with a stimulus and inputs a choice of a, b, or c, or a word. The package includes a record keeping option with printing capability. Also included is a create-a-lesson format. POTENTIAL USES: This package is most appropriately used with individual students for remedial, standard instruction or enrichment. MAJOR STRENGTHS: the presentation of the material is very logical. The program allows for alternate ways of answering the questions and gives immediate feedback. The capability for the teacher to author appropriate materials for students is a real plus! By following directions in the program and reading the documentation carefully, the process is very easy. Modifications to any existing lesson can also be made. The record keeping for students is a strong point in that it tells not only  how many were missed, but exactly what was missed. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: The rewards are not particularly exciting, and would seem not to be a motivator in themselves. In places, the screen is somewhat crowded due to the larger lettering.

CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: Adventure combined with spelling drill and practice with clear directions for use. ESTIMATED STUDENT TIME REQUIRED: 20 minute sessions. POTENTIAL USES: Introduce disk to whole class to explain how it operates. Make up student assignment sheets including title of list, place for student name, and the date, the list of words and a place to enter the student's progress report. Student would be given assignment sheet and sent to media center to use program. Upon completion of program, student would return assignment sheet to teacher for evaluation and  follow-up. This would be an excellent program for correlating vocabulary from other subject areas. Program provides an excellent means for classroom teacher to enter his or her own list of spelling or other words in which review of spelling is needed. Students find the format very motivational. It is very easy to enter a list of words. MAJOR STRENGTHS: The program is simple to use, especially entering a list of the teacher's choosing. The program is appealing to students. It has many possibilities for use in all subject areas. Input of the teacher's own words into program is allowed, making the program very relevant. It is very easy to enter a list of words.

Box 50047, San Jose, California 95050. EVALUATION COMPLETED: September 1982 by the staff and constituents of the Capital Children's Museum. Their evaluation is partly based on observation of student use of the package. COST: $34.95. ABILITY LEVEL: Pre-kindergarten to kindergarten. SUBJECT: Alphabet and number recognition. MEDIUM OF TRANSFER: 5-1/4&quot; flexible disk. REQUIRED HARDWARE: Atari 800 with 24K ram, Atari 810 disk drive, monitor or television. REQUIRED SOFTWARE: Atari Basic (cartridge). INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSE: Remediation, standard instruction, enrichment, assessment. INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES: Drill and practice,  tutorial, information retrieval, game, learning management, pattern recognition. DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE: Supplementary materials include: suggested grade/ability level(s), instructional objectives, sample program output, program operating instructions, and teacher's information. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES (Stated): To teach the alphabet and numbers in a pleasing fashion by means of association. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES (Inferred): The ability to manipulate the computer system, especially the keyboard. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: &quot;My First Alphabet&quot; serves as a remedial reinforcement as well as a number and alphabet learning program. The package provides optional selections for the user, depending on how the program is used. Users may select prompts or answers. ESTIMATED STUDENT TIME  REQUIRED: Thirty minutes to one hour per day. POTENTIAL USES: The package is appropriate for group work in the classroom or for home use. For children just beginning to use the program, a great deal of adult supervision will be needed. The program is quite noisy and could disturb children working on other projects nearby. MAJOR STRENGTHS: 1. The graphics are excellent, 2. The sound rewards are varied, 3. The program relies on association to teach, rather than on drill, 4. The program is stimulating and enjoyable. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: 1. A letter or number should be drawn before its picture is presented so that children have enough time to study its shape, 2. Motion of graphics and prompts across the screen should be from left to right to encourage children with Dyslexia to read in that  direction, 3. If the program were used wih a voice synthesizer, children would not have to depend on an adult to be sitting with them, 4. The disk is required at most times in the program, 5. Exit from the program is only possible at the end of each presentation or respond, which renders the documentation pointless.

Supplementary materials provide information for the teacher. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: Not stated. ESTIMATED STUDENT TIME REQUIRED: Approximately 2 1/2 hours per section. POTENTIAL USES: To diagnose student strengths and weaknesses in English grammar, and based on the diagnosis, to provide tutorials for instruction in areas of weakness. MAJOR STRENGTHS: The diagnosis of student knowledge and provision for acquisition of knowledge and skill application. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: 1. The use of vocabulary  such as &quot;appropriate&quot; when referring to linking verbs is vague. Because its meaning is unclear, more than one response should be correct. 2. Pressing the wrong key can produce a correct response. For instance in the &quot;Get Acquainted&quot; lesson, the &quot;?&quot; key produces the same results as the space bar; in lesson 36 the user is not oriented to pressing the actual keys needed to supply the correct response. 3.

EVALUATION COMPLETED: June 1982, by staff of the Portland Public Schools, Multnomah ESD, Portland, Oregon. COST: $80 per module; $375 for series of 5 modules. ABILITY LEVEL: 3-9. SUBJECT: Language Arts: Grammar and Usage, Homonyms. MEDIUM OF TRANSFER: 5-1/4&quot; flexible disk. REQUIRED HARDWARE: 48K Apple II, Single disk drive, B &amp; W monitor. REQUIRED SOFTWARE: DOS 3.2, 3.3; Applesoft. INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSE: Assessment, standard instruction. INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES: Drill and practice, tutorial, learning management. DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE: In the program: student instructions, followup activities, and posttesting.  In supplementary materials: suggested grade/ability levels, instructional objectives, program operating instructions, teacher's information, resource/reference information, and information about the program's relationship to standard textbooks. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES (Stated): to provide individual drill and practice for students on troublesome homonyms and word pairs, using skills and concepts already introduced by teachers. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES (Inferred): Students should already be familiar with the concept of homonyms and should have had considerable practice using them in drill and practice situations. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: This package contains eight tests on homonyms covering simple homonyms, contraction homonyms, triple homonyms and confusing pairs. Students must pass  tests at 90% or better to move on to another test. Failure to pass at the 90% or better level results in additional drill and practice experience. This package also contains a useable student management program component. This package is one component of an integrated program series covering English grammar. ESTIMATED STUDENT TIME REQUIRED: Twenty minutes per day until the material is mastered. POTENTIAL USES: This package would be useful in a classroom setting for drill and practice or testing of student knowledge of homonyms. It would not be useful for basic instruction, and students should probably have had considerable paper practice on homonyms prior to using the program. MAJOR STRENGTHS: The program contains student and class management components which allow the teacher to assign  work (drill and practice) as needed by students. The material in the program had been correlated with basal language arts texts. The material includes a scope and sequence chart. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: The program does not make adequate use of the more creative aspects of a computer. A more extensive teacher's guide with student support materials would be helpful.

COST: Apple II and Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III disk, $60.00. Models I and III cassette, $39.00. ABILITY LEVEL: Grades 3-9. SUBJECT: Language arts: reading. MEDIUM OF TRANSFER: 5-1/4&quot; flexible disk. REQUIRED HARDWARE: Apple II or Apple II Plus, with single disk drive and monitor or television. (Also available for TRS 80 models I, III with cassette or disk drive.) REQUIRED SOFTWARE: DOS 3.3 (for Apple II version). INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSE: Remediation, standard instruction.  INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES: Drill and practice. DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE: Computer program includes prerequisite skills and activities, program operating instructions and followup activities. Supplementary materials include suggested grade/ability levels, instructional objectives, prerequisite skills/activities, program operating instructions and teacher's information. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES: Provide drill and practice in recognition of homonyms within a given context. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: (Not stated) Reviewers infer that users have received instruction covering the idea of homonyms, and that users can spell (and read) words that are presented. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: This package presents a series of six lessons of increasing levels of difficulty (third grade through high school).  Each lesson consists of 25 contextual sentences for which the student must choose the appropriate homonym. An incorrect response (or allowing the 12 second time limit to expire) causes the correct word to appear. Then the next frame presents the same sentence again. A new sentence is not presented until the student has entered the correct answer. At the end of the lesson, the program reviews the sentences the student missed. Lessons are in increasing difficulty, based on vocabulary and context of sentences. At the end of each lesson, there is a short game the student may play. ESTIMATED STUDENT TIME REQUIRED: Twenty minutes per level (six levels). POTENTIAL USES: The package would be appropriate as part of the instructional program at the indicated grade levels. MAJOR STRENGTHS: The  program provides an immediate, personalized response. There is an opportunity to correct incorrect responses. The program includes a range of difficulty levels, and the program is easily managed by students. The game at the end of each lesson was viewed as motivational. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: Some reviewers felt that the material intended for grades 7-9 was too simple for that level. Others felt it was appropriate. The program could be improved by allowing teachers to tailor the program by selecting the number of trials and the homonym pairs in the lessons. It was felt that teachers could not make changes to meet particular student needs. EVALUATION SUMMARY: Evaluators indicate they would use or recommend use of this package with little or no change.

Central Expressway, Dallas, TX 75243. LOCAL DISTRIBUTORS: Contact producer for list. EVALUATION COMPLETED: Fall 1981. VERSION: Apple II. COST: $24.95. ABILITY LEVEL: Grades 4+. SUBJECT: Library Skills: identifying and locating fiction, non-fiction, biography; using Dewey numbers, card catalog, reference books. MEDIUM OF TRANSFER: 5&quot; flexible disk. REQUIRED HARDWARE: 32K Apple II, one disk drive, color monitor. REQUIRED SOFTWARE: Applesoft Basic. INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSE: Standard Instruction. INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES: Drill and practice, tutorial. DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE; Suggested grade/ability level, instructional  objectives, program operating instructions, post-test. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES: At the completion of the program, students will be able to: identify and locate fiction, non-fiction and biographies; use the Dewey Decimal System to locate non-fiction books; use the card catalog to locate books; and know how to locate and use reference books. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: To use the program successfully, students will need to: know the computer keyboard and the Yes and No commands, be able to read at fifth grade level, be able to learn from a minimal amount of information and practical exercises, and have had prior exposure to a library. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: The program is organized into three sections. Part I is a series of text displays telling the student what the computer will do and  how and when to respond. This introductory section also defines a library in terms of the kinds of materials most commonly found in modern collections. Part II allows the student to choose among four skills: identifying fiction, non-fiction, and biography; learning how books are arranged; using the Dewey Decimal System and the card catalog to locate books; and using reference materials. Each skill section begins with an objective, a definition and example(s). This is followed by a short series of drill and practice exercises. Students may set their own pace and ask for help from a &quot;First Aid Station.&quot; Part III is a brief final drill on all of the skills. ESTIMATED STUDENT TIME REQUIRED: Not available. POTENTIAL USES: The program may be used as a supplementary exercise in a school library  skills program, or as a means of assessing a student's skill level prior to instruction. MAJOR STRENGTHS: The program is cheerful, student paced and uses color graphics appropriately. The operating instructions are well stated and available when needed. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: The program has spelling and factual errors and provided only minimal tutorial assistance to students. The instructional quality of the program is shallow and incomplete and allows students to go through it giving wrong answers and receive a passing grade. Practice exercises are too short, definitions vague and/or misleading, the reteaching is repetition of past presentations, and documentation is nearly nonexistent. Students are allowed to choose among the skills at random; however, the tutorials and exercises are  designed sequentially. The vocabulary level is too difficult for fourth graders. EVALUATION SUMMARY: Evaluators indicate they would not use ths package (Note Major Weaknesses). (Author)",

PRODUCER: Hartley Courseware, Inc., Box 431, Dimondale, Michigan 48821. EVALUATION COMPLETED: January, 1983 at the Clackamas County ESD, Milwaukie, Oregon. COST: $26.95. ABILITY LEVEL: Pre-school through grade 10. SUBJECT: Language Arts. TOPIC: Spelling. MEDIUM OF TRANSFER: 5-1/4&quot; flexible disk, protected. REQUIRED HARDWARE: Apple, 48K, 1 disk drive, monitor, cassette control device, cassette player/recorder, printer (optional). REQUIRED SOFTWARE: Cassette tapes, Applesoft, DOS 3.3 or 3.2. INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSE: Remediation, standard instruction, assessment. INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUE: Instructional management, authoring, drill and practice. DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE: In  program--student's instructions. In supplementary materials--sample program output, program operating instructions, and teacher's information. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVE: Creating lessons is done by teacher--objectives would vary from teacher to teacher. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: None stated. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: Teacher records auditory stimulus which can require one word or a phrase to an answer. Student planning/recordkeeping is included. Teacher creates all lessons. POTENTIAL USES: There is no curriculum content with this package. It is a program which allows a teacher to author his/her own word list, so it would be useful in any curriculum area. The teacher first creates a word list using a tape recorder with a controller device from the computer, the teacher then pronounces each  word in the list, and uses it in a sentence if desired. Students using the program type the word into the computer which they hear from the tape recorder. MAJOR STRENGTHS: The unique use of the cassette control device (CCD) is a positive aspect of this package and gives students both visual and auditory clues. The only limitation is the amount of time the computer allows to get something recorded on tape. The capability for the teacher to author appropriate materials for students is a real plus! By following directions in the program and reading the documentation carefully, the process is very easy. The record keeping for students is a strong point in that it tells not only how many were missed, but exactly what was missed. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: The program does not allow for capital letters  in responses, so the student could not use proper nouns. The rewards are not particularly exciting, and would seem not to be a motivator in themselves.

EVALUATION COMPLETED: June 1982 by staff of the Portland Public Schools, Oregon. COST: Cassette: $24 Disk: $34.50. ABILITY LEVEL: K-1. SUBJECT: Reading: location of letters on keyboard, order of letters in alphabet. MEDIUM OF TRANSFER: Cassette or 5 1/4&quot; flexible disk. REQUIRED HARDWARE: Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I, 16K cassette; Model III 32K with disk; Apple II 32K with disk. REQUIRED SOFTWARE: Model III, TRS-DOS; Apple II, DOS 3.3. INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSE: Remediation, standard instruction. INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES: Drill and practice, tutorial. DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE: The computer program includes  operating instructions and student instructions. Supplementary materials include the suggested grade and ability levels, instructional objectives, program operating instructions, sample program output, teacher's information and student instructions. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES: (Stated) The program teaches kindergartners and first graders the location of letters on the computer keyboard. It also teaches the child to type letters in alphabetical order. No attempt is made to teach finger positions or other typing skills. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: (Inferred) The user needs to know the correct order of the alphabet in order to succeed. Students would need a teacher's help to read instructions. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: This package consists of a diskette and a notebook explaining the program to  the teacher. The diskette contains three exercises: one on the location of capital letters on the keyboard, one on the location of lower case letters and one on the order of letters in the alphabet. This package is one component of an integrated series in reading being developed by Random House. ESTIMATED STUDENT TIME REQUIRED: Twenty to thirty minutes; repeated usage would probably be necessary to learn skills. POTENTIAL USES: This package would be appropriate for students who want to learn the computer keyboard and who can read instructions. MAJOR STRENGTHS: The program is clearly presented and it helps students use the keyboard in their first experience with a computer. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: The program is designed for kindergarten and first graders, but children this age usually cannot  read the instructions on the screen. They would need to know the alphabet to do so.

INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVE: (STATED) To provide drill and practice for elementary students in grades 1-2 in the areas of beginning consonants, ending consonants and median vowels. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: None stated. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: The student is presented with a TV screen and a word with a letter underlined. There are several other single letters presented. If one of those letters selected by a student makes a new word, it appears on the TV screen. The stimulus remains until all correct choices are made, then goes on to the next word and letters. Student planning/record keeping is included. Teacher can also create their own lessons. POTENTIAL USES: This package is most appropriate for use with individuals or small groups. MAJOR  STRENGTHS: It is easy to operate once the student knows what to expect. The capability in this program for the teacher to author appropriate material for students is a real plus! By following directions in program and reading documentation carefully, the process is very easy. Record keeping for students is a strong point in that it tells not only how many were missed, but exactly what was missed. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: Uses the same visual display for all lessons and could be monotonous. Students would have to be told what clues to look for to know it is time to move on. For example, if they have not made all choices possible, the computer will wait--and wait. No directions are given to students on screen. The rewards are not particularly exciting, and would seem not to be a motivator in  themselves.

REQUIRED HARDWARE: 48K Apple II or Apple II+, single disk drive. REQUIRED SOFTWARE: Applesoft, DOS 3.2.1. Note: The packages have a &quot;double boot&quot; feature so that they can be used with DOS 3.3. The packages will be converted for 3.3 in the future. INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSE: Enrichment (for Secondary). INSTRUCTIONAL  TECHNIQUES: Computer modeling, Simulation. DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE: In the computer program: operating instructions and student instructions. In supplementary materials: instructional objectives, prerequisite skills or activities, sample program output, teacher's information, resource/reference information, and student instructions. A supplementary film is also available. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES (Stated): 1. To understand the production of adaptations by the action of selection on random variations. 2. To understand adaptation to specific environmental conditions in relation to survival value. 3. To gain experience in manipulating models of selection acting on populations. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: 1. An elementary knowledge of genetics and, in particular, the meaning of: alleles,  dominance and recessiveness, homozygotes and heterozygotes and gamete formation and fertilization. 2. An elementary knowledge of ecology. 3. An ability to calculate percentages and plot graphs. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: &quot;Evolut&quot; is one of a series of units in biology being produced by Conduit. The package includes a diskette, student notes and a teacher's guide. The program produces charts and tables which display results of the mechanism of natural selection operating on various populations. Supplementary material introduces Darwin's Theory of Evolution, natural selection and variation with directions for student activities. The computer program extends student activities, providing a quick means of observing results over multiple generations and results when parameters of the selection  mechanism are changed. Charts of populations and genetic frequencies may be obtained for as many generations as desired. ESTIMATED STUDENT TIME REQUIRED: Five hours. POTENTIAL USES: Evaluators indicated that this package would be appropriate for use in high school or college biology or genetics classes for generating results of pea breeding with two gamete types. MAJOR STRENGTHS: The computer shows results of pairings in genetics much more quickly than could be done by hand; textual material is very well coordinated with the computer program. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: Certain textual material is unclear (e.g., instructions for &quot;power of selection,&quot; p.11); in the program, certain instructions are ambiguous, and the user must refer to textual material for choices of parameters for subsequent  run-throughs; there is too heavy a reliance on numbers and charts, with no use of graphics (evaluators warn this will lose high school students); students require extensive preparation before being able to use the program productively; and while the materials are well coordinated, it would be too time consuming to use all of them. EVALUATION SUMMARY: Evaluators indicate they would not use or recommend use of this package. (Note Major Weaknesses for high school audiences.) (Author)",

In supplementary materials: instructional objectives, sample program output, program operation instructions, pretest, posttest, teacher's information, resource/reference information, student's instructions, student worksheets, follow-up activities, glossary of terms. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES: The program teaches volcanic terminology, the types of volcanoes, methods and results of remote sensing surveys, interpretation of bar graphs, keeping careful records and interpretation of scientific observations. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: Knowledge of the terms included in the documentation; knowledge of the various methods of surveying a volcanic region. This information is included in the documentation. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: Package consists of two diskettes, two Blue Books (user reference  manuals), two sets of reproducible maps and one teacher's manual. Two to three players are assigned areas on a map by the computer. Each player is assigned a research fund and skill level. Players must conduct simulated scientific surveys, such as infrared scans, of their areas and predict volcanic eruptions. Players keep records, dispense a research budget, plan research strategies and evaluate research results. ESTIMATED STUDENT TIME REQUIRED: Two to four hours. POTENTIAL USES: Volcanoes could be used to supplement a high school geology or earth science class which covers volcanism. The package could also be used with advanced upper elementary and junior high school students. The teacher would need to provide students with adequate background information and time in order to  successfully complete the simulation game. MAJOR STRENGTHS: The background information and instructor's manual are very well written. A pretest, posttest and helpful bibliography are included. Volcanoes allows the student to simulate the role of a volcanologist and provides insight into the role of a research scientist and the science of volcanology. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: Students had some difficulty learning what to do to successfully predict an eruption. It would be helpful to have the computer print a list of current conditions, i.e., gases, recent seismic activity, location of hot spots, etc. This would give student more of an opportunity to get a &quot;feel&quot; for expected eruptions.

Extending students' knowledge of projectile motion from the simplest case (a 'flat Earth' and constant gravitational force), to the more general (round Earth, force varying with distance); 2. An appreciation of how the application of Newton's Second Law, and his Law of Gravitation leads to prediction of satellite orbits; 3. Knowledge of the possible shapes of orbits, 4. Some idea of the periodic time of orbits, and of the effect on the orbit of varying  launch velocity; 5. The application of a familiar idea (conservation of energy) in a new situation. INSTRUCTIONAL PREREQUISITES: Prerequisites are stated as basic familiarity with Newton's laws of motion and gravitation. CONTENT AND STRUCTURE: &quot;Newton&quot; is one of a series of units in physics developed by Conduit. The package is a simulation illustrating Newton's laws of motion, and it is designed to be integrated into existing courses. The package consists of a diskette, student materials and a teacher's guide. Student materials lead students to an approximation of the horizontal velocity needed to keep a body in orbit. The computer program challenges the student to determine the initial velocity required to keep an object in orbit. The program displays the projectile in orbit around Earth  and a table of accompanying data. Teacher's materials provide ideas and references for extending and modifying the program. ESTIMATED STUDENT TIME REQUIRED: Two to three fifty-minute periods. POTENTIAL USES: Evaluators indicate that this package is appropriate for use in a high school or college physics class to demonstrate (simulate) the trajectory required to put an object into orbit. MAJOR STRENGTHS: Numeric description accompanies graphic representation of the height and shape of each orbit; and student materials contain illustrations and questioning strategies which are involving and lead the student into the use of the computer program. MAJOR WEAKNESSES: The plotting of the trajectory is extremely slow. The program could be improved by allowing it to run longer. It was felt that the  program stops too frequently. EVALUATION SUMMARY: Evaluators indicate they would use or recommend use of this package with little or no change. (Author)",

        "description":"In order to provide a base for national information planning and the restructuring of existing training institutions, a detailed study was conducted of manpower needs--at professional, paraprofessional, and technician levels--for information systems and services in the Caribbean region. A paper setting out the basic principles underlying manpower forecasting formed the basis for a forecasting model. In 1981 surveys of local contacts in Caribbean countries and regional training institutions were conducted to collect basic information about each country, the existing stock of individuals and jobs, the flows which might increase or decrease these, and the national or regional training institutions. There was a relatively poor response rate to the surveys. When the data collected  were applied to the forecasting model, results showed that the Caribbean region faces a major problem in the supply of trained information services manpower. However, the forecasting model and data collection system were found to work well. The report begins with a brief summary of the work carried out, the conclusions reached, and the recommendations made. This is followed by sections giving fuller details on the manpower forecasting model, the data collection system, and the results and recommendations of the study. Sample survey instruments are provided. (ESR)",

        "description":"In July 1982, 10 member libraries of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) were surveyed to obtain information on their existing budget practices. Libraries participating in the study were the University of California, Santa Barbara; University of Chicago; University of Colorado; University of Florida; Iowa State University; Notre Dame University; Oklahoma State University; Stanford University; University of Wisconsin; and York University. This report examines how library budget allocations are determined at the 10 institutions, particularly in the areas of personnel, acquisitions and binding, and operations expenditures. The budget process for base budgets as well as annual increases is described, and details of budget administration and flexibility are reported. In a  review of issues underlying the budget practices in use, a compromise between the development of absolute standards and the present system of adherence to historical allocation levels is suggested. It is proposed that ratios of library support related to library use be utilized to calculate an index of relative library support. Report appendices comprise: (1) a sample survey form; (2) a list of 11 suggested readings and resources; and (3) a copy of the March 1975 Report of (the) ARL-ACRL (Association of College and Research Libraries) Joint Committee on University Library Standards (Revised), which provides additional perspectives on budget allocation systems.

        "description":"A study was conducted in order to examine the current state of the art in library network delivery of consumer information services and to develop an assessment model for the effectiveness of network delivery of citizens' information. Based on a comprehensive survey of 620 library networks, typologies for both library and non-library networks providing consumer information services were formulated. With the assistance of an advisory group consisting of experts in both library and non-library network activities, a conceptual model was developed for evaluating the effectiveness of information networks in providing consumer information. The model consisted of research questions organized into 13 areas of consideration, and an interview guide was developed for testing and refining  the model. Five library and four non-library networks providing consumer information services were selected for in-depth case analyses. These analyses, which were derived from the interview guide, reflected the history and present status of the networks, as well as the short-term and long-term concerns of network staff on the provision of consumer information services. Major similarities and dissimilarities among the networks were evident; the findings of the case analyses were used to modify the original assessment model. The methodology and results of the study are briefly presented in this summary final report. (Author/ESR)",

The videotape illustrates a sample search strategy and then highlights the use of four basic information sources: (1) the card catalog for book information; (2) &quot;Social Sciences Index&quot; for periodical information; (3) &quot;CIS Index&quot; for government documents; and (4) the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) computerized file for technical papers. Development of the library instruction unit began with the drafting of a preliminary set of objectives which were then discussed with members of the political science department. The  instructional package was completed in summer 1981, previewed by faculty members, and used by 24 class sections during the 1981-82 academic year. A brief questionnaire was also developed and distributed to a random selection of classes that had used the instructional package during the fall semester to stimulate feedback and evaluation. This report discusses the design of the instructional package, its use, and its evaluation. A concluding section discusses possible future programs and developments. Appendices provide a list of the preliminary objectives; copies of three research guides, including one listing specific sources of information relating to the Soviet Union; and a sample questionnaire.

        "description":"Intended to contribute to a better understanding of research library development in the United States, this report describes the history of the development of the library of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin from 1904 to 1918. It is based on records of the relationships between three principals--John R. Commons and Richard T. Ely (members of the University of Wisconsin faculty) and Reuben Gold Thwaites (superintendent of the Society)--and their associates and subordinates at the two institutions. From a rich mixture of personal ambitions, institutional and personal interactions, variant perceptions of the functions of libraries, and other factors, the library of the Society was developed during the period 1904 to 1913 into--among other things--a major center for the study  of the trade union movement in the United States. The development of the library resulted from the working of a complex collecting effort by an agency--the American Bureau of Industrial Research--connected administratively to neither the Society nor the University. Afterward, the Society continued the collecting program begun by the Bureau, but in a substantial degree of dissociation from the conditions that led to the library's earlier development. The author's vita and numerous references are included in this report. (Author/ESR)",

It has been agreed that computer literacy should be available to all students, with the elementary and secondary schools bearing the largest responsibility for instruction. Some of the issues involved in planning for a computer literate society include: the question of whether computer-related skills are needed by everyone;  provision for inservice and preservice teacher training; the political, social, and economic implications of computer technology; isolation and separatism among students using computers; and health and safety aspects. Course topics could include history of computers, programming, computer systems, and the social effects of computers.

Section 1 discusses the qualities of a competent professional. Key issues are the lack of universal agreement among professional members and differences in philosophies as to whether a service professional's job is an art, a science, or a craft. Section 2 addresses the objections of critics to competency-based education, who argue that the essence of a service professional's job requires intuition and judgment which cannot be specified behaviorally. Section 3 considers the position of advocates, who  undermine undefinable and unobservable mental ideas and feelings in their push for setting and maintaining standards of performance. Section 4 presents the controversial nature of competency-based education and the need for continuing debate in search of a resolution. Section 5 addresses the current status of competency-based requirements for school media professional certification.

First, a rationale for the course and its basic premises are highlighted (e.g., writing is learned by writing, writing problems are often thinking problems, and writing is a process involving particular stages). Next, course procedures are specified, including attendance requirements, writing tasks, solution plan for writing problems, the role of student assistants, grading, class session requirements,  and maintenance of a record of progress. Then, stages in the composing process are outlined, including listing details and finding a focus, writing a thesis statement and outline, preparing first and subsequent drafts, revising until the composition meets specified criteria, and preparing the final draft after the instructor's approval to proceed is obtained. Instructions for completing eight composition assignments are then provided, which specify the task, indicate the audience and length of the composition, and discuss important concepts and ways to proceed.

        "description":"In fall 1981, entering freshmen at Bronx Community College (BCC) were encouraged to attend a 10-week non-credit orientation course (SPD-99), in which counselors used a variety of materials and instructional procedures to assist students with their educational, career, and personal development and to introduce students to various campus resources and services. In fall 1982, entering freshmen were required to attend a one-credit, 15-week orientation course (OCD-01), which had a similar focus, but a standardized outline. A study was conducted to determine and compare the effects of the two courses on students' mean cumulative grade point average (GPA) and retention rate. The study compared the performance of 195 students who attended SPD-99 five or more times, 1,082 students who did  not attend SPD-99 at all, 732 students who attended OCD-01 more than seven times, and 678 students who did not attend OCD-01 at all. Study findings, based on a random sample of every third student in each group, included the following: (1) the mean GPA and re-enrollment rate of students who attended SPD-99 five or more times were significantly higher than those of students who did not attend the class at all; (2) attendance of OCD-01 had a similarly positive effect on students' GPA and retention rates; and (3) the mean GPA and re-enrollment rates of students who attended SPD-99 were significantly higher than those of students who attended OCD-01.

The instruments were designed to measure program effects on several dimensions of the cognitive, social-emotional, and applied strategies domains. Specific competencies measured are presumed to define in operational terms Head Start's overall goal of developing participating children's social competence. Each of the instruments is theoretically grounded, reflecting explicit conceptualizations of the domain and dimensions of behavior measured. All reflect hypotheses concerning sequential or hierarchical processes of development. Further, the measures are designed to accommodate the cultural diversity of Head Start and similar populations,  and to identify the different but equally valid paths along which individuals, racial/ethnic groups, and sex groups of children progress toward common goals. With reference to the test battery, this report describes the areas of child development measured, and lists principles and procedures used in developing the instruments. The largest portion of the report presents rationales for and characteristics of the measures. The concluding section describes pre- and post-field testing, preliminary analyses of the data, and revisions of the instruments.

In contrast to primary preventive efforts that focus on a central concern, secondary prevention attends to potentially serious concomitant issues. In this study the central concern was the signs of social or behavioral difficulties some of the children exhibited. The secondary concern was the possibility that individuals selected for treatment might be negatively labelled or stigmatized if singled out. Therefore, entire classes were involved in the program and no child was publicly identified as a target of intervention. Teachers designated 18 children with nascent social or behavioral problems, and  a comparison group of 18 non-target children was formed. Delivered to small groups consisting of target and non-target children, the intervention program provided reinforcement of appropriate social behaviors, modelling of prosocial behaviors, use of peer models, and behavioral rehearsal. At the beginning and end of the 8-month intervention, both target and non-target groups were observed 10 times. Results indicated that target children showed significant increases in interacting with other children and significant decreases in playing alone. Decreases were found in agressive behavior. Results were viewed with caution due to the study's lack of a control group. (RH)",

One of many projects initiated in recent years by the DePaul Mental Health Clinic, this project aims to create an ongoing, self-sustaining cmputer-assisted tutoring program at St. Mary of the Lake, a school located in Chicago's economically disadvantaged Uptown district. In the Comp-Tutor project, 6th- through 8th-grade students learn computer programming and tutoring skills and tutor 1st- through 4th-grade students. Most participants in the program had experienced academic or behavioral difficulties in school, and many of the tutors were reputed to be slow learners and disruptive students. However, program supervisors have enocuntered none of the rebellion or reluctance to learn that teachers  often receive from troubled students. Most participants consistently exhibit cooperation and enthusiasm. During sessions, tutors spend 20 minutes working on their own programs and then spend the next 20 minutes helping younger students. Educational software used in the tutoring sessions is carefully selected, and teachers insure that the material is consistent with each child's educational needs. It appears that experience in the use of programming materials facilitates students' cognitive development and the tutoring experience enhances feelings of self-worth. Outcomes of the intervention suggest that projects such as this should be considered by mental health workers interested in making preventive, early interventions. (RH)",

        "description":"The comparative effectiveness of two student monitoring and reinforcement strategies was assessed among primary school students. The 50 participating students met in a multi-purpose instructional center during one of two sessions for academic periods of 30 minutes, three times a week. Students were assigned to one of six study groups in the center, one group for each multi-media learning station. Three target behaviors were identified and measured utilizing a variety of data collection procedures; the behaviors investigated were start up time, appropriate utilization of instructional hardware, and group decorum. Data were first collected during a teacher-monitored baseline condition. Subsequent interventions consisted of student-leader monitoring and student self-monitoring  procedures. Across both interventions a token economy was introduced that allowed students to choose free time in the center as reinforcement. Results indicated that, in comparison with teacher-monitored baseline performance, both student monitoring strategies improved student behavior. Student-leader monitoring was more effective than student self-monitoring in managing the three targeted study behaviors. It is suggested that primary grade teachers might delegate to trained, student-leader monitors many managerial responsibilities that are related to study behaviors. (RH)",

        "description":"The present study examined the role of similarity of experience in young children's affective reactions to others. Some preschoolers played one of two games (Puzzle Board or Buckets) and were informed that they had either failed or succeeded; others merely observed the games being played and were given no evaluative feedback. Subsequently, each child was shown a videotape of another child failing on the Buckets game. Thus, each child observed the confederate as having a similar or dissimilar experience on a familiar or unfamiliar game. The observing child's facial reaction to the saddened confederate was unobtrusively videotaped while he/she watched the videotape presentation. Immediately following the presentation, each child was asked to indicate how he or she felt on a 7-point&quot;smiley face&quot; rating scale. Results were generally consistent with the notion that a young child's empathy with an unhappy agemate will be enhanced when the observing child has had a similar unpleasant experience. Implications of the present findings for prosocial behavior in children are discussed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"A total of 24 children, meeting several criteria for being diagnosed as having an attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, were selected for study. Children were assigned to one of three conditions: a meditation-training group, a progressive-muscle-relaxation group, or a waiting-list control group. Subjects in the training groups were seen on an individual basis for 20 minutes twice weekly for a period of 4 weeks. Meditating subjects sat with eyes closed, breathed slowly and deeply, and repeated the Sanskrit word \"ahnam\" (\"nameless\") first out loud and then silently for periods gradually increasing in duration from 2 to 8 minutes. Relaxing subjects tensed and relaxed hands, forearms, biceps, triceps, shoulders, stomach, thighs, and calves in periods increasing from 2 to 8  minutes. Results indicated that both the meditation-training and relaxation-training groups showed significant decreases in levels of impulsivity. No change in impulsivity was found in the control group. In the measures of selective deployment of attention and freedom from distractibility, only meditation training resulted in significant improvement. Parent rating scales reflected a significant improvement in the behavior of children in both the meditation-training and relaxation-training groups. The Locus of Control Scale failed to show significant changes over the course of the study for any of the groups. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"One distal, cognitive component of parenting is knowledge of infant development. This multifaceted construct includes knowledge of developmental norms, parental skills, and abstract principles of development. Generally, it has been assumed that knowledge of development affects childrearing practices; this assumption is documented in various bodies of literature and is evident in parent-education programs. Acquisition of parental knowledge may occur through exposure to sociocultural sources of information (such as the advice of experts, family, and friends) or through direct observation of infants and children. Research conducted with 256 mothers of 6-month-old infants indicates that books, the family doctor, and the parents' social network are the most important sources of  information. Furthermore, such sociocultural influences appear to shape knowledge more powerfully than do direct, observational experiences with children. Research also suggests that more knowledgeable mothers rate their infants as having easier temperaments and that knowledge of development influences the way parents structure interactions between children and the social and physical environment. Presently, little is known about parents' experiences, knowledge, beliefs, and perceptions. Future studies of parental knowledge should develop better measurement techniques; seek a more complete description of origins and variations in knowledge, beliefs, and perceptions; and work toward a coherent typology of cognitive influences on parental behavior.

The sample included 44 children, ranging in age from approximately 9 to 11 years, who were identified by their teachers as being low in ability to solve division problems. After measures were taken of children's perceptions of self-efficacy for correctly solving division problems and following the administration of a division-skill pretest, children were assigned to one of four treatment groups: rewards only, goals only, rewards plus goals, and training control. Children received two 45-minute training sessions over consecutive school  days; during sessions, an adult proctor gave treatment instructions appropriate to the children's experimental condition, and children solved problems alone. It was predicted that children in the condition involving rewards plus goals would demonstrate the highest levels of self-efficacy and skillful performance. Results indicated that offering children performance-contingent rewards or suggesting proximal goals exerted motivational effects on problem solving and that combining performance-contingent rewards with proximal goals led to superior levels of self-efficacy and skillful performance. Results thus supported the idea that self-efficacy bears an important relationship to subsequent achievement. (RH)",

The sample was a relatively heterogeneous group, representing a broad cross section with respect to socioeconomic characteristics (housewives, students, and retired persons accounted for a relatively large proportion of household members). Although low household incomes were reported fairly frequently, intermediate income levels were more typical, and a substantial number were relatively high. Educational levels among adults varied considerably.  Income, education, and household composition were important socioeconomic factors that were related to other characteristics or attitudes of the persons interviewed. Several characteristics tended to vary with location (communities, residences, and individuals); however, a central coal mining county was similar to the southern coal mining counties. The majority of in-migration seemed to be from out-of-state and has become more common during the last 10 years, with more during the last 5 years. (AH)",

Personal interviews with nearly 100 organization, government, and agency leaders revealed many similarities between the two countries. In both countries, formal women's organizations such as the Young Women's Christian Association arose from traditional sociocultural orgins and are led by upper middle class urban volunteers. Often united under umbrella institutions, the organizations offer programs to the rural, and sometimes to the urban poor in sewing, health, child care, and handicrafts. Informal organizations such as the Sarvodaya Mother's Clubs and the Good Sheperd Farm  Center are usually rural, operating under government auspices, and are often highly successful in family life and agricultural education. Thai organizations are closely tied to the sociopolitical structure, and some, like the Girl Guides, enjoy great success. Their leaders are often good fundraisers and internationally active. On the other hand, Sri Lankan organizations are usually older and poorer. Their leaders generally operate within the country. Leaders in both countries need outside aid to develop training and management resources and to develop projects focusing on agricultural and industrial skills. (SB)",

        "description":"Women's vulnerability to increased landlessness and other economic factors has created a need in most developing nations for year-round, rural, non-agricultural employment opportunities for women. Census data from 56 Third World countries reveal that women are generally underrepresented in the paid labor force and overrepresented in the &quot;unpaid family worker&quot; labor force. Consequently, agrarian reform and rural development policies, in combination with favorable national economic policies, must work to raise the productivity of the labor in which women currently engage, transform subsistence activities into income-generating activities, and create new employment opportunities for women in areas such as non-agricultural production, sales, services, administration, and the  professions. A 6-step strategy for mobilizing rural women for employment involves: (1) identifying the groups of women who most need income-generating employment; (2) defining the range of economic activities in which they are engaged; (3) locating and mobilizing indigenous social networks of women; (4) establishing sources of credit, technical assistance, and training for group enterprises; (5) determining needs for technology to reduce domestic burdens; and (6) identifying and overcoming other cultural or structural obstacles that deny women control over the products of their labor.

        "description":"A study of women in migration in Third World countries since 1960 reveals that, contrary to assumptions, more women are migrating autonomously from rural to urban areas in an often unsuccessful effort to improve their economic status. The results of the study of migration patterns in Africa, Asia, Central America, South America, and the Middle East show that males generally dominate the migrant population under age 50, while females dominate the population over age 50. Central and South America are exceptions. Women migrate to join their spouse or family; find a spouse; improve their economic situation; or take advantage of better schools, housing, and medical facilities in urban areas. Most women migrants are either under 25 or over 50 years old. The younger women tend to be  single; the older women are separated, divorced, or widowed. Women migrants, who have the lowest educational level among migrants, tend to migrate from rural areas to large urban centers where they accept the lowest paying, lowest status jobs. Migration apparently causes greater instability and divorce but improves women's status within the family. Policymakers must restructure social services and urban and rural development policies to respond to the needs of the autonomous female migrant. (SB)",

Because data from publications, national censuses, and studies frequently did not focus on autonomous female migrants, researchers constructed a sex differential migration index. While many regional differences existed in the areas studied (Africa, Asia, Central America, the Middle East, South America), female outmigration generally dominated only among migrants over age 50. Most female migrants were adolescent, in  their early twenties, or over 50. Most were single and had less education than male migrants. A growing percentage migrated, often in step-wise fashion, for economic reasons. Having migrated to urban areas, many female migrants found themselves in low-paying, low status jobs. Researchers noted increased family responsibilities for female migrants and for rural wives of male migrants, and the weakening effect of serious economic dimensions of women's migration and on autonomous female migration.

Researchers applied a modified inductive approach to data from questionnaire surveys of 107 academic programs, 119 Indian communities, and 30 senior Indian students. Results indicated that American Indian programs in two- and four-year schools were more concerned than universities with recruitment and services but had similar difficulties acquiring appropriate faculty. Institutions and Indian communities agreed that a major  cause of Indian student dropout was lack of previous educational skills. Communities also noted that lack of role models was a factor; institutions noted financial problems; and students cited cultural pressures which were greatest at Ph.D.-granting universities. A wide variety existed in program structure and offerings. Over 17% prepared students for elementary or preschool education; 11.2%, for art; 10.3%, for history; and 9.3%, for counseling. However, communities wanted trained professionals in business, counseling, medicine, and law. Training programs did not reflect the realities of Indian survival in the 1980s. (SB)",

Three hundred four teachers (96% of those surveyed) responded by mail to questions about the use and effectiveness of teaching practices recommended nationally and for American Indian children, their preferred instructional methods, and their personal job satisfaction. In general, rural Alaskan teachers did not report frequent use of nationally recommended practices; rather, they used practices advocated in American Indian research literature  such as hands-on and self-paced instruction. Only about half the teachers regularly assigned homework. Most expected their students to complete high school, but not to attend or complete college. Only about 40% felt their students' academic ability met or could be expected to meet national averages. For many teachers, academic progress represented a problem. Though satisfied with many aspects of their jobs, rural teachers reported frustrating relationships with district centers and little opportunity for professional growth. These findings have significant implications for the Rural Effective Schools Project. (SB)",

Socioeconomic status was the most consistent variable, showing a strong relation to academic achievement in all test areas for all grades except 12. Attendance had a significant effect on language and reading scores of students in grades 6, 8, and 12. Attendance was also a significant variable for students of low  socioeconomic status, as was stability of enrollment. In general, students with stable enrollment in grades 6, 8, and 12 outperformed transient students in language areas. Overall, students with the best scores were those with the best attendance records who had been enrolled consistently in the district. Evaluators felt that these results proved the quality of the district's program. Variables such as one-parent homes, negative parental attitudes, and school expectations can also affect attendance and performance, and should be investigated. (SB)",

Twenty-three students were matched and randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. Students in the experimental group camped out and partially constructed a wooden structure on three successive winter weekends. Students in the control group had no significant group or challenge experience. The students were pre- and post-tested with the Tennessee Self Concept Scale (TSCS) and the Rotter Internal External Locus of Control Scale. Their academic achievement was measured by their academic grade means. As expected, results of the  tests, compared between and within groups, indicated that the generative and challenging experience had no effect on academic achievement or locus of control, and no effect on 11 of 12 self-concept scales on the TSCS. A longer project might have provided subjects with a better chance to change their self-concept.

All six groups served as channels to the adult world by increasing members' contact with responsible, civic-minded, generous, and concerned adults. Four-H provided the most extensive youth-adult network. The groups' main activity was the successful teaching of practical skills not taught anywhere else. Each  group's history and leadership affected which skills they emphasized. While all groups taught members some leadership skills, the Boy Scouts provided an especially structured program of leadership and responsibility development to prepare boys for business and community leadership roles. The groups also socialized the members for adult service organizations and stressed voluntary community responsibility. Parents and children generally agreed on the groups' major goals and benefits.

Using observation and interviews, researchers studied all aspects of the troops over 7 months. One troop, whose scoutmaster was benevolent and easy-going, perceived scouting as fun. Meetings were loose, raucus, and often unorganized. Formal meeting activities such as planning and learning groups quickly disintegrated into joking and play. Troop leadership and responsibility were centralized in the hands of a few senior boys who were frequently unprepared. Parents rarely participated in troop activities, preferring to donate money instead. The boys learned to function in a peer culture.  The other troop, whose scoutmaster was a no-nonsense man with a strong work ethic, held elaborate, formal, organized, and quiet meetings. Meeting activities were serious business. Leadership and responsibility were spread among all the members, supported by a stable system of informal adult roles. Parents frequently participated in troop activities, especially fund-raisers. Keen observers of the adults, the boys learned responsibility and leadership. The comparison showed how organizations create an informal culture that can support or undercut official educational goals. (SB)",

Areas where Confluent Education could enhance Outward Bound were elucidated: wilderness as therapy; occasions for meanings;  educating the whole person; self-knowledge/personal relevancy; and experimentation. The demonstration project included six paired courses, three with Confluent/experimental groups and three concurrent courses with control groups. Of 72 students, aged 14 to 20, who started, 31 (25 male, 6 female) finished Confluent courses and 30 (23 male, 7 female) finished control group courses. All participants were given pre- and post-evaluations derived from Outward Bound and Confluent Education literature. Findings indicated that an Outward Bound experience was more meaningful and personally relevant for groups which utilized Confluent Education Curriculum than for groups which did not. (MH)",

        "description":"The first in a series of planned secondary curriculum materials about the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, the book traces Choctaw tribal government from before seventeenth century contact with the French to the present day. Chapter I treats tribal government in the period before contact with the French, when Choctaw family structure and relationships were well defined. Chapter II discusses the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth century French alliance with the tribe. Chapter III details a series of United States-Choctaw treaties dating from 1786 and including the 1830 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek which resulted in the removal of many of the Choctaw to Oklahoma. Chapter IV described the tribe's &quot;dark ages&quot; between 1830 and the 1921 colonization operation of the  Choctaw Agency. The chapter also describes the 1944 declaration of the Choctaw Reservation, the re-emergence of tribal government and its 1975 reorganization, and the new spirit of self-determination and economic development that exists today. The chapter contains biographies of five tribal leaders. Appendices contain the text of nine treaties and the revised tribal by-laws and constitution. The book, written by tribal members and scholars, is illustrated with black-and-white photographs and maps. (SB)",

The currently reported &quot;crisis&quot; in science education is not a new phenomenon nor a surprise to educators in the field, as it was predicted as early as 1976 by researchers noting a decline in newly certified mathematics and science teachers and an enrollment drop in teaching programs. Generalizations have been made from research results implying a high percentage of surplus teachers, yet when broken down by geographic and/or subject area, a critical shortage of math and science teachers is evident. Supply and demand is affected by such factors as geographic area, birth rate, economy, military requirements, changes in social  conditions and use of new technologies in school curriculums. Existing positions are held, in many cases, by older teachers with continuing contracts and outdated science content backgrounds, with new position openings occurring only through attrition.

The &quot;intrinsic models&quot; approach uses motivating activities which are direct expressions of the underlying mathematics. The area of graphing was chosen because it is basic to scientific applications as well as to further work in pure mathematics. In addition, it is an area where tests indicate poor performance on the part of large numbers of students. The materials produced by this project deal with qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of graphs. Materials were developed in conjunction with student use in local public schools. Evaluation was largely formative, revolving around  on-site observation of students, student interviews, and teacher interviews. Criterion-referenced test results from an informal (and incomplete) trial with the finished materials indicated that students learned well the concepts they had an opportunity to study. Descriptions of materials as presented in the instructor's manuals published with the programs are also provided. The first set of programs deals with graphing equations. The second set, recommended for high school mathematics/science or college science courses, helps students make meaningful interpretations of graphs of physical phenomena. (Author/JN)",

Included are discussions of project goals, course modifications, and evaluation of results and impacts. Course modifications are  discussed under the following heading: focus on professional practices; study guides and assessment manuals; students working as teams; presentations by students to students; videotaping; variety of assignments and use of simulated real-life situations; and assignment periods. Among the evaluation results/impacts reported are those indicating that: (1) the communication competency was the most successful of the three competencies introduced, (2) the teaching of competence did not decrease subject matter emphasis in course work, and (3) the modification of only a small portion of courses can have a major impact on student competence development.

        "description":"The Team-Assisted Individualization (TAI) mathematics program has been developed in an attempt to make individualized instruction workable in the classroom by adding components of cooperative learning. This paper presents the rationale for the development of TAI and describes results of three field experiments conducted to assess the effect of TAI on student achievement, attitudes, and behavior. The experiments, which involved a total of 1,997 students in grades 3 through 6 (including mainstreamed students), demonstrated basic achievement effects of the program and a number of positive social and attitudinal effects. Results clearly indicated that TAI increases students' mathematics achievement more than traditional instructional methods and that TAI students gained more than  their control counterparts on every achievement measure in every study, although the differences were not statistically significant on some subscales at some grade levels in the third experiment. In addition, the third experiment demonstrated that TAI could be used over an extended time period (most of a school year) as the primary means of mathematics instruction. Among the other results reported are those indicating that TAI can have a strong positive effect on the social acceptance and behavior of academically handicapped students. (JN)",

        "description":"Reported are two separate but related longitudinal studies of two variables strongly associated with sex-related differences in mathematics achievement and enrollment, namely spatial visualization and confidence in learning mathematics. First, boys (N=33) and girls (N=36) in grades 6-8 who were discrepant in their spatial and verbal skills were interviewed to determine how they used spatial visualization in solving word and symbolic mathematical problems. Each subject was asked to read a problem, draw a picture to help solve the problem, and explain how the picture was used in the problem situation. In the second study, boys (N=31) and girls (N=32) in grades 6-8 who were above the mean in mathematics achievement and in lower or upper quartile in confidence in learning mathematics  were interviewed about two question types (expectations and feelings), different perceived respondents (individual, peers, or teachers), and four mathematical situations (general, spatial, low, or high cognitive level). Among the results and implications reported are: (1) students with high spatial visualization skills tend to use them more than those with lower skills; (2) some differences were found in the ways boys and girls use their spatial skills, with girls who are low in such skills using them less than any other group; and (3) expectation of success in mathematics diminishes for girls from grade 6 to grade 8, while increasing for boys. In addition, technical information and instrumentation (including sample transcripts) are provided as separate reports in two detailed appendices.  (JN)",

These areas will be investigated by means of a computer program which can solve physics problems stated in English. The program's problem-solving techniques will then be compared with techniques inferred from protocols taken from expert/novice humans solving the same problems. Using a computer program which can solve physics problems has several advantages. First, requiring that the program be able to solve complete physics problems helps to insure that no essential component skills have been left out or assumed to be trivial when they are  not. A second benefit is that the program can provide a testbed for different problem-solving strategies. A third benefit is that such a program could form the basis of an intelligent computer-assisted-instruction program which understands all the component skills required to solve problems. Several hypotheses about the nature of problem-solving in physics are discussed and related to the computer program to be developed and to difficulties of humans in learning to solve physics problems.

        "description":"The primary task in solving a physics problem is to select ways of viewing the problem in terms of physical systems whose behavior is described by physical laws. The physical systems are, in general, only approximate models of the real-world systems. As models of real-world systems are made more accurate, the equations involved quickly become unmanageable; furthermore, certain special cases of physics problems which frequently occur can be solved using greatly simplified equations. Success in solving physics problems therefore depends crucially on selection of physical systems which satisfactorily model the real-world systems and which possess tractable mathematical models. Selection of the physical systems used as models is generally based on qualitative features (including  ranges of numerical magnitudes) of the real-world systems. Many problems are best solved by considering the same real-world system from multiple viewpoints and relating the viewpoints to each other, often by identification of their components. (Author)",

The functions performed by such a model, the information which needs to be represented, and the knowledge used in selecting and instantiating an appropriate model are discussed. An example of a model for a mechanics problem is presented. A set of problem-analysis rules has been written which can construct physical representations for such problems. The rules are written in MRS, a representation and inference language which provides the features of first-order logic while allowing specification of Lisp implementations for data storage and inference methods, as well as allowing meta-level reasoning about the problem-solving process itself. The rules infer  important features of the problem in small steps, which in turn trigger other inferences, in a fashion similar to the progression of inferences presented in the example problem. In this way, a finite set of rules serves to analyze a large set of possible problems. The physical model generated by the rules not only can drive generation of equations to solve the problem, but also can be used to generate meaningful diagrams and explanations of the problem-solving process.

The GLISP language is implemented by means of a compiler which accepts GLISP as input and produces ordinary LISP as output. This output can be further compiled to machine code by the LISP compiler. GLISP is available for several LISP dialects, including Interlisp, Maclisp, UCI Lisp, ELISP, Franz Lisp, and Portable Standard Lisp. The goal of GLISP is to allow structured objects to be referenced in a convenient, succinct language and to allow the structures of objects to be changed without changing the code which references the objects. GLISP provides both PASCAL-like and English-like syntaxes; much of the power and brevity of GLISP derive from the compiler features necessary to  support the relatively informal, English-like language constructs. Provided in this manual is the documentation necessary for using GLISP. The documentation is presented in the following sections: introduction; object descriptions; reference to objects; GLISP program syntax; messages; context rules and reference; GLISP and knowledge representation languages; obtaining and using GLISP; GLISP hacks (some ways of doing things in GLISP which might not be entirely obvious at first glance); and examples of GLISP object declarations and programs.

        "description":"This report describes a simulation of adults' retrieval of arithmetic facts from a network-based memory representation. The goals of the simulation project are to: demonstrate in specific form the nature of a spreading activation model of mental arithmetic; account for three important reaction time effects observed in laboratory investigations; and provide a basis from which developmental changes in performance can be meaningfully understood. The simulation, based on the process of spreading activation among related nodes, retrieves correct answers as the activation from a problem's addends/multipliers intersects in the network. Two decision processes are simulated. The first consists of an attempted matching of retrieved and stated answers, essentially a process of number  inequality judgments. The second decision mechanism involves competition among related nodes, based on levels of activation generated during the search phase for both retrieved and stated answers. Both decision mechanisms are necessary to predict the separate effects of split and confusions which have been observed in the laboratory. The conclusion of the paper discusses the relationship of the simulation to developmental processes in mental arithmetic performance, considering the interplay between declarative knowledge of the sort simulated and &quot;procedural&quot; knowledge of arithmetic algorithms and heuristics.

Topic areas include: achievement; algebra; arithmetic operations; attitudes/anxiety; calculators and computers; cognitive style; diagnosis and remediation; ethnic and social variables; geometry and measurement; learning; learning disabilities; mathematics materials; number and numeration; organizing for instruction; problem-solving; sequencing; sex differences; and test analysis. Accompanying the author's name in this index is a grade-level designation. In  addition, each annotation listed in the three major categories also includes a grade-level (or age-level) designation. Annotations generally indicate one principal finding of a study, although most have additional findings. Therefore, the original report should be checked for other results as well as for limitations affecting the validity of the findings. Several studies in which mathematics education was not the primary focus are also included. Such studies are usually not annotated. (JN)",

        "description":"This study ascertained the relative effectiveness of writing assignments in mathematics compared to traditional assignments on the performance of students (N=83) in an elementary, college algebra course. Students were placed into experimental and control groups based on the nature of assignments given. Control subjects were given 15 assignments covering mathematics problems while experimental subjects were given 15 assignments requiring written responses to conceptual questions. To control for teacher effects, assignments were marked by an independent grader, teachers were not informed as to which group individual students were assigned, and teachers were instructed not to answer questions regarding the writing portion of the assignments until after all reword assignments were  returned. Of the students completing a pre-established proportion of assignments, no significant differences were found between groups on either pre- or post-performance measures. Significant moderate correlations between the number of assignments completed and performance were found for both groups. It was concluded that writing assignments employed without teacher engagement were not more effective than traditional mathematics assignments. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"Suggesting that the concept of structure employed by political scientists in the analysis of belief systems is inadequate and misleading, the paper discusses Jean Piaget's concept of egocentrism as a theoretical alternative to belief systems analysis. The purpose of the paper is to provide political scientists with a short but comprehensive summary and introduction to Piaget's theory of cognitive development. The first part argues that current measures which, for example, analyze the degree to which respondents' beliefs conform to traditional ideologies (such as liberalism or conservatism) are measures of belief content rather than belief structure. This section demonstrates the weakness of constraint as a measure of structure. The second section, the major portion of the  document, presents Piaget's concept of egocentrism. The section's emphasis is that the individual's belief structure is provided by the cognitive system of the mind. Topics include Piaget's &quot;Genetic Epistemology&quot; as the key to the structure of belief systems and egocentrism as the mainspring of genetic epistemology. Specifically, the discussion involves infantile, pre-operatory, concrete operational, and formal operational stages and cooperation as opposed to egocentrism. The final section offers both long-term and short-term methods for incorporating Piaget's theories into political science research. (KC)",

        "description":"The linkage between policy research and policy formation can be strengthened through the use of qualitative methods. Currently, the linkage between policy research and policy decision making is tenuous; there are differences in philosophy, function, self-definition, and criteria by which success is measured. Although research cannot dictate the use of policy research findings, it can influence the reception and use of policy research, particularly at the stage when programs are initiated, target populations identified, and resources allocated. Utilization of research can be greatly enhanced when the researcher considers the appropriateness of the study design and of the execution of the study, the absence of major conceptual errors, relevance, timeliness, presentation, and  impact. These criteria for policy research can be more effectively met through qualitative research, e.g., ethnography, field studies, and case studies. Qualitative research can inform the decision-making process through its analysis of the complexity of the social system, its complement to statistical analysis, and its study of the unanticipated consequences of social change. By examining the social settings and organizations of our societies, qualitative research can inform of existing conditions and thus can enlighten policy formation. (KC)",

        "description":"The author argues that unless Kohlberg's theory of moral development can be demonstrated empirically, based on scientific evidence, his ensuing plan for a program of moral education amounts to no more than a systematic program of indoctrination. Kohlberg identifies the moral stage of a person by eliciting from a subject the reasons referred to in determining to act one way rather than another. While Kohlberg claims to study the structure of responses rather than their substance, it is questionable whether these are separable and whether relying on immediate utterances of responses is sufficient evidence for characterizing individuals into particular stages. Determining the scientific usefulness of a proposed theory depends upon the semantic clarity of the terms used in  constructing the theory, and Kohlberg's description of &quot;stages&quot; as &quot;organized systems of thought&quot; is one example of the semantic insufficiency and ambiguity characteristic of Kohlberg's paradigm. It is fundamentally important to a theory that is grounded upon the linguistic behavior of its subjects to develop clearly constructed procedures for associating observation expressions such as &quot;justice&quot; with terms of less ambiguous nature. In conclusion, by constructing a particular nomenclature, Kohlberg has made his ideas appear to be actual, and appear, therefore, to be a legitimate object of scientific study. (LH)",

Contributions of teachers, scholars, and curriculum specialists were many and included providing lesson ideas, checking accuracy of material, and  contributing knowledge about course organization. The scholars were also involved as critical reviewers of the lessons. Examples of their generally positive reviews are provided. The main achievement of the project was the book of 62 lessons entitled &quot;Lessons on the Constitution: Supplements to High School Courses in American Government and History.&quot; Evidence gathered from field test teachers indicates that the lessons are practical and do work.

Teachers assume that their access to educational theories depends on a group external to themselves and that theory has little practical value in the classroom. In the second part of the paper, the author discusses four existing research paradigms currently employed in the study of the process of schooling in society--functionalist, phenomenological, action-research, and social reproductionist. The functionalist model of systems analysis is attractive to many because it views social processes as self-regulating systems and appears to provide the foundation for a truly empirical-analytic science of  society, free of value bias. In Alfred Schutz's phenomenological analysis model, social processes are viewed as the constructions of autonomous individuals. Habermas' educational action-research model is based on the assumption that social processes rely on the existence of subjectively shared rules of interpretation for translating social norms and values. Social reproductionist theory attempts to show that subjective meanings expressed in social action are biased by their economic function. The action-research model best supports educational research as a science aimed at improving schooling, thus maximizing the theoretician practitioner relationship. (LH)",

The analysis involved a study of 1,400 people aged 65 and over and 800 of their helpers. Delivery of services was categorized according to telephone or face-to-face; the frequency of each was measured. Services were categorized as \"household\" (housekeeping, paying bills, making repairs) and \"normal kin\" (checking on persons, bringing meals, giving gifts, talking to them when they are depressed). The farther away the helper lived, the smaller the proportion who received household help. By contrast, kinship services were far less affected by geographic  distance. Also, in terms of geographic proximity, it appears that when older people were both sick and single, they were more than twice as likely to live in the same household as their helper than those who were married or single and healthy. Also, those classified as poor made more daily face-to-face contacts with their helpers than those with high incomes, attributable to the fact that those in the unskilled labor class, not subject to the problems of occupational mobility, tended to live closer to their relatives. Finally, groups least incorporated into the modern economy (i.e., the poor and recent migrants) were more likely to adhere to a more traditional kinship structure and were least likely to be geographically distant.

To counteract this decline, departments need to continue to offer a traditional academic sociology curriculum, but also need to offer stronger training in research methods and statistics, interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving, and training and experience in practical settings and interaction. The sociology department at Southwest Texas State University has taken steps to incorporate these applied skills in their program; they have developed a bachelor of science program, a multi-disciplinary, multi-tract master's program in applied sociology, and an internship program. The applied undergraduate sociology program is designed to prepare  sociology majors for business and governmental positions by emphasizing applied skills. The Master of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies (MAIS) offers a modular concept with four tracts of study in the areas of gerontology, industry and social work, social studies, and social control.

        "description":"In response to recent statistics indicating a 20 percent decline in the ability of the average 17-year-old to analyze, interpret, and express views about written prose, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) recommends a number of changes in the elementary school social studies curriculum to provide more opportunities for students to practice writing and analytical skills. Writing can be optimized as a learning tool to sharpen social studies information and concepts; to develop thinking skills such as inference making, classification, and analysis; and to further the development and refinement of writing techniques. Research provides insight into the writing process and suggests that teachers develop appropriate activities to assist students during the prewriting,  composing, and rewriting stages of the writing process. An example of a facilitative prewriting activity in social studies would be the gathering of information from older citizens through personal interviews, which can be used as a catalyst for future composing activities. Careful integration of writing and social studies can best maximize the already limited time available for social studies instruction. In order to successfully integrate instruction in writing and social studies in the elementary classroom, effective writing instruction must be part of a coherent, systematic, developmental program of studies in which attention is paid to substance as well as technique.

The most commonly used microcomputer instructional techniques are presented, including drill and practice, tutorial, inquiry learning, educational games, real world simulations, models, use of graphics, and creative writing. The paper addresses major advantages of microcomputer instruction in implementing particular instructional strategies (such as the use of totally objective and immediate feedback) and accommodating a wide variety of learning styles. The limited research concerning computer assisted instruction, the limited availability of social studies software, and possible reasons for the reluctance of software producers to invest in high quality, educationally  sound software for the school market are discussed. Instruments available for assessing the soundness of microcomputer programs and additional sources of evaluative information are included. A brief discussion of major issues concerned with incorporating software in the classroom is followed by a 7-item annotated bibliography of resources in the ERIC system on microcomputers for the social studies.

Following an introduction, the document discusses several programs, including (1) the use of small one-time payments for individuals who become sterilized and to family planning workers or doctors for each acceptor recruited; (2) incentives that improve welfare such as deferred incentive schemes like the &quot;No-Birth Bonus Scheme&quot; by private industry or government pension programs, in which accounts are credited with later collection contingent upon success in having a small family; (3) community development incentives in which whole villages are rewarded with  development programs if the birth rate falls; (4) penalization of large families by imposing costs or withholding benefits; (5) emergency measures such as India's compulsory sterilization and China's one-child policy; and (6) expansion of the role of other incentive and disincentive schemes such as paying women to remain childless longer and developing programs to improve the lot of women. Also provided are four data tables illustrating countries offering small, one-time payments; average number of living children of women undergoing sterilization; fertility declines of all of India and the Tea Estates with and without &quot;No-Birth Bonus&quot; schemes; and Singapore's birthrate from 1960-1982.

        "description":"The topic of discourse in general is examined and examples of how scientific inquiry in the field of geography is affected by discourse are provided. To develop a more complete understanding of research, the author states that it is often useful to step back and ask why researchers choose to conduct research as they do, and why they so often ride the intellectual bandwagons which roll through various disciplines. He then discusses how a portion of the answer may lie in certain thoughts stemming from Foucault's conceptualization of discourse, defined as a broad collection of principles and beliefs which serve to set the bounds of knowledge and understanding. The effects of discourse on the following three areas of geography are examined: (1) the evolution of cartography; (2) the  study of human ecological adaptation; and (3) the influx of quantitative approaches to the study of geographical topics. Insights grounded in the phenomenology of Husserl, particularly the notion of regional ontologies, are proposed as important potential means of dealing with the effects of discourse. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"An eclectic, ethnographic methodology is presented for studying the content and acquisition of children's environmental learning, knowledge, and interaction in a transitional economy in rural Sudan. Drawing on methods of geography, linguistics, and anthropology, the paper attempts to provide a valid alternative to most of the methods used in research on environmental cognition and behavior. It is especially appropriate for work undertaken in non-Western settings. Two methodological issues addressed are that researchers need to be aware that biases and values affect the research process and that methods appropriate to study in one culture are not necessarily appropriate to study in another. The study focuses on a sample population of seventeen 10-year-olds from a village of 350  households in central Sudan. The major portion of the paper emphasizes the researcher's methodology including (1) the combination of random and directed observations, providing a complete picture of the activities of the sample population; (2) verbal methods, including ethno-semantic interviews, providing information on the content and origins of children's environmental knowledge; (3) demonstrative methods, including child-led walks, landscape modeling, and geo-dramas; and (4) &quot;oral-geographies,&quot; conducted with parents and grandparents of children, to discover the environmental goals for their children as well as their own childhood environmental interactions.

        "description":"The European history textbooks of four authors, Phillip Van Ness Meyers, Willis Mason West, Hutton Webster, and James Harvey Robinson, are described to show how they responded to and reflected the changing nature and function of the high school from 1880 to 1930. Data for the study came from educational histories, committee reports, journals, school district annual reports, surveys, and federal statistics. Three phases in the general development of the high school were identified: (1) the classical high school (1880-1900), which served few students and offered a predominantly classical curriculum; (2) the transition high school (1900-1925), which slowly accommodated the needs of commerce, industry, and social aspirations through a tracking course of study; and (3) the mass high  school (1925 to present), which offered a common basic, utilitarian curriculum to all students. Between 1880 and 1930, the textbooks changed from the omnibus general history emphasizing ancient history found in the classical high school, to the specialized subject texts containing ancient history and medieval and modern history components of the transition school, to the general or world history texts written for all students with a concern for readability.

The literature demonstrates that the period covered was a particularly decisive one in the long history of high school psychology, as it witnessed a resolution of the conflict over cognitive vs. affective  curriculum concerns and marked the commitment of professional psychology to precollege psychology. During this time the American Psychological Association created its Clearinghouse on Precollege Psychology.

The case study, which took place between November 18 and December 18, 1981, in a Champaign (Illinois) school, also examined viewpoints of: students and teachers on different levels and at different schools, administrators, learning coordinators, other staff, and parents. The document is presented in 4 parts. Part I describes the schools and teachers and the history of social studies textbooks in the Champaign schools. Part II compares criteria devised by administrators, students,  teachers, and parents for the ideal sixth grade social studies textbook; the acceptability by all groups of a single as opposed to a multi-text approach; and the specific acceptability of &quot;American Neighbors.&quot; This part contains results of attitude measures and sample letters from students to textbook authors. Part III examines textbook use issues. The role of the textbook according to the curriculum committee, administrators, teachers, parents, and students is described. Dependency on textbooks by all groups, and student and teacher styles of textbook use are also examined. Part IV, the conclusion, presents 10 questions related to textbook content and approach for publishers, educators, and parents.

State assessments were also conducted by Connecticut and Minnesota for comparison to NAEP findings. Findings in music indicate that knowledge about the elements of music and musical notation have decreased, although a positive attitude toward music prevails. Findings in art indicate that although knowledge about art is low, performance does improve with age and number of classes taken. Students are less willing to accept nontraditional art, pursue artistic activities outside of school, or perceive  art as important. State assessments in Minnesota and Connecticut indicate that Minnesota compares favorably over the nation in music achievement while Connecticut outperformed the nation in both music and art. Due to emphasis on back-to-basics, the arts are not being nurtured as they might be, and efforts should be made to ensure that achievement levels in art and music do not erode further by (1) promoting greater awareness of the importance of art to physical and national well-being; (2) encouraging a more sophisticated view of art; (3) allocating state recommended minimum amounts of time to art and music; (4) employing certified art and music teachers; and (5) encouraging student participation in artistic endeavors.

These problems are: (1) unabating deficiencies in its economy; (2) a precarious battle with communist orthodoxy and alliance management in Eastern Europe; (3) a jittery relationship with China; (4) an adverse shift in the balance of world power; and (5) the constraint which global interdependency and the thermonuclear age impose on the rational formulation of defense policies. The future will be intensely demanding for the Soviet Union because it has achieved global military capabilities at precisely the time its economy appears worn  out. U.S. leaders need to undertake frequent fresh appraisals of Soviet threats and realistic capabilities in the domestic and international contexts in which they occur. Defense strategists should not attribute to Soviet foreign policy nonexistent successes, but rather should be critical of claims that the balance of power has shifted to the Soviets. Both countries should agree to a moratorium on the habitual counting of weapons. Finally, the United States should be skeptical about the view that problems besetting Soviet decision makers can be resolved by war. (Author/KC)",

Research concerning effective schools is the topic of chapter 4, and chapter 5 demonstrates how indicators of effective schools are grouped into the more general categories of school climate  and leadership. Chapter 6 uses a hypothetical case study to show how school leadership processes can promote a school climate where there is an academic emphasis, an orderly environment, and expectations for success. The chapter ends with suggestions for superintendents and school boards for improving student achievement. Chapter 7 includes a questionnaire for assessing a school's effectiveness. The eighth chapter discusses principles of the school improvement process.

Data on the size of physical education departments, type of school governance, size of college communities, and the training and experience of the faculty were collected. All institutions surveyed were coeducational, and 90 percent were public. A majority of the colleges had liberal arts and vocational-technical curricula, and the physical education departments offered activity or service classes to the student body as a whole. In addition to information on the scope of programs offered, the study sought to examine current  policies, practices, and procedures used in the administration, organization, and conduct of the programs, and the use of available facilities. Results indicate that, over the past 10 years, there has been a decrease in the number of years required of students in the service program. Methods of program evaluation were investigated as well as the status of athletic coaches and their opportunities to gain tenure. Responses indicate that the majority of athletic administrators felt no significant impact from Title IX. (JD)",

        "description":"Current economic conditions have created additional sources of stress in the correctional setting. Often, recreation professionals employed in these settings also add to inmate stress. One of the major factors limiting stress management in correctional settings is a lack of understanding of the value, importance, and perceived freedom, of leisure. Inmates' perceived freedom of leisure includes their perceptions of: (1) leisure competence; (2) leisure control; (3) satisfaction of leisure needs; (4) depth of leisure involvement; and (5) barriers to leisure involvement. Negative leisure freedom in each of these aspects relates to stress, but all aspects of negative stress can be changed into positive stress. The Continuum of Perceived Leisure Freedom shows that inmates should be  moved from: (1) competence in few leisure activities to competence in many; (2) low leisure control to high leisure control; (3) few satisfied leisure needs to many satisfied leisure needs; (4) little depth of leisure involvement to indepth involvement; and (5) a reduction in leisure barriers. Only after the inmate has advanced along the continuum from a negative perception of leisure freedom to a positive perception of leisure freedom can stress be reduced. (JMK)",

        "description":"Descriptive data about teachers in America were analyzed in terms of the international dimension of education and the social context in which schools operate. Characteristics of teachers, such as age, gender, race, experience, education, and the conditions under which they work, provided a profile of the &quot;typical&quot; teacher. The model teacher emerged as an individual who is inclined toward provincialism, is monolingual, has not systematically studied other cultures, and shows little desire to teach in a multicultural context. Escalating immigration has increased the ethnic diversity of the schools and the need for teachers to broaden their understanding and knowledge of cultures and attitudes different from their own. The need has also grown for widening the international  understandings and perspectives of students. A discussion is presented on the necessity of developing a school climate in which teachers and students interact in ways that deepen appreciation for cultural differences and make them aware of the ways in which critical social values and interpersonal qualities can be modeled in the schools. Recommendations are made for developing teacher education programs which will broaden the international awareness of prospective teachers. (JD)",

The subjects' (30 female undergraduate physical education majors) oxygen consumption and heart rates were monitored while they walked on a treadmill on which the grade was raised every minute. Each subject was tested for maximal oxygen consumption on three different occasions. The times of day for testing periods were between 0800-0830, 1200-1230, and 1600-1630 hours. Data related to physical performances as measured by the total number of seconds subjects walked on the treadmill revealed significant differences between 0800 and 1200 and among 0800, 1200, and 1600. Significant increases in maximal oxygen consumption were noted between 0800 and 1200 and 0800 and 1600. The  exact nature of this variation is unknown; however, an increased blood flow to the working muscles can be postulated. The results of this study imply the need for researchers to report the time at which tests for maximal performance are administered. Additionally, when maximal performances are being compared, subjects should be tested at the same time of day to reduce the variability due to diurnal variations. (JMK)",

These multisite qualitative studies address the same research question using similar data collection and analysis procedures in a number of settings. To gain systematic knowledge about this phenomenon a study was undertaken of policy research projects in the field of education that were: (1) federally funded via a competitive request for proposals process, (2) involved the application of qualitative methods of data collection, and (3) compared several research sites. A two-step data collection strategy was employed. Telephone interviews were conducted with a key staff member of 25 projects.  Subsequently documents were reviewed and site visits made to five projects. One important distinction among these multisite qualitative studies was the degree to which their methodology was &quot;formalized.&quot; Formalization entails codification of the questions and variables to be studied, standardization of the data collection methods, and systematic reduction of verbal narrative to codes and categories. The variation in formalization observed across projects was substantial and seemed to result from different adaptations of academic social science to the policy research context. (Author)",

The second section of the paper contains reflections on the contributions this literature can make to the training of teachers in two specific areas: (1) development of skills in critical analysis  that will allow teachers to interpret, critique, and digest what others are saying and writing; and (2) development of observation skills that will allow teachers to find out for themselves what is happening in their own classrooms. Ethnographic descriptions of life in classrooms, with their detailed accounts of the lives, actions, thought, and perception of persons involved in educational settings, can be used as case materials to help teachers and potential teachers think in more differentiated ways about what happens in educational settings.

Based on extensive naturalistic data-gathering, the research documents how local school administrators use evaluation information generated by the district's research and evaluation unit. The significance of the research is the framework presented for conceptualizing the evaluation use process in a local education agency, including the following concepts: three new or revised use factors (&quot;espoused theories&quot; vs. &quot;theories-in-use,&quot; an expanded personal factor, and the clout factor); the types of use (signalling vs. charged use); the evaluation use process; and the domain of charged use. Concluding recommendations are directed toward local school evaluators and  users. They emphasize the importance of evaluator sensititity to organizational complexities within school districts, urging that most time and resources should be spent on evaluations supported by key administrators who have internal clout. Evaluation reports required to &quot;signal&quot; that the ongoing program responsibility is met will be conducted to fulfill external requirements, but these reports may not have the potential to directly effect local program change. Finally, implications for future research, including the call for more naturalistic evaluation use studies, are presented. (Author/PN)",

The study examined: (1) whether the dynamic assessment approach yields information which is a more appropriate indicator of cognitive competence than standard approaches based on static test theory; (2) why and for whom the dynamic assessment approach is effective; and (3) for what reason the procedures should be used. The sample of 147 fourth- and fifth-grade students from 15 elementary schools in the San Bernardino, California, area included 67 Anglo Americans, 37 Black Americans, and 43 Hispanic Americans randomly  assigned to standard, verbalization, or elaborated feedback test conditions. Measures of cognitive and perceptual functioning, cognitive style and personality (e.g., impulsivity-reflectivity, motivation and planning, and school achievement) included Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices, the Matching Familiar Figures Test, the Cattell Culture Fair Test of &quot;g,&quot; Harter's Perceived Competence Scale for Children, and Trail Making and Visual Search Tasks. It was found that the testing condition which seemed to be most effective in increasing performance of all groups was verbalization; a type of compensatory effect for initially observed differences was brought about by subject verbalization.

This paper notes the variation in state Title I gains over 2 years.

The data set of achievement for 1979-80 and 1980-81 data from 24 states, received by the fall of 1982, were examined. Differences between the estimates of gain  for the 2 years were minimal, with the largest being for grade 12 annual reading.

        "description":"To ascertain how evaluation has fared in the eighties, the Austin Independent School District surveyed the 94 largest school districts (including Hawaii and Puerto Rico) shown in the Directors of Research and Evaluation Network directory. A usable return rate of 63 percent was received for data analysis. As expected, the overall number of students eligible for Title I services increased as the overall enrollments in large cities continued to decrease. The average program budget decreased along with the average Title I evaluation budget. The average number of clerical, professional, and administrative staff declined. A smaller percentage decrease in overall federal funds for evaluation looks as though Title I funding may be taken up by other sources of federal monies. A surprise  comes in the increase in local dollars for evaluation. It would appear that local school systems do value the evaluation services they are receiving. The survey form and district responses to the question of whether there were changes in evaluation due to the reduction of federal funds are appended. (PN)",

        "description":"This paper reviews the role played by the Title I (now Chapter 1) Evaluation Technical Assistance Centers in providing technical assistance to state and local agencies. It presents (1) a legistative history; (2) the Technical Assistance Center (TAC) activities under Title I; (3) an evaluation of the TACs; (4) the legislative changes enacted by the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, Chapter 1; (5) Chapter 1 TAC contracts and activities; and (6) several questions about the future of TACs: are TACs still needed, are TACs an effective and efficient means of providing service, and will TACs continue to be effective? It would appear that, in spite of over 6 years of Federal evaluation assistance through the TACs, little progress seems to have been made in establishing  evaluation as a state and local priority. The selection and training of program evaluators typically has been a low priority for state and local education agencies. Few states have established criteria for program evaluators. In some cases, evaluation has not been perceived as a worthwhile activity; in other cases, the need for training has not been seen. Therefore, Federal technical assistance providers have been used to provide training for new untrained staff, as well as for local and state personnel who want to improve their skills. Steps need to be taken to reduce the dependency on Federal assistance through a reassessment of the purpose and implementation of federally funded assistance activities. (Author/PN)",

Further, the plan includes provisions for protecting the trend analysis function of NAEP by assuring a satisfactory level of comparability between the new assessment and prior assessments. A number of fundamental changes are necessary if the objectives of greater efficiency and policy relevance are to be met. Among the recommended changes for NAEP are: (1) a full-time, professional staff for the Policy Assessment  Committee; (2) the introduction of methods for developing objectives and items that are more cost efficient, provide for input from wider audiences, and result in a product that could be widely used by state and local school districts; (3) creation of a &quot;national&quot; item bank; (4) introduction of simplified methods of test administration; (5) revision of sampling procedures to eliminate cluster sampling; and (6) use of item domains.

The courses were designed to provide remedial instruction in reading and mathematics for target first, second, and ninth grade students. Questionnaires were administered to determine the success of the telecourses based upon the extent to which students watched the programs and the general reactions of students, parents, and teachers. For ninth graders who registered for the reading and mathematics telecourses, a pretest and posttest were also administered to determine whether there was an observable improvement in their skills at the end of the summer. An analysis of the data indicates that the programs were well received by those who responded. However, an overall assessment  of the telecourses' success was hampered by the following data collection problems: (1) only 14 percent return of parental questionnaires, (2) test information submitted for non-registered students made it difficult to identify the sample of students to be studied, (3) high attrition rate of students who were posttested, and (4) due to a revision of the mathematics posttest, no comparison could be made regarding students' performance in the mathematics pretest and posttest.

Eye movement measures were used as the dependent variables reflecting psycholinguistic processing. When all of the constraints within which the study had to be performed were examined, it became obvious that none of the traditional research designs would be appropriate. Hence, a new experimental design, Latin square matched with other Latin squares, was conceived which met the constraints of the study. This design has some features which make it very useful for research in many different fields of education. Furthermore, from a statistical analysis point of view, this design has several desirable characteristics: it allows  the researcher to test a larger set of hypotheses than is possible under other designs employing the same number of individuals, and it allows the researcher to gain sufficient power for the hypothesis tests while using only a small number of individuals. A description of the study and its constraints, an explanation of why the traditional designs cannot be used, and an introduction to the conceived design are given. The statistical analysis techniques to be employed on data collected using this design are then explained in detail. (Author/PN)",

The main objective of the paper is the illustration of a method for maximizing coefficient alpha. The maximization of alpha can be achieved with the aid of a principal component analysis. The relation between alpha max. and the first eigenvalue of a principal component analysis is presented. Alpha reaches its optimum value for a given set of items when each standardized item is weighted by its respective saturation coefficient under the first principal component. An example shows how one can calculate alpha, alpha standardized and alpha max. Though statistical weighting of the items offers the possibility of increasing the internal consistency of a scale, the  different importances given to each item should not be too far from a rational weighting based the nature of the items or other theoretical considerations.

In light of the increase in internal consistency reliability achieved by the method of aggregation and consequent increase in predictive validity, such high aggregate validity coefficients are expected. The particular value of the demonstrations reported here is that they show that in some applications of the method of aggregation, high aggregate validity coefficients can occur even though the actual variability in the predicted aggregate score is trivially small; in other words, little may be gained in the explanation of the  variability in the criterion measure by predicting the aggregate criterion score since this predicted criterion score is so close to the overall mean of the criterion scores. The routine reporting of the standard deviation of the predicted aggregate score was recommended for all applications of the aggregation method in the study of personality. (PN)",

Five criteria were established to test scale invariance across time and four criteria were established to test scale invariance across groups. Using the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory for Children, six models were developed to test the above criteria with covariance matrices obtained from the responses of 722 Black, White, and Hispanic elementary students. Results indicated that correlated uniquenesses existed across time and this produced an overestimate of the test-retest reliability. In addition, the construct of self-concept was shown to be invariant across the three ethnic groups.  Thus, LISREL procedures appear to provide a useful technique for studying scale invariance both within and between subjects. (Author/PN)",

Such a restriction might arise, for example, if a subject's response is expected to be affected artifically if any given level of a factor is presented two or more times. This paper describes an analysis for data which arise from such designs. Only the balanced case is treated. Subjects in a 2-to-the-kth-power mirror-image design may be divided into 2-to-the-k-minus-1 groups, each of which receives a specific, unique pair of treatments. This grouping arises from the restriction in the repetition of levels admissible in  the design. Each subject thus yields two scores under two combinations of distinct levels of the factors. It is assumed that the populations the groups represent are homogeneous bivariate normal. Significance tests are developed in the paper for the usual main and interaction effects associated with a 2-to-the-kth-power design. A fully worked example is included. (Author)",

The work undertaken at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education is described. Generally, efforts in the past have been given to computerization of bibliographic information and to computerization of data analysis facilities. It is now time to turn to the problems of the research data resource itself--to data development, data archiving, and to computerization of data (and documentation) access and exchange. A first step is for research institutions, government agencies, university departments, and private centers to establish a local data archive and computing laboratory, dedicating as much attention  to this as has been given to print collections and to analysis software. Institutions and contracting agencies should develop and adhere to reasonable guidelines about data preservation on the one hand, and data ownership on the other. The computerization of data access and exchange between institutions requires good arrangements at each institution and standardized facilities for computer networks. Another need is for a centralized archive function. (Author/PN)",

Aspects of development for both teachers and researchers as a result of these cooperative endeavors are examined.

Overall countywide results are presented and they are also broken down by racial/ethnic and sex classifications. School results are presented in four forms: (1) average subtest scores, (2) total battery interquartile ranges, (3) longitudinal trends (average score change for students tested in the same elementary school twice), and (4) nonlongitudinal trends (difference between average scores for students transferring into and out of each school). There are two appendices. The first one contains tables with  detailed summary data. The second one is a glossary of technical testing terms which provides the definition, use(s), and some interpretive precautions to be observed for each term. (Author)",

Tests were administered to 27,086 fourth, seventh and eleventh grade students in 405 schools selected at random in March of 1982. Test results were returned to participating schools in April, providing school staff with item-by-item and total-test results at the individual student, classroom and building levels, along with the comparable statewide averages. An interpretive manual was mailed along with the results. At the state level, three interpretive panels met in June to review the results, judge the adequacy of student performance, identify factors affecting the results and recommend ways to improve or  maintain performance. This report documents the interpretive panels' conclusions and recommendations. In order to compare Oregon students' achievement with that of students at the national level, fourth and seventh grade reading tests were equated with the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, allowing for a norm-referenced interpretation of statewide reading achievement for those grade levels.

The data were from black seniors and white seniors on the High School and Beyond data files. We wished to account for statistical artifacts by conducting cross-validation or replication studies. Therefore, each analysis was repeated on randomly equivalent samples of blacks and whites (n's=1500). Furthermore, to establish a baseline for judging bias indices that might be attributable only to sampling fluctuations, bias analyses were conducted comparing randomly selected groups of whites. Also, to assess the effect of mean group differences on the appearance of bias, pseudo-ethnic groups were created, i.e., samples of whites were selected  to simulate the average black-white difference. The validity and sensitivity of the IRT bias indices were supported by several findings. The pattern of between study correlations showed high consistency for parallel ethnic analyses where bias was plausibly present. Also, the indices met the discriminant validity test. Overall the sums-of-squares statistics (weighted by the inverse of the variance errors) were judged to be the best indices for quantifying item characteristic curve differences between groups. (PN)",

This study analyzes the relationships between the school climate and the different educational outcomes for students in various class situations. The study is based on analysis of data from a Junior High School study which was aimed at evaluating the reform in the Israeli educational system, and the conclusions of a case study of five integrated junior high schools in Israel. The ethnic composition of the classes studied varied due to the specific demographic situation in each area, to the location, and to individual school policy. It was hypothesized that school  climate may have a differential effect for different types of classes, according to their composition and grade. On a school level analysis, two distinctive climates were revealed: an achievement-conservative one and an integrative-open one. The type of climate was related to various student variables, such as achievement, aspirations, locus of control, self image, and anxiety. Results showed that classes are differentially sensitive to the effects of school climate, according to their ethnic composition. Also, in analyzing &quot;extreme school climate situations,&quot; the potential impact of school climate was found to be quite consistent. It is suggested that school climate is a dynamic phenomenon, changing through an interactive process, having different effects on different classes and with  different situations. (Author/AOS)",

The first comprised five case studies of school principals. The second synthesized studies on collaborative arrangements for school improvement, and the third is a review of five studies on the role of linking agents in school improvement. The work on public school principals examined the behavior of these individuals in different settings, and showed how community, district, and personal factors interacted with the organizational characteristics of schools to shape instructional management activities and decisions. The review of studies on interorganizational collaboration found that: (1) formal collaborative  arrangements are widespread, effective, and influenced by external factors; (2) structure has little influence on effectiveness; and (3) effective collaboration requires strong leadership, mutual ownership of the collaborative effort, congruency of needs and resources among collaborating organizations, and flexible operating procedures. Finally, the study on linking agents indicated that: (1) linkage activities include communication, coordination, resource finding, assistance in information utilization as well as problem solving and program implementation, and administration; (2) support systems were more significant than formal training in shaping linking agents' attitudes and behavior; and (3) linker effectiveness depends on the research focus, external assistance, the nature and  magnitude of the innovation, and local support.

To dispel the notion that the Administration is not committed to equal rights, the Assistant Attorney General describes current enforcement activities in the form of investigations and litigation concerning sex and race discrimination in employment, voting rights, school desegregation, and the rights of the incarcerated and institutionalized. Replying to criticisms of Administration policy against numerical goals and quotas to remedy past discrimination, Reynolds reaffirms the government's adherence to the principle of equality which, he says, is  contradicted by the concept of affirmative action through preferential treatment. Reynolds points out that no matter how well meant, measures to redress the effects of past discrimination with further discrimination will ultimately limit opportunities for individuals of all racial groups, and will invite a view of people as possessors of racial characteristics rather than as unique individuals. Maintaining that the Administration stands by the principle that individual rights take primacy over rights bestowed on groups because of race or sex, Reynolds stresses that civil rights policy will continue to reject racial quotas.

Part I of the study defines the fundamental American egalitarian ideology and its equality of opportunity and equality of results strands. The ambiguity in egalitarian policy standards, as formulated by the courts and by the Congress in Title VI and the Emergency School Aid Act, is discussed. Part II compares the &quot;Big City Review&quot; in New York City with insights gained from similar reviews of faculty hiring and assignment and student service issues, undertaken in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. In Part III, data obtained in the study, as well  as results of a survey conducted by the authors, are reviewed from the three analytical perspectives mentioned above. It is concluded, among other findings, that in New York City public schools for the time period examined, (1) commitments to anti-discrimination standards led to positive changes in teacher assignment and student tracking practices, and that (2) the entire process of civil rights enforcement was influenced by political factors at both national and local levels.

The report indicates that: (1) Hispanics drop out at higher rates than Blacks or Whites; (2) males drop out more often than females; (3) dropouts tend to have low grades, dislike school, come from low income families, and receive little parental support for staying in school; (4) reasons for dropping out include academic failure, non-school interests, economic need, health problems, and conflicts with school personnel; and (5) the unemployment rate of dropouts is double that of graduates. It is suggested that reducing the dropout rate in  Austin requires districtwide commitment and a coordinated approach that addresses the problem at all grade levels. It is further suggested that to be effective, dropout prevention programs must (1) ensure that all students will develop a minimum of basic academic skills, (2) include components that will enable students to meet their economic needs, (3) provide attractive activities, (4) focus on improving achievement, especially among disadvantaged students, and (5) be based on clear plans of action.

Project activities included inservice sessions on equity topics designed to help teachers become aware of inequitable classroom practices and ways of remediating them. In addition, unbiased classroom materials or materials which reduce bias  and stereotypic thinking were provided. Students were then administered four separate grade-appropriate instruments, using the Attitudes Toward Sex Roles (ATSR) instrument. Results showed that: (1) students' attitudes became less stereotypic during the second year for most groups, but the effects were not uniform for all grades, (2) individual grade cohorts showed significant movement toward androgyny, and (3) the greatest changes in students' attitudes toward sex roles occurred in the kindergarten and grade seven cohorts.

As exemplary projects called Developer Demonstrators, 12 of the programs described receive Federal funds to provide training, materials, and assistance to groups that wish to set up similar programs. Four of these Developer Demonstrators receive supplemental funding to provide expanded services as NDN Technology Lighthouse Projects. Seven other programs described in the report currently receive no NDN funds for diffusion activities, but may offer services through cost/service agreements with potential adopters. All of  the programs are concerned with computer applications in educational administration, management of instruction, and occupational training; computer literacy; computer- or technology-assisted-instruction in basic skills; technology utilization in education for the handicapped; and/or mass media technology. Information provided for each lighthouse project includes brief reports on facilities, equipment, and resources; services; staffing; special features; procedures for visitation; and a contact person. Descriptions of the other programs include scope, target audience, evidence of effectiveness, implementation requirements, financial resources, services, and a contact person.

An overview by Gwenelle Styles O'Neal reviews factors that influence the mental health of ethnic minorities and explores family and community support networks for alleviating stress. Susan Bellinger examines mental health programs and preventive activities in the workplace and discusses efforts to evaluate these programs. June Brown considers whether primary prevention, which relies on examination of social conditions and environmental intervention, can improve the design of family and child social services. Samuel O. Miller and Rita Cates discuss distinctions and linkages between physical and mental health prevention approaches, consider  prevention specifically for ethnic minorities, and discuss potentials for developing and implementing preventive programs. James Leigh examines preventive programs in the educational setting, and stresses the need for social work educators, practitioners, and students to be aware of how race and racism affect mental health. David Maldonado explores prevention among the minority elderly, focusing on the special needs of this group. Finally, Samuel O. Miller stresses the need to develop social work education curricula on preventive mental health in conjunction with existing social services, and examines social work curriculum development models for mental illness prevention among ethnic minorities.

First, Reynolds stresses that the Administration's commitment to the principle of nondiscrimination in all areas rejects the notion of a \"protected class\" and the practice of favoring some to the disadvantage of others. Consistent with this commitment, he says, policy on equal opportunities for the blind emphasizes that blind people are entitled to equality that can be achieved through removal of social discrimination, education of the public to new concepts concerning blindness, and measures that would enable all blind people to fully exercise their  individual talents. Reynolds then discusses how the Federal government enforces this policy through public awareness programs, agency coordination activities to standardize service accessibility requirements, and regulation, investigation, and litigation regarding civil rights for the blind. In conclusion, Reynolds reiterates that all American citizens are individuals with unique characteristics and talents; that preferences for certain groups will not be tolerated; and that the Federal government is committed to ensuring that artificial barriers to a free society and discrimination in all its forms are obliterated.

        "description":"Among Puerto Ricans who have migrated to the United States, a significant number have returned to Puerto Rico, while others shuttle between Puerto Rico and the United States. These groups of people are identified as return migrants. Studies suggest that return migrant youth in Puerto Rico have had to make environmental and cultural adjustments that have shaped their perceptions, concepts of group identity, and world views. Return migrant youth are often characterized as being negatively disposed toward self, inconsistent in behavior, alienated from Puerto Rican culture, and limited in Spanish language skills. At the same time, they are described as possessing initiative, respect for work, discipline, and practicality. Relationships between return migrants and Puerto Rican  islanders have not been very positive. The islanders complain about the returnees' contempt for anything indigenous, while the returnees are disillusioned when their expectations about Puerto Rican life and culture turn out to be false. Instead of good living conditions, ideal weather, good job opportunities, and friendship, the returnees find themselves confronting poor living conditions, discrimination, mistrust, and misunderstanding.

The survey sample consisted of 2,209 public, private, and parochial elementary and secondary schools in the United States. Findings of the survey (conducted in 1982/83 by means of mailed questionnaires and telephone contact to the schools) indicate that: (1) secondary schools are the largest pre-college users of microcomputers, with emphasis on the teaching of BASIC language programming; (2) 53 percent of schools now have at least one microcomputer for student instruction; (3) the use of microcomputers is growing faster in secondary schools than in elementary schools; (4) elementary schools tend to have only cassette-based  microcomputer equipment; (5) small parochial elementary schools and public schools in poorer districts are less likely to have microcomputers; (6) microcomputers are used for both drill-and-practice and for programming instruction, with greater emphasis placed on drill-and-practice by elementary schools and on programmming instruction by secondary schools; (7) social effects outweigh the academic effects of microcomputers; and (8) above-average students benefit more than average or below-average students from the use of microcomputers.

In defending the administration, Lee cites the Spirt v. TIAA-CREF and Hishon v. King and Spalding court cases. Both cases fall under the Title VII statute which prohibits employment discrimination. In the Spirt case, the issue in question was the payment of lower monthly pension annuity benefits to women than to men. The Hishon case regards law firms that discriminate against women in promotion from associates to partners. In both cases, the government argued that the Title VII principle requires  that an individual be treated as an individual, rather than as an undifferentiated member of a group. Lee says that the same argument holds for the administration's position on employment quotas or the use of busing in school desegregation, since both are group oriented solutions. Lee asserts that the cornerstone of civil rights laws and public policy has been the securing of individual rights. Therefore, he concludes, consistency in civil rights cases should be measured by attempts to protect individual rights. (AOS)",

        "description":"Accreditation receives much emphasis in our educational systems and it forms a significant element in both institutional and programmatic accountability and credibility. Numerous agencies and associations in addition to national institutional accrediting agencies are recognized as accrediting bodies. The accrediting bodies establish accreditation standards or essentials that guide their deliberations regarding accreditation and an educational institution's efforts in applying for accreditation. Accreditation standards apply to institutional accreditation, while accreditation essentials generally pertain to programmatic accreditation. Concern about the eligibility of vocational institutions for federal funds brought accrediting opportunities to these institutions in the 1960s.  Because of the difficult questions vocational-technical education encountered with the accreditation process, a national workshop held in 1979 with participants from existing accrediting agencies and vocational educators from state agencies and local institutions was organized to develop program standards and to improve accrediting procedures for vocational programs. Although accreditation is called &quot;voluntary,&quot; it is necessary for federal funding. The problems in accreditation--high costs and inefficient procedures--can be lessened by joint scheduling of on-site visits, development of a single self-study guide, and further research regarding the accreditation process. This paper explores the general accreditation process and its application to vocational education; it also profiles the  accreditating agencies and their standards. (KC)",

        "description":"The Youth Incentive Entitlement Pilot Projects demonstration has been the most ambitious attempt thus far to determine the feasibility of using private employers to provide a work experience in a youth employment program. In establishing this demonstration, congress authorized program operators to recruit private businesses as well as the traditional providers of work experience: public and nonprofit agencies. As part of the overall research on the implementation of entitlement, this report examines the participation of private businesses in the demonstration with particular attention to the experiences of both the firms that chose to participate and those that did not. The report addresses the strategies of prime sponsors in recruiting private businesses, the interest of firms  in participating as work sponsors, and the experiences of those who participated. In particular, the report assesses the sensitivity of the participation decision to the level of wage subsidy offered by the prime sponsor on the basis of a subsidy variation experiment conducted at two sites. In addition, the study assesses the satisfaction of firms with program administration and with the youths working for them, as well as the factors that affected their willingness to remain as work sponsors. Finally, the report addresses the dual congressional mandate that job creation for entitlement youth must not result in &quot;make-work&quot; jobs or in displacement of work opportunities for others by examining the relationship between levels of work quality and degrees of displacement.

Of the technology currently available, most is more suited to application with learner groups that are &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;captive&quot; rather than to learner groups that are &quot;fuzzy&quot; and &quot;free.&quot; More work needs to be done on developing a technology for determining what people do and what they value doing. One conceptualization of need that has proved useful in several contexts, including a business training needs assessment, is a model that conceives of need as consisting of the following three components: the competence or ability of an individual to perform a task or skill, the relevance of the  task or skill for the individual's particular job role, and the individual's desire to undertake training or education in the task or skill. The most immediate benefit of applying the concept of need components is in being able to determine empirically what activities people do and how they value those activities, with greater convenience and with less negative influence from the characteristics of the target group.

The program has three major components: advising/placement, academic skill development/cultural awareness, and financial aid/job placement. Native Americans over 18 years of age enter the institute and are carefully assessed concerning career and educational aspirations and abilities. They are then placed in programs that Truman College offers, or in programs at other institutions, and financial aid is secured for them. Once the participant is engaged in formal training, personal, educational, and career counseling are provided on a continual basis, and academic skills are bolstered through  individual tutoring. Additionally, participants receive personal and cultural awareness development. These multiple support services are intended to facilitate successful completion of vocational training or higher education, to prepare the individuals for eventual success on the job, and to increase both their appreciation of their cultural heritage and their understanding of their own needs and life goals. Job placement and followup also are provided. In the fall of 1981, the INAD placed 124 persons into Truman College and other institutions. This was the largest class of Indian higher education students ever assembled in the Midwest. An evaluation of the program showed that it has been successful and provided suggestions for its improvement. (KC)",

An examination of current trends in the areas of high technology, labor force demographics, and organizational culture indicates that business and individual clients of vocational education will increasingly demand not only technical skills but also the work adjustment and interpersonal skills necessary to function in this new environment. Various factors, including the recent information explosion, demographic changes, and the rise of computer and related product  technology have increased the need for life-long learning, for the acquisition of study and learning skills, and for improving students' occupational scientific literacy. Because of these societal trends, vocational education must institute approaches for integrating the delivery of occupation training and the knowledge and skills that make up what some have called the new basics--communication, information processing, science and mathematics, and computer literacy. In addition, vocational education faces significant challenges in the areas of diversity, issue management, and revitalization. (MN)",

Information and reports on BSEP were reviewed, and three major commands were selected for evaluation. In designing the program, the Army did not identify the basic skills required for each military job and, instead, devised blanket literacy levels. To remediate this problem, the Army awarded contracts to relate grade-level requirements to job performance. BSEP has not been effective in alleviating soldiers' deficiencies in basic skills due to the lack of centralized management and the lack of program evaluations. Studies have shown that short-term remedial programs do not provide the  competency needed to master highly technical material in many Army jobs, and substantial resources would be required to bridge the literacy gap. Recommendations were that the Secretary of the Army should defer renewal of all contracts for basic skills education at installations until the program is revised, offer basic skills education only during off-duty hours, define the basic skills required for each military job, and determine whether the desired skills are attainable.

Two classes of variables were extracted for the sample: personnel characteristics including age, sex, race, educational background, aptitude scores, and occupational assignments identifying the enlistee's Air Force specialty code (AFSC). Two tenure criteria were developed to reflect the number of months served (up to 36) and a dichotomous variable coded 1 if the airman was still in the service after 36 months; a zero was used otherwise. Four multiple linear regression models were developed to examine the occupational and personnel correlates associated  with airmen tenure. Results indicated that attrition rates differed markedly among AFSCs. These differences were attributed both to background and educational characteristics and to the unique aspects of individual AFSCs. The nature of the differences were interactive rather than additive. A general statistical model, designed to predict for all specialties combined, was found to be much less accurate than were specialty-specific equations. (Ten pages of attrition data are appended.)

        "description":"A study compared the approaches of self-paced and conventional instruction in Navy training. Using a sample of 37 Navy and Marine Corps courses, researchers contrasted the conventional, mixed, computer-managed, and self-paced instructional approaches according to the following six measures of instructional quality: prerequisites, cues, participation, reinforcement, feedback, and correctives. Various data collection strategies were employed during the study, including site visits; analysis of instructional materials; and questionnaires administered to students, instructors, and supervisors. Based on data from all of these sources, the researchers concluded that the six quality-of-instruction elements appear to occur with more frequency in conventional rather than in mixed or  self-paced instructional courses. Both student and nonstudent direct costs for the self-paced courses examined were from 36 to 58 percent of those required for the conventionally taught courses. Because self-paced instruction was found to be heavily dependent on written instructional materials, researchers urged particular care in the design of instructional materials and objectives for self-paced courses. Since instructional strategy did not ultimately appear to be a determining factor in the overall effectiveness of current Navy courses, researchers suggested that choice of instructional strategy rest primarily on the relative cost effectiveness of the approaches.

        "description":"This study examined the economic development role of small businesses in Macomb County, Michigan, in order to identify those businesses which are most significant in terms of their contribution to economic development and, which therefore, would warrant public support for their retention and growth. Using these criteria, the study isolated the role played by the tool and die, machine making, and fabricated metal parts industries. In addition, the study considered the significance of administrative and auxiliary businesses, the coordinating and research arms of manufacturing industries in Macomb County. While the latest economic census of Macomb County private businesses revealed that these areas have suffered a relative deline over the past 7 years, considerable amounts of wages  are still earned in these industries. Although service sector employment (a low-wage industry) has grown, the manufacturing area still accounts for a majority of the wages earned in Macomb County. The study concluded, therefore, that the economic development of Macomb County would best be served by retaining and expanding these high-wage industries. The study suggested several ways of implementing this goal: first, the establishment of a county-wide technology center that can conduct research and aid in developing the necessary machinery to enable the metal-bending industries to remain competitive; second, the establishment of an import-export center that can aid these industries in penetrating foreign markets; and third, the application of job training funds to the needs of individuals  within these industries. The study anticipates a key role for Macomb Community College in working with government, business, labor, and the community to rejuvenate and retain the metal-bending industries. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A study examined the accommodations provided to handicapped employees by federal contractors. During the 20-month project, researchers surveyed 2,000 federal contractors, conducted telephone interviews with 85 firms, surveyed disabled workers, and conducted intensive case studies of 10 firms identified from their survey or telephone responses as having exemplary accommodation practices. Based on these data, the researchers concluded that for firms that have made efforts to hire handicapped individuals, accommodation does not involve much in the way of actual costs. In 51 percent of the cases reported, accommodation cost nothing and in 30 percent of the remaining cases it cost less than $500, with the most expensive and extensive accommodations provided largely to blind persons  and individuals in wheelchairs. Accommodation efforts are generally perceived as successful in allowing workers to be effective on the job. While variations exist in who receives accommodation, the basic pattern appears to be that once individuals are hired, they are likely to be accommodated, regardless of occupation or seniority. Included among the recommendations emerging from the project were calls for tax credits for expensive accommodations, for adding a line item in federal contracts under a standard formula for accommodations for disabled workers used on contracts, and for technical assistance and, possibly, cost sharing in accommodation.

        "description":"A series of 10 case studies was conducted as part of a 20-month nationwide study of the accommodations provided to handicapped employees by federal contractors. During the course of the project, case study visits were made to the following firms: the Dow Chemical Company; E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company; Hewlett-Packard; IBM Corporation; Lockheed Missiles and Space Company; Merck, Sharp, and Dohme; the Raytheon Company; the Storage Technology Corporation; Tektronix, Inc.; and the Union Carbide Corporation. The site visits, which lasted from 1 to 2 days, involved interviews with various types of individuals, including top administrators, handicapped employees, managers of handicapped employees, employment recruiters or interviewers, and individuals in outside agencies who send  referrals to the firm or who handle accommodation issues. Because these companies are large, they all have at least one individual responsible for equal employment opportunity and affirmative action. In most cases, procedures for handling accommodation appear to be informal and decisions concerning accommodation are made on a flexible basis. Found to be especially successful were accommodation practices involving technological advancements that open job possibilities for some handicapped workers, special procedures for finding and interviewing qualified handicapped applicants, and training company staff in the areas of company policy and disability awareness.

        "author":["Mockovak, William P."],
        "description":"While gathering the 1980 census, the U.S. Census Bureau tried several methods of improving its training of census interviewers. This paper covers three general areas of that experiment. First, it reviews bureau efforts to improve verbatim training and presents selected results from an alternative training experiment conducted in the 1980 census. In this experiment, a method of instruction called job-aided training was developed, was used experimentally, and was compared to census verbatim training. The job-aided training was an enhancement of verbatim training that changed it from a lecture-oriented approach to one that required active learning by the trainee. It included simplification of training materials, especially the training manual, and the addition of task analysis to  the design of the materials. As a result, this training approach was more successful than others, and the bureau is planning to use it more widely for the 1990 census. Second, the paper presents an overview of training approaches being developed to support the bureau's increasing activities in centralized telephone interviewing. These approaches include self-paced instruction and classroom-housed performance-based training, especially practice interviewing exercises. Finally, the paper reviews some of the evaluation strategies being implemented to determine training effectiveness and to improve the quality of interviewing. Specifically, these strategies include selection, training, and monitoring techniques for use in a centralized telephone operation. Because of the expense of their use  and the questionable results, however, such techniques may remain experimental. (KC)",

The guide suggests the following five essential steps necessary for developing training programs: assessing the status of the situation, defining the problem, selecting a solution, implementing the solution, and monitoring the solution. In order to accomplish these tasks, an action planning process is suggested for use in examining the existing available curriculum resources. The following worksheets are included for use by program planners: (1) a guide to designing entrepreneurship training, (2) a guide to assessing curriculum priorities, and (3) a guide to implementing  entrepreneurship training. Eight curriculum resources are explored in depth. For each of these resources previously developed under federal and state funds, an abstract has been prepared that includes the source of the product, the materials available, level and scope of the resources, format, special features, and instructional units. In addition, items are included in order to illustrate a typical sample of what is to be found in the resources. The following four charts summarizing the resources are useful in completing the worksheets: background information, selected features, subject matter, and teacher and student materials. Finally, several additional curriculum resources, additional references, and a list of relevant organizations are included. (KC)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the skill areas that are generalizable across secondary vocational training program areas in the 32 vocational centers in Illinois. The major research problem was to (1) develop, validate, and determine the reliability of an instrument and (2) identify which mathematics, communications, interpersonal relations, reasoning, and other skills were generalizable across programs in secondary agriculture; business, marketing, and management; health; home economics; and industrial occupations training. Following a review of the literature, a survey instrument was developed and administered to 593 secondary vocational education teachers in the 32 vocational centers in the five program areas. The questionnaires gathered descriptive data regarding  the relative importance of a list of skills, as perceived by teachers, in terms of being necessary for students to perform successfully in the vocational training programs in which they were enrolled. The results of the study suggested that the concept of generalizable skills existed and was reliable and valid in terms of being capable of identifying the skills that are basic to, necessary for success in, and transferable/common across secondary vocational training programs. Students need high levels of skills in the generalizable skill areas of mathematics, communications, interpersonal relations, and reasoning to succeed in several secondary vocational training programs. Recommendations were made to periodically update the list of generalizable skills and to explore other skill  applications. (A list of the generalizable skills and the areas to which they relate is included in the document.) (KC)",

Project staff worked in April and May 1983 with students and teachers in the Columbus, Ohio, Northwest Career Education Center to field test 5 of 55 existing metric educational modules in 77 vocational education areas. Students from preselected classes in auto mechanics, diesel mechanics, and merchandise distribution were  randomly assigned to the experimental (36 students) and control (40 students) groups. The Statistical Analysis System program T test was used to examine the data collected. Comparing the raw scores of each category and then collapsing this data revealed that in the control group only 25 percent scored higher than 59, while in the experimental group 76 percent of the scores exceeded 59. A comparison of the means in the control and experimental groups demonstrated a significant difference and provided an overall picture of the effectiveness of the metric module. This study, while comparing groups drawn from a relatively small sample, indicates the instructional modules assessed were effective in imparting basic metric principles to the experimental classes. Replication of this study is  recommended in enlarged control groups employing both pre- and posttest provisions to facilitate the assessment of gain rather than final conditions only. (KC)",

The guide is organized in four sections and four appendices. Section 1 provides an overview and introduction to the guide, which describes the purpose, and the potential users of PACE, and summarizes the content of the succeeding sections. Section 2 contains 48 activity statements that describe alcoholism counseling. These statements are grouped into 12 functional headings; the first 7 headings are activities that deal  with direct client-counselor interaction (e.g., family counseling, group counseling, assessment); the 5 remaining headings are activities that counselors perform to insure the quality and continuity of the counseling process (e.g., professional conduct, documentation, education). Each activity statement is followed by a description of knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to perform that activity. Section 3 presents five categories of topics, in instructional units related to the 48 activity statements; each includes a rationale for the content, a content outline, suggested instructional activities, and a partial list of resources. A foldout is provided which displays the units in outline form under appropriate categories. Section 4 addresses issues that must be considered in  planning an educational program in alcoholism counseling (i.e., the philosophy of instructional design, and the necessary characteristics of a formal alcoholism counselor education program). Appendix A describes the activities of alcoholism counseling; Appendix B suggests resources for evaluating student performance; Appendix C provides ordering information for materials listed as resources for the instructional units; and Appendix D presents the desired counselor attitudes from Section 2, listed by activity.

        "description":"Impression management refers to the concept that people engaged in interaction will attempt to control the image of themselves that others form. This provides a foundation for social interaction, giving others information about who we are and what to expect from us. A central concern of impression management is the manner in which we are evaluated by others, i.e., if they react toward us as we intend our self-presentation has been successful. Social anxieties (e.g., stagefright, shyness, embarrassment) are tied to impression management because the fundamental concern in all these problems stems from the prospect of evaluation from others. Within this fundamental similarity, however, the bases for social anxiety may differ according to social setting, and according to whether a  predicament which makes us look bad has actually occurred or whether we just fear it might. A combination of high motivation to make a \"good impression\" and a perceived likelihood of failure creates the fundamental stress of social anxiety. Impression management also emphasizes that social anxiety is produced by an interaction of situational and personal characteristics; this suggests that there is no one specific treatment for all victims of social anxiety, but that a variety and combination of treatment modalities (e.g., cognitive therapy, or social skills training) should be used, as required, for each individual.

One factor which may influence the relationship between disclosure and attraction is emotional empathy (i.e, an observer's reacting emotionally because he/she perceives that another is experiencing an emotion). To investigate whether emotional empathy on the part of the listener would increase the effect of a negative, intimate self-disclosure on attraction to the revealer, female undergraduates (N=86) were assigned in equal numbers to the eight manipulated conditions of a 2 (perceptual set) by 2 (intimacy) by 2 (responsibility) design. In groups of two, the subjects were assigned a list of 15 self-description topics. Subjects watching their partner's self-description actually saw one of  four videotapes in which the confederate's disclosure varied in intimacy level, or in level of responsibility. Following the videotaped disclosure, subjects completed a mood, and an impression questionnaire. The multiple regression design used for analysis included empathy as a dispositional trait, empathy as a manipulated perceptual set, intimacy-level of the disclosure, and responsibility for the disclosed event as predictors. Results showed that dispositional empathy was associated with greater differences in perceived intimacy, and a tendency to interpret disclosures as an indicator of attraction from the revealer. Dispositional empathy was not associated with greater attraction to the revealer, and perceptual set had no effect on perceptions. (WAS)",

As part of a larger study to obtain information on students' reactions to types and sources of career related information, psychology majors (N=83) were surveyed about three general areas of career related information: enhancing knowledge about one's self; the world of work; and career implementation skills. Data analysis, based on a 64 percent response rate, showed that the most valued types of information were resume writing, interview skills, information about courses, the career activities of health/law professionals, and job search skills; none of the most highly ranked  items concerned knowledge of self. The most valued sources of information were two courses taught by the psychology department, and psychology advisors. One possible problem in the use of these findings is that excessive attention to information about the world of work and career implementation skills may serve as a barrier to student receptivity to knowledge of self.

        "author":["Zweibel, Nancy R."],
        "description":"Perhaps no facet of long-term care (LTC) research has received as much attention as the evaluation of community-based LTC demonstrations. Recent thinking has called into question the validity and policy relevance of the findings of these studies, yet their efforts will continue to receive strong financial backing. The time has come for LTC analysts to rethink the place of evaluation research as a tool for LTC policy development and to strengthen the methods for such development. Following the introductory analyses of LTC evaluation research, this paper describes a quasi-experimental research design, cohort analysis, used to evaluate the Hospital Discharge Demonstration Project (HDDP) funded by the State of Illinois, which provided short term, in-home assistance to impaired  persons, sixty and older, upon discharge from Chicago hospitals. The benefits of the quasi-experimental cohort analysis, when an experimental design cannot be used, are explored; specific topics discussed include sample comparability (in background and characteristics), sampling techniques, and the effects of political and organizational realities on the study design. A final section compares the benefits of traditional, comparative cost and effectiveness evaluations of community-based and institutional LTC and the quasi-experimental cohort analysis design.

        "description":"Bulimia, an eating disorder characterized by binge eating, may be increasing in frequency. In order to examine and assess: (1) the prevalence of bulimia in a non-clinical sample of college women; (2) the relationship of reports of binge eating to the fulfillment of operationalized Diagnostic and Statistical Manual III (DSM III) criteria for bulimia; (3) the prevalence of binge eating in males and females at times other than meals; and (4) sex differences in the labeling of one's behavior as binge eating, 327 male and 485 female college students responded to a questionnaire requesting information about binge eating and its frequency. Of the 147 women who responded positively to both questions, 105 completed an operationalized form of the DSM III in which the criteria for bulimia  were defined. Large quantities of food was defined as 1,200 calories or more per binge; episodic eating patterns was defined as a minimum of 8 binges per month; and repeated attempts to lose weight was defined as two or more attempts in the past month. Analysis of results showed that 56 percent of the women and 38 percent of the men reported binge eating, and more women than men labeled their behavior as binge eating. However, only 7.2 percent of the women binged 8 or more times per month. The criteria for bulimia in the operationalized DSM III were fulfilled by 3.9 percent of the women, suggesting that bulimia may be a more prevalent disorder in non-clinical college women than previously suspected.

Virtually no data are available in the professional literature pertaining to the SDS-E. High school students (N=44) in five remedial reading classes completed the SDS-E under standard conditions, i.e, the instrument was self-administered and self-scored. No relationship was found between reading level and Holland type scale scores. Summary codes, used to indicate personality type and occupational environment, were similar to those obtained by high school norm groups on the SDS. However, there was little agreement between stated aspiration and measured vocational personality. An  analysis of the errors and irregularities in the students' performance on the SDS-E suggested that the discrepancy was a function not of reading deficiency but rather of a greatly restricted view of the occupational world.

Such job information may be provided in several different formats. To determine if the type of job information influences decisions, management psychology students (N=48) received information about a job that stressed either the tasks involved or the basic abilities required. They then rated an applicant who was either technically average or superior, and who was either male or female. It was hypothesized that the task description would yield less accurate ratings and that the ability description would be discriminatory toward females. Contrary to the predictions, both types of descriptions produced decisions that were reflective of technical  qualifications and neither discriminated against women. The ability oriented description yielded more lenient ratings on many scales, and participants felt more confident in their decisions when given this type of information. (Author/WAS)",

        "description":"Bem's androgyny theory predicts better psychological adjustment in androgynous males and females (those with a balance of masculine and feminine traits) than in traditionally masculine men or feminine women. However, recent research suggests that androgynous individuals have no advantage over masculine-typed individuals of either sex. To explore the relationship between adjustment and sex-role orientation in college males, 45 male students completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI). A median split procedure was used to form four sex-role groups: androgynous, masculine, feminine, and undifferentiated males. These four groups were compared on the 3 validity and 10 clinical scales of the MMPI. Data analyses showed that  masculine men had greater ego strength and were less socially introverted than feminine men. No significant differences were found between masculine and androgynous men. There was also a significant negative correlation between masculine scores and the Si scale of the MMPI, and a significant positive correlation between femininity and the Si scale. The results tend to support the hypothesis that \"real men\" (masculine men) are similar to androgynous typed men in that they tend to have greater ego strength and less social discomfort than feminine or undifferentiated men. Additional support was generated for the notion that masculinity is the important trait in the adjustment of androgynous men. (WAS)",

        "description":"This paper, addressed to school counselors, provides background information concerning the rights of privacy for juveniles. A brief introduction notes the recent changes in juvenile rights and the expansion of the school counselor role and responsibility. The first section presents a general statement of the right of privacy primarily through English common law, American case law and the Warren and Brandeis Right to Privacy article (1890), which still acts as a catalyst in contemporary case law and legislation. The second section reviews the four categories of right of privacy as defined by Prosser in 1960: Appropriation - of a person's name or likeness for the defendent's benefit and advantage; Intrusion - on the plaintiff's solitude by intentionally and purposely prying; Public  Disclosure - of private facts; and False Light - publicity which creates false light in the public eye. The third section discusses the extension of the right of privacy to juveniles as clients of school counselors; summaries of case law concerning the First, Fifth, Ninth, Fourteenth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments are included. The fourth section provides general application of confidential and priveleged communications by school counselors resulting from the right of privacy of student, parent, and school staff clients. The appendixes provide a list of states with school counselor privileged communication, along with brief summaries of the laws in those states; a table of the legal cases cited; and a list of the references cited.

To construct a prediction model which, through readily available school information, will aid in the identification of students likely to drop out, schools in the Austin, Texas, school district provided data on students sampled according to birthdate (N=5,039). The longitudinal study encompassed four school years (1977-1981), and students were classified into four groups: non-leavers, transfers, dropouts, and other/unknown. The variables studied were gradepoint average (GPA), grade placement, sex, ethnicity, and number of serious discipline problems. Statistical analyses showed that students who had low  GPA's, were behind in grade for their age, had been involved in serious discipline incidents, were female, and were non-black had a higher than average probability of dropping out. Most of these variables had face validity for predicting dropping out. Two findings were somewhat misleading: in fact, girls as a group had a lower drop out rate than boys; however, an individual girl with certain characteristics might be more likely than a similar boy to drop out. Although scores of Blacks on variables were similar to scores of Hispanics, Blacks were less likely to drop out, apparently due to influences outside of the variables scored. Altogether, about 78% of dropouts and non-leavers were correctly classified. (WAS)",

To investigate the effects of the graduate experience on intra- and inter-family relationships among married doctoral student couples, and to discover how these students cope with the dual student/spouse role, 16 full-time married doctoral students (8 males and 8 females) and their non-enrolled but employed spouses participated in ethnographic interviews over a 6 month period. Results of ethnographic analyses highlighted four recurring themes: (1) support from spouse and parents (financial, emotional/psychological, academic, and basic needs); (2) factors affecting marital stability (i.e., financial problems, time pressures, children, communication,  sexual concerns, role conflict, physical and emotional separation); (3) social relationships and interaction (influenced by such factors as interest in status changes, absence of married peers, fears associated with terminating relationships upon graduation, and special needs of the non-student); and (4) status (affected by such factors as living arrangements, student-spouse role conflicts, measurement of status through enrollment and grades, locus of control, and financial conditions). The results have implications for the role of university and student affairs professionals who deal with the married graduate student. The telephone interview and interview questions are appended.

To clarify and broaden Doyle and Moore's work, and to develop a measure of attitudes toward males in society, 40 additional items were generated to add to Doyle and Moore's original 45 items, producing an 85-item pool. Factor analysis of college students' (61 males and 123 females) responses to the items (both the original Doyle and Moore items and then of all 85 items) yielded 23 possible factors, with half of the items, including 15 of the 40 new items, loading on a single factor. Fourteen items which  loaded over .30 on this factor and did not load higher on any other factors (even in the Doyle and Moore study) were chosen to form the Attitudes Toward Males in Society Scale (AMS). AMS scores were completed for each participant and compared to demographic data. Analyses of results showed that females had a slightly more liberated view of male roles in society than males, and older women were more liberal than younger women. There was no difference with age among men. (MCF)",

To examine the relationship between trait indecisiveness, vocational uncertainty, and interpersonal characteristics, 325 freshmen students were tested with a Trait Indecisiveness Scale and the Leary Interpersonal Checklist. The relationship between indecisiveness and vocational surety was examined by a chi-square test, while the relationship between indecisiveness and interpersonal characteristics was examined by a two-group discriminant analysis based on high versus low indecisive subjects. Self-reported vocational surety was significantly related to indecisiveness, lending support to the validity of the Trait  Indecisiveness Scale. Results of the discriminant function showed that the primary interpersonal variables which contributed to the differences between high and low indecisiveness groups were submissiveness, lack of general dominance, self-criticalness, passivity, and cooperativeness (related to the need for acceptance). The validity of the indecisiveness construct as an important component of vocational indecision was supported. Clients suffering career indecision might also have high trait indecisiveness and be experiencing interpersonal discomfort. (Author/JAC)",

They also were taught a method to evaluate the confrontation responses they were practicing. The discrimination/communication training group discriminated levels of effective confrontation using Carkhuff's confrontation scale and, subsequently, practiced communication of confrontation responses. Both groups received 3 hours of group practice  and feedback. Assessment of the effects of treatment was carried out through analysis of 15-minute audiotapes made by each subject with a coached client. Dependent measures included total number of responses, number of confrontations, ratings on Carkhuff's confrontation scale, scores on the Multidimensional Confrontation Response Scale, and the Response Relevance Scale ratings. The results indicated that the cognitive self-instruction group subjects made fewer total responses and higher Response Relevance Scale scores, but they did not differ in the measures directly related to confrontation.

Ninety undergraduates completed survey forms asking them to describe how they monitored their comprehension of textbooks. Reported criteria were classified as involving the retrieval of text propositions (knowledge standard) or the transformation of text propositions (comprehension/application standard). Students were then classified as having &quot;dualistic&quot; (perceiving knowledge as isolated  facts and answers) or &quot;relativistic&quot; (perceiving knowledge as an organization of facts and concepts) beliefs about the nature of knowledge. Students were also classified as high or low inventives (reporting few or many emotional blocks, respectively). Results indicated that the dualists were significantly more likely to use the knowledge standard than were the relativists, and that students reporting the use of comprehension /application criteria earned significantly better grades than did those using the knowledge criteria. High inventives used more monitoring criteria than did low inventives and were more likely to use monitoring strategies that combine the two standards. Students using many monitoring criteria earned significantly better grades than did those using only one. (Copies of  the survey forms are appended.) (Author/FL)",

        "description":"To create not a text-bound but a reader-based procedure for identifying global coherence within a discourse, five major writing tasks of 13 college students enrolled in a basic skills composition course were evaluated by three readers--doctoral students and faculty members in English and Reading Education. After choosing the five most and the five least coherent papers, the readers summarized the main ideas of these texts and identified the statements contributing to and detracting from their main ideas. Analysis of the readers' findings revealed no significant differences between highly coherent and highly incoherent papers in the percentage of statements contributing to global meaning. It did show, however, that the globally incoherent texts had a higher percentage of local  incoherent statements and more frequently required readers to generate major inferences from these statements. Results indicated little reader agreement either on which propositions in the more incoherent papers were significant or irrelevant, or on the global meanings of any papers, coherent or not. The findings suggest that more coherent texts supply readers with a greater number of multiple cues for the building of meaning macrostructures and thus require fewer processing resources on the part of the reader. Because reading is a transactive process, however, the existence of multiple signs does not guarantee a shared understanding of even the most coherent texts. (MM)",

Goodman's study found that many grammatical miscues are, in fact, signs of reading for meaning. The research suggests, therefore, that teachers need to treat students' home language with respect. Teachers without reading materials adapted to dialect can improve their teaching of dialect users if they effect changes in their own knowledge, attitudes, methods and materials, including (1) recognizing that students' cultural  experiences will affect their reading comprehension, (2) learning more about students' dialect patterns, (3) accepting dialect miscues as evidence that students are comprehending what they read, and (4) focusing not on word identification but on larger strategies for improving comprehensiion, such as SQ3R (survey, question, read, recite, and review).

Once students have developed an awareness of their own comprehension processes, high interest novels will increase their reading fluency. Geared to student ability and interest and approached through open-ended questioning, these novels can build student confidence toward the reading process. In addition, frequent quizzes on the reading can help students develop test taking skills. Content area texts can be used to help students develop good questioning techniques and  mapping skills. Generating important questions on the material read (1) gives purpose to reading, (2) encourages the prediction of actual test items, (3) alerts students to important concepts, (4) highlights the material's method of organization, and (5) makes students active readers, thus improving their concentration.

        "description":"To determine whether the impressive rates for speed reading (e.g., 500 words per minute) can be approximated in speed listening, two experiments compared the comprehension level of material heard at a normal speaking rate with that heard at accelerated rates. In the first experiment, the major demonstration experiment, three groups of college students--a control group, a group given three hours of training in listening at normal speed, and a group given an equal amount of training in speed listening--were given comprehension tests of (1) material presented at a normal speaking rate, approximately 180 words per minute; (2) \"skimmed\" material, having unnecessary words deleted so as to produce a presentation rate of 230 words per minute (rate was determined by dividing the number of  words in the original passage by the number of minutes it took to play back the skimmed version); (3) original material speeded up, with pitch correction, to 400 words per minute; (4) material skimmed and accelerated to 500 words per minute; and (5) new material (no presentation). While comprehension following speed listening was below that following a normal presentation, the amount of information acquired per unit of listening time was greater under speed listening conditions. Surprisingly, practice in speed reading had little effect on comprehension, both in this and in the second experiment, which increased practice listening experience time to about 16 hours. The document notes that, beyond its theoretical interest, research in speed listening can be applied to programs for the  reading disadvantaged and for situations where communication must be restricted to auditory channels.

The subjective ranking of the passages' difficulty illustrated the varied factors on which individual judgments are based. Calculation of the percentage of grammatical and lexical ties per word and per sentence failed to correspond to workshop participants' subjective judgments of difficulty, suggesting that the connection between cohesion and comprehensibility needs to be investigated further. Rix scores--obtained for each passage by counting the number of long words, dividing  by the number of sentences, and multiplying by 100--corresponded roughly to the subjective ratings. While providing an objective measure, the Rix scale's equation of sentence and word length with sentence and word complexity is questionable. Although these measures are indirect, they may nevertheless provide teachers with help in critically evaluating classroom texts. (MM)",

Constantly renegotiating these goals, readers create successively more refined drafts of meaning, adopting different alignments (critic, coauthor, editor, character, reporter, eye witness) to achieve greater coherence. Finally, after revising their developing interpretations, readers monitor their understanding, evaluating their effectiveness in each stage of the composing process.

The results disproved both hypotheses, indicating that the elderly subjects (1) were not physically incapacitated (they had usable vision, could hold and turn pages of books and newspapers, and could attend to and concentrate on their reading); (2) did not have to read and were not too busy to read; and  (3) expressed a need for instruction in determining the author's purpose, developing critical and evaluative reading skills, understanding government documents, and using the library efficiently. The results suggest that a strong motivational element must also be included in reading instruction for the elderly. A subsequent three-phase instructional program based on what might be done for the subjects in the study addresses the issue of the amount of reading done by the elderly, focuses on opportunities for sharing reading and reading related experiences, and offers suggestions for addressing specifically diagnosed reading difficulties.

During the oral reading, the teacher records the number and kinds of reading miscues made and notes student affect. By leading students through progressively more difficult lessons, the teacher can determine (1) at what levels the pupils can read comfortably without help, (2) when reading becomes so  difficult that the experience is more harmful than helpful, and (3) what range of materials the pupils can handle effectively in a teacher-guided situation.

The second section reviews key issues in the development of discourse production, including local, remote, and unsuccessful connections and then presents research findings on  connectedness in children's expository and narrative text production.

These analyses indicated that the word  recognition factors drawn from the reading set were most related to the spelling variables of the writing set at both grade levels. However, substantial differences were apparent across reading level cohorts. For beginning readers, again, the word recognition factor drawn from the reading set was most related to the spelling variables in the writing set.

Students examine and imitate not only finished works but also the writing that went into them--the generation, arrangement, and revision of the material that makes up a story or poem. Constraints on the teacher's ability to involve students in the different phases and variations of the writing process include the lack of time, the relative dearth of texts that describe what writers actually do, the requirement  of grading, and students' possible unwillingness to surrender some measure of &quot;self-expression&quot; for imitation. As a reasonable compromise, teachers would require a great deal of imitative work but base grades on works the students choose.

Traditional journalists focused on local and spot news, downgraded interpretative and national/international material, and shared their audience's news preferences. Less concerned with local interests, interpreters stressed national news and human interest stories, while activists emphasized international news. Both interpreters and activists stressed investigative reporting. According to multiple-regression analyses, traditionalism indicated both local orientation and pragmatic efficiency--spot news can be processed quickly using newswriting conventions. Results were supported  by L. Kohlberg's six-stage model of moral/ethical development. Stage 1, emphasizing arbitrary, fixed rules, reflected the traditionalist stance. Stage 4--basing beliefs on logical reasoning rather then on majority opinion--suggested the interpretative attitude, while stage 6--positing a concern for universal ethical principles--described the approach of many activists.

A content analysis of 45 local television newscasts on nine different stations was followed by the administration of in-depth interviews with the stations' news editors. The interviews solicited information from the editors about sources of unique news stories and about their perceived newsroom philosophies in the coverage of unique news stories. Results showed that more than half of local stories analyzed were categorized as unique.  These stories most frequently involved the topic Human Interest/Feature when analyzed with respect to all local stories. (Appendixes contain definitions of news story topics and brief summaries of each local news story analyzed.) (Author/FL)",

        "description":"In contrast with earlier findings indicating that public information campaigns produce little change in public attitudes and behaviors, current research suggests that the Advertising Council's &quot;Take a Bite Out of Crime&quot; campaign, initiated in 1979, has had a substantive impact on the public's response to crime prevention. Data from a national survey of public reactions to the campaign, as well as a panel sample examining changes in citizen crime prevention orientation, suggest that the public service messages have made people more aware of prevention techniques, more optimistic about the effectiveness of citizen-instituted prevention activities, and more involved in actively preventing crime. As a direct result of the televised messages, nearly one-quarter of the exposed survey  respondents adopted additional safety measures such as leaving on their outside light, or asking neighbors to watch their house when they were away. Most significantly, an increasing number of respondents became involved in neighborhood crime prevention techniques. The failure of the campaign to increase either concern about crime or a sense of responsibility for its prevention may, in one sense, be a positive feature, as it indicates the campaign heightened public awareness of a problem without increasing the individual's sense of vulnerability.

        "description":"Panel studies have frequently been used by mass communication researchers. While these studies allow researchers to draw inferences about mass communication effects over time, they also tend to sensitize respondents to the issue under study. A study was undertaken to investigate panel effects by examining the survey interview as a medium of communication. Unlike other models of survey research that have conceptualized the interview as an &quot;upward flow&quot; of communication, the study used an approach that investigated the flow of information from interviewer to respondent to other members of the social network in a &quot;downward&quot; two-step flow. Subjects were 81 college students, 53 of whom lived in the same dormitory. Of these, 27 were involved in the survey panel and were interviewed  twice, the interviews separated by a two-week interval. The remaining 26 dorm students were interviewed only at the second interview period, as were 28 students who did not live in the dorm. The findings indicated that significant knowledge gain and diffusion effects can occur in and thus contaminate panel studies. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"A study tested the cumulative acquisition model proposed by S. H. Chaffee and A. R. Tims to explain the development of adolescent patterns of news media use. The Guttman scale procedure was used to analyze patterns of news media use across a three-wave panel survey of 366 parent-child pairs over a 2-year period. In each wave, interviewers talked first to the child, then to the parent concerning a wide range of topics dealing with the 1980 presidential campaign, perceptions of the candidates, attitudes toward the government and social institutions, interpersonal communication about politics, mass media usage, partisan political orientations, political beliefs, and social values. Longitudinal patterns of news media use showed that the only evidence of a cumulative growth in usage  was for children in the fourth through sixth grades at the outset of the study. The developmental patterns were not consistent with the requirements of a Guttman scale at two of the three measurement points. Generally, television news exposure did not emerge prior to the regular use of print media, and the acquisition of print media use did not take place at the expense of television news viewing. This pattern is substantially consistent with the notion of a cumulative process. (Author/FL)",

Another activity, following a reading and dramatization of \"Spoon River Anthology,\" is taking gravestone rubbings at a local cemetery and inventing dramatic monologues in the style of Edgar Lee Masters. Other suggested activities include (1) studying and listening to ballads, followed by writing, practice, and performance; (2) starting a column of poetry in the school or town newspaper, offering original works and reviews; (3) visiting the local art museum or  gallery, preceded by a review of poems based on various paintings, and followed by art-inspired student writing; (4) building library skills by reporting on a modern or contemporary poet; (5) introducing works by the masters and having students tinker with the form; (6) bringing a poet into the classroom so students can talk with someone who writes poetry as part of his or her life; (7) publishing a modestly produced journal in which students contribute poetry and prose as well as editorial and production time; and (8) producing and directing an annual poetry festival, featuring dramatic performances of \"Spoon River\" poems, epics, ballads, and favorite poems, or displaying poems alongside student photographs, or photographs of major artworks.

        "description":"Prepared as part of a series applying recent research in oral and written communication instruction to classroom practice, this booklet discusses three visual models of teaching written composition. The first section of the booklet discusses the content area model, which begins with an abstraction presented to students (definitions of parts of speech or rules for subject-verb agreement, for example), then moves to models or examples, such as sample paragraphs or model short stories. The section also examines the shortcomings and the strengths of the model. The second section deals with the mastery model, a visual interpretation of B. Bloom's ideas, analyzing its flaws and advantages. The third section presents the writing process model, a synthesis of ideas from D. Graves, J.  Britton, G. Stanford, and others. The discussion covers the various stages of the model, including prewriting, drafting, and proofreading, and offers a comparison of the model to others. The booklet concludes with three &quot;excursions,&quot; extended treatments of several points related to the topic of models, including talk in the classroom, revision and teacher feedback, and the writing process, mechanics, and nonstandard English. Examples of student work are used throughout the booklet. (FL)",

        "description":"Responding to students' needs for systematic advice about their writing, a city university developed a voluntary test using student writing samples to evaluate punctuation and grammar, diction, sentence structure, and organization and development. Evaluation of 100 test results revealed that these students, all working adults, showed more control over mechanics than over organization and development. Although all but 10 of the students had had previous college writing instruction, only 23% of the sample received a satisfactory score. After receiving their diagnostic test results, one-quarter of those eventually receiving degree candidacy registered for a nonrequired first-level writing course. These findings suggest the following: (1) a self-instruction format for teaching  editing skills could free needed class time for work on more difficult problems with idea organization and development; (2) if given information about their writing problems, adult students will voluntarily register for additional instruction; and (3) instruction alone is not enough to improve writing skills--teachers in all subjects need to stress writing's value as an aid to both communicating and learning.

A battery of questions based on a modified communication triangle--subject (problem), writer (rhetoric) and audience (opposition)--helps students to analyze argument components. Adapted from the Crebbe-Debate approach, peer evaluation of arguments emphasizes the importance of the audience in persuasive essays. Combining inductive analysis of writer, subject, audience, and sense of audience immediacy with solid organizational options, this method teaches students not simply what weakens arguments, but how to write good  persuasive essays.

Students in this course also reported greater self-perception of improvement in the public  speaking unit and in writing skills associated with this unit--the ability to outline, to develop and support a thesis, and to conduct research.

The subjects, 161 undergraduates enrolled in communication courses at an eastern university, were given a two-page summary of a university problem regarding the introduction of hard liquor at a campus &quot;pub,&quot; and a summary of arguments for the change from student advocates, from neutral elements of the university administration, and from campus security  opposed to the change. The decision-making process was then described in either a single author version or a version by a committee made up of faculty and students. Subjects were told that the final decision was a compromise permitting wine and champagne, but no hard liquor. Subjects were then asked to complete a 26-item Decision Quality Index. The evaluative responses clearly indicated that the group was perceived as being generally more credible than the individual, and the decision made by the group was rated higher in quality than that of the individual, supporting both hypotheses.

A survey was sent to all individuals who had indicated to a university center for management education and services an active interest in business or organizational training procedures or programs over the previous 5 years. One hundred eighty-five responses were received. Respondents were asked to indicate on a four-point scale the extent of competence of supervisor or management personnel in specific communication skills with subordinates, supervisors, and peers; the importance of those skills to supervisors or middle management personnel; and in which of the  communication skills categories additional training was needed. The categories used were formal presentation, group problem solving, conference leadership, giving directions, handling grievances, private conferences, delegating authority, motivating people, and listening. The results indicated that listening, motivating people, and handling grievances were ranked as the top three areas in which additional training was needed. In general, supervisors or middle management personnel saw these three areas as being the most important to them regardless of with whom they are communicating. Listening and motivating people were the areas where on-the-job training should be concentrated, and where students should place the most emphasis before entering the business job market. (HTH)",

Involving a frequently elaborate organization of rules that emphasize at once an adventurous role with few physical restrictions and the need for team play, boys' games teach the importance of being able to work creatively within a complex framework. The logical extension of these games is the adult business organization. Girls' games, however, usually operating with a very simple set of rules, stress one-on-one interaction rather than competition between groups. Girls' game behavior is ritualistic and physically limited, creating roles frequently domestic in style. It is little wonder, therefore, that  when confronted with the unfamiliar game strategies of the organization, businesswomen experience a general sense of discomfort, insecurity, and estrangement. Literature offers few sound prescriptive comments, however, either about using games to expand girls' organizational and boys' interpersonal skills, or about helping women learn corporate strategies.

        "description":"It is axiomatic that context influences interpersonal behaviors, yet communication researchers have had limited success in generating a set of conceptual or operational definitions for the situation variable. Two studies were conducted to examine emotion-eliciting qualities as the basis for such a typology and the relationship of situations classified by this system to other variables. Specifically, the first study investigated whether interpersonal situations could be described reliably in terms of emotion-eliciting qualities, while the second study tested specific predictions about approach toward or avoidance of interpersonal situations based on emotions elicited. In the first study, 102 college undergraduates completed emotion-eliciting scales for a variety of situations,  and, in the second, 170 students completed scales measuring anticipated approach-avoidance. Results indicated that emotion-eliciting qualities comprise a system for classifying situations that is exhaustive, mutually exclusive, and related to the theoretical purposes of explanation and prediction. Further, the findings showed that emotion-eliciting qualities of interpersonal situations relate systematically to other variables. Approach toward or avoidance of interpersonal situations, for example, was predicted and explained in terms of emotions elicited by those situations. (FL)",

        "description":"A preliminary study investigating the perceptions of intergroup relations in the bargaining process supports Kenneth Burke's concepts of order and mystery. Questionnaires, interviews, and direct observations of teachers' and school boards' teams involved in contract negotiations show that people closest to the bargaining saw more order in the process than did those further away. Teachers with previous experience in negotiating, for example, were more aware of the complexity and multiple levels involved in reaching a settlement. They differentiated between their role and the greater control exerted by team leaders and professional negotiators. Experienced teachers, unlike inexperienced ones, also saw their own operations as more mysterious than the school board's. An apparent  contradiction of Burke's idea that those closest to the process see it as less mysterious, this finding might reflect the experienced teachers' greater awareness of the secret meetings conducted by their own team leaders. While earlier research focused on the dyadic relationship in bargaining, this study suggests that intragroup and intergroup relations have a significant effect on reaching a settlement. (MM)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine the place of cable in the lives of subscribers and its perception among nonsubscribers. Subjects, 251 subscribers and 246 nonsubscribers in a northeastern city midway in the process of cable diffusion, responded to a number of questions concerning their recreational activities, sources of information about cable, reasons for adoption or nonadoption of the medium, family communication about it, and ownership of other media technologies, such as video games. Demographic data were also gathered. Results showed that those subscribing to cable television services were more affluent, more likely to be married, and more likely to live in households with children than were nonsubscribers. The data also suggested that cable television was most often  requested by children in a household, and that parents often yielded to their requests for the type of programing provided by cable. When children left a home, parents declined to subscribe, offering reasons suggesting that cable is a commodity that needs justification rather than a necessity that stands alone. Overall, the findings indicate that the decision to subscribe, maintain, and terminate subscription to cable television takes place within a matrix of interpersonal communication. (FL)",

Students will then become aware of the diversity of ideas and cultural practices, and Francophone traits will be rendered less stereotypic. The most useful classroom techniques using cognitive dissonance involve: (1) offering students nonjudgmental information over a sustained period; (2) group task assignments such as listing positive attributes of the French, finding French-made items, or finding local businesses with French clients overseas; (3) exploratory small-group discussions on attitudes toward the French; (4) skillful  interrogation allowing students to reveal biases against the French; (5) values clarification requiring students to list values, assign priorities, make choices, and respond to hypothetical situations; and (6) counter-attitude advocacy, having students support a position and attitude that is the opposite of the one they actually hold. The more effort and time students spend on these activities, the more likely that their attitudes will change. (MSE)",

They are (1) that in a grammatical situation where an adult's first language parameter is not activated in the second language, the learner will \"lose\" the first language parameter, carrying over some of its structures into the second language; and (2) that in losing the first language parameter, all of its aspects will be lost together, not partially. The parameter examined was the \"pro-drop\" parameter, which includes such properties as the ability to omit subjects, and free inversion of subject and verb in declarative sentences. The subjects were 54 native speakers of Spanish (a pro-drop  language) learning English (not a pro-drop language) and a control group of English students who were native speakers of French (like English, not a pro-drop language). Results suggested that having to change a parameter in language learning may cause problems and is a source of interference errors, at least initially. Other possible explanations for the results are discussed. (MSE)",

The grammar combines an emerging knowledge of semantics with existing detailed knowledge of syntax. The primary unit of analysis is the predication, a group of related concepts expressed as a finite or nonfinite clause, taking varied structures. A section on theory presenting the fundamentals of the proposed grammar is introduced by a chapter explaining structures and terms. Other chapters in this section outline the predication, secondary arguments, argumental relationships between predications, and nonargumental relationships between predications. The second section describes the specifics of the application of the grammar to  language analysis, focusing on quantification techniques. Chapters address these topics: measuring argumental characteristics, measuring argumental relationships, measuring nonargumental relationships, and syntax. Substantial statistical documentation of the techniques is not presented because of the early stage of development of the system. (MSE)",

        "description":"The use of German film in four instructional contexts, based on experiences in developing a university course, is discussed. One use is as part of a German culture course taught in German, emphasizing the role of film as a cultural statement of its time, intended to be either a social criticism or a propaganda tool. A second use is integration of the film into a literature course taught in German, employing a series of television plays acquired from the Embassy of West Germany. Experience with film as part of an interdisciplinary German/journalism course offers ideas for a third use: a curriculum, offered in English, to explore a historic period or film techniques. A fourth use is as an element of a period course taught either in German or, if interdepartmental, in English, such  as a course on the artistic manifestations of expressionism. (Author/MSE)",

First, appropriate student on-task behaviors were determined, and teacher behaviors influencing or associated with student on-task behavior were defined. An observational instrument for recording and correlating student and teacher behaviors was then designed and tested with 11 beginning Spanish classes to minimize error in high-inference decisions. Inter-observer agreement of over 85% was found with the instrument being developed. The instrument was then used in the central study of five intensive Spanish students with no previous second language experience and average language aptitude. Each student was observed for four class periods during the five weeks, with  observations coded every fifteen seconds and verification by audiotape recording. It was found that all subjects spent most of their instructional time on task, despite varying performance. Grammar and speaking activities were the most common recorded. Sensing (primarily listening) was the most common teacher behavior. Proportions of student behavior spent on each type of task, and associated teacher behaviors, are tabulated. The student showing the least time-on-task was the student who performed best on the final examination, possibly needing less time to master content. Further research is recommended on types of tasks and conditions of performance. (MSE)",

These practices included: open-door admission for students who either could not be accepted by or were dismissed from other colleges, a set of core courses, a preceptor system, a system that allowed students to charge their meals and other expenses, the use of modern computers, offering attractive employment benefits to faculty members, and using a prominent public relations firm and law/accounting agencies. Problems between the college and the accrediting agency occurred from 1963 until  1967, when Parsons College lost its accreditation.

Study objectives were to determine: adequacy of sources and levels of support for graduate students, financial constraints to graduate school attendance by talented students, growing levels of indebtedness of graduates, and underrepresentation of disadvantaged groups in various fields of graduate study. The need for new or modified federal aid programs for graduate students, especially in the humanities and social sciences, was addressed. After reviewing the importance of graduate education and research, the following problems are considered:  maintaining a high quality faculty; the loss of talented students; and inadequate equipment and library collections. Reasons for the erosion in the graduate enterprise are addressed, including demographic shifts, the academic market, federal support, and cost problems. An agenda for federal action and 10 recommendations are suggested. Appendices include: a list of witnesses offering testimony, information on issues relating to graduate student finance, discussions of the participation of minority groups and female students, and a three-page bibliography.

Sixteen instruments were identified by departments for the validation studies. Three validation strategies were found to work best. One was a pre- and post-instruction comparison that determined if changes in student performance can be attributed to the effects of instruction. A second strategy was criteria evaluation, which involved the clarification, revision, and refinement of criteria based on an analysis of student performance. A third approach was the interrater reliability of assessor judgments, which enabled a test of reliability as well as the development of instrument criteria. Criteria evaluation appeared to be most helpful  when the instrument was being evaluated and revised. Pre- and post-instruction comparisons were used most effectively after faculty had judged the instrument as meeting most other instrument design guidelines. Interrater reliability studies were most useful when they were conducted currently with criteria evaluation. The validation studies showed that direct involvement of faculty in analyzing student performance data and probing validity questions generated a broad scope of validity issues. (Author/SW)",

The ICS technique allows students to demonstrate integration and transfer of learning in three situations: oral presentation, group discussion, and the In-Basket exercise (decision-making problems). Assessors observe and evaluate performance criteria, and provide students with feedback. In the 1970s, the In-Basket exercise was the most difficult and the most valid in terms of correlation with measures of students' cognitive development and other generic ability. Oral presentation showed mixed results, and the group discussion correlated with other measures in opposite to the expected directions. When age, background, and college  program were controlled, there were no significant relationships between the three ICS tasks and other college performance measures. Generally, it was found that the In-Basket exercise most accurately measured abilities of analysis and problem-solving. The results point to the importance of nontraditional assessment techniques, such as In-Basket, and to revision of the measure with attention to the links between group discussion criteria and the social interaction ability it represents.

The six characteristics were integration, independence, creativity, self-awareness, commitment, and habituality. Ratings on the performance characteristics were conducted on all classes during 1979-1982 as part of a program validation. Based on a longitudinal study sample of two consecutive entering classes, a single factor was found to account for 90 percent of the variance in ratings on each characteristic on three occasions.  Using the single factor, it was found that students were rated at significantly higher levels over time, corroborating the cross-sectional evidence for the developmental character of the procedure. Relationships between the Six Performance Characteristics factor and the measures of human potential revealed that the faculty were making judgments based on a general dimension associated with several external criterion measures of intellectual, ego, and moral development.

Over 750 students participated in the longitudinal and cross-sectional studies by completing a battery of 12 instruments with developmental characteristics, and which employed both recognition and production tasks. The instruments were drawn from cognitive-developmental theory, experiential learning theory, and competence assessment. Cognitive-developmental and learning style measures were  better indicators of change than were the generic ability measures, and recognition measures showed more change than did the production measures. The effects of the learning process on student change were more evident during the last 2 years of college. Students demonstrated intellectual ability and socioemotional maturity at entrance to college, and these abilities were integrated by graduation. The findings indicate that change is measurable, and that broad outcomes of college can be specified and assessed. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"Alumnae of Alverno College were studied to determine how they were learning to learn at work, how they describe lifelong learning, and what factors promote transfer of learning to professional performance and careering after college. Interviews were conducted with 32 alumnae, and questionnaires were administered to 56 alumnae and 63 seniors. Interview analysis indicated that continuation of learning was a positive value, was part of developing competence in the job role, and was valued as intrinsically rewarding. Complex abilities especially important for new job roles were interpersonal abilities learned in college. Reasoning abilities such as analysis, problem-solving, decision-making, planning, and organization also transferred to work. Most respondents viewed work through  some concept of careering, looking beyond the present job to a professional future. The cross-sectional questionnaire results revealed that seniors expect to work after college; 96 percent of alumnae sought work, 92 percent succeeded, and 89 percent found work directly related to their college major. Alumnae attributed more importance to educational goals than did graduating seniors. Older alumnae viewed analysis and self-directed learning as more important than did other groups.

The model is to be used to validate the nursing faculty's existing competence model for nursing education at Alverno College's 4-year program. The model will also provide descriptions of effective nursing performance to enable further development of learning objectives and experiences. Finally, the model will provide additional criteria for assessing student nursing performance. Interviews were conducted with nurses from agencies in different settings: acute care, long-term care, and community health. A nomination questionnaire elicited  lists of nurses considered to be outstanding. The nurses were administered a behavioral event interview to determine what they did and how they felt about work situations in which they felt effective or ineffective. Background information on the respondents was also obtained, and a job element inventory provided ratings of behaviors that are perceived as important to outstanding nursing performance. The study resulted in descriptions of nine generic abilities, which are appended. Also attached is &quot;A Generic Competence Model for Effective Nursing Performance: A Codebook.&quot; (SW)",

        "description":"Abilities or competences that ensure effective managerial performance were studied, and a model of effective managerial performance was developed. Performance, perceptions, and careering and professional development of 103 women managers and executives from 53 Milwaukee private corporations were described using a recently developed performance measurement system. In addition to the competence model, over 500 behavioral examples that can be used in instruction and assessment were obtained. Women managers were found to demonstrate intellectual and entrepreneurial abilities to the same degree as they showed interpersonal abilities. Based on factor, cluster, and path analyses, it was determined that competences are largely independent of each other but some are best learned in  sequence. For example, a manager's ability to initiate rests on intellectual skills. It is concluded that education should include learning to integrate abilities, to test them in a range of work situations, and to critically appraise one's performance. In addition, it is suggested that there are broad competences that will generalize across situations and contexts. Information is included on the study methodology and the research instruments, which are appended. (Author/SW)",

Major controversies related to the mission of public service in higher education are discussed by examining three metaphors commonly used to characterize the nature of colleges and universities: ivory tower, social service station, and cultural mart. Attention is also addressed to four perspectives on the question of how the public service mission is best fulfilled: through ideas of value, social criticism, social problem solving, or social activism. In addition, the ideal of public service is traced historically. State-of-the-art information concerning patterns and practices by major type of service is presented, with attention to community service by community colleges, service to urban communities, service to  state and local governments, and partnerships between higher education and business and industry. Examples of the following types of partnerships are provided: research partnerships; consortia; and university, industry, and federal initiatives. The question of organizing for public service is addressed, along with organizational issues of structure, policy, reward systems, and resources.

Objectives and activities that were undertaken for each of these five program areas are identified. The following benefits of the SDIP program are also identified: it demonstrated the need for remedial training; the program helped the university develop and implement a computer system; the SDIP promoted the revision of curricular offerings, including the development of a computer  science degree; the program helped improve the effectiveness of the Testing Center and the University Placement Services; and the program influenced the university to allocate permanent funding for the four program areas to be maintained after the conclusion of the SDIP grant.

The bachelor of science degree requirements are identical, except that no Western heritage courses are required and the three social science courses need not include a sequence. It was found that most of the students completed distribution requirements during their freshman and sophomore years, except that only a third completed the humanities distribution requirements by the junior year. Over 40 percent of those completing the  social sciences sequence took two courses in psychology and over half of those completing the humanities sequence took two courses in U.S. history. It appeared that nearly 90 percent of the students were taking two history courses to fulfill general education distribution requirements. It is suggested that the college needs to determine if the strong preference for history courses over other humanities and Western heritage sequences matches the intent of the general education program.

Cognitive processes discussed include task recognition; task comprehension; goal setting; planning performance; initiating, monitoring, and evaluating performance; stimulus encoding and elaboration; attentional processes; retention and retrieval of information; hierarchical schemata for discrimination and generalization; motivation; and skill integration and automatization. For motor skills, special attention is given to structural characteristics and movements; signal discrimination and  generalization; roles of sensory modes and their interactions; and patterns of skill integration. Empirically-based concepts are used throughout to provide an operational means of manipulating variables during training, and examples are given of methods for empirically assessing the roles of various processes. Conclusions indicate that the analyses could readily be extrapolated to training technology in general and to the design of training devices in particular. Selected research topics illustrate what would be involved in the extrapolation. A 22-page reference list is provided. (Author/LMM)",

        "description":"Forty-four family-oriented, prime time television program episodes (30 hours) aired in November and December 1982 were selected for content analysis from 12 commercial television series which met selection criteria for Neilsen Television rating, airing time, and theme. Family oriented programming was defined as any series with a primary theme that centered on family life with primary characters that included parent(s) and children under 18. Parental behaviors were coded that reflected performance of parental role, child rearing patterns, and children's responses to those roles and patterns. Results indicated that relatively large numbers of parenting behaviors were being illustrated in the programs viewed. Television fathers were somewhat more active as parents than were mothers,  and both mothers and fathers were portrayed in traditional ways, even though many more non-traditional than traditional family structures were presented. Television children responded differently to performance of parental roles and to child rearing patterns according to the sex of the television parent. Based on findings, several recommendations were made for parent and family life education and further related research. A four-page reference list is provided. (Author/LMM)",

Based on study findings, the following part-time faculty training needs were identified and prioritized: community college mission, instructional development and delivery, legal aspects of education, and classroom and laboratory management. Part-time faculty perceived their own need for training in these areas as lower than full-time faculty and much lower than administrators perceived part-time faculty needs to be. The training model that resulted from  the study included the following components: (1) administration of the training; (2) determination of training needs; (3) development and organization of curriculum components; (4) identification of populations to be served; (5) logistics of the training program; (6) funding; and (7) support services.

        "description":"Five issues facing vocational education are becoming sufficiently visible to suggest an agenda for community college action. First, the Job Training and Partnership Act, which seeks to address the continued dislocation of the American economy and to rectify problems of structural unemployment, will require greater cooperation and coordination among education, business, industry, labor, and government to meet local training needs. Second, since the time lag between technological innovation and commercial application of new techniques and processes is down to 2 or 3 years, new linkages with business, industry, and government must be established by community colleges to update equipment in vocational laboratories and shops. Third, vocational education must be able to provide  remedial, entry-level, upgrading, and structural retraining opportunities simultaneously in light of the prospect of technological retraining facing all Americans during their work lives. Fourth, vocational faculty will need retraining to respond to changing technologies through periodic returns to business or industry. Finally, a technologically sophisticated economy will require employees with the basic skills necessary for mastering the new technologies. To respond to these challenges, community colleges must develop delivery systems founded on technological literacy and independent learning; a competent vocational faculty to prepare the social environment for technology transfer; and greater cooperation and coordination.

        "description":"One promising avenue for increasing the utilization of institutional research data is the informal action research model. While formal action research stresses the involvement of researchers throughout the decision-making process, the informal model stresses participation in the later stages of decision making. Informal action research requires that researchers: have a fair amount of informal knowledge of pressing issues and of the decision makers at their institution; use informal communication channels; anticipate information needs before they arise; provide concise and timely data, solicited or not, in easy-to-read language; and use multiple channels for disseminating data. Three brief case studies illustrate the use of informal action research at Miami-Dade Community College  (MDCC). In one case, data on the effectiveness of immersing students in remedial work during their first term, in contrast to integrating regular and remedial courses, were used in the formulation of policy regarding mandatory placement. In the second case, a student survey focusing on perceptions of high school preparation spurred joint action by MDCC and local public schools toward improving the quality of high school education. In the final case, a student flow model was developed to illustrate to legislators and administrators the potential impact of new testing requirements. Researchers may profit from the informal model as a way to show decision makers the value of data for their deliberations. (LAL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted at Miami-Dade Community Colleges (MDCC) to investigate whether a combination of freshman and sophomore grades and student scores on the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) would be a better predictor of student academic success at the four-year level than CLAST scores alone. Since there were insufficient data to determine the predictive validity of CLAST, an analogous situation was used to test the premise; i.e., the college performance of students with high grade point averages (GPA's) from high school and low scores on the Comparative Guidance and Placement (CGP) test was analyzed. The study sample was a group of 455 credit students who had been offered the Scholar's Grant award based on their standing in the top 10% of their high school class. Of  these students, 326 scored high enough on the CGP to register for college-level course work, and 129 scored low enough on at least one of the sub-tests to be eligible for remedial course work. The performance of these two groups was compared on the basis of whether they earned an associate degree, number of credits earned, and student GPA. There was no significant difference between the groups on the basis of credits earned or degree attainment; however, a larger proportion of students not eligible for remedial course work earned GPA's of 3.0 or higher. Based on study findings, it was concluded that achievement test results are not better predictors of overall success than previous academic performance, and that use of CLAST results alone will probably lead to erroneous admission  decisions.

Introductory material provides background on declining first-time-in-college enrollments, and presents study methodology and results. Next, tables present: (1) a summary of graduation and MDCC enrollment patterns for each high school in the area for the past 2 years ordered by factors influencing MDCC headcount; e.g., whether there had been a decline in the absolute number of direct-entry graduates to MDCC, whether there had been a decline in the proportional draw to  MDCC, whether MDCC was receiving fewer than 30% of the graduates as direct-entry students, and whether the school had fewer than 400 graduates; and (2) a summary of high school graduates by geographical area and subsequent enrollment at MDCC as direct-entry, first-time-in-college students for the years 1978 through 1982. The bulk of the report consists of data on direct-entry enrollments for four geographic areas, which including the number of students enrolling at MDCC from each graduating class and their distribution by campus; the percentage of direct-entry, first-time-in-college students; and statistics for each high school in that area individually.

Next, the performance criteria for the formula, assumptions resulting from a unit cost study, and the means of funding of designated non-credit courses are presented. Then, the proposed formula (comprised of faculty, support, and travel allocations) is set forth, and a step-by-step procedure for using the formula is outlined. The following sections discuss the development of the formula and  allocations for fiscal year (FY) 1981 through FY 1983. The final sections discuss the differences between actual and projected enrollments, suggest a transition period of 3 years before the funding to a college is reduced on the basis of formula allocations, and evaluate the success of the formula in meeting its objectives and performance criteria. Appendices include data on faculty/student ratios, support per Fiscal Year Equated (FYE) student, and percentage of travel costs in relation to faculty and support costs for FY 1981 through FY 1983; an analysis of minimum staffing needs for new community colleges; and sample state legislation.

        "description":"Data on the success rates of non-high school graduates at Miami-Dade Community College (M-DCC), as determined by graduation or the achievement of a 2.00 grade point average (GPA) and 30 or more credit hours, are presented and analyzed in this report. Table 1 summarizes the enrollment of non-high school graduates at M-DCC by ethnic group, using closing term data for the full academic years 1980-81, 1981-82, and 1982-83. Table 2 provides data on the success rates of cohorts of non-high school graduates who entered M-DCC in the fall quarters of 1977 through 1980, and table 3 provides comparable data on success rates of high school graduates over the same period. The last table, table 4, provides a summary of the distribution by age of non-high school graduates from fall 1980 through  summer 1983. Highlights of the findings show that: (1) the number of non-high school graduates enrolling at M-DCC declined consistently across all categories from 1980 to 1983; (2) in 1980-81, 60% of all of the non-high school graduates enrolled were black, and in 1982-83, 37% were black; and (3) the success rate of non-high school graduates over the 5-year period beginning in 1977 was 15.1%. The report concludes that a proposed exclusion of non-high school graduates from M-DCC would affect black students most heavily and would prohibit some students from achieving success at the two-year college and beyond.

        "description":"In winter term, 1981-82, a study was conducted at Miami-Dade Community College (MDCC) to ascertain the effect of a low-cost intervention on the retention rate of full-time, first-time-in-college, black students at the college. The intervention consisted of two successive letters encouraging students to re-enroll and obtain counseling services if they were experiencing problems. These letters were mailed to 284 of the 569 students in the defined population, and analyses were conducted to determine whether the students who received the intervention letters had a higher retention rate than those who did not. Though students receiving the letters had a 5% higher return rate than the students not receiving the letters, the difference in retention rates was not statistically  significant, and further examination was warranted. In winter 1982-83, a replication of the original study revealed that students who did not receive the letters had a 3% greater rate of return than the students who did receive the letters. Conclusions from the study indicated that the differences between the two groups were not the result of the intervention strategy, and it was recommended that this type of intervention program be discontinued. The intervention letters are appended. (HB)",

First, background is presented on the historical development of the community college; forces contributing to the rise of higher education and the emergence of junior colleges; and the expansion of the role of two-year colleges to include community services and remedial education in addition to transfer, occupational, and postsecondary terminal programs. This section also analyzes forces affecting community college growth over the past four decades, including increased educational access, the student consumerism movement, the increasing enrollment of part-time students, and the absorption by community colleges of the educational functions of other agencies. The next section  looks at community college faculty, providing information on their educational background and professional involvement in contrast to their four-year college counterparts; the faculty union movement; and factors such as long working hours and underprepared students which erode faculty job satisfaction. Curriculum and instruction in the community college are discussed next, with particular focus on transfer, occupational, and community service curricula. The paper examines the dilemma faced by college leaders attempting to maintain their institution's place in graded education, while providing a variety of educative services to their constituents on an open-door basis. A number of tables conclude the paper. (LAL)",

        "description":"An experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that the remediation of negative emotion will be most effective when the remedial procedure matches the experience or cognition that induced the negative state. Other hypotheses examined were (1) that negative states induced by cognitive reflection related to the self would be resistant to remediation and (2) that changes in emotional expressions may make it appear that a negative state has been effectively remediated when lingering effects on behavior and cognition indicate otherwise. Negative emotional states were induced in 150 second-grade children by one of four processes involving social rejection content: cognition that focused on the self (thinking about being rejected) or a peer (thinking about a peer's being rejected)  or experience relating to the self (actually being rejected) or to a peer (observing a peer being rejected). These processes were followed by a positive remedial induction (social acceptance) whose process did or did not match that of the negative induction. Except for negative self-cognitions, it was found that the behavioral and cognitive consequences of negative emotion were alleviated when the positive remediation was of the same type as the original induction. Regardless of their type, emotional expressions were consistently positive following remediation. (Results are discussed in terms of differing processes for maintaining negative emotion as a function of the character of induction, and implications for understanding clinical depression in children are noted.)

In the first study, subjects ranging in school entrance age from 57 to 68 months were drawn from five elementary schools in an urban lower socioeconomic area. A total of 114 nonrepeating kindergarten children were administered (1) cost-effective, highly reliable screening tests at the beginning of the kindergarten year and (2) several measures of academic performance at the end of the kindergarten and first-grade years. While first-grade testing involved subsamples, end-of-year promotion decisions were obtained for all children in the sample. The second study, a replication of the first, was similarly  designed but included additional children from one middle class school. Some measures of school readiness were retained, some were excluded, and other measures were used. In the third study, interviews to determine the effect of background factors influencing school achievement were conducted with parents of 40 children in the replication study who were between 57 and 59 months old at kindergarten entry. Results of all three studies suggested that raising entrance age is likely to be less productive than initiating a psychometrically based screening program supplemented by intervention geared to the needs of the failure-prone child.

Results also confirm that concern and anger about such conditions and their potential consequences are widespread among staff, as is the need for appropriate training and resource materials to deal with such hazards. The study uncovered a startling prevalence of hazards originally thought to be of little immediate concern, such as the on-site use of chemicals and pesticides. In addition to identifying major hazards in the work environment, respondents were also asked for data on current organizational policy affecting on-site conditions. In general, findings  show evidence of working conditions that contribute to the physical and professional debilitation of child care staff and are consistent with previous study results suggesting that child care may adversely affect workers' health.

The report describes the background, initiation, expansion, implementation, consequences, and highlights of the projects, which included developing a maple festival; establishing a rural medical clinic; providing senior citizen housing; developing a complex to house senior citizens, a health care center, and a child development center; establishing an arts and crafts center; and providing a new library. The report notes that although the projects ranged from informal local efforts to formalized projects involving extensive outside assistance and funding,  they had the following features in common: (1) the principal actors and beneficiaries were local people and the goals represented local interests, (2) the projects were public, (3) the projects were oriented towards solving local problems with extensive volunteer participation, and (4) the process was democratic. The report also analyzes each case study for elements central to success and presents patterns of the action process including establishing non-profit corporations for community action, using communication and publicity, fund-raising and funding, coordinating the community and forming networks, and leading the projects.

The introduction gives general guidelines for tutoring and makes suggestions about how to build on students' cultural heritage. The program makes use of student tutors who receive special training. Subsequent sections outline tutor responsibilities, the student--tutor relationship, progress charts and reward systems (with sample awards and charts), and 60 ways to praise. Forms include a sample lesson plan and lesson plan checklist, an instructional needs survey (to be completed  during the initial tutor--teacher conference), an end-of-quarter report form, a sample time sheet, a letter to parents, and a parent bulletin. Move-ahead games for tutoring are discussed. A section on reading covers reading, sight vocabulary, and word analysis skills; comprehension, the Systematic Approach to Reading Improvement (SARI) system; reading rules of thumb; comprehension questions; and reading activities and games. The math section discusses computation skills; math questioning strategies; student learning objectives; and math activities, games, and ideas. (MH)",

Developed by the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, EBCE is a highly individualized, fully credentialed educational experience which combines basic skills and educational requirements with career development and community based work-experience programs. EBCE increases students' growth in academic achievement, social development, career knowledge, independence, and employability by providing the opportunity for them to try out adult work in a variety of settings and to complete structured and documented work experiences. EBCE can be a  partial or complete curriculum and can involve the strategies of career exploration, career seminars, individualized learning projects, life survival skills, career journals, and learning levels. Prior to implementing EBCE, districts should resolve the issues of flexible academic credit, coordination with paid work-experience programs, district-wide involvement, collaborative planning, migrant parent involvement, recruitment of local businesses, transportation, insurance, and collaboration with other national migrant programs such as the Migrant Student Record Transfer System.

Researchers videotaped 11 fifth and sixth grade class sessions in which Anglo teachers in Mississippi Choctaw Indian schools and Lawrence, Kansas, schools used a switchboard participation structure. Researchers recorded data with 2 cameras, one providing a wide field of view of the teacher and the class and the other recording the listener gaze of 18 students (8 Choctaw, 3 non-Choctaw  Indians, and 7 non-Indians). The video tapes provided data on student utterances, turn switching pauses, listener gaze, butting-in interruptions, individual versus &quot;choral&quot; speaking, and teacher utterances and switching pauses. All utterances and switching pauses were precisely timed, and transcribed results supported the hypotheses, showing the Choctaw students spoke individually less often, used shorter utterances, interrupted the teacher more often, and gazed more a peers while the teacher was talking than their Anglo counterparts. Choctaw school teachers had longer switching pauses, asked more questions, and used shorter utterances to ask questions of individual students. (SB)",

Most of the somewhat limited efforts to use comics and fotonovelas dealt with family planning. Generally, the efforts were not entirely successful and the quality of productions was irregular, because producers misunderstood the media forms and did not appreciate their traditional conventions and generic structures. According to the study, fotonovelas, with their visual and highly emotive quality, were more effective in reaching illiterate, semi-literate, and large audiences; had more potential  for multimedia campaigns and participatory education; and were better suited for certain distinct educational messages, especially family planning. In contrast, comic books, with their less emotive themes and more abstract presentation, were more flexible, could reach more diverse audiences, and were ideal for children and adolescents. However, comics were more expensive to produce and presented more production problems than fotonovelas. Both faced distribution problems resulting from limited institutional channels and limited commercial marketing systems in less developed countries. The study contains a review of successful and unsuccessful examples of both media forms. (SB)",

Guided by an advisory panel, phase I was conducted in 1980-1981 and covered all grade levels of the migrant program as well as parent and community involvement. It focused primarily on implementation at the district level and policy at all levels. Formative information was gathered through participant interviews, document reviews, and site visits to 13 districts chosen for a unique combination of characteristics. Summative information included state data on enrollment, policy, and student achievement, and questionnaire  responses from district level personnel, parents, and students. The study revealed a dedicated staff at all levels but an ineffective partnership of migrant and non-migrant personnel and a confusion over program ownership in many districts. The study also revealed the need for the program, especially its advocacy aspects, and the need for leadership at the state level. Respondents indicated that the program has many successes which go unheard while also agreeing that the program should be improved. Conclusions and recommendations in 15 areas are included. (SB)",

First, it deals with evaluation concepts, explaining the purposes of evaluation; pertinent terms; and the sources of evaluation in public health procedures, the scientific method, the systems approach, and General Systems Theory. Second, the paper explains evaluation criteria for postgraduate programs, noting objectives and means (such as interviews, questionnaires, and meetings), and citing five objective indicators of quality: academic productivity; quality of educational staff, students, and program support; and the relationship between the program and its environment. Third, the paper describes an evaluation method that examines a  program's requirements, support, and results and the variables pertaining to program initiation, maintenance, and outcome. The section includes seven guidelines for an evaluation procedure. Fourth, the paper discusses evaluating Master's-level Central American postgraduate programs, noting that evaluations are possible on internal and external instrumental and internal and external institutional levels. The section includes questions designed to determine the potential academic quality of a program.

Basic concepts in regionalized education and inservice teacher training are noted. Efforts in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile are briefly covered. Problems in the management of decentralized educational systems are discussed, including persistence of problems of centralized education systems, such as administrative rigidity, excessive paperwork, and strained relations between administrative personnel and schools, and also shortages of qualified personnel, inadequate  articulation between different educational levels, and lack of interinstitutional coordination and communication between different system elements. Influences of lifelong learning and citizen participation are described. The role of the school as a natural center for teacher training is noted. Characteristics and activities of a central coordinating and monitoring entity in teacher training for regionalized education are listed. Factors affecting training of middle and upper level managerial personnel are discussed. (MH)",

The second section gives six brief case illustrations depicting incidents in the daily experience of social work practitioners in agencies serving Native American communities. The case illustrations describe situations of interaction between Indian people and social  workers, then give discussion questions and a conclusion which clarifies the cultural influences shaping the situation. The third section provides an annnotated bibliography of 21 books and articles helpful in social work teaching and curriculum planning for practice with Native American people, and lists 4 sources of case studies. The fourth section lists tribal headquarters in South Dakota, including those of the Cheyenne River Sioux, Crow Creek Sioux, Flandreau Santee Sioux, Lower Brule Sioux, Oglala Sioux, Rosebud Sioux, Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux, Standing Rock Sioux, and Yankton Sioux Tribes.

Issues discussed are identification of effective cross-cultural teachers by a &quot;multiple hurdle&quot; technique; criteria that 228 teachers, 29 administrators, and 40 community members used to identify effective cross-cultural teachers; and whether effective village teachers can be described in statements that are general enough to be valid and specific enough to be useful. The multiple hurdle technique for identifying effective cross-cultural teachers by using consistent nominations by teaching colleagues, school administrators, and the local community is contrasted with standard criteria in the research literature. Methods of  collecting nominations are described, including a mail survey of teachers, interviews with administrators, and interviews with community members. Criteria that the three groups used to judge teacher effectiveness are given in narrative and tabular form, with rapport/concern/empathy cited most often by all three, followed by the quality of dedication, and with community involvement cited by 34% of administrators and 50% of community members. Concrete stories about particular teaching situations (&quot;teacher tales&quot;) are suggested as an alternative to abstract generalizations about effective teaching practices. (MH)",

        "description":"Researchers analyzed information from student records and student organizations to determine the academic success, dropout, and graduation rates of Alaska Natives at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks (UAF) throughout the late 1970's. Perhaps due to political, social, and policy changes, Native student success peaked in the early 1970's and leveled off in the late 1970's. The leveling off may have been due to the greater enrollment of poorly prepared students, perhaps a result of new village high schools. Native freshmen dropout rates declined from 87% in 1963 to 75% in1975, but the chance of success between 1977 and 1979 was still only one in three. The number of Native students completing associate or bachelor's degrees also increased during the 1960's to peak in the early  1970's. One reason for the increase was the development of field-based teacher education programs which accounted for one third of all Native degrees between 1972 and 1980. Most bachelor's degrees were awarded to Native women in education or social science; most associate degrees, to men in technological fields. Between 1935 and 1980, UAF awarded 202 bachelor's degrees, 61 associate degrees, 4 masters's degrees, and 1 doctorate to Native students. (SB)",

        "description":"This paper on a widespread nonformal American educational experience, the Boy Scouts, describes the close relationship between family socialization and scouting, and the education that occurs in three key scouting settings: camp-outs, troop meetings, and scout service projects. The paper argues that certain types of families deliberately use scouting as an educational tool, as a way to reinforce threatened family values, and to carry out a specific educational agenda for their sons. The study is based on intensive observation of boys' experience in 2 Alaska scout troops, each observed for 7 months, and on repeated interviews with 20 &quot;focal&quot; boys (boys in troop leadership roles, with several years of scouting experience; boys new to the troops who noticed the commonplace) and  their parents. Scouting education in the troop setting is seen as demanding that 11- and 12-year-old boys learn how to perform a difficult set of unfamiliar tasks: running a meeting, keeping a group together to get a job done, identifying community projects, and organizing volunteers. An analysis of these tasks as nonformal educational experiences is included. Positive reviews from scouting professionals, scoutmasters of the troops studied, and parents interested in the research are cited. (MH)",

Building from a comprehensive needs assessment by and for the District's Navajo communities, the all-Navajo school board has adopted a District philosophy, and individual schools have constructed goal statements to implement it. Retreats provide a setting conducive to clarifying and reaffirming direction without office distractions. A team management approach and democratic leadership style are used. Essential aspects of retreats are preplanning, scheduling, and followthrough. Preplanning must establish clear expectations,  with all participants contributing to the retreat agenda. Site selection and selection of the planning team are critical. Retreat products include goals and objectives developed by the board for the administrative team to implement through identification of activities and development of a work plan which indicates projected completion dates and persons responsible. Intangible results include improved collegial relationships, clearer understanding of District direction, and renewed commitment to implementing goals and objectives. Follow-through should include periodic review during the year. (MH)",

The emphasis is on programs and curricula to help new literates retain literacy skills, strengthen those skills, and put literacy to work in their daily lives. The first chapter defines illiteracy, pre-literacy, and literacy, describes four types of illiterates: complete, functional, technological, and vocational, and discusses post-literacy stages, adult education, nonformal education, rural development, use of print and non-print media, and curriculum/program development. The second chapter catalogs  post-literacy needs: literacy retention programs, second chance formal education, systematic integration between literacy and developmental objectives, and socialization for ideal societies. A third chapter, on program/curriculum design, discusses national goals, the change process, organizational design/institution building, needs analysis/community diagnosis, counselling/guidance for adult learners, program/curriculum design issues and skills, and personnel training for post-literacy programs. Technical appendices describe post-literacy work in Tanzania, India, and Southeast Asia; discuss organizational literacy for functional literacy workers and design of delivery systems for learning resources in community education; and give the project description of a curriculum/program  development workshop.

The majority of the schools (99%) had at least one microcomputer. The mean was 9.8 per school, or one computer for every 32.2 students. The schools used the computers most frequently for student instruction (especially in computer science, mathematics, and business courses), recordkeeping, and word processing. They reported that 21.4% of the teachers were computer literate and 45.4% were computer  aware. Only 25% of school counselors frequently recommended correspondence courses to students needing additional credits. Most correspondence students were \"D\" or \"F\" students. The mean number of correspondence credits allowed towards graduation was 2.7. The four most frequently offered courses in small high school curricula were typing, English grammar, algebra, and biology.

        "description":"A resource/curriculum guide developed for teachers of grades 4-6 is intended to help Iowa students learn about agriculture in Iowa: its importance as the state's major industry, its role as a source of employment and careers, and its role in meeting basic human needs for nutrition, clothing, and shelter. The guide recommends that, wherever possible, students should be given the opportunity to learn directly from people connected with agriculture, such as classroom speakers, on field trips to farms or vocational agriculture laboratories, and by visits to agriculture fairs and shopping center exhibits. Five basic elements to aid teachers are included in the seven units: a 45-item pre/post test for diagnostic and evaluation purposes; background information for each unit; suggested  activities and masters for reproduction; resource lists of materials, people, and possible field trips; and a key system to distinguish between student activities, student information sheets, transparency masters, student &quot;just for fun&quot; sheets, and teacher information pages. The units are &quot;The American Farmer: The First 200 Years,&quot;&quot;The Challenge of Farming,&quot;&quot;Life on an Iowa Farm,&quot;&quot;What Agriculture Does for You,&quot;&quot;Iowa--The Land and its Products,&quot;&quot;Eating for a Happy, Healthy Body,&quot; and &quot;A Glimpse into the Future.&quot; (MH)",

In the first unit students build miniature monuments and observe the deterioration of monuments exposed to acid rain. In unit 2 students design filtration methods for cleaning up dirty water. Unit 3 focuses on developing familiarity with marine and/or fresh water environments by promoting field trips to the shore. For those unable to visit a shore, unit 4 describes a possible field trip to a local fish market. In a look at geometric shapes, unit 5 explores the similar shapes of living organisms and mechanical devices that move  quickly through water. In units 6 and 7, mathematical skills are employed when students map their schoolyard to predict where puddles will form and when students evaluate water usage at home, at school, and in their town. In unit 8 students prepare an Irish moss seaweed extract to discover the properties of algae. In unit 9 students simulate an oil spill and later assess which clean-up materials work best. The final section gives instructions and patterns for creating an icosahedron mobile to accompany and illustrate the preceeding wet world activities. (LH)",

Section 1 provides an introduction with behavioral objectives, procedures, and useful flowchart symbols. Section 2 gives flowchart samples and in section 3, classroom procedures are flowcharted. In section 4, mathematics-related flowcharts are provided for problems such as finding an average, changing decimals to percent numbers, performing algebraic equations, constructing an isosceles triangle, bisecting an angle, and multiplying and dividing  fractions. The final section provides student instructions, a teacher's guide, room arrangement ideas, game rules, sample tests, and a gameboard for a two-day activity in which students follow a flowcharted path representing the steps that must be fulfilled to obtain a driver's license.

Leading causes for these deficits are: too little classroom time in those subjects; inadequate curriculum materials which emphasize applications, interest, involvement, and problem-solving; and the decline in numbers of qualified science teachers and students preparing for the profession. Recommendations to remedy the problem include: requiring almost daily science and technology studies for everyone in kindergarten through grade  12; development of new curricular materials and wider use of some presently available materials; inservice education, preparation, and technical support through science specialists, regional centers, and contacts in science and industry; and recruiting and retaining more competent science teachers through increased professional satisfaction, participation in curriculum development, and additional pay.

Each part focuses on a particular class of professions, with necessary training as well as the character of the work and general conditions of employment described. Parts I through V deal with five areas in which the application of mathematics plays a major role: applied mathematics and engineering, computer science, operations/research, statistics, and the actuarial professions. Part VI deals with applications of mathematics to model building in other disciplines such as social sciences and biology. Parts VII and VIII are organized around the type of employer, with the first devoted to the teaching of mathematics at all levels  and the second discussing the role of the mathematician in government, business, and industry. Part IX describes the value of an undergraduate degree in mathematics as preparation for a number of other professions not necessarily thought of as mathematical, such as business or law. In Part X, a list of references to publications and professional societies is given. (MNS)",

        "description":"A set of dimensions for describing teacher discussion style is presented in this paper written in 1963. In the task dimension, teacher style is defined in terms of statement posture (positive or negative assertion), discussion posture (teacher's attitude toward information, e.g., descriptive, analytic), statement types (value judgments or factual claims about reality), and logical or intellectual operations. The social-emotional dimension includes the interpersonal affect. Procedural dimensions include efforts to control the interaction situation, e.g., task-oriented procedural acts, deviance control. To describe teacher behavior, the authors recommend first defining styles according to certain conceptual dimensions, training teachers to &quot;play&quot; these styles, and observing what  differences occur in student behavior and learning outcomes. They illustrate this approach by describing two style models--recitation teaching and socratic teaching--and then defining some of the similarities and differences between the two styles according to the dimensions in their model. The paper concludes with a discussion of the utility of a dimensional analysis of teacher or discussion style. (RM)",

Although the unit relies upon resources available in Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia, other 18th century cities or towns can be studied in the same manner. Lesson topics include identifying elements of colonial architecture, understanding the history of colonial architecture, reading floor plans for architectural details, identifying exterior and interior architectural elements, taking a walking tour of Alexandria's Carlyle House or a similar 18th century structure, investigating modern adaptations of colonial elements, comparing architecture of  the past with present day and anticipated future styles, and designing a colonial dwelling. Goals, objectives, suggested materials, teacher guides, student assignments, and illustrations are included in each lesson. Appendices giving details for a walking tour of Alexandria are followed by a short, annotated bibliography. (LH)",

No effort was made to obtain a representative sample of activists. The five main approaches to social change encountered were represented by members of the ideological and political left, by community-organizing and neighborhood empowerment groups, and by advocates of lifestyle change, interpersonal transformation (e.g., feminism), and spiritual transformation. Among the findings are the following. There is a strong emphasis on decentralization among grass roots activists. A possible basis for collaboration between localists and globalists is their shared anti-statism. The networks created by local activists tend not to extend  beyond the state (nation) boundary. Local activists tend not to be activating, or even informing, local people about suffering on a global basis. Local activists tend to change their lifestyles so that they reflect their beliefs; the globalists do not. The localists rarely have visions of the future, compared to the global future tradition of the globalists. There are a small number of local/global activists. (Author/RM)",

After students collected the data, they reduced them to manageable proportions, and then examined average long-term relations which may have emerged among yearly, monthly, and daily values. This approach makes the study of weather and climate more relevant to students by utilizing local sources of data that students may find appealing and informative. Examples of the many figures, questions, and discussion topics that can be used in exercises to help students reflect on how the climate and weather conditions influenced the precipitation patterns are presented. For example, to get a concise summary of  the general precipitation pattern in their community, the students placed on a graph yearly precipitation values for the entire period of record. To examine possible precipitation trends, students calculated a 5-year running mean for the Macomb data. The resulting graph helped to smooth the yearly fluctuations evident in their initial graph of yearly precipitation values, making the interpretation of dry and wet periods easier. (RM)",

The first of these is to establish the conditions of the tour, including identification of the topical focus, specific destinations and sites to be visited (museums, geological sites, etc.), time available, costs, and participants' characteristics. The second step, planning the itinerary, requires day-to-day scheduling of sites and accommodations. Step three involves double checking and reworking this itinerary to account for unforeseen delays, travel times, and travel conditions. The final step, marketing the tour, lends itself to several options, from contracting with a tour  company to enlisting the aid of the university continuing education department.

Two separate and distinctive samples were used. Sample A consisted of 12 randomly chosen students from the teacher education program at a large southeastern state university. Sample B were four students selected on the basis of specific criteria from the teacher education program at a large midwestern state university. The two main methods of data collection were observations and interviews. Six major perspectives were expressed through the students' beliefs and actions. These were: social studies as a non-subject; as a means of teaching human  relations or citizenship; as \"school knowledge; as the \"great connection,\" or core of the curriculum; and as a stimulus to social action. These findings showed that the official conceptions of social studies have little to do with students' beliefs and actions in the classroom. While it is important to have clear conceptions of and goals for social studies education, it is also necessary to focus on how these goals and ideals can be manifested. (RM)",

Such studies have challenged the long standing assumptions that social and political attitudes become more conservative as people age. To extend the research on this subject, a study was conducted to determine whether, in this present period of liberal and tolerant racial attitudes, the perspectives on race relations held by older adults have also become more liberal. Data were taken from seven surveys of noninstitutionalized older adults in the continental United States conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago between 1963 and 1982. Five questions administered to all white respondents measured  attitudes towards school and neighborhood desegregation, interracial marriage, and interracial socializing. Results further undermine the aging-attitudinal rigidity hypothesis. Liberal shifts equal to those found among younger cohorts existed in all elderly cohorts surveyed. Research documenting attitude change among older persons should begin to counter stereotypes of the elderly as dogmatic, rigid people. (LP)",

        "description":"In recent years, commentators on socialization and adolescent development have suggested that secondary schools encourage students' participation in voluntary community service. This study, conducted in 1982-83 on students in volunteer programs and in comparison groups at eight high schools, tested whether such programs positively effect the social development of student volunteers. Through open-ended interviews, pre- and posttests, and a questionnaire, researchers compared volunteer and non-volunteer groups for: (1) students' sense of responsibility and concern for the welfare of others, (2) students' sense of competence in working on collective tasks and in dealing with adults, and (3) students' anticipated participation in adult groups and politics. Also analyzed were social  development in problem-solving skills and students' perceived opportunities to take responsibility and make decisions. Findings indicate that while community service modestly increases students' sense of social responsibility and sense of personal competence, it fails to bring special benefits in sense of school responsibility, political efficacy, future affiliation, and future political participation. The conclusion is that developmental opportunities offered in regular school classes may presently have more impact on social development than specific opportunities within community programs. (LP)",

At least part of the reason for this lies in the fact that policy analysis has concentrated too narrowly on economic paradigms in teaching and practice, minimizing the evaluation of consequences outside that field. To be truly effective, policy analysis should have a multidisciplinary focus, combining insights from many social and natural sciences. Greater political science input at the level of teaching and practice can lead to a more holistic, and ultimately more useful, analytical science. Such an enterprise would be concerned with a greater range of problems and solutions and assessment criteria and would be more sensitive to the needs of elected  officials and interest groups involved in the policy process.

        "description":"During the past 10 years, the patterns of degree awards in education have departed from the general trends in degree awards from higher education institutions. A decline in the number of bachelor's degrees, accompanied by continuing increases (then a decline) at the master's level, may reflect several factors: shifts in the supply and demand for teachers; higher salaries paid to teachers with graduate degrees; a shift of the preferred teacher credentials from the bachelor's to the master's level; or combinations of these factors. The large increase in doctoral degrees earned during this period suggests considerable change in emphasis within the discipline. This paper presents a profile of the discipline, as it is reflected in degree awards, and the institutions which confer them.  The profile places education in the larger context of higher education disciplines, and, within the discipline, it identifies change, stability, and current status. Data are summarized on earned degrees from a variety of perspectives, and trend information is assembled on awards by level, recipients, specialties, and institutions. While not describing the entire active profession of educational researchers, a primary source of new entrants to the discipline is considered, and the environment within which much educational research is conducted is described.

They also shared the observation sheet with the student teacher and provided a set of definitions and examples of the behaviors to be observed. Results indicated that the use of an observation instrument in tandem with a cooperating teacher who displays high ATB may increase desirable teaching behaviors.

Implications discussed in this report include: (1) The number of students expressing interest in becoming teachers is more than adequate to meet future needs; however, whether or not they are the best qualified or most committed is open to question; (2) Women will continue to make up the largest proportion of teachers; (3) Knowledge and skill in a subject area, interest in a subject area, and a desire to work with children or young adults are important factors in an interest in becoming a teacher; (4) Prestige and recognition,  working conditions, friend or relative who is a teacher, and cost of education are not important factors to those expressing high interest in teaching; (5) Higher salaries are essential to attracting people into teaching; and (6) Attempts to attract people into teaching should take into account differences in interest which may be related to gender. Copies of the questionnaires are appended. (JD)",

        "description":"Three factors tend to remove classroom teachers from any direct benefits from formal research: (1) the difficulty of replicating the exact circumstances of the study in the classroom; (2) the scarcity of research which claims to show a &quot;significant difference&quot;; and (3) the complexity of reporting, in formal research journals and reports, which tends to intimidate individuals who lack needed interpretation skills. This paper examines these problems and proposes an approach to dealing with the problems of generalizability of research findings and accessibility of research evidence. It is suggested that laboratory schools are appropriate sites under which to undertake research that can obtain causal evidence of the success or failure of new hypotheses which are directly applicable  to the real circumstances of the classroom. It is also suggested that colleges of education maintain a constant emphasis upon the value of the teacher's remaining in touch with current research. (JD)",

The goal of the plan is to teach the students to assume responsibility for their own actions; discipline is instructional, as opposed to punitive. A record is kept for each child upon which all serious behavior infractions are written. During phase 1 (1-5 behavior infractions), the teacher deals with the student directly, evaluates possible causes of inappropriate behavior, and attempts to find and reward positive aspects of the student's behavior. After three infractions, the student must meet with the teacher and develop a written plan to change the behavior. The parents are informed about the problem and the student's plan for change. If there  are continuing behavior problems (6-10 infractions, phase 2), the student must meet with the principal and school counselor and develop another written plan for changing behavior. Ten or more infractions (phase 3) will call for a meeting of the student with the teacher, principal, counselor, and parents, and the development of another written plan for behavior change. Misbehavior beyond this point (phase 4) results in suspension and work with a behavior specialist. (JD)",

Effects of the \"baby boom\" are discussed as they reflect a current general glut of teachers which may be so pervasive as to discourage potential teachers from entering training programs. This same demographic phenomenon is analyzed for its future implications; namely, that there will be a teacher shortage due to increasing birth rates. Three areas of critical teacher shortage--science,  mathematics, and computer education--are cited as problems that have no immediately predictable solutions. General migration from north to south and an apparent increase in movement from urban to rural areas is considered in an examination of population trends. Suggestions are made for developing policies which may offer promise for improving the overall status of teaching. (JD)",

        "description":"There continues to be a great deal of debate about the role that field experiences play in teacher development and about the relative contribution of various individual and institutional factors to the socialization process. Field experiences in teacher education entail a complex set of interactions among program features, settings, and people (the ecology of field experiences); research which seeks to understand the role of these experiences in teacher development must reflect, in its conceptualization and methodology, the dynamic and multidimensional nature of the event being studied. If one accepts this ecological viewpoint, then it becomes necessary to understand the influence of various interacting factors to understand the influence of any given factor. An understanding of  three specific elements of this ecology is a necessary ingredient in studies of field experiences: (1) structure and content of field experience programs; (2) the characteristics of placement sites; (3) characteristics, dispositions, and abilities of individual students and their \"significant others.\" The conceptualization of \"development\" in these studies needs to be broadened to include the documentation of actual actions and interactions and the investigation of unanticipated outcomes.

During their student teaching experience, the subjects participated in a study which measured their perspectives on the nature of knowledge and function of curriculum, the teacher's role, teacher-pupil relationships, and student diversity. Placed in different settings in their first year of teaching, the subjects were observed and interviewed to monitor their continuing development of teacher perspectives. Of particular interest was the degree to which each teacher felt free to employ initiative and independent judgment, and the extent to which each  felt it necessary to conform to expectations of others with respect to what to teach, how to teach, and how to manage the classroom. It was concluded that, despite differing institutional contexts during student teaching and the first year, beginning teachers, under some conditions, maintained a perspective which was in conflict with the dominant institutional cultures in their schools.

Cross cultural training, an aspect of multicultural teacher education, provides experience in understanding the way a culture conditions ways of learning, behaving, and perceiving, and the ability to look at cultural phenomenon from the perspective in which it occurs. If experience with cultural diversity is not available, trainees can be placed in settings such as mental health facilities, units for the mentally retarded, alcohol and drug counseling facilities, programs for the aged, programs for abused women, or correctional facilities. Each of these settings can provide a culturally diverse experience. Working in a correctional facility brings quick  awareness of the \"institutional\" culture that the inmates live in. The \"drug culture\" is in evidence in drug and alcohol abuse programs. Through working with a mental health program which is trying to establish a center for adult mentally retarded in a community, one comes in contact with societal objections similar to those resulting from having an ethnic minority family move into a different community.

Of special concern were the questions regarding the contribution of the analytical section, as well as obtaining evidence of the correlational validity of scores on the restructured verbal and quantitative sections. The reported results are based on analyses of data for 100 small departmental samples (36 graduate schools) from the fields of English, education, history, economics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, and economics. Following the descriptions of analytical rationale and assumptions, assessments of validity are based on samples of departmental data pooled by field. The results provide preliminary  evidence of the validity of the restructured GRE Aptitude Test (and selected other predictors) for predicting first-year graduate grade-point average in samples of first-time graduate students entering in fall 1978, in subgroups defined in terms of sex, and in samples of self-identified minority students.

Some Mathematics standards were more difficult for all grade levels than were the majority of reading and writing standards. In Communication Skills, only the eleventh-grade writing standard that required students to punctuate correctly,  the two eighth-grade reading logical thinking standards, and the fifth grade standard of determining the main idea of a message had mastery rates of below 70 percent.

The results suggest that a narrowly targeted program can increase enlistments by an amount that is out of proportion to the limited number  of jobs covered, and do so at a cost per additional recruit that probably is lower than that for a general program under which everyone brought in by the program may ultimately receive the benefit. Implications for future policy are discussed which provide a framework for the design of a relatively cost-effective program of military educational benefits. (PN)",

        "description":"The De Anza Reading Center is a California Demonstration Program for intensive instruction in reading at the junior high school level that was originally modeled after the successful program developed at Santa Barbara Junior High School. Operating since January of 1973, each project group receives instruction in the Reading Center for two years--as seventh and eighth graders. All students at the project grade level participate in heterogeneous classes regardless of their reading levels and abilities. The objective is to help every student become a better reader and a more responsible person by increasing the reading achievement and improving the self concept of each student. As outlined in the proposal, the project was to include 12 major components and 8 specific objectives. The  evaluation of these twenty items is contained within this report. The appendices include a parent questionnaire with parental comments and suggestions, parental interviews and comments, and student interviews and comments. (PN)",

Some of the forms would be used only by the developer/demonstrators but are included as a matter of interest for administrators and teachers. The Futureprint staff believes strongly in the effectiveness of its individualized program, and is dedicated to helping interested educators develop their own reading program based on this model.

        "description":"From a co-operative education class in an urban high school, 16 adolescent males were identified as impulsive and as high-risk based on their performance on the Matching Familiar Figures test and the advice of teachers and counselors. Students participated in 12 to 15 videotaped group problem-solving sessions (20-25 minutes in length) over a period of four months. Attrition precluded any attempt at generalizations from the results. However, two dependent measures of change in impulsive behavior were in the predicted direction and provided limited support that the enhancement of verbal mediation and attentional behaviors through self-instruction training will reduce the incidence of behaviors associated with cognitive impulsivity among high-risk adolescent male students. This  document provides an extensive literature review presenting evidence of a strong link between impulsive thinking styles and forms of delinquency and other maladaptive behavior. A bibliography of 96 citations dated from 1950 to 1982 is included. (PN)",

Procedures for estimating the parameters of the model are presented. The research objectives are to determine whether the two-parameter logistic model more adequately explains multidimensional test data than does the unidimensional version of the model, and to determine whether the results yielded by the application of the model are consistent with the results of another, more established multivariate data reduction procedure, factor analysis. The results of the analyses of the simulation data indicated that the parameters of the multidimensional model could be accurately estimated. The results of  the goodness of fit analyses indicated that the multidimensional model could more adequately model simulated multidimensional response data than could the unidimensional model. The results of the analyses of the real data indicated that the multidimensional model also more adequately modeled multidimensional real data than did the unidimensional model. It was concluded that the use of a multidimensional model does seem to be feasible, and that more research is warranted. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"This study investigated whether there were significant differences in the acquisition of oral language and reading skills among limited-English-speaking, Hispanic elementary school students receiving instruction through three different bilingual reading approaches, and what other variables might be important. The three reading approaches were: (1) teaching reading in the native language prior to the formal introduction of English reading; (2) teaching reading in the native language and English concurrently; and (3) teaching reading in English exclusively. Three groups of children were studied: 6 year olds, 8 year olds, and 10 year olds. In oral English, findings indicated statistically significant differences among the 6 and 8 year olds: students receiving English-only  instruction performed better than students receiving bilingual instruction. In English reading, the findings indicated statistically significant differences only among 6 year olds: students receiving English-only reading instruction performed better than bilingual program students. In Spanish reading, students who received reading instruction in Spanish and English performed better than those who received reading instruction in English only. As far as the independent variables are concerned, English as a Second Language (ESL) instruction and teacher training appeared to be significant predictors of English reading scores among younger children. Oral proficiency in Spanish was significant for all three age groups in Spanish reading, and was a positive predictor of oral English proficiency  among 6 year olds and a negative predictor among 10 year olds.

These images are tied to the Afro-Caribbean woman's immigrant status. As a foreigner, she constantly strives for financial security and to achieve goals which were the motives of immigration. The Afro-Caribbean woman has little time for or understanding of community activities. She develops most of her images from the media and believes that through hard work, the &quot;American Dream&quot; can be hers or her children's. Early socialization also influences her images. On arrival, she lives in poor black or Hispanic neighborhoods and has a  low-status job. These facts, coupled with exposure to the belief that the city is to be feared, lead her to fear her neighbors. Divide-and-rule tactics in the workplace often reinforce the belief that she is superior to American-born blacks. Furthermore, ignorance of American segregation patterns leads to actions which a native black might not even consider. Thus, conflicts and misunderstandings arise between native blacks and Afro-Caribbean women because each has images of the other which do not coincide with reality. (CMG)",

A review of court decisions, statutes, and agency rules shows some important advances: the bilingual provision of the Voting Rights Act, bilingual education, some requirements for bilingual notices and assistance in unemployment and public assistance matters, and some limitations on an employer's right to establish and enforce English-only rules on the job. These rights, however, do not stand on  a secure foundation.

Part II discusses two model occupational accessing programs: the Machine Trades Training Program for Youth (Cleveland, Ohio) and Career Pathways in Energy  Conservation (Boston, Massachusetts). The report describes all four models in theory and practice; analyzes termination data, participant follow-up results, and program impact; discusses cost-effectiveness; and presents employer analyses. Appendixes contain supplementary tables, information on controlling for selection bias, and a comparison of cost analysis methods. (CMG)",

        "description":"The major purpose of Project CAUSE (Collaborative for Alabama Urban School Educators) as explained in section I of this report was to get educators in the Birmingham and Mobile school systems, in the Alabama State Department of Education, and in the Appalachia Educational Laboratory to (1) collaborate in identifying and solving problems; and (2) consider research and development (R &amp; D) as a vital and practical source of support for local improvement efforts. Year 1 (1981-82) of the project was devoted to the planning and establishment of meaningful patterns of cooperation between educators in the member agencies. Year 2 (1982-83) was to have been the first of several implementation years but was the only operational year funded. Sections II, III, and IV present, in chart form, a  review of major Project CAUSE accomplishments and show that most objectives were met or exceeded. Especially significant is said to have been the collaboration achieved between the Birmingham and Mobile urban school systems. Section V (prepared by Thomas P. Ryan), provides a descriptive summary of major events of the implementation year, a tentative assessment of some project outcomes, and suggestions for a follow-up study. Together with Section VI, it provides additional insights into and implications for the development of viable collaborative relationships and/or the building of a school district's capacity to make local improvements through the use of R &amp; D information. Appendices contain minutes from CAUSE policy meetings, a summary of a CAUSE conference, policy meeting evaluation  materials, dissemination conference agendas and evaluation forms, and questionnaires for the proposed follow-up.

        "author":["Grubb, Henry Jefferson"],
        "description":"The basic tenet of this paper is that the difference between black and white children on IQ measures is not due to genetics but describes the cultural distance between the two groups. The cultural distance approach is described as an amalgam of the environmental and social psychology points of view. It holds that any subculture operating according to principles not present or equally operative in the majority culture processes functional information differently from the majority culture. Therefore, minority performance on tests based upon and validated by the majority culture will show response patterns different from the norm. These patterns are indicators of what is present in the tests that is salient to each subculture and to the majority culture. The tests, however, are not  responsive to what is salient to the specific minority subcultures but absent in the majority culture. Thus, bias is assumed to be present in all standardized IQ tests. Evidence from the United States and around the world shows that multicultural societies must, and for the most part do, interpret standardized IQ scores of minority individuals in a different light from those of majority individuals.

        "description":"This paper examines two strategies for the teaching of Black Psychology. The first strategy is designed for use in undergraduate and graduate seminars. It relies on a course structure that requires each student to complete a weekly reading assignment, to give an oral abstract to the rest of the seminar, and to write a weekly thought paper on a topical area in Black Psychology. This strategy is viewed as incorporating elements of African-American Philosophical Psychology by emphasizing oral traditions, multi-disciplinary approaches, and cooperative and collective responsibility for the teaching of the course. The second strategy is one that involves the inclusion of black psychological perspectives in the general university lecture course. The paper provides illustrative examples  for lectures on the history of psychology, psycho-biology, psychological assessment, and race relations. It is concluded that the black psychological/philosophical perspective should be included in every facet of the black scholar's instructional activities. (Author)",

The project, an overview of which is given in the introductory chapter of this report was organized into three components. The initial, exploratory study examined what scouting and 4-H leaders, youth members, and parents perceived as the important educational experiences and effects of youth groups. Well-run groups were found to provide such benefits as (1) increased contact with adults, (2) teaching of practical skills, (3) practice in formal leadership and organizational roles, (4) opportunities to practice community responsibility, and (5) increased family involvement in the education of adolescents. The  second study examined critically these perceived effects through an intensive, descriptive study of boys' actual experiences in two Boy Scout troops. Emphasized were (1) how families use Boy Scouts for socialization purposes and what boys gain from the experience; and (2) critical variables in troop functioning which influence the type of educational experience boys receive. The third study examined one youth group in a rural Alaska Eskimo village. It was found that, although organizations such as scout troops and 4-H are seldom established in rural Alaska, they can be successful if they reflect local cultural patterns (as does this group). Questionnaires used in the studies are presented in appendices. (CMG)",

The program, conducted through a collaborative effort between the University of Minnesota and Minneapolis Public Schools, provided advocacy, tutoring, counseling, job preparation training, job placement, life skills training, chemical management counseling, and recreational and cultural services to adolescents considered at risk with respect to completing high school, becoming involved with the juvenile justice system, or finding suitable employment. The services were provided through structured classes, outreach, advocacy, and direct counseling interventions. Much of the  direct service was delivered by part-time paraprofessional college students. Major problems with the Connection were related to organizational, public relations, and communication issues. However, the program received generally positive evaluations from clients and employers. Preliminary data also suggested that the program helped to divert its clients from involvement with the juvenile justice system. Unfortunately, the program's positive effects could not be expanded due to termination of funding. Appendices to the report provide client data, program summary data, evaluation materials, and financial information. (CMG)",

        "description":"The research described in this paper examined nonverbal factors affecting the education of Chinese American children in bilingual/bicultural classrooms. The purpose was to define how such variables as interpersonal distance, arrangement and use of space, pace of participants, size of groups, use of time, and interpersonal synchrony influenced the behavior and response of students. The investigation also explored associations between language of instruction and these variables, as well as the effects of variations of classroom ethnic composition. Research methods involved analysis of research films of classrooms and film interviews with people associated with the classrooms and students. Findings showed that Chinese American students responded best to situations in which there  were close interpersonal distances, a slow to moderate pace, arrangements that did not isolate individuals, and activities that involved group processes. They responded particularly well in situations with these characteristics that also involved considerable contextualization of subject matter and the use of time frames significantly longer than the American school norm. Such situations were characterized by high levels of interpersonal synchrony. These patterns were closely associated with use of Cantonese language in the classroom. Size of groups did not appear to be a significant factor, but the response of Chinese American students was adversely affected when proportions of non-Chinese students rose above a certain point.

The States examined (Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington) were selected to reflect significant regional demographic and economic differences. Although the findings, based as they are on the first year of Chapter 2 implementation, can only be regarded as tentative at this stage, certain common patterns emerge: (1) Implementation has been smooth. (2) Small towns and rural districts and those which had minimal or no funding in the competitive antecedent programs did well under Chapter 2. (3) Districts which lost  funds under Chapter 2 tended to be those with large amounts of Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA) money and/or those that had actively sought out funds from other sources. (4) In some States, Chapter 2 supported already-planned, creative restructuring and refocusing of capabilities in the State education authority. (5) There is some evidence of use of Chapter 2 funds to support long-term goals of local school districts that might otherwise have gone unfunded. (6) Some ESAA districts used Chapter 2 funds for what they considered to be more effective ways of achieving desegregation. (7) Private school participation in Chapter 2 seemed to be high. (CMG)",

        "description":"The analysis of conceptual issues related to the perception and use of knowledge by classroom teachers and school administrators in improvement programs, specifically in urban elementary reading programs, was the primary goal of this study. To begin, a distinction was made between knowledge sources that constitute the initial bases for program development and working sources of knowledge necessary for program implementation. These knowledge sources were further divided into sources external and internal to the classroom, with the latter (in the form of information about students revealed only during the teaching process) being regarded as essential to productive teaching. Field studies in four urban public schools showed this conceptualization to be inadequate. Two distinct  knowledge bases used to define programs at the different sites were identified. One, the &quot;procedural&quot; knowledge base, which was found in centrally controlled schools, emphasized the techniques of teaching and left little room for teacher or principal response to student feedback. The other, the &quot;theoretical&quot; knowledge base found in more autonomous schools, took the form of principles, maxims, and precepts about ways that teachers teach and children learn, and allowed teachers and principals to respond to student feedback. In view of the importance of student feedback to effective teaching, the growing national trend toward the procedural rather than the theoretical model raises disturbing questions about the effectiveness of programs designed to improve schooling and/or enhance  educational equity. Following the narrative, sample teacher interviews from the four schools, and interview guidelines are appended. (CMG)",

Unit 2 considers why these families chose to settle in Wisconsin, while Unit 3 describes their living and working conditions during the frontier period and subsequent years. Unit 4 focuses on the dissolution of rural communities. Each unit is followed by a summary, guide, questions, activities, vocabulary, and a list of resources. An extensive  bibliography (subdivided into sections on communities and settlements, families, migration and immigration, military history, politics, women and research methodology) is also provided. Finally, five crossword puzzles based on the material presented in the manual are appended. (GC)",

Part I discusses the rationale of multicultural education in the 1980's and the product and process phases of multicultural education. The process phase is described as consisting of five stages: (1) awareness (of the historical perspective); (2) analysis (of the school, curriculum, one's purpose in the school, and the multicultural philosophy); (3) acceptance (of redefined roles of teacher, school, and curriculum); (4) adoption (of the multicultural model); and (5)  actualization/implementation (of multicultural concepts that put the educator in the role of leader and advocate). Part II includes several definitions of multicultural education, summarizes them, and puts multiculturalism into a historical perspective. Competencies necessary for the multicultural staff are discussed in part III. Administrator responsibilities are outlined as well as the critical elements of cross-racial/cross-ethnic teaching and learning. A model for a multicultural staff development program is presented that includes needs assessment, projecting/planning, sequencing/organizing, and operationalizing and monitoring phases. The elimination of victimization, as part of this model, addresses the problems of racial, sex, age, and class prejudice, as well as prejudice against  the handicapped. Finally, guidelines are given for enhancing curriculum and staff development. (ML)",

Chapter 2 describes the original impetus for PUSH-EXCEL as arising from the Reverend Jesse Jackson's organization for social activism among black Americans and reviews Jackson's principles regarding the role of blacks in social and educational change. Chapter 3 concerns events which transformed the project into a mass program with substantial federal funding. Chapter 4 focuses on two implementation sites--Chattanooga and Denver--in which PUSH-EXCEL began in 1979, and briefly contrasts these sites with previously established programs in  Chicago, Kansas City, and Los Angeles. Chapters 5 and 6 then detail the evaluation design and the findings regarding the impact of PUSH-EXCEL on student behavior, motivation, responsibility, and achievement. Student, parent, and teacher attitudes toward the project are also described. The concluding chapter, chapter 6, discusses the project from two perspectives; as a federally funded demonstration and as a social/educational movement. Appendices include (A) project chronologies from Chattanooga, Denver, and Memphis; (B) site synopses from Chattanooga, Chicago, Denver, Kansas City, and Los Angeles; (C) a description of the Kansas City program; (D) the Los Angeles case study; (E) quantified data on PUSH-EXCEL's impact; (F) instruments for collecting interview and questionnaire data; and  (G) instruments for collecting observational data.

They present an overview of the present situation, advocate the replacement of a dominant technique by a well-structured planning process, and suggest the wide range of analytic approaches available and necessary if labor force analysis is to be improved within this process. The introductory chapter discusses the economic approach to the analysis of education's contribution to social welfare objectives, summarizes governments' rationales to justify educational expansion, examines the debate concerning the appropriate technique to appraise educational projects from a labor force development perspective, and introduces the perspective the other two  authors develop further. Chapter 2 argues that the effective management and planning of the labor force development sector is conditional on the existence of a centralized coordinating agency involved in a continuous planning process plus the increased use of cost-effectiveness analysis. The basic concern of chapter 3 is the formulation of more appropriate labor force planning activities, given a conception of labor market operation. Discussion follows of the labor market characteristics of high, middle, and low skill levels in the public and private sectors and of various types of analyses seen as most appropriate for increasing labor market efficiency.

It also determined what further research is needed to facilitate mutually advantageous interagency arrangements. The study used a dyadic perspective. An analytic model of interorganizational behavior, the Van de Ven model, was selected from the theoretical literature and used to analyze published reports of interorganizational relationships (IORs) and to design and conduct the field site study. The field site study focused on North Central Technical College in Mansfield, Ohio and its collaborative relationships with a secondary vocational school, regional medical facility, and an economic development consortium with emphasis on  training. The application of the theoretical model to the three field site dyadic relationships supported the viability and usefulness of the model. The model was useful as a tool for understanding interorganizational causes and effects in all three cases. Factors found to be important in IORs included resource incentives, interdependency, commitment, a positive climate, and coordination.

It was determined that the use of such technologies would be helpful in order to serve more clients in more locations at lower costs, especially in a time of rising travel costs and decreasing educational budgets. The technologies addressed in the study were audiotape, telephone, radio, videotext, freeze-frame, electronic blackboard, videotape, videodisc, television, computer, and computer-based instruction. The results of this feasibility study indicate that  potential clients' order of preference for a conference was (1) conference out of state, (2) teleconference in state, (3) videotape, (4) telephone conference, (5) audiotape, and (6) proceedings. Based on client preferences and the National Academy's goals for providing distance training, the following technologies were recommended for immediate adoption: a telephone lecture series supplemented with slides and question-and-answer sessions; ad hoc telephone conferences; videotapes of workshop activities and lectures; ad hoc satellite video-conferences with two-way audio for participant questions; more videotape equipment; and satellite disks to receive satellite-transmitted video conferences at the National Center.

A discussion of usage patterns includes information on influences on usage (price of labor versus capital investment, cost, interface, assembly) and projections of usage. A section on training implications for vocational education offers information on skills and training requirements and suggests that a significant demand for newly trained robotics technicians will not  develop. Chapter 3 on office automation begins with a definition and then discusses the use of technology and influences on the office automation equipment. A section on training implications for vocational education at the secondary and postsecondary levels discusses the need for word processing training for entry-level personnel and retraining needs for the acquisition of higher-order skills in analysis, comprehension, and logical thinking.

The study developed a model for evaluating vocational education R &amp; D based on legislative frames of reference for research, exemplary projects, and curriculum development. Called an Impact Tracer Model, the program is based on information and observations taken from distribution records of 308 vocational education R &amp; D products, utilization data from 12 exemplary products distributed nationwide, and impact data from 6 field sites. The five-stage model consists of needs assessment, product development, product dissemination, product use, and product impact. Some of the conclusions reached through the study are the following: (1) distribution data are easier to acquire  and less expensive to obtain than product use or impact data; (2) most research coordinating unit directors are willing and able to provide distribution data; (3) superficial data on use can be obtained by mail, but detailed documentation requires observation or interviews; (4) baseline measurements should be established when assessing impact; (5) interactive methods are necessary for collecting impact data; and (6) data on product use and impact are collected by few states at present. The study recommends that a comprehensive and continuing vocational education R &amp; D evaluation system be implemented in phases beginning with the collection of distribution data on all qualified R &amp; D products.

        "description":"A study investigated those transitional patterns that account for substantial numbers of young people moving from secondary education to employment. Data came from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972; and the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience, Youth Cohort, including high school transcripts of a subsample. Large numbers of students began postsecondary education but did not earn degrees. Often the interruption was followed by going to work. The availability of nearby community colleges led to higher attendance. Socioeconomic status, gender, and race were related to choice of pathway. Choices were also influenced by significant others, particularly parents and close friends. Few students cited high school teachers and counselors as  important influences. The choice of postsecondary education as a pathway was related to the high school experience; the higher the high school achievement, the higher the educational level the student generally completed. Outcomes of the nonpostsecondary path were predominantly lower-skilled craft and service jobs. For vocational students, postsecondary work tended to lead to professional/technical and craft occupations. On-the-job training was the predominant kind of postsecondary education. Post-high school training, incomplete pathways, and transitional decisionmaking were recommended for policy attention. (YLB)",

Study objectives were to obtain a list of occupational competencies; to rank their order of importance; and to compare opinions from robot manufacturers, robot users, and robotics educators concerning the degree of importance of the competencies identified. Responses to mailed questionnaires identified 94 competencies, 11 of which were deleted because respondents considered them less important. The remaining 83 competencies were categorized into basic skills and five job functions: operation, application, programming, installation, and maintenance for robot technicians. A coefficient of agreement statistics was used as the  evaluation criterion for determining the degree of importance of competencies identified. The results indicated a very high and significant degree of agreement (A=0.93) among manufacturers, users, and educators on the importance of all competencies. Maintenance was perceived as by far the most important job function, followed by operation. Programming and installation were tied for third place. Application was least important.

        "description":"Based upon a review of literature and on-site interviews and observations at nine firms that are recognized leaders in the development and implementation of quality of work life (QWL) activities, this report examines implications of QWL developments for future skill requirements and their potential consequences for public vocational education policies and programs. The report is not a handbook or a guide for changing current practices but is intended to provide background information to familiarize vocational educators with QWL developments in the workplace. The report focuses on two major sets of educational implications. First, it discusses the implications of QWL developments for the content and instructional processes of vocational education. It suggests that to function  effectively on high-involvement participative work settings, workers and managers not only need good basic skills and technical job skills, but they will also increasingly need improved skills and knowledge in group problem solving and in the organization and management of production. The report discusses examples of skills and knowledge in these two broad areas and examines why they are needed in business and industry. The second major focus of the report examines what new participative management techniques may do to improve the nation's schools, especially the management and organization of vocational education. The report discusses how QWL practices in industry must transfer to a better way of learning and a new high-involvement participative approach to schooling. Appendixes to the  report contain a list of skills applicable in participative work settings and summaries of the site visits to the nine companies studied. (KC)",

        "description":"This document, a transcript of a House of Representatives subcommittee hearing on a Reagan Administration proposal, discusses consolidation of existing federal vocational and adult education programs, simplification of requirements for states and other recipients participating in federal vocational and adult education programs, authorization of certain state and national programs for the development of vocational skills and basic skills in the work force that will improve productivity and economic growth, and authorization of states to consolidate funding for such programs into block grants to the states in an attempt to increase efficiency and productivity. At the hearing, testimony and a prepared statement were given by T. H. Bell, U.S. Secretary of Education, and questions  were answered by Dr. Robert Worthington, Assistant Secretary for Vocational and Adult Education. Secretary Bell and Assistant Secretary Worthington testified that their bill is designed to accomplish these four major objectives: (1) consolidation of existing vocational and adult education programs into a single, flexible program of grants to the states; (2) simplification and reduction of administrative burden at all levels of government, so that states can use more of their federal dollars to provide educational services to students; (3) enhancement of the role of vocational and adult education in assisting local, state, and national economic development; and (4) refocusing the federal role to concentrate on research, development, dissemination, demonstration, and other national  leadership activities rather than on intervention in educational decision making at the state or local levels. They emphasized that the bill would cut through red tape, streamline paperwork, permit wider discretion to the states, and make it easier to harmonize the use of state and federal funds, while at the same time preserving the emphasis on vocational education and continuing to fund adult basic education programs. (The text of H.R. 2940 is included in the document.) (KC)",

        "description":"Despite the fact that, of all the 50 states, Utah has the highest percentage of state and local government expenditures for education and the highest proportion of adults who have graduated from high school, one out of every five adults in Utah lacks basic literacy skills. At present, the following adult literacy programs offer instruction in basic skills to Utah residents: a community education program, an adult high school program, an adult basic education program, an adult refugee education program, prevocational programs at five area vocational schools and two technical colleges, and a Job Training Partnership Act program. Although no single source of authority or responsibility for adult literacy programs exists in Utah, the quality of the individual programs is good.  Serious logistical problems exist, however, in getting enough of the scattered population in rural areas together to conduct a program. An expanded adult literacy program would undoubtedly lower unemployment and raise earnings in Utah. With the state pressured to expand and improve schools and colleges, however, adult programs remain a low priority. (Eleven tables depicting program enrollment and impact data are appended.) (MN)",

In response to the need to raise the literacy levels of their personnel, the Armed Forces have paid increasing attention to literacy instruction in recent years. Whereas literacy programs once followed a master apprentice training model that emphasized decoding, recent military instructional programs focus on literacy training that takes into account the specific requirements of the job to be performed. The Navy's Job-Oriented Basic Skills Program, the Army's Job Skills Education Program, and the Air Force's Job-Oriented Basic Skills Assessment and  Enhancement System all have been based upon the actual tasks personnel will have to perform.

Faced with the many changes in the retailing industry and in the composition of the work force that have taken place over the past three decades, retail firms are beginning to question how to select better employees and how to improve worker performance. Although some remedial courses in mathematics and in communication skills do exist in retail business-run training and management development programs, remedial training is not generally seen as the responsibility of business. Instead, the retailing industry maintains linkages with educational institutions,  utilizing programs such as work study and tuition refund. Because industry's views of education have changed over the years, more information is needed about the relationship between industry's employment considerations and the development of basic skills. Possible agendas for research in this area could include examinations of the reasons for the lack of qualified persons for higher sales and supervisory positions, increased employee turnover, and employee obsolescence and declining job performance.

To answer these questions, researchers must develop a database of information about literacy needs and deficiences. Developing such a database, however, is not easily accomplished. Upon discovering that employee performance in one area is unacceptable, employers can take any one of a number of actions that would change the nature of the job in question. In addition, literacy requirements change over time as organizations themselves change. Job analysis and validation are two possible means of assessing the literacy requirements of work. Each method has  advantages and disadvantages that must be considered carefully when using them in a large-scale research project. Informal surveys of employers throughout the country indicate that the burden to improve employee quality rests mainly with the educational system. While employers are concerned about the literacy levels of their workers, many doubt whether literacy training by employers is effective. An examination of the remedial training policies of companies such as American Telegraph and Telephone suggests that, for a variety of reasons, employers are generally quite conservative about providing literacy training.

The success of the early efforts in community colleges was marginal at best, as is evidenced by a 1968 study indicating that nearly 90 percent of all remedial students failed or dropped out of remedial courses. By 1977, however, the first national study of American college and university programs for low-achieving students revealed that some programs were achieving success. A national study of college and university programs was conducted in 1982 to discover the magnitude, nature, and level of success of literacy and basic skills programs. Based on this survey, it appears that successful remedial programs exhibit the following 11  characteristics: strong administrative support, mandatory counseling and placement, structured courses, award of credit, flexible completion strategies, multiple learning systems, volunteer instructors, use of peer tutors, monitoring of student behaviors, interfacing with subsequent courses, and program evaluation. The successful programs that were isolated during the study can serve as models that document the learning potentials and capabilities of community college students. (MN)",

Before program planners and developers can remedy this situation, they must be able to obtain accurate information on the numbers of illiterate inmates and the numbers of inmates currently receiving literacy instruction in America's prisons. The establishment of an information clearinghouse and the development of standard definitions and measures to facilitate the collection and dissemination of such information would be important first steps in the effort to improve literacy instruction for inmates. Included among the many issues that must be addressed by planners of prison literacy programs are the lack of consistent federal and state policies toward rehabilitation; the lack of  adequate funds, facilities, and equipment; the lack of trained professionals in the field; and the lack of comprehensive, integrated literacy programs. On the positive side, a number of exemplary prison literacy training programs do exist. Some of the key components of these exemplary programs are development of a coordinated structure; provision of staff training in literacy; utilization of competency-based, integrated curricula; the offering of incentives for inmates; coordination between correctional and community education programs; and increased use of technology. On a daily basis, program developers and implementers must also contend with a number of problems that interfere with their operation, including disregard for the educational needs of inmates, lack of adequate referral and  support services, and lack of coordination of penal programs within and among institutions, as well as overcrowded and substandard living conditions.

        "description":"In response to the increasing number of constraints affecting adult education, South Carolina has designed an approach to adult literacy that makes efficient use of limited resources. The program, which has been designed so that it can be adapted to conditions prevalent in local communities, centers around the development of political, social, and financial support in the local community and relies on a diversified financial base that has a mix of public and private funds. While the local adult literacy programs depend heavily on volunteers, a strong management team and a core of paid staff members are also essential to their success. The final phase of the design of local literacy programs should entail a determination of the form of service delivery that will be utilized. While  the Laubach Literacy Method is presently employed by the South Carolina Literacy Association, it should be noted that several other approaches are also effective. The most important point to consider in the planning of the local literacy programs is the need to offer services that are appropriate to the needs, schedules, and social characteristics of the group to be served. Also important to the success of a program are efforts to obtain cooperative support from other community organizations. (MN)",

        "description":"Large numbers of trained volunteers working in community-based settings are needed if adult literacy programs are to be successful. In addition, adult literacy programs must work in partnership with other community organizations. Particularly necessary are formal linkage agreements with nontraditional organizations such as service and fraternal organizations; community action agencies; and religious, cooperative, and political organizations that address the establishment of literacy programs and deal with issues of funding, public relations, and human resources. In order to reduce significantly the extent of adult illiteracy in the United States, program planners must make volunteerism a national priority and must direct funding at the continuation and expansion of proven pilot  programs that serve the client. Furthermore, those communities having the greatest need for adult literacy programs must be targeted and given priority. Rather than spending money on more national conferences and studies of adult learning, planners should initiate local community conferences that would be concerned primarily with the development of local programs.

        "description":"In developing a community-based adult literacy program, program planners need to consider who the program will serve, which strategies will best serve the target population of the program, and exactly how much stability and change are to be encouraged in the program. Once the planners of a community-based adult literacy program have answered these questions, they must determine the educational strategies, management procedures, and program linkages that will be most beneficial to the program's success. In doing this, the planners must consider their options carefully and must realize their need to make informed and definite commitments to their target audience. When deciding on an appropriate balance between change and stability within an emerging adult literacy program, planners  must remain aware of the fact that while maintaining stability is a crucial aspect of the management of an organization, particularly in emerging organizations that depend upon credibility among their supporters and constituents for survival, programs that are unresponsive to their environment will not be effective and will eventually lose credibility among these same constituents and sponsors. Finally, the various individuals involved in an organization must balance their particular needs and preferences with those of other persons and with the needs of the organization as a whole. (MN)",

The special needs of ESL students from preliterate societies and learning activities for use in addressing these special needs are examined. Described next are a series of strategies focusing on meaning that can be used successfully with students who are not themselves literate but who speak a language that has a common written form. A series of activities focusing on patterns are provided for use with ESL students who are well educated in their first  language.

        "description":"Although English-as-a-second-language (ESL) practitioners are generally making good progress in teaching listening and speaking skills, the entire area of teaching literacy skills to ESL students is barely in the formative stage. The teaching of ESL is further complicated when students are not only lacking in English literacy skills but are also functionally illiterate in their native languages. Educators need to become more aware of the special problems that even the most motivated ESL students face when learning a language that is as difficult to learn as is English. Whereas many ESL programs have been predicated on the notion that students must be orally proficient before they can read English, research shows that reading and speaking can be taught concurrently. To facilitate  the teaching of reading and writing in the ESL classroom, educators should provide early and systematic instruction in areas such as phonetic spelling, writing mechanics, structural analysis, study skills, and test taking. In addition, planners of ESL and literacy programs should devote more effort to pooling the resources of smaller local programs to avoid duplication, solicit cooperation from and work together with business and industry, offer counseling services, and provide necessary staff development activities.

        "description":"Problems facing literacy education include how to attract nonEnglish speaking and illiterate adults to the programs and how to reduce attrition and increase motivation for the students who do come to the programs. One method that could help to solve these problems is &quot;community literacy,&quot; an approach to learning in which the curriculum is derived from the needs of students and in which students and teachers are actively engaged in the process of learning and community development. Community literacy could help overcome the learning barriers many literacy/English-as-a-second-language (ESL) students face, such as poor self-image or lack of relevancy of the curriculum to their lives. At present, many literacy programs unwittingly reinforce learning conflicts; for example, some ESL  literacy tests have hidden cultural and social assumptions that stereotype the learners. Instead, such materials could be changed to correspond to the actual situations and life issues that students confront. With this new student-developed material, the teacher would use a five-step inductive questioning strategy, moving from asking students specific informational questions to exploring the nature of the problem presented in the text and considering possible actions to change the situation. Because literacy is only one of the many problems adults face, other supportive services should be provided; community sites for satellite centers should be developed; in addition, literacy instruction should be incorporated into existing community programs.

        "description":"During the past 40 years, the definition of literacy and the needs of adult literacy education have changed. Before World War II, adult literacy programs usually focused on teaching totally illiterate adults to read and write at the simplest levels. Later, functional literacy at about the fifth grade level was promoted through the programs. Now, however, a reading level of twelfth grade is needed for adults to function in an increasingly complex technical society. Reading instructional materials can be classified in stages from one to five from a low to an advanced level, with one being simple reading skills such as those acquired by primary grade children, and five being more abstract reasoning skills such as those acquired by the average high school graduates. The amount of  time required for adults to pass through these various stages of reading has not been determined, but unless adults have acquired a broad general education, it takes considerably longer than the usual attendance period at literacy programs. If literacy programs are to be successful at raising the reading levels of their participants to a twelfth grade level, more research is needed on how this can be accomplished. More appropriate materials need to be developed, along with diagnostic tests for adult programs. Finally, research is needed to show the influence of cognition on reading and the influence of reading on cognition. Such research efforts can help to prepare adults for the increasingly technical jobs of the future. (KC)",

Professionals at the National Adult Literacy Project and Conference considered the problems of adult literacy education, raising eight main issues in their papers. First of all, the speakers emphasized a need to understand better the adult literacy problem in the United States. Closely related to the first concern is the necessity to understand better the need for adults to have different kinds of skills and knowledges for the future. A third issue is the need to have a better understanding of the various delivery systems for adult literacy  development, their clients, and their effectiveness. The problems of adults who must learn English as a second language raise issues unique to this population and must be considered separately from the rest of adult basic education. Closely related to the issues surrounding the teaching of English as a second language is the need to understand literacy problems in the United States by comparison to the literacy problems in the rest of the world. An issue of central concern for all of the presenters is the need to understand the difference between the development of literacy during childhood and in adulthood, while the seventh issue they raised is the need to understand better the use of technology in the development and delivery of adult literacy programs. Finally, the eighth issue  concerns the need for a clearly articulated national policy for adult literacy development. (KC)",

Chapter 4 provides the transition to the second, practical part of the monograph. An ideal, fully functioning literacy system is described that is composed of nine subsystems. The nine chapters that follow deal with planning and organizing in  relation to each of these nine subsystems: policy and planning, administrative and instructional delivery, technical support, social mobilization, curriculum and materials development, and evaluation. Each chapter describes (1) the planning and organizational objectives of the subsystem, (2) the planner system, and (3) the plan adoption system as defined by the objectives of the subsystem. Possible planning and organizational solutions are generated. A brief chapter of conclusions and a bibliography end the monograph. (YLB)",

Evidence does not support these myths. Most new jobs will not be in high tech fields, and technology will reduce the skill requirements. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that high tech occupations will grow rapidly until 1990, but the actual numbers of jobs that will be created are quite small in comparison to other occupational categories. Technology is shaping the future economy by other forces. Robotics, automation, sophistication of some technologies, and movement of jobs overseas will result in job loss. New jobs will be created by technology in production and maintenance of robots. Skill requirments will also be affected.  Reduced skills will be needed to use word processing equipment, computers, and cash registers. Educational implications from these changes include the need to increase and strengthen basic education; the need to strengthen the idea of lifelong, recurrent education; and the need to gear training and education toward adaptability and flexibility. Questions and answers about high technology, vocational education, and changes in the nature of work conclude the document. (YLB)",

During the study, researchers contacted all 50 state mental health manpower development offices and requested copies of statewide training programs, instructional materials, training needs assessment studies, and descriptions of unique training developments. Although there was little consensus about training priorities for paraprofessionals in community mental health agency positions, many states indicated that few new staff, whether professional or paraprofessional, had adequate skills for working with severely disturbed, chronically mentally ill clients. In addition, most respondents believed that two broad subject areas were  important: case management skills necessary for developing linkages with community supportive services and skills in developing treatment plans. The ways in which different states have approached the problem of training mental health workers varied considerably. Included among the training strategies adapted by different states were the following: the development of statewide agreements with colleges or universities to define the conditions for training agency workers, the use of training materials for specialized subjects geared to several levels of staff, and the establishment of decentralized responsibility for developing training programs and materials. (This publication analyzes the findings of the survey in detail and provides examples of training materials.) (MN)",

(The EJAA provided emergency supplemental appropriations to provide productive employment for jobless Americans, to hasten or initiate federal projects and construction of lasting value to the nation, and to provide humanitarian assistance to indigent persons.) The review, which examined the way that 18 different federal agencies implemented the EJAA, indicated that the agencies were generally taking appropriate actions to implement the Congressional mandate expressed in the bill. It was determined that the ability of agencies to obligate Title I EJAA funds quickly was dependent, in large measure, upon the types of programs involved, with  welfare-type, grant-in-aid program funds being obligated more quickly than funds for facility construction, renovation, and maintenance. By the end of 1983, a total of $933 million or about 43 percent of the Title I funds were obligated. Because no uniform, comprehensive reporting requirements exist for the number, nature, or duration of jobs created with EJAA funds, data in this area were incomplete. It appeared, however, that the agencies examined have generally allocated funds in accordance with the targeting provisions of the act. (MN)",

        "description":"The vocational education programs in the 14 Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) member states were examined in order to obtain an overview of the objectives of vocational education and the coordination of vocational programs between secondary and postsecondary institutions in those states. It was determined that 3.5 million high school students in the SREB region were enrolled in vocational education programs in 1980-81. While the fundamental purpose of vocational education, at least from the federal perspective, is to prepare individuals for gainful employment, many SREB member states have developed their own philosophies and directions for vocational education. Thus, the policies of different states reflect varying degrees of concern for basic skills preparation,  occupationally specific training, on-the-job and cooperative training programs, and exploratory or prevocational education. To maximize the efficient delivery of occupational training, educational policymakers and planners in SREB member states must coordinate the activities of the secondary and postsecondary sectors. The development of adequate coordination among secondary and postsecondary institutions in any one area requires that planners define articulation issues, reassess the relevancy of program offerings to market needs, and address the issues of program capacity and governance.

Federal legislation emphasizes vocational guidance and counseling programs as essential to the successful placement of individuals in careers. The Vocational Education Act of 1963 as amended in 1976 provides funding for vocational guidance programs; the Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE) provides policy direction, coordination, and leadership in this field. Vocational guidance contributes to meeting both individual and societal needs. As American jobs change, counselors can help people meet the challenge of change. In the future, vocational guidance must assume leadership to ensure that  comprehensive guidance programs, services, and activities are an integral part of the vocational education program and take an aggressive role to develop and enhance existing relationships with the private sector. In line with these needs, OVAE is providing leadership through supportive research, coordination, and various kinds of technical assistance. (YLB)",

Characteristics of the overall nursing supply are discussed in terms of marital status, age, and employment patterns. Data are also provided on nurses newly licensed to practice, males, and minorities. Projections are made of the supply of registered and licensed practical nurses. Chapter 2 reexamines two approaches for determining requirements for registered nurses: the historical trend-based model that identifies the impact of health system changes on requirements and the criteria-based model that is designed from the development of health care goals. The two sets of requirement projections are compared with four  sets of supply projections based on alternative assumptions about the number and types of graduates that might be available. Recommendations are made in chapter 3 for the role of the federal government in support of nurses training and for advanced preparation in nursing.

These variables included measures of satisfaction and satisfactoriness, several aptitude measures, and a series of demographic variables obtained from student records. Participants in the small validation effort were 96 students from a small, rural area vocational technical institute in central Minnesota in six different programs: all-female, all-male, and mixed-gender. Two questionnaires were developed for use: a student satisfactoriness (performance) questionnaire and a student satisfaction questionnaire. Results of analyses seemed to support the reliability and validity of the two  constructs, satisfaction and satisfactoriness; the acceptance of the results of the canonical correlation analysis rejected the hypothesis that no relationship exists between the two sets of variables. A constructed measure of educational adjustment was also accurately described by the relationship between the satisfaction and satisfactoriness variables on a program-by-program basis.

A key feature of the followup study planning sessions was discussion about collecting useful information beyond the minimum required for the VEDS report. An open-book database approach was adopted instead of minimal compliance with federal regulations. An operational analysis of the outcomes from the process included the organizational planning and structure that evolved from the groundwork for this project, the project  products such as applications software, and operational difficulties encountered in implementing the project (content validity, confidentiality, and access).

The project was designed to make LEP students in grades K-12 aware of the myriad of career possibilities that exist in the United States and of the possibility for persons of both sexes and various racial and cultural backgrounds to fill these jobs. Materials chosen for the program were nonsexist and multiracial. Meetings were held with parents, members of the community, and other educators to discuss the needs of students and the human resources that would be available to aid in the implementation of the program. Two types of pretests were administered. One test depicted 36 workers to be identified according to profession. The second  test, based on the New Jersey Occupational Checklist, entailed having students indicate whether only a woman, only a man, or both could do the jobs specified. When the pretests were used as posttests, the gains were significant. Using filmstrips, cassettes, games, puzzles, workbooks, texts, puppets, and dittos, the students learned that many job opportunities exist and that interests and personal characteristics are as important as intelligence and educational background when considering personal goals. Field trips and guest speakers of various ethnic heritages and, at times, nontraditional sex roles aided in expanding horizons and in bringing the world-of-work closer to the students. (Author/KC)",

Interviews were conducted with site managers and staff, students, teachers, field office staff, employers, and parents at six sites. Information on all 34 sites was also considered. The site programs were found to operate in conformity with the state model, although there were some differences in operations among sites. Activities included identification of students for project participation, assessment, employment preparation training, work experience, and supportive services. The State Department of Education's Office of Special Education was responsible for overall project management, and  the Office of Employment and Training assisted the project staff. Operational problems included unfamiliarity with the Department of Rehabilitation's eligibility criteria, lack of resources, and lack of attention to funding expenditures. Conclusions were that the projects' integrated delivery system can increase the employability of high school special education students; the extensive coordination at the state and local level was a key factor in meeting objectives; and assessment and work experience contributed the most toward increasing students' employability.

A total of 163 questionnaires were completed and returned by parents of high school students with moderate and severe handicaps. The questionnaire consisted of nine items that asked parents to provide demographic information, to rank features of vocational and day services most likely to influence selection of a program, to rank features of residential services most likely to influence program selection, and to rank generic adult service programs their children would need immediately upon graduation, five years after graduation, and ten years after graduation.  Parents overwhelmingly ranked vocational/day programs as the top priority for their children upon graduation and for the next 10 years. Long-term structured employment models providing a wide range of work opportunities and contact with nonhandicapped peers were the preferred alternative. Residential programs were more important five to ten years after graduation. Case management services were seen as important at two points in a student's transition from school to adult services: prior to graduation and as parents grow older and less able to act as their children's overseer. Data also verified the inadequacy of information for parents about adult services. (YLB)",

        "description":"A pressing problem in the United States today is that of employment: how to create enough jobs and, especially, what impact high technology will have on present and future jobs as well as educational need. Some policymakers see high technological industries as the basis for revitalizing the economy. The major challenge to education and training, according to this view, is to prepare adequate numbers of people with required high-level skills and to upgrade the present skill requirements of occupations. In this view, more, better, and more specialized education is needed. In contrast to these persons are those who predict that the effects of high technology on employment will be modest in both the number of jobs created and the skill level required, and that high technology will  downgrade skill requirements of existing jobs as well as displace workers already in jobs. Furthermore, the labor force will not require expanded science and mathematics or computer literacy but will be employed in low-level service occupations. According to this view, the relatively small number of workers who will require higher-level skills will be able to obtain them through existing higher educational channels. In our view, what is needed is a comprehensive approach enabling persons to obtain the types of education and training that they need throughout their working lives. Such an approach, called recurrent education, would (1) respond to emerging educational needs, (2) cover a wide range of opportunities, and (3) by establishing a wide range of finance and information, allow  persons to undertake a variety of educational and training experiences over a lifetime. Such a system should be a top priority for this country. (KC)",

Technology is changing all aspects of life, while work force requirements shift rapidly, swelling the numbers of workers who need to be retrained. At the same time, information technologies are creating changes in the automated office. Higher-level literacy is required for most workers in this sector. As the economy moves from an industrial to an information base, the mass educational approach designed to turn out productive workers for industry is no longer deemed appropriate. Rather, education for the future must be improved; not only must schools reemphasize the basics, they must expand the traditional curriculum to include communications, higher-level problem-solving skills, and scientific and technological literacy. Whereas  only 7 percent of this country's new jobs will be in high-technology occupations, programs to train workers for these jobs must be designed and implemented quickly if the United States is to compete in the international marketplace of the new global economy. Educators at all levels should cooperate to provide their students with higher levels of mathematics, language, science, and computer literacy skills, along with critical thinking and reasoning skills. (This paper provides information about and examples of the types of programs needed to prepare persons for the new technological jobs that are emerging.) (KC)",

        "description":"American society is based on work. The industrial revolution exposed a growing proportion of the population to unemployment, underemployment, and dislocation. Early theoreticians believed that unemployment was a temporary labor market imbalance that would correct itself with downward wage adjustments. John Maynard Keynes, on the other hand, argued that unemployment is involuntary and results from government policies that can be changed. The Employment Act of 1946 legislated the nation's intent to achieve full employment, an ideal still held. However, the only way to achieve full employment is through increased spending that fuels inflation. To date, the principal strategy for fighting inflation has been economic restraint, which results in ever-higher levels of unemployment. The  strategy proposed to correct the situation emphasizes policies that conform to the actual operation of the labor market, with a full range of anti-inflationary policies in place before attempts are made to reach the 8 percent unemployment barrier. Probably the best device above the 6 percent unemployment rate is a temporary marginal wage subsidy to create jobs. Below the 6 percent rate, strategies to improve productivity in the lower range of jobs are appropriate. To provide the training needed to increase productivity, American educational systems will have to do a better job of making sure youth acquire a high level of basic skills. However, overall economic expansion is a necessity if unemployment is to be reduced. (KC)",

        "description":"Retirement is a phenomenon of contemporary, industrialized nations. Retirement, which may be either voluntary or forced, generally refers to that phase in life when full-time, paid employment ceases. Depending on individual circumstances, it may be viewed as either a positive or negative event. Retirement planning and preparation are key factors in developing favorable attitudes toward retirement. Demographic, economic, and social changes which will have an effect on retirement in the future include an increase in the number of elderly, an increase in life expectancy, the need for elderly persons to earn money, and the changing work and career roles of women. Retirement planning refers to those activities which help individuals make decisions about their retirement. Areas of  concern which are covered in retirement preparation programs include: finance, interpersonal relationships, self-concept, physical changes, and life-style changes. Potential benefits of retirement planning include: a better understanding of normal changes which occur as a result of aging and retirement, interpersonal communication skills and a feeling of control over the future, a personal plan for retirement, a positive attitude, and successful adjustment.

        "description":"The school dropout problem among American Indian youths is severe and complicated by the heterogeneous nature of the population and its unique social, cultural, and political history. To investigate the educational experiences of high risk Navajo youths in the areas of language minority status, traditionalism, critical markers, distance to school, and future orientation, 24 adolescents (13 males, 11 females), representing three subgroups: high school dropouts (N=6); high school seniors with no future educational plans (N=9); and college bound high school seniors (N=9), were interviewed. Interview topics included family, school history, language profiles, socialization experiences, perceptions, future plans, and work history. School and community records were also obtained. An  analysis of the results showed that students whose families encouraged the development of English appeared to be more likely to do well in school and to graduate. Successful youths came from moderate homes that valued many of the Navajo traditions while adhering to many modern notions. Dropouts perceived themselves as more contemporary. In studying critical markers, student record keeping was found to be lacking as students moved between schools, making identification and planning for &quot;high risk&quot; students difficult. Distance to school and transportation problems affected school attendance, motivation, and the ability to go to school and to keep up with school work. Finally, college bound students had concrete future goals and plans, while graduates had some future goals and plans.  Dropouts had little future orientation and no plans to improve their unemployment status. (Case studies of the six dropouts present a qualitative picture of the research findings.) (BL)",

        "description":"Relocation of dual career families often translates into career advancement for the spouse whose job prospects initiate the move and career disruption for the spouse who follows. To describe the relocation concerns of men and women in dual career marriages, 32 professional couples were interviewed. Half the sample were black and half were white, and childless couples as well as parents were included. Results showed that a move was initiated by a job offer for the husband for 13 of the couples, by a job offer for the wife for 4 couples, and by offers for both spouses for 2 couples. Of the 13 wives who moved in response to their husband's job offer, 6 had difficulty finding work, 3 saw the move as emotionally uprooting, and 3 had no problems. Husbands did not always acknowledge the  extent of the problems experienced by their wives. No differences attributed to race were found for job moves determined by husbands or wives, or in the degree of empathy for the dislocated spouse. The findings suggest that wives disproportionately experience disruption, and their husbands tend to lack empathy. (JAC)",

        "description":"The psychology of personality has always attempted to define the individual in relation to normative data. However, personality theory should be attempting to define individuals from an interactive measurement model, examining the individual in terms of his own subjective impressions about what he does, with a conception of what he does not do. Using a dialectical model, the reasoning process by which individuals formulate and express subjective judgments about personality can be studied. In interactive measurement the focus is on the nature of the psychological process that generates a particular response rather than on the individual's response, per se. The subjective judgment process can be formally represented by an equation (given in the text) which allows the researcher to  quantify the subjective judgment into a given value on a + 1.00 range, representing the subject's covert judgment about a particular construct. In discerning the nature of the context for the judgment, dialectical reasoning comes into play. In making the subjective judgment the individual's mind defines the judgment's polar negations and warrants a judgment about them, thus defining the context for the judgment. Empirical research designed to test the interactive measurement model and dialectical reasoning found that, for the majority of subjects, the dialectical model was superior in defining the judgment process. (An exercise illustrating the model and implications for personality theory are included.) (BL)",

To examine the empathy level of Helsinki students and the influence of an empathy campaign on the development of empathy, 665 students, aged 11 to 18, (49 percent female, 51 percent male) were exposed to an empathy campaign. The campaign was presented according to various intensity levels from the mildest level, which consisted of a symbolic poster on the wall and a morning ceremony, to the most intensive level, which consisted of a week-long theme program planned by students and teachers. A control group consisting of 92 students received no empathy campaign. The Mehrabian-Epstein Scale on emotional empathy and teacher and peer ratings of prosocial  behavior were used as pre- and post-test measures of campaign effectiveness. An analysis of the results showed that empathy can be increased through school campaigns when the campaign is intensive, and when the students take part in the planning and organizing. Overall, girls were significantly more empathetic than boys. However, the emotional receptiveness of the test group boys increased during the campaign significantly more than other boys or girls in the control group. Positive changes were greatest in the lower grade students of the test group. The most even development of empathy took place in the group which had the most intensive campaign. (BL)",

        "description":"Research on the cognitive processes used in semantic priming has shown that the processing of a given stimulus is speeded by prior processing of a related stimulus as the result of automatic and/or effortful priming. To investigate the effect of age on semantic priming, two independent studies were conducted at Pomona College in California and at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. In the Pomona study, 64 adults (32 young adults, 32 older adults) decided whether or not a visually presented sequence of letters (target) was a word after being shown a prime. Semantic relatedness, participant expectations for the target, and stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), i.e., the interval between the onset of the prime and the onset of the target, served as independent variables. An  analysis of the results showed no evidence that older adults have a more limited ability to switch attention, or that they require more time than younger adults to do so. No age differences in the effortful components of semantic priming, nor in automatic priming at the 410 msecond stimulus onset were found. In the Georgetown study, 108 adults made decisions on target words after being shown a prime, similar to the Pomona study. The stimulus onset was varied between subjects. An analysis of the results showed that, as in the Pomona study, no age differences in priming occurred at stimulus onsets of 450 and 1000 mseconds. However, at 150 mseconds, age differences in automatic semantic priming did occur, with younger adults showing significantly more effect. (BL)",

        "description":"Although popular literature cites between 25,000 and 100,000 parental child snatchings a year, no empirical studies have been conducted to support this estimate. To determine an empirical estimate of the extent of parental child snatchings, telephone interviews were conducted by Louis Harris and Associates with a representative cross section of adults, 18 years of age and over, at 3,745 sampling points within the United States, between June and August of 1982. Respondents were read a definition of child snatching and were subsequently asked if they knew of an instance of parental child snatching in their family or in a family they personally knew. Respondents who answered &quot;yes&quot; were asked questions about the number of cases, the children involved, and how they knew of the  incident. An analysis of the results showed that 273 respondents (7.3 percent) reported exposure to an incident of parental child snatching, with 55 respondents (1.5 percent) reporting personal involvement within the previous 12 months. Projecting this rate to 83.5 million households, assuming that at least two households are involved in each incident of child snatching, and allowing for a sample error of .39 percent, there are an estimated 459,000 to 751,000 incidents of child snatching each year. Given that more than two household could be personally involved, this estimate could be considered the highest possible projection, making the 100,000 popular estimate very low. This preliminary incidence survey is useful to those trying to establish the full extent of the issue as well as to  researchers who wish to study further this hidden family problem. (Author/BL)",

        "description":"Social learning theory maintains that parents incluence sex development by modeling and reinforcing masculinity and femininity. To further examine the effects of parental modeling and reinforcement antecedents on sex role development, 103 college students (52 female, 51 male) who had been previously categorized as masculine, feminine, or androgynous, completed two Bem Sex Role Inventory Scales (BSRI), to assess perceptions of parents' sex roles, and the Parent Child Relations Questionnaire II, to obtain retrospective reports of parent behavior in terms of love, attention, casualness, rejection, and demand. Parents (N=82) also completed the BSRI. An analysis of the results showed that for both the parental modeling and behavior variables the social learning theory was only  modestly supported for females. While androgynous females perceived mothers to be more masculine than traditional feminine females, none of the parent behavior variables differentiated among the female sex role groups. However, parent behaviors contributed significantly to the prediction of daughters' masculinity and femininity. Masculinity in females was associated with the perception of accepting and masculine fathers, and attentive and masculine mothers. Femininity was best predicted from the perceived femininity and attentiveness of mothers and the perceived femininity and acceptance of fathers. In males, parent behavior was most influential in sex role development, particularly for sons' androgynous development. Androgynous males perceived both parents as loving and attentive and  perceived a high degree of femininity in fathers. The best predictors of masculinity for males were the perception of paternal acceptance and maternal affection; femininity was best predicted from the perception of femininity in fathers and affection from mothers.

To investigate the kinds of prevention information that is exchanged in households and the obstacles to effective exchange, 521 Boston parents (187 male, 334 female), with children aged 6 to 14, were interviewed. The interview focused on knowledge of sexual abuse, instruction given to children, incidence and how it was handled, and a self-administered section on respondents' childhood sexual abuse experiences. An analysis of the results show that in spite of a surprising amount of knowledge about the problem of sexual abuse, only 29 percent of the parents had talked with their children about it. Mothers tended to discuss the subject with their children more than fathers, with  the majority of parents feeling that age 9 was an appropriate age for talking about sexual abuse. Overall, parents tended to be vague in their discussions and relatively complacent, doubting that abuse would occur to their child in their neighborhood. Further reasons for avoiding talking with their children were age of child, fear of frightening the child, and overall reticence in discussing sex. The two biggest motivators for parents communicating with children about sexual abuse were hearing about abuse that happened to someone else in the neighborhood or social network, and having been victimized themselves.

        "description":"Despite increased interest in real life problem solving with both children and adults, the question of whether problem solving is related to psychological adjustment remains unanswered. To examine whether college students' self-appraisal of their problem solving skills is related to their psychological adjustment, 671 students took the Problem Solving Inventory during a mass testing program at the beginning of the semester. Subsequently, 80 subjects were selected for additional participation; 67 of those subjects completed the study by responding to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). The data were analyzed on a scale by scale basis, as well as through profile analyses by two psychologists skilled in the interpretation of MMPI profiles. Results revealed that  self-appraised ineffective (as opposed to effective) problem solvers scored more negatively on a general index of psychological adjustment (the sum of all the clinical scales), differed on all of the hypothesized validity and clinical scales, and differed on all of the hypothesized additional scales. In addition, the profile analyses by the two psychologists suggested that the self-appraised ineffective problem solvers were less well adjusted psychologically than the self-appraised effective problem solvers, thus supporting the findings from the scale by scale analyses. The findings suggest that whereas behavioral adjustment was previously linked to the ability to cope with problematic situations, perhaps an equally important variable is the person's appraisal of his/her coping ability.

Simulations of Commons Dilemma have grown considerably in the last decade; however, the research has used small face-to-face groups to study behavior in the Commons. To compare the choices individuals make in large, indeterminant sized groups with those made in small face-to-face groups, 105 college students initially played a 1-trial dilemma game. Subsequently, groups of seven students either played a 75-trial Commons Game or discussed their options for 10 minutes (to cooperate, to exploit, or to withdraw). Both groups then played the 1-trial game again, once in a large anonymous group and once in their small  face-to-face group. Half the players in each condition could fine others for exploitation. An analysis of the results showed that players chose differently in a Commons Dilemma depending upon the size of the referent group in which the choices were made. Players chose the withdrawal option at a high level in the large group but rarely in the small group, suggesting that cooperation, greed, and the desire not to be a sucker operate in the large group, but only the first two operate in the small group. The possibility of being fined for defection did not deter exploitation nor increase cooperation prior to playing the game. After the game or small group discussion, the possibility of being fined did make a difference, suggesting that to be effective fines must be experienced or talked about  with others. Finally, subjects who played the game made fewer cooperative choices and more withdrawal responses in the large referent group than those who did not play the game. (BL)",

        "description":"Although smoking cessation techniques have been effective, few programs have long term results. To investigate the effectiveness of a tobacco dependence relapse prevention program, 123 adult smokers (51 male, 72 female) voluntarily participated in one of four small group treatment conditions (6 or 30 second aversive smoking plus skill training, or 6 or 30 second aversive smoking plus discussion control) over a 14-weeek period. Skill training focused on relaxation, commitment enhancement, and relapse prevention skills, while discussion control focused on group discussions of habit breaking and desire for change. Prior to treatment and at 3, 6, 26, and 52 weeks post-treatment, subjects reported the number of cigarettes smoked in the past 24 hours, provided blood and air samples,  and completed an assessment battery focusing on mood, anxiety, cost/benefits, withdrawal symptoms, behavior, and expectations. An analysis of the results showed that differences in abstinence rates and in number of cigarettes smoked favored the skill training condition at 6 and 52 weeks post-treatment. Exploratory analyses indicated that at 52 weeks lighter smokers (20 cigarettes per day or fewer at pretreatment) were more likely than heavier smokers to be favorably affected by the skill training condition. Subjects assigned to the skill training condition were more likely to report use of coping skills, but did not differ from the discussion condition in perceived costs and benefits of change or of smoking, or in mood dysphoria or physical complaints. Abstinent subjects reported less  mood disturbance than nonabstinent subjects at weeks 3, 6, and 26, and fewer physical complaints at week 52. (Author/BL)",

There are a number of benefits to the study of human behavior which can be accrued by carrying out research in various cultures, largely concerned with better theory development and better conceptualization of important variables. Some of the benefits include theory expansion, increasing the range of variables, unconfounding variables, and studying the context in which behavior occurs. Another way of looking at cross-cultural psychology is to look at its contributions to both general and applied psychology, including cultural influences on perception, cognition, motivation, interpersonal  attraction, and group dynamics. Applications of cross-cultural psychology include validation of employee selection and appraisal procedures in each of the cultures in which they are to be used. To reduce the negative effects of cultural differences, six kinds of cultural training have been identified: (1) information or fact-oriented training; (2) attribution training; (3) cultural awareness; (4) cognitive-behavior modification; (5) experiential learning; and (6) the interaction approach. Cross-cultural psychology can contribute to a more internationally-oriented education for college students. (JAC)",

Subjects also completed a series of smoking history questionnaires; the Self-Efficacy for Smoking Avoidance Questionnaire, to assess expectations for smoking cessation; and the Horn-Waingrow Scale, used to delineate types of smokers. Treatment involved three 1-hour  sessions, with those not abstinent at post-treatment or follow-up receiving three additional sessions. Outcome was assessed at post-treatment and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months following the final treatment session. Results indicated that positive suggestions were more efficacious than negative. Treatment was most successful for subjects who did not see themselves as habitual smokers.

        "description":"Professional competency in psychologists wishing to treat children and families is an area of considerable concern and disagreement. Three types of practitioners comprise the bulk of the problem: clinical psychologists, who lack specific child-oriented training; developmental psychologists, who wish to serve children but lack traditional clinical training; and developmental psychologists, who lack clinical training but are currently serving children. The American Psychological Association's (APA) Standards for Providers of Psychological Services recognizes the single route theory to competency, which maintains that retraining in a formal program integrating formal classroom and experiential preparation, is the only true road. Recently, however, representatives of APA and its  divisions have recognized that psychologists may become health care providers by a variety of routes, adopting a broader, three-component definition of clinical psychologist which includes state licensure, doctoral degree in psychology from a regionally accredited institution of higher learning, and a 2-year internship in a health service setting. Training deficits or competence gaps currently exist either in classroom or experiential preparation; single route theorists believe that these must be acquired simultaneously in an integrated fashion. However, many graduates of APA approved programs lack either theoretical or clinical training in developmental psychology. To ameliorate the competence gap, the credentials and competencies of individual psychologists should be reviewed and  specific goal-oriented remedial work should be undertaken. To assist in this endeavor a new organizational division within APA is recommended: the Bureau of Academic Retraining Facilities. APA-approved internship sites are also recommended, designated as Technical Uniform Retraining Facilities. (BL)",

To present this information directly to never-pregnant adolescents, an annual conference, outside of the authority structure of the school was developed in Bangor, Maine. The three primary outcome goals of the conference are to identify community resources, identify resources for school-based follow-up programs, and to encourage teens to serve as resources to their peers. The conference is coordinated by four volunteer professionals, with an advisory panel of teens and adults assisting in planning the agenda and in identifying topics, facilitators, teen parents, and community professionals for panel discussions and film  presentations. Community agencies and parents are solicited to underwrite costs. A small registration fee helps offset costs without prohibiting attendance. The organizers handle hall rental and advertising. The conference is held during school hours to maximize attendance. Evaluations of the conferences have shown that attendance increased from 180 the first year to 600 in subsequent years. Information about contraception, learning to say &quot;no&quot; to sexual involvement, and communicating with parents is consistently cited as most useful. Both films and teen panel discussions are rated highly. The focus of the conference has expanded from teenage pregnancy and sexuality to general adolescent development. (BL)",

To investigate the development of nonverbal emotional communication in young children, two studies were undertaken. In the first study, equal numbers of 5- and 11-year-old children from two schools were videotaped using facial expressions to show affective states (happy, sad, angry). The children subsequently interpreted the expressions of unfamiliar children from the other school. An analysis of the results showed that young children were able to communicate affect through facial expressions and that the interpretative ability of 5-year-old children was on a par with 11-year-old children for the happy and angry expressions of  peers. In the second study, 112 children, equally divided among 4-, 5-, 6-, and 19-year-olds, interpreted verbal/vocal and musical representations of affect (happy, sad, angry, afraid). An analysis of the results showed considerable consistency in the understanding of affective meaning in music for 4- to 6-year-old children and adults. Performance with sad and angry pieces improved from 4 to 5 years, declined between 5 and 6 years, then increased significantly between the 6 year and adult levels. The 4-year-old children were able to identify the fearful selections better than the 5- and 6-year-old children. The results of these studies led to the examination of multidimensional aspects of nonverbal affective communication between parents and children in a naturalistic setting, through the  analysis of videotaped morning goodbyes of parent-child dyads at a daycare center. Preliminary results showed that, contrary to reported differences in verbal parent-child interactions by socioeconomic status, no such differences have been found in nonverbal affective exchanges.

For these reasons the President has made the prevention of alcohol and drug abuse a high priority. And the key to prevention is education concerning the truth about alcohol. For 10 years the Department of  Education has been developing school-based alcohol and drug abuse education programs. The Department's primary goal is to provide leadership, training and technical assistance to school systems to use local resources to deal with local problems. The program has established teams of school and community personnel, supported by training and follow-up assistance, in every state and territory.

An analysis of the results showed that older adults do engage in helping behavior and that providing help to others is often the source of considerable satisfaction. Antecedents of helping behavior were health, finances, age, education, occupation, and  race, with blacks reporting more helpfulness than whites. Facets of the residential context related to helping were availability of opportunity to provide volunteer service, convenience, owning a car, similarity in ethnic backgrounds, and sense of safety and security.

Men with higher SES and those who felt they were in better health were more satisfied than their lower SES and less healthy counterparts, but overall dissatisfaction remained present. When controlling the other  variables, age was significantly and positively related to satisfaction, with younger adults being least satisfied. It may be that the problems resulting from discrimination have led black men to have low expectations for marriage; this, and other factors such as the educational and sex-ratio disparities between black men and women, may have long-lasting impact on the black family.

        "description":"Although cheating is reportedly endemic in colleges, the honor system is believed to have reduced its incidence. Cheating in a graduate, clinical psychology training program touches serious fundamental issues with academic, ethical, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and professional implications. The responsibility of the teacher is to respond reasonably and effectively to serve the students, the university community, and the public. A humanistic and responsible approach provides an atmosphere in which the students can make amends while learning about the therapeutic role and environment through their experience. In order to illustrate a psychotherapeutic approach to such a breach of ethics, this paper presents a case study in which two women graduate students were involved in  cheating on a take home final examination in clinical psychology. After two meetings with the professor, the woman who allowed her examination to be copied wrote a paper on professional ethics as her requirement for closing the breach. The woman who copied the examination studied limit setting as it applied to herself. Both women found the experience beneficial to their moral and professional development and may have gained something from their own experience toward understanding what psychotherapeutic acceptance is about.

To investigate the effectiveness of Jean Illsley Clarke's parent education program, Self Esteem: A Family Affair, on self-esteem, conflict resolution, and family togetherness and flexibility, 27 intact families with a minimum of one adolescent child were assigned to either a control or treatment condition. In the treatment condition, the families attended eight, 2-hour class sessions in which Clarke's education program was implemented. The Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES II), the Inventory of Parent Adolescent Conflict, and the Tennessee Self Concept Scale were administered to all families as pre- and  post-tests. An analysis of the results showed that the course was effective in producing significant changes in family members' perceptions. Fathers perceived the family system as more adaptable and were more satisfied with family cohesion. Average family empathy was increased, and mothers perceived less dissonance with fathers, increased empathy with fathers, and less total dissonance. Adolescents in the experimental group compared to those in the control group perceived less dissonance with their fathers. (BL)",

To investigate the correlates of client satisfaction in two counseling centers, one staffed primarily by trainees (CC-T) and one staffed primarily by professionals (CC-P), 464 questionnaires (107 or 26 percent at CC-T; 357 or 39 percent at CC-P) were completed by clients who used the centers' services during 1980-81. The questionnaire focused on counseling goals, counselor-client relationship, and reactions to the center and services. An analysis of the results showed that at the CC-P, clients were satisfied with all aspects of the services as opposed to CC-T clients who were less satisfied, particularly with the center itself. Satisfaction was strongly  related to helpfulness, personal characteristics of the counselor (warmth, action orientation, understanding, and competence) and disposition to return to counseling. At the CC-T, overall satisfaction was more closely related to perceived counselor competence. Favorable disposition toward returning to the counseling center was higher for clients at the CC-P.

To examine the effects of one educational seduction variable, instructor expressiveness, on student achievement attributions and affective reactions, four studies (2 in 1980-81; 2 in 1981-82) were conducted, in which 532, 229, 220, and 165 male and female college students viewed two 25-minute videotaped lectures, manipulated for high or low instructor expressiveness. Subsequently, the students took an achievement test on the material and completed two profiles assessing attributions, achievement responsibility, and emotional response. An analysis of the  results showed that instructor expressiveness had a consistent and moderate to large effect on student achievement across all four studies. The high expressive instructor produced a greater internal mastery orientation in students and enhanced students' confidence in their performance. The findings raise important questions about whether expressiveness affects other cognitive processes such as expectations or motivation. (BL)",

To assess the influence of unsafe actions on the attribution of responsibility for traffic accidents of varying severity, 96 college students read scenarios in which the level of unsafe driving behavior (none, drinking, drinking and speeding) and the severity of accident outcome were experimentally varied. Subjects were asked to evaluate the degree of responsibility of the perpetrator, the importance of chance, and other possible causes. The results indicated that both increasing levels of unsafe act and severity of outcome were associated with increased attribution of responsibility. Severity-dependent attribution of responsibility was apparent even in the  absence of obvious unsafe acts by the perpetrator. The commission of unsafe acts produced a tendency in the observers to attribute greater responsibility to the actions and chracteristics of the perpetrator rather than to chance or situational factors. A denial of personal similarity with the perpetrator was also found under such circumstances. (Author/JAC)",

To assess the relationship between absenteeism and traditional stress risk/buffer factors, depressogenic attributional style, depression and academic performance, 68 students completed the Internal-External Control Scale, two versions of life event changes scales, a student version of the Jenkins Type A Behavior Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and an attributional questionnaire. Absenteeism was assessed by the number of times a student was not present to turn in assignments or tests. Academic performance was determined by mid-term and final examination scores. The previously reported negative relationship between classroom absenteeism and academic performance was confirmed,  although none of the stress or depressogenic factors were significantly related to absenteeism. The findings suggest that absenteeism as a reflection of stress-related issues poses problems and solutions very different from those present when absence behavior is part of a rational coping strategy or due to low interest.

        "description":"Research in the area of social cognition has suggesed that actual stimuli don't predict later judgments and responses as well as cognitive representations of and cognitive responses to those stimuli, in the form of attitudes, impressions, or causal attributions. To identify the factors most important in predicting adolescent smoking, a 4-year longitudinal study was conducted using a sample of students in grades 6 through 12. Three major categories of factors were used: (1) proximal variables (attitudes, beliefs, intentions) from Ajzen and Fishbein's (1970) model of behavior prediction; (2) general personality and perceived environment factors from Jessor and Jessor's (1977) problem behavior theory; and (3) perceived smoking environment factors. These factors were assessed across  sex, age, and stage of smoking. The results supported the utility of a cognitive social-psychological approach to understanding adolescent smoking behavior. For adolescents who had already experimented with cigarettes, increases to regular smoking were best predicted by attitudes and beliefs about smoking as well as behavioral intentions to smoke (i.e., the Ajzen and Fishbein variables). Those who tried smoking but did not become regular smokers placed higher values on independence and had higher expectations for actually attaining independence, which may have helped reduce peer influence. In contrast, initial experience with smoking was more dependent on the immediate situational context. Moreover, adolescents grossly overestimated the actual extent of smoking among adults and teenagers.  Self-image and social image were also related to adolescents' smoking decisions. The findings should prove useful in designing more effective interventions for primary prevention of smoking among adolescents. (JAC)",

To measure the perceived strength of attachment and stress of loss of 20 typical relationships (e.g.,wife or husband, father, son, daughter, brother, sister, friend, lover, grandparents, and casual acquaintance) and to determine how these scales correlate with the actual experience of relationship loss, 469 college students assigned numbers to relationships in proportion to their perceived magnitude of attachment or stress following a loss, in comparison to a standard modulus. In addition to making magnitude estimations, 117 subjects made magnitude judgments using a hand dynamometer. Subsequently, 352 college students from the  original sample rated, on a 7-point scale, the degree to which they had experienced each of 26 emotional reactions (e.g., lonely, angry, depressed) and made each of 20 coping responses (confided in friends, formed new attachments, started to drink) to the loss of a relationship. An analysis of the results showed that subjects were able to provide consistent and reliable judgments of the strength of their attachments in these relationships, and of the stress associated with the loss of those relationships. The cross-modality matching validation was confirmed for both strength of attachment and stress of loss, indicating that subjects assigned the same magnitudes to the 20 relationships when they used numbers and when they used apparent force of handgrip. A high correlation was obtained  between the stress of loss scale and the average ratings of emotional reactions and coping responses to loss. (Author/BL)",

Included in the report are guidelines related to the fundamental mission of such centers, the level and duration of their funding, and the criteria for judging the  initial proposals and the success of the working programs. Several general observations pertinent to increasing the chances of successful operation of the centers are also discussed. These include continuing support for the disciplinary bases of engineering research by federal, state, and private sectors, recognizing that this program is an important step in solving some of the problems in engineering education, and allowing the centers considerable latitude in attaining their goals.

Air pollutants and acids generated by industrial activities worldwide are also considered. Many forests in Europe and North America now receive as much as 30 times more acidity than they would if rain or snow were falling through a pristine atmosphere; ozone levels in many rural areas of Europe and North America are now regularly in the range known to damage trees. The book is organized into six sections, an introduction and bibliography of cited references. Major topic areas discussed include: (1) signs of forest destruction worldwide; (2) pathways of pollution that in most cases are  traced back to sulfur and nitrogen oxides emitted during the burning of fossil fuels; (3) economic and ecological reality of forest destruction; (4) controlling emissions through requirements for effective technology; (5) international cooperation as an essential factor in controlling a wholesale continental pollution trade; and (6) the emerging realization of the potential economic and ecological consequences of acid rain and air pollution.

Also included were four questions assessing their perceptions of cheating among their peers. Results indicate that the majority of students cheat. Several negative consequences are identified, including harm done to cheaters themselves, the profession, and society at large. Several solutions are also proposed, including persuading students to realize the harmful consequences of cheating, assigning ungraded homework problems or assigning different problems to different  students, and closely monitoring students taking examinations. Lastly, it is suggested that some benefit would be gained from publicizing university and departmental policies on cheating, with the assumption that these policies are strictly enforced.

        "description":"Magnetic Information Technology (MINT), which involves use of magnetic techniques and materials to store information, is a critical growth industry in the United States. However, experts from both industry and academe forecast the inability of the United States to meet demand in this area. According to these experts, growth of magnetic information capacity will, in the near term, be limited not by the industrial capacity to manufacture equipment but by the availability of new basic and applied research data in all areas of MINT. Furthermore, growth in MINT will be limited by the absence of trained engineers, scientists, and faculty. These and other conclusions emerged from a MINT workshop which focused on what universities must do to address the various research needs in MINT and  on how more students can be encouraged to pursue graduate study in areas applicable to mint. Recommendations made to the National Science Foundation include requests that the agency supplement and encourage industrial support of two to four centers of excellence in MINT at universities, establish a MINT research program for single investigators, identify MINT as a national priority, encourage industrial laboratories to become more active in supporting MINT research at universities, and encourage university-industrial interchanges.

        "description":"Two conferences were held to: (1) study the decline in mathematics and science academic performance among elementary and secondary students; (2) examine the dramatic lack of participation of women, Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and others historically underrepresented in these academic areas; and (3) propose strategies to improve these situations and to influence local, state, and national policymakers. The conferences acquainted participants with findings of the recently released White House Report, \"Science and Engineering Education for the 1980s and Beyond\" and provided opportunities for them to discuss implications of the report and to generate proposed strategies for alerting others to its contents and for influencing public policies. In addition, participants heard  presentations by representatives of industry, education, science, mathematics, and engineering. Included in this report are participant recommendations, categorized according to the conference(s) at which they were generated and by their respective level(s) of impact. Recommendations focus on awareness and involvement, programs, and on resources and support. Also included are recommendations of conference presenters and of Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL) staff. One SEDL recommendation is fostering the idea that science is as much a \"basic\" as reading, writing, and human interaction. (JN)",

        "description":"Algebra word problems were analyzed in terms of the information integration tasks that are required to solve the problems. These tasks were classified into three levels: value assignment, value derivation, and equation construction. Novices (35 first year algebra students) and experts (13 analytic geometry students) were compared on the proportion of tasks completed at each level in their attempts to solve six word problems. As predicted, the novices showed greatest weakness on the tasks from the second and third levels, which required an appreciation of the structure of the problems. Consistent with this finding, novices performed at chance levels on a task that required them to identify which two problems of three were most similar. Experts performed very well on this task.  Instruction focused on the structure of the problems was successful in improving performance of a group of novices. (Author)",

Emphasis is placed on using locally available materials and making the hardware needed. In part III, students use their food dryer in experiments demonstrating the effect of drying food and the importance of using proper drying methods. They also create balanced diets from the food they have dried and compile  information about food drying for people in their community. Each part begins with an introduction and diagram outlining the major concepts covered and is followed by clusters of activities; background information is provided before each related group of activities. Each activity contains a brief introduction, list of materials needed, procedures, instructional strategies, possible discussion topics, and suggestions for further study.

Two randomized field experiments of 16 and 18 weeks' duration, respectively, compared an individualized model, Team Assisted Individualization (TAI); an ability grouped model, Ability Grouped Active Teaching (AGAT); a group-paced model, the Missouri Mathematics Program (MMP); and, in Experiment 2 only, untreated control classes. The first experiment involved pupils in grades 4-6, while the second experiment was conducted with pupils in grades 3-5. Nested analysis of variance on CTBS Computations scores adjusted for pretests indicated that in both experiments, TAI and AGAT exceeded MMP. In  Experiment 2, TAI, AGAT, and MMP also exceeded control. No interactions with prior achievement were found. Effects on Liking of Math Class and (in Experiment 1) Self-Concept in Math favored TAI.

        "description":"Although women comprise the majority of the population, fewer than 9 percent are employed as scientists and engineers. Research indicates that girls have poorer attitudes toward science, enroll less often in science courses, demonstrate lower achievement levels in science, and have fewer experiences with science materials or instruments. Among the factors identified as contributing to the dearth of girls and women in science courses and careers are social factors (role models, sex role stereotyping), educational factors (enrollment patterns, parent/teacher expectations, classroom and extracurricular activities), and personal factors (spatial visualization). This paper examines each type of factor and suggests ways to eliminate negative ones. Briefly, the effect of sex/role  stereotyping of physical science courses and careers as masculine deters entrance by, and retention of, adolescent girls. Furthermore, the lack of female role models has a negative effect, particularly on early adolescent girls. In addition, girls have fewer opportunities to develop spatial visualization skills, which may be an important factor in science achievement. However, the most critical difference occurs within science classrooms. Research shows that girls have fewer experiences with science instruments, materials, or techniques. This difference must be addressed by every science teacher to eliminate inequalities in science education. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"Educational research in Asia and the Pacific is examined from the perspective of reform in instructional content and method. Information based on speeches and discussion at a regional workshop held in Japan in 1982 is presented in four chapters. Chapter 1 explains workshop objectives, introduces participants, and presents a general overview of the agenda. Chapter 2, a presentation of patterns and directions in educational reform, is subdivided into sections on infrastructure, reform implementation, and diffusion. Issues identified include financial problems, paucity of trained research personnel, lack of coordinated research efforts, credibility of research, lack of evaluation techniques, teacher participation, and methods of dissemination. Chapter 3 outlines research strategies  related to implementation and evaluation of instructional content and methods. Issues are discussed under the categories of preparation strategies, participation strategies, anticipatory strategies, and evaluation strategies. The final chapter recommends specific actions regarding research, professional training, and strengthening of the role of UNESCO. The bulk of the document consists of four appendices which contain a list of workshop participants, individual papers presented at the workshop, papers prepared by resource persons, and a visit to a secondary school by workshop participants.

Because the topic of measurement is neglected or given improper treatment in much research work and because few national data sets containing reliable and valid data are available to researchers, attention to the technical properties of instruments used to collect data is essential for a sound empirical study in economics education. The paper begins with a study of cognitive tests. Identified are what to look for in the reliability and validity information accompanying a standardized economics achievement test. Specific tests are  discussed. The alternative to standardized tests, teacher-developed tests, is considered. Norms are also examined. Next, the author deals with affective instruments. Many researchers fail to report information on the reliability or validity of affective measures, now widely used in economics education. This measurement problem is examined in depth, and general guidance is given on ways to evaluate new measures. (RM)",

Part 1 discusses the methods and models used by the National Institute of Curriculum Development since it was established in 1975. One of its projects is to develop a common core curriculum for social and political education. The objectives and content of the new subject area, the focus of part 2, are based on the idea that man's thinking and acting are greatly influenced by society, but that he can still, for the most part, act autonomously and have impact on the circumstances of his life. The development of attitudes is emphasized. An existence-oriented approach stressing relevance and practicality is used. The six theme-areas  emphasized are: education; house, home, and environment; work and leisure; technology and society; state and society; and international relations. Part 3 focuses on course organization, discussing how social and political education fits into the overall school curriculum and examining the central questions and didactic principles on which the curriculum is based, its process- and product-aims, and course evaluation.

The first problem the political science instructor faces is materials selection. Although an overview text seems the simplest and most comprehensive tool to use in an introductory American government course, it is probably the most disastrous choice from the student's point of view. Issue-oriented readers, which generally have higher interest value than textbooks, offer the best opportunity to involve students in the introductory course. Experiential learning is also fundamental to an effective and meaningful political science  course. Projects can range from having students write letters to their congressmen, to designing and conducting public opinion polls. One effective project is a non-partisan voter information campaign for fall term. Courses which carefully and thoughtfully choose materials and active learning experiences assert the virtues and demonstrate the importance of liberal arts education. (LP)",

The I-E items were factor analyzed and, in general, replicate Collins' (1974) four-factor structure of the I-E scale. Responses to the attitude items were compared to Collins' Belief in a Politically Responsive/Unresponsive World factor.

The subjects were  instructed to &quot;think out loud&quot; while generating their solutions. A tape recorder was used to collect the protocols.

        "description":"A study sought to determine whether use of the forced compliance paradigm could be used in teacher education classrooms to influence teachers' tendency to perpetuate sex role stereotypes. Two hundred college students were randomly placed in 1 of 3 experimental groups. All students completed the Attitudes Towards Women Scale as a pretest, posttest, and post-posttest; the Personality Attributes Questionnaire measuring sex role orientations; and the Group Embedded Figures Test, measuring perceptual differentiations. At 1-week intervals, two groups wrote three short essays that espoused non-sexist positions. One group received feedback on their essays. While the three groups were similar in their initial attitudes towards women, their sex role orientations, and their perceptual  differentiations, subjects in the two groups which wrote essays reflected a significantly more liberal attitude toward women than subjects who did not write essays. This attitude change was not maintained on the post-posttest. Those who wrote essays but did not receive feedback were significantly more liberal than the control group, an attitude that persisted on the post-posttest. In this study, feedback did not promote attitude change. Counterattitudinal advocacy is one means of reducing sex role stereotypes in the teacher education classroom. Further research should explore the longevity of this attitude change and its relation to feedback and individual differences. (Author/LP)",

        "description":"A discussion of the public image and academic reputation of psychology covers three topics: general public skepticism of the field, the introductory psychology course, and undergraduate education in psychology. Public skepticism about psychology stems from: the nature of the field as one encompassing a diversity of viewpoints and theories; the input of untrained, \"popular\" psychologists; and the propensity of some otherwise reputable psychologists to sensationalize the field. While the first two problems are inherent to the discipline, the third is not, and therefore can and should be remedied. Federal funding for psychology research is adversely affected by such sensationalizing. While funding for science has been on the upswing in the 1980's, it was at a low ebb in the  mid-1970's, a condition blamed largely on the projects of behavioral scientists. At that time, the National Science Foundation was distinguished as the agency receiving the largest number of Senator William Proxmire's \"golden fleece\" awards for waste in government. Most of these awards were based not on the quality of the research but on the way the projects were portrayed to the public. The introductory psychology course, like the field at large, must also resist the trend toward the overpopularized \"fun and games\" approach. Attention to undergraduate education in psychology is extremely important. Efforts should be made not only to relate psychology courses to the needs of today's students but to teach the courses in such a way that students leave with a high regard for the field.  (LP)",

        "description":"The article discusses two interrelated aspects of computer education: the computer's potential for developing cognitive skills and ways in which the differential participation of males and females in computer experiences may lead to inequitable outcomes. The Assessing the Cognitive Consequences of Computer Environments for Learning Project (ACCCEL) has identified several aspects of computer environments which make it particularly cognitively demanding: the interactive, complex, and challenging nature of the environment; the precise feedback of information; and the possibility for multiple solutions. In addition, higher cognitive skills can be fostered by certain types of educational software and commercial computer games which lend themselves to student adaptation and creativity.  However, a gap exists between this educational promise of computers and the reality of their use in the classroom. A number of factors may account for this gap, among them teachers' lack of awareness of computers' potential for fostering cognitive skills, lack of appropriate curriculum materials, and the restriction of computers to programming and logic courses. This gap in turn contributes to the potential for inequitable outcomes. Females are poorly represented in computer courses in high schools and colleges, a fact which is attributed to both content and process of computer instruction. Equitable outcomes will be enhanced if teachers tailor instruction to the needs of the learner, guiding exploration of the computer for female students. (LP)",

It is hoped that students, after completing the unit, will not only take greater care in deciding upon a classification system to use on their own choropleth maps, but also that they will become more critical in their analyses of all such maps. Students are presented with data and then shown several ways of classifying data into groups for making maps. The classification schemes used are: natural grouping--the boundaries of each data group are located where natural breaks occur; constant intervals--the numerical range of each class is the same; quantiles--equal size data groups; and quantitative--the  use of standard deviation of the data array to set the class limits. Students must then produce five choropleth maps. After the maps have been completed, the students compare them and discuss the differences found in the spatial arrangements of the shading patterns. Diagrams containing data and sample maps are provided in the unit. (RM)",

Lipman and his associates established the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC) at Montclair State College (New Jersey) in 1974. Subsequent chapters describe the successes and problems of the IAPC programs. The Institute continues to develop curricula designed to expand reasoning skills, beginning in early childhood education with reasoning in language comprehension and followed by reasoning  skills in ethics, language arts, and social studies. It also conducts workshops to prepare teachers and teacher trainers in the use of the materials. Also discussed in the booklet are the philosophical foundations of philosophy for children and the significance of dialogue in teaching philosophy to children. The booklet concludes with an annotated listing of IAPC curriculum materials and a bibliography. (RM)",

The advantages to searching databases online include combination of concepts, comprehensiveness, multiple database searching, free-text searching, currency, current awareness services, document delivery service, and convenience. Disadvantages include cost, lack of back files, equipment problems, and the inability to browse. Databases of particular interest to political scientists are described. They are organized by the following categories: political science as a discipline; related disciplines; documents; legislative, judicial, and administrative; popular; numeric; and book. To demonstrate some of the major capabilities of online searching--e.g., searching for a  combination of concepts--sample computer search strategies are provided. The major concern about teaching and online searching is that students will not learn how to do literature searching nor learn about the major sources in the field. Researchers, both traditionalists and behavioralists, will benefit from the advantages discussed in the first section of the paper. (RM)",

        "description":"The state and status of educational knowledge can be vastly improved in two ways: by looking beyond classroom settings for potential applications, and by broadening the vision of the usefulness of educational knowledge to include other professional fields requiring the skills and knowledge fundamental in education. A changed conception of what educational knowledge includes as well as programmatic changes in departments of education are needed. Educational knowledge can be applied to educational research, program planning, management and evaluation, technical consultation, advocacy, and industrial training. Programs in education should be expanded to include such professional possibilities. For example, incorporating a research course into the education program would allow  students to consider later work in policy and program analysis; courses in educational media and computers would open the way to technology-based professions. This proposed expansion of educational programs requires considerable cooperation and collaboration on the part of the various academic departments. Great strides can be made in changing the general perception of education and teaching by realizing that educational knowledge is a commodity valuable to many fields of work and that teaching is just one of many things one might do with an education degree. In this case, minimal program changes can go far toward accomplishing this changed perception. (LP)",

Each group was presented a lesson about the geography, politics, history, and economy of the country of Botswana. The lessons were the same except for variations in the four conditions stated above. After the lesson, each group was tested on comprehension of the material, and then each group completed a lesson evaluation. Teacher uncertainty negatively affected achievement, and notes  handouts positively affected achievement. Both teacher bluffing and lesson discontinuity negatively affected student evaluation of the lesson. Several significant interactions were obtained. These findings are discussed in relation to previous research on low-inference behaviors related to teacher clarity. (Author)",

This situation, where the context of acquired information is not carefully examined as to its potential effect on the information itself, may be all too common in  ethnographic studies.

The first section describes several advantages of using fiction rather than a text to teach anthropology. Teacher and students share more or less equally in the teaching process with this approach. The teacher is no longer an authority on a subject because the teacher and students explore a novel together. With fiction, there are no right or wrong answers to inhibit discussion. Moreover, well-written fiction arouses higher interest than professional writing in anthropology. Fictionalized case studies offer opportunities to apply values, to integrate the real world with the theoretical, and to develop problem-solving skills. Teachers have a responsibility to help students  understand themselves, their culture, and their physical-biotic environment. They must also help students learn to enjoy thinking and learning. Using a teaching method that is meaningful and interesting to the teacher as well as the students, such as the fiction approach, facilitates this process. The second section consists of appendices containing practical course materials. These are: a list of \"thought\" questions, an example of a fictionalized anthropological case study, a list of group functions, a needs assessment of cross-cultural human resource training, a list of characteristics of good instruction, an outline of course goals, and a 4-page reading list.

Such approaches to international education are no longer consistent with the needs of an interdependent world. Global education, the effort to foster a world view and a realization of the interconnectedness of people, is a necessity, given the context of changes in social, economic, and political structure of the world. This approach emphasizes interdependence, diversity, empathy, multiple loyalties, cooperation, human rights, participation,  change, and conflict management. Some significant models have been developed for teaching global education, among them the curricula developed by Minnesota, Florida, Chicago, and the Longview Foundation project.

The second phase proposes to concentrate on more fully developing the academies, which are the cornerstone of both phases. These teacher education academies  will: (1) understand the content of classroom effectiveness research; (2) engage in collaborative inquiry; (3) identify the present and future staffing criteria and staff development priorities of the cooperating school districts; (4) analyze classroom instruction; and (5) apply instructional research to classroom instructional problems.

        "description":"A study was aimed at developing a methodology for describing competent classroom teaching performance and analyzing components of competent classroom decision making to be used in improving preservice and inservice teacher training programs. Information processing research suggests that expertise in semantically rich domains involves the ability to apply knowledge effectively in response to environmental cues. This study investigated differences between experienced and novice teachers in terms of: (1) their use of student performance cues; (2) their instructional actions and the relationship of these actions to student performance cues; and (3) the nature of their instructional goals and prior instruction-related knowledge. Stimulated recall data were collected on three  experienced and five novice teachers. Results showed that, while both groups attended to the same number of cue categories, experienced teachers implemented twice as many kinds of instructional actions and considered a greater variety of goals, while exhibiting more complex associations between cue and action categories.

Steps in planning and implementing a successful recruitment program are outlined in the appendix. (JD)",

        "description":"A study was made of the perceived success or failure of early field experiences prior to student teaching as perceived by cooperating teachers (CT) and field experience students (FES). Subjects were secondary school teacher education majors (n=145) and their cooperating teachers (n=34). Measures were taken of expectations, problems, and values over a period of nearly two years. Questions directed to the CTs concerned expectations they brought to the experience, problems they incurred in dealing with FESs, and help they received from the FESs. Field experience students were queried about expectations they brought to the experience and usefulness of the field experience as they decided about and prepared for a teaching career. A third question sought to determine ways in which the  diverse perspectives of CTs and FESs hindered the development of a positive field experience. A comparison was made of responses to the questions, and major factors which emerged as significant were analyzed. Potential difficulties revealed by responses are discussed in this paper and methods suggested for bringing diverse outlooks closer together. Appended tables provide data on responses to specific problem statements and comparisons of attitudes toward the experience. (JD)",

        "description":"Research studies in science education have revealed that wait-time, the duration of teacher and student pauses in questioning dialogue, is an important variable in teaching. In this study, discussion materials were gathered, from 4 groups of 10 teachers, each week for a semester. The groups were defined as: (1) comparison group; (2) instruction in effective questioning group; (3) wait-time feedback group; and (4) instruction and wait-time feedback group. Discriminant function analysis and analyses of variance revealed that the wait-time feedback groups experienced greatest increases in wait-time and exhibited higher cognitive levels of interaction in classroom discussions. Longer student answers and more student talk were also found in the wait-time feedback groups. Re-analysis  of the data separated the feedback groups into three categories: (1) those who maintained pauses of three seconds or more in several discussion sessions; (2) those who reached the three second criterion at least once in a discussion; and (3) those who were unable or unwilling to pause to the criterion. Significant differences favoring the effective wait-time group were found in the following areas: fewer memory-level, rhetorical, management, and leading questions; smaller percentage of teacher talk in discussions; and longer student answers. Eleven tables are included. (Author/JMK)",

A new format for objective testing, alternate-choice questions, was studied. Specific study project goals were to: (1) study the usefulness of a novel test-item format to evaluate student achievement; (2) increase the reliability and validity of the course's unit examinations and final examinations; (3) collect information useful in evaluating course effectiveness, student learning, and teacher performance; (4) facilitate student learning of practical and sound measurement theory and techniques  through investigation of an important measurement question; and (5) model the spirit of inquiry, impressing on preservice teachers the importance and value of experimentation with new techniques and the necessity of continuous evaluation of both new and well-accepted practices. Study results showed that Alternate Choice (AC) items were slightly less difficult, discriminating, and reliable than Multiple Choice (MC) items; that students were able to respond to twice as many AC as MC items in a given time; and that students viewed the course testing positively.

A survey of administrative officials at 777 teacher preparation institutions was conducted to examine the number and type of university-level programs designed to prepare teachers to teach sex education. Practicing sex educators were also asked how universities might better prepare teachers. Thirty percent of the 322 responding institutions offered one or more specific courses on the topic. An additional 34 percent included the material in more general courses. Comparison of this data with that from a 1968 survey showed a trend toward offering more specific sex education courses. There still appears to  be no consensus as to who should teach sex education, or what constitutes adequate teacher preparation. While practicing sex education teachers are drawn from such diverse backgrounds as music, English, and science, formal coursework is usually offered in the health education curriculum. Also, while teachers emphasize the need for courses on methods, human relations training, value exploration, and parental concerns, the most frequently cited content area in university-level courses is human reproduction.

The program, called SITIP (School Improvement Through Instructional Process), and initiated by the Maryland State Department of Education, supported local education agencies in their adoption and implementation of four research-based instructional models: Active Teaching; Mastery Learning; Student Team Learning; and Teaching Variables. Data were collected for the IL study from local educators, students, and state technical assistants in the form of observational interviews, questionnaires, and document analysis. Factors or  conditions related to the success of teachers as ILs are summarized in the form of recommendations. For a teacher to be successful as an IL: (1) implementation in the first year should be limited to the teacher's school; (2) ILs should be given sufficient time to plan and develop enough materials for a complete course before implementation begins; (3) the IL should be involved from the initial phases of planning and training; (4) IL expertise in the instructional model is necessary; (5) IL leadership style should be democratic; (6) the two key tasks of the IL are training and coaching other teachers in the innovation; and (7) administrative support is essential for IL success.

        "description":"The &quot;componential&quot; theory of intelligence explains intelligence in terms of three types of component processes that make up intelligent performance. The first of these, &quot;metacomponents,&quot; are the higher-order or executive processes that one uses to plan what one is going to do, monitor what one is doing, and evaluate what one has done. The second type of process is the &quot;performance&quot; component. While &quot;metacomponents&quot; decide what to do, &quot;performance&quot; components actually do it. The third type of process is the &quot;knowledge-acquisition&quot; component. Processes of this kind are used in learning new material. If intelligence can be broken down into this set of underlying processes and strategies for combining these processes, it is possible to intervene at the level of the mental process,  teach individuals what processes to use, when and how to use them, and how to combine them into workable strategies for task solution. Three programs that train aspects of intelligence as specified by the &quot;componential&quot; theory are reviewed: (1) Feuerstein's &quot;Instrumental Enrichment&quot;; (2) Lipman's &quot;Philosophy for Children&quot;; and (3) &quot;Chicago Mastery Learning: Reading.&quot; General remarks and suggestions about adaptation of an intellectual or thinking skills training program are presented. General guidelines that can be applied to selection of programs are offered. (JD)",

Although research does not yet permit unequivocal generalizations about effects, existing research is promising, especially when compared with research on effects of work experience per se. Positive effects include student, teacher, and community supervisor enthusiasm, feelings of self-efficacy and social efficacy, and increased knowledge about the domain in which the experience occurs. Assuring effective programs appears to depend most upon: (1) clarifying and prioritizing objectives; (2) communicating objectives and priorities to all concerned; (3) adapting and localizing successful efforts of others; (4) providing adequate time for planning and pilot  efforts; (5) providing resources to impart knowledge and skills to school and community-based facilitators; (6) providing follow-through; (7) involving young people in serious working relationships with adults and peers; (8) designing programs to respond to genuine needs; (9) mounting efforts with visible results; (10) including opportunities for serious analysis and reflection; (11) providing &quot;hands-on&quot; experience and skill-training keyed to student needs and abilities; and (12) assessing student progress flexibly.

The primary question was &quot;Does a teacher use a systematic decision model?&quot; The three secondary questions were: (1) Does this teacher make preactive and interactive decisions? (2) What governs this teacher's decisions? and (3) What is the interaction between this teacher's decision making and the need to maintain activity flow? The study discovered that the teacher used a six-phase decision model that integrates preactive and interactive decisions. It was also found that: (1) a set of conscious assumptions governed the teacher's decisions; (2) smooth activity flow was essential for her success; and (3) she taught the  pupils to be responsible for their own behavior. Each step of the six-phase decision model is described in detail. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"Effective schools research has delivered some relatively concrete findings on important issues facing this country's educators. The result has been an extensive collection of effective schooling practices which have potential for increasing performance in young people. In reviewing effective schools literature, implications of the data were found to include a clear and direct relationship between student achievement and self-concept--the affective domain was found to be a critical component of school improvement efforts. This paper looks at the affective domain as it relates to effective schools; more specifically, it explores student self-concept and teacher expectations and attitudes as dependent variables in instructional settings. Student and teacher behaviors as predictors  of school success are critically examined. Included in the analysis are factors of school and classroom climate. The paper concludes with recommendations that will move the findings toward implementation; that is, how to improve teacher expectations and attitudes and how to build positive and realistic self-concepts in students. Four appendices are included: (1) Flanders' Interaction Analysis; (2) The Metfessel, Michael and Kirsner Instrumentation of Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives; (3) Carkhuff's Interpersonal Process Scales; and (4) some common self-report inventories.

First, the trauma created by abuse and neglect is as much a detriment to learning as is a perceptual or physical difficulty. Second, teachers' roles place them in close contact with the child on a daily basis. And third, in all states, teachers are mandated by law to report child abuse and can be held liable for failure to do so. This book discusses the teacher's role in recognizing and reporting child abuse or neglect in nine chapters: (1) &quot;How Do You Recognize Abuse and Neglect?&quot; (2) &quot;Whom Do You Tell?--The Reporting Process&quot;; (3) &quot;If You Suspect Child Abuse, How Can You Validate Your Suspicion?&quot; (4) &quot;Once You Report, What Happens Then?&quot; (5) &quot;What If You Have to Go  to Court?&quot; (6) &quot;What Can You Do for the Child, Beyond Reporting?&quot; (7) &quot;Who Is the Child's Family?&quot; (8) &quot;How Can You Help the Child by Helping the Family?&quot; and (9) &quot;What Can You Do about Prevention?&quot; Also included is a 41-item bibliography, eight appendices which include sources of further information and reporting procedure, and a list of state review board members.

Subjects were 312 Georgia school principals who returned a survey out of an original randomly-selected sample of 500. Data were analyzed using three statistical procedures: one-way frequency distributions; Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients; and analyses of variance. Study  findings do not imply (as other research has) a mass exodus from the principalship in Georgia. Principals generally feel adequately prepared for most role activities, and this perception of preparation is highly correlated with their perceptions of role difficulty. There are a great many differences in principals' perceptions based on background variables. Ten tables of study data are appended. (JMK)",

A discussion of some legal issues involved in teacher proficiency testing is presented. Specific cases are cited which illustrate the fact that the courts have ruled that testing must show &quot;job-relatedness&quot; and a &quot;rational basis for use.&quot; It is pointed out that, in spite of high rates of minority failure, the courts have ruled that basic skills proficiency testing is related to the states'&quot;legitimate employment needs.&quot; It is noted that court rulings on test validation have steered states toward criterion-referenced examinations which measure basic skills, professional knowledge, and content area ability. The Arizona Performance-Based Teacher Certification program, which consists of a  basic skills subtest, a professional knowledge subtest, and a proposed competency-based two year teacher residency program, is described. The major focus of this description is on the Basic Skills subtests and some impacts this has had on teacher education in Arizona. Results of the Arizona Teacher Proficiency Exam in the basic skills component statewide, and at Northern Arizona University, are examined. Finally, some early testing results are analyzed. This includes a discussion of some test score correlations with other measures of student ability as well as a discussion of implications for minority students. (JD)",

Southern Illinois University workshop participants were asked to respond to 78 items on: (1) sources of encouragement for using computers with students; (2) level at which participants perceived themselves to be informed about computer subjects; (3) interest in learning how to use a computer for various purposes; (4) interest in learning about subjects related to computers in the classroom; (5)  extent to which they believed that the future of schools and teaching would be influenced by computers; and (6) extent to which they believed that aspects of their teaching careers would be influenced by the computer movement. Comparison of group means indicated significant differences on several survey items. Workshop participants were more likely to report support from colleagues, administration, and students. Participants also had an interest in a wider range of computer subjects, were less threatened by the projected role of computers in education, and tended to shift their attitudes and interests over the course of the semester.

A review of the literature on teacher evaluation systems revealed that most systems attempted to accomplish two potentially conflicting purposes: to encourage teacher development and improve instructional quality (formative), and to judge teacher effectiveness and acquire evidence of incompetence (summative). An analysis of legal constraints and a series of case studies in local districts, illustrated the fact that collective bargaining agreements have been a major force in the school district's definition and limitation of teacher evaluation procedures. This factor has led to emphasis on summative evaluation, with the result that assessment practices contribute relatively little to the  identification of teachers' strengths and weaknesses or skill improvement. Information acquired through summative teacher evaluation is seldom used organizationally to plan staff development activities. A review of the results of the case studies produces a list of barriers to formative teacher evaluation. It is concluded that it is both feasible and advisable to emphasize formative evaluation and develop an environment conducive to its success. A set of guidelines is presented for developing an effective formative evaluation system. (Author/JD)",

This tradition of separatism cannot easily or quickly be displaced, nor can one of shared professional responsibility be easily established. This volume contains papers dealing with the problem of building such a tradition. In &quot;Teaching the Handicapped in Secondary Schools: An Historical Perspective,&quot; Thomas M. Stephens and Vikki F. Howard discuss the tradition of separatism in the schools and societal attitudes toward the handicapped. Specific ways in which secondary schools can move toward a tradition of shared responsibility are considered. Patricia L. Reed, in &quot;Preparing Regular Secondary Personnel to Help Make Mainstreaming Work,&quot; proposes that  shared responsibility can be promoted through the use of a congruent set of special education concepts and practices in the preparation of secondary school teachers, administrators, and supervisors. The role of counselors in building the new tradition is examined by Mary Ann Stibbe, Loviah Aldinger, and Reemt R. Baumann in &quot;The Role of Counselors in Implementing P.L. 94-142.&quot; In &quot;The Irony of Modern School Reform,&quot; Joseph Watras suggests that the new tradition may only reinforce a more dangerous type of separatism unless sufficient thought is given to what makes up good education.

A description is given of how the West Genesee/Syracuse University Teaching Center (New York) has dealt with these problems. Through a joint agreement between the school district and the university, faculties and students cooperate to develop programs for continuous pre- and in-service teacher education. The center's Directing Council consists of faculty and administrators from both institutions, and the center coordinator sits on committees both at the university and the school district. The concerns of each  group are carried to the other, and, as a result, very clear guidelines are established for each level of field placement. Classroom teachers share in the evaluative process. University professors meet with the classroom teachers to discuss assignments and clarify what type of experience that it is expected the classroom teacher will allow the preservice teacher. The classroom becomes a laboratory in which the preservice teacher tests materials, teaching strategies, and self. The university and school faculties are equal partners in establishing the atmosphere. An outline of the university's core course for preservice teachers is included. (JD)",

        "description":"Two alternative programs for students seeking secondary school teacher certification were compared for cost effectiveness. The most pronounced difference between individuals majoring in education and non-majors seeking teacher certification while completing degree requirements in their chosen field is the number of required semester hours of professional education coursework. Education majors are required to complete 12 more hours of professional education coursework than are non-majors. Each program requires a minimum of 48 semester hours of teaching field coursework. The cost effectiveness of the 12 semester hours required of education majors was analyzed. An analysis of costs (faculty, materials, equipment, facilities, and services) revealed that, from the college of  education's perspective, the certification option was less costly than the program for education majors. An analysis of student teachers' impact on student achievement revealed that education majors achieved a 10 percent higher increase in pupil cognitive attainment. The findings indicated that it costs $73 more per semester per education major to positively effect a 10 percent gain in pupils' cognitive performance. The implications of these findings for program developers are discussed. (JD)",

Thirty-six social studies lessons, representing a unit, were videotaped over a 10 week period. Classroom interaction was assessed with an adaptation of the Teacher-Child Dyadic Interaction instrument. Learning was assessed with 30-question multiple choice tests administered during and following the study, and attitudes toward the teacher and lessons were assessed with &quot;Pupil Perceptions of a Class Period&quot; and &quot;Postclass Reactions,&quot; each of which were administered 9 times during the study. Overall study  findings provide support for a bidirectional model of classroom interaction, in which both the teacher and students exert influences on one another.

A 30-item multiple choice test of knowledge and a 15-item attitude survey were developed for each ELRE Resource Guide unit. The units were Rules and Responsibilities, Origins of Law, Law and Influence in America, and the Court System. This evaluation report determined that the ELRE Program has succeeded in attaining virtually all of the objectives proposed. Recommendations are  made to refine the program.

Prior to implementing these changes in 1977, only 56  percent of Ribault students were able to show minimum competence in communications to pass that portion of the State Student Assessment Test (SSAT), and only 20 percent passed in mathematics.

GRE scores, undergraduate grade point average, and being a male were the important predictors of students' expectations of obtaining a doctor's rather than a master's degree, and this was generally true for each of the ethnic groups. Characteristics of their undergraduate institutions such as affluence, selectivity, and the predominant racial make-up, generally had little influence. Black and Hispanic/Indian students had higher degree aspirations than White or Oriental students with similar characteristics. However, there is marked similarity among the  ethnic groups in the percentages planning to obtain a doctorate at the various GRE percentiles for their group. This suggests that each group acts as a particular frame of reference for students within it. For each of the major field areas (humanities, natural sciences, social sciences), the variables available for this study did not highly predict which students expected to obtain the higher degree.

It is a composite of seven component inquiries with three substudies in Phase 1 and four in Phase 2. These seven studies cover the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) item-type domain from a number of viewpoints relevant to implicit guessing behavior. The studies in Phase 1 centered on item analytic strategies and on test data derived from a GRE administration. The studies in Phase 2 centered on item-component strategies and on data derived from supplementary materials administered at four university settings. The groups studied were Whites, Chicanos, and Blacks. The implication of any intergroup differences might be that the scoring formula and the instructions to candidates  concerning scoring were inappropriate for one or more groups. The most general conclusion is that such intergroup differences do not exist. In seven attempts to find group contrasts, with each attempt yielding a fairly complex and multifaceted analysis, only one minor phenomenon can be reported: Chicano female omitting on GRE-Verbal is demonstrated by individual groups of somewhat lower average ability than that of individuals demonstrating similar behavior for other ethnic-sex groups.

        "description":"The Figure Location Test (FLT) developed by Donlon, Reilly and McKee to provide a machine-scorable test of the cognitive style called field dependence-field independence, was administered as the experimental section of the October 1976, Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Aptitude Test at about one third of the centers in the United States. Initial data analysis showed that the FLT was related to choice of majors: mathematics and chemistry having high mean scores while education, sociology, and nursing had low mean scores. In addition, those who responded that being people-related was an important consideration in choosing their major fields had lower mean scores than those who said it was unimportant. The converse was true for those who said they emphasized intellectuality.  Analysis, including analysis of covariance and partial correlation to remove the effects of the GRE-Verbal and Quantitative scores, showed that most of these effects overlapped those of the other variables. That Witkin found some independent relationships between choice of major and a cognitive style test is perhaps due to the fact that he was studying undergraduate rather than graduate students, or to the fact that he was studying students in a single, rather selective, college.

Data collected during the study are described and interpreted from the standpoint of teachers' routine assessment needs and practices. The classroom teacher is seen as a practical reasoner and decision maker who makes clinical use of assessment information to diagnose, prescribe, and monitor instruction. The tests teachers use most frequently are those that fit  their practical circumstances: formal and informal measures they themselves construct or seek out for the information they provide; and curriculum embedded tests that come with commercial or district materials. Policy implications germane to the development of testing programs are presented and features of a testing system that could be directly useful to teachers are described. (LC)",

This report covers the second year of discrepancy criteria implementation. It examines the identification of 225 students with SLD during the first semester of the 1982-83 school year in the San Juan (California) Unified School District. Of particular interest was the impact of the California criteria for identification, adopted in early 1983. The criteria in use in San Juan for the 1981-83 period were similar to those adopted by the state, but were applied according to a uniform discrepancy score, rather than using a different discrepancy for each pair of test scores. Students identified under  San Juan's criteria were found to be in line with the adopted state criteria specifications. (Attachments are included for the state and federal legislation related to SLD, and San Juan's criteria for services.) The use of discrepancy criteria had no effect on the percent of referrals identified. It did, however, have an effect on the number of students referred for special education. Because fewer students were referred, fewer students were actually identified as having learning disabilities. (PN)",

The data were analyzed through a multitrait-multimethod matrix (MTMMM) to ascertain convergent and divergent validity. Data were obtained from 57 faculty members, all of whom held the doctorate. Because the required conditions were not fully met for each criterion, applying the MTMMM approach led to somewhat ambiguous results. While the limitations (e.g., small sample size, questionable properties of the instrument, and uni-dimensional assumption of traits) should be considered in interpreting the results, the fact that  confidential data are difficult to obtain suggests both that the tentative conclusions may be of value to other researchers and that further investigations are warranted. The results indicate that the evidence for validity is relatively weak; it was concluded that the results from these measures should be interpreted with considerable caution. (Author/PN)",

With these two questions in mind, 536 kindergarten through 12th-graders were asked the single question: &quot;Tell me about yourself?&quot; All statements in every student's protocol were analyzed on the basis of self-concept content, self-esteem judgments, and whether the mentions appeared early or late in the protocol. When the entire protocol was considered, trends emerged which are consistent with previous research on self-concept development.

Reliability is examined as it is influenced by reader inconsistency, domain sampling, and other sources of error. Validity evidence is presented, which shows reported relationships between direct assessment scores and criteria such as class rank, English course grades, and instructors' ratings of writing ability. Evidence on the incremental validity of direct assessment over and above other available measures is also given. It is concluded that direct assessment makes a contribution but that methods need to be developed to improve its reliability and reduce its costs.  New automated methods of textual analysis and new kinds of direct assessment in which more than a single score is produced are suggested as two approaches to better direct assessment. (Author)",

Multivariate analyses of variance were used to determine the effects of the program, grade level, sex, and race. Significant differences in favor of the Scoring High program were found on some of the subtest scores of the California Achievement Tests (CAT). Significant interaction effects prevented a straightforward interpretation of the program's impact. Some of the students in some grades increased some CAT subtest scores as a result of participating in the program. The authors state that since the program did not produce clear evidence that it is a valuable tool to increase student performance on the CAT, school  administrators and others involved in the decision to use this particular program should weigh the results of this study as well as the financial requirements (approximately $2.00 per student) and the use of valuable classroom instruction time as they consider whether some small increases in some test scores for some students warrants the purchase and use of the program.

Responses from two instruments supported the separation of M and F, but differed in the direction of the correlation for the two traits, while the third provided remarkably strong support for a bipolar MF continuum. Despite the apparent  inconsistency, the observed correlations were explicable in terms of the design of each instrument. While the two-factor model provided a reasonable fit for the BSRI, more complicated models were better able to fit responses to the ASRS and CPS. Results from this investigation and other research were used to formulate a new theoretical model. (Author/BW)",

This particular application is in the Electronic Technicians &quot;A&quot; (ETA) school at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center, Illinois. The goals of implementing CAT at this site were to increase test security, improve the efficiency of the testing program, and improve the quality of measurement yielded by the testing program. The problems encountered by this CAT program include the unknown dimensionality of the tests, the small number of available items for the item pools, and the  availability of item response data only for small samples. The overall design of the project includes four phases: (1) preliminary analyses and software design; (2) implementation of a computer-administered conventional test; (3) implementation of a dual testing program (conventional and CAT); and (4) elimination of the conventional testing program. If the results are positive, this project will demonstrate that adaptive testing can effect improvement in classroom testing. (Author/BW)",

The Rand McNally SCIIS &quot;Communities&quot; unit used in this study can be characterized as a conceptual change strategy because it is organized around a three-phase learning cycle designed to move students from preconceptions to new, more scientific concepts. The three phases include exploration, invention, and discovery. Data were collected on the students' conceptual knowledge and their experience of instruction. Pretests and posttests were given to distinguish among alternative conceptions of plants' source of food and the role of light in plant growth. Lessons in the instructional unit were observed and recorded. The impact of instruction on students was similar  to a previous study; only one student appeared to hold the intended goal conception with the others retaining their preconceptions or various hybrid conceptions. The contrast between these results and the reasonableness of the SCIIS strategy led the authors to examine several problems which appear to have general implications for cognitive instruction. In this report, the nature of these problems is documented and described, and their implications for teaching, curriculum development, and research are discussed. (DWH)",

        "description":"This research examined the results from direct and indirect writing assessments to determine the most effective method of discrimination. The New Jersey State Department of Education developed a test for ninth-grade students which was designed to measure the ability to apply writing mechanics to written text and to communicate effectively in writing. The instrument combined direct and indirect assessment in a 54-item multiple choice section and a 30-minute essay. This minimum competency test measured minimum writing skills. Essays were holistically scored. Direct writing assessment requires writing samples by examinees to be read and scored by examiners. Indirect assessment requires examinees to respond to items which measure correlates of writing. Both methods are reliable  assessments. In states which mandate that students pass a writing test as part of the requirements for receiving a high school diploma, the important criterion is which form of assessment discriminates best between competent and incompetent writers. Results of statistical analysis indicated the indirect assessment provides a better means of discrimination between competent and incompetent writers. However, a combination of both methods, creating a weighted total test score, is considered the most appropriate method. (DWH)",

        "description":"Negative item bias is produced by the inability of preadolescent children to respond appropriately to negatively worded items on rating scales, and is hypothesized to be a cognitive-developmental phenomenon. The effect is examined with responses to the Self Description-Questionnaire (SDQ), a multifactor self-concept instrument. In study 1, response to positive and negative items were uncorrelated in grade 2 but were substantially correlated by grade 5. In study 2, confirmatory factor analysis of response by grade 5 students demonstrated that the negative items contributed both to the scale they were designed to measure and to a \"negative item\" factor. The negative item factor was nearly uncorrelated with any of the self-concept factors, but was substantially correlated with  reading achievement. The two studies demonstrate that younger children and children with poorer reading skills are less able to respond appropriately to negatively-worded items, and that this effect produces a bias in their response to the SDQ. This supports the contention that the effect is a cognitive-developmental phenomenon. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"The responses of first-grade students to seatwork assignments were studied through detailed narrative records, copies of seatwork performance, and informal conversations with the students about their work. Two distinct groups of students were identified for comparisons: those whose responses to seatwork were frequently poor (low attention and low performance) and those whose responses were generally adequate (high attention and high performance). After this classification, it was determined that every poor responder was a member of a lower level reading group, and every adequate responder was a member of a higher level reading group, suggesting that seatwork was a qualitatively different experience for lower achievers than higher achievers. Further analyses of the narrative data  revealed that poor and adequate responders also differed in terms of the fluency of their answers and the appropriateness of the strategies they used to do the work. These data suggest why achievement differences widen over time. Lower achievers (who were likely to be poor responders) were spending less of their seatwork time in beneficial ways than were higher achievers. (Author/BW)",

The 11 factors the SDQ II was designed to measure were clearly identified in a conventional/exploratory factor analysis and in a confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL. Each scale was reliable and correlations among the factors were small. All of the SDQ II scales were significantly correlated with sex and/or age, though the effect of sex and age were independent of each other and the relationships were small. At every grade level academic criterion measures were significantly correlated with every academic scale, but not with the nonacademic scales. These findings not only demonstrate the  multidimensionality of self-concept, but also show that its relationship to other constructs cannot be adequately understood if this multidimensionality is ignored. The findings have important implications for the study of adolescent self-concept, and also support the construct validity of the SDQ II and the Shavelson model upon which it is based. (Author/PN)",

Master and student teachers evaluated all the essays according to overall effectiveness of written expression and according to holistic ratings of specific components (mechanics, sentence structure, organization, word usage, content/ideas, and style). Ratings of writing effectiveness by master teachers and by student teachers were substantially correlated with each other and with an external validity criterion. Correlations were particularly high for the sum of ratings of specific components, but were nearly as high for overall, global ratings. The single-rater  reliability (r=0.7), the average of correlations between each pair of raters, was higher than expected from previous research. The average of single-rater reliabilities for specific components (r=0.6) was also high. However, the predicted ability of teachers to discriminate among the multiple components, except perhaps the mechanics facet, was not supported in a variety of multitrait-multimethod analyses. The student teacher ratings were nearly as reliable and as valid as master teacher ratings, and student teachers were prehaps better able to differentiate among different components of writing effectiveness.

        "description":"Multiple dimensions of self-concept, inferred self-concepts based upon responses by peers and by teachers, and academic achievement measures were collected in a sample of 559 fifth grade students. Exploratory/conventional factor analyses of responses to the Self Description Questionnaire (SDQ) clearly identified the eight facets of self-concept that the instrument was designed to measure and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated the factor loadings to be reasonably invariant for self-report and peers' responses. Student/teacher/peer agreement was statistically significant for most self-concept dimensions, and agreement on any one dimension was relatively independent of agreement on other dimensions. Academic achievement scores (both objective test scores and teacher ratings)  were significantly and positively correlated with self-concepts based upon self-reports in academic areas, but not in nonacademic areas. Students' own self-reports more clearly separated self-concepts in Reading and Math than did responses by peers or by teachers, or the actual achievement measures. The findings of this study demonstrate that the formation of self-concepts is affected by different processes than the self-concepts inferred by significant others, that academic self-concepts are affected by different processes than the academic achievements which they reflect, and that self-concept cannot be adequately understood if its multidimensionality is ignored.

Students from non-English speaking families achieved significantly poorer reading results than those from English speaking families, and these differences were consistent and stable across grades 1-6. Longitudinal analyses suggested that the effect occurred primarily in grade 1 and that the lower reading achievement scores obtained by students from non-English speaking families in subsequent school years could be explained by the poor reading performance in grade 1 without taking into account the home language. The group differences were quite specific to  language and reading skills and did not generalize to performance in mathematics. In year 6 the two groups did not differ in mathematics measures and students from non-English speaking families scored significantly better after controlling for language skills. Students in the two groups differed on many variables (for example, socio-economic status and home environment) so that causal conclusions are not justified. However, the specificity of the group achievement differences to language and reading skills suggests that home language may be an important determinant of early reading, and that early reading is in turn the primary determinant of subsequent reading performance.

It is based on data collected from a national sample of tenth graders in the 1980 &quot;High School and Beyond&quot; (HSB) survey sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics. Besides obtaining data on students' family background, the survey asked students to respond to a series of questions regarding their general sense of well-being, satisfaction with school, self-esteem, and sense of opportunity. Also examined was the racial composition of the students' schools. The report describes the distribution of student responses to questions  regarding their sense of well-being and opportunity, and summarizes the areas where race and sex differences appear. Correlates of student variations on selected scales of satisfaction, self-esteem, and sense of efficacy are analyzed to determine the importance of school and non-school influences on these student outcomes. In addition, broad features of the school experience are distinguished for their apparent role in the process. The report concludes that participation in extracurricular activities does contribute to an improved sense of satisfaction and well-being for both blacks and whites, but does little to influence either the sense of personal efficacy or a positive self-image. Desegregated schools that maximize participation in extracurricular activities especially enhance black  student participants' sense of well-being. (CJM)",

        "description":"Research on microcomputers in education suggests that this new technology may be widening the gap between rich and poor schools and talented and underachieving students. Public schools in poor districts and small parochial schools are the least likely to own computers. One survey indicates that while 66 percent of affluent school districts have computers, only 41 percent of the least wealthy districts have them. Even among schools owning microcomputers, there is the question of how these computers are used in instruction. Wealthier schools tend to conduct classes in computer programming, while less affluent schools offer computer assisted instruction (CAI) such as drill and practice. Little research has been conducted on the success of CAI for disadvantaged students. The studies  completed indicate that CAI has a positive effect on disadvantaged elementary and secondary students' computation skills, and on elementary students' language arts skills. On the less positive side, CAI shows mixed results in teaching vocabulary skills and reading to this student population. Schools serving disadvantaged populations must ask themselves whether these students are being served equitably by their exposure to computers, and when they are using computers, whether the curriculum is best suited to their needs.

        "description":"This is the report of a study conducted to determine the effect of six variables on the career choice of 995 black college students, most of them from rural South Carolina. Study design, sample selection, and data collection methods are outlined; and related literature is briefly reviewed. The relationship between career choice and each independent variable is then presented and discussed. It was found that (1) rural residents, despite career choice, come from lower socioeconomic level families and are more concerned about the cost of post-baccalaureate education than urban and out-of-state residents; (2) students who choose nontraditional majors have more positive concepts of their leadership, academic, and athletic abilities than do their cohorts who choose traditional careers;  and the nontraditional majors express less concern about the cost of post-baccalaureate education; (3) political participation of parents is not a factor in student career choices; and (4) secondary school environment exerts little influence on career choices, aside from some measure of teacher influence. Recommendations relating to increased assistance and counseling for rural minority students are made. Appendices include a bibliography; the survey instruments; histograms of most frequently chosen majors; a rank order of traditional and nontraditional majors; and a table showing distribution of subjects by county of residence.

        "author":["Richter, Kerry"],
        "description":"The objective of this paper is to examine possible changes in the extent of the turnaround in growth patterns between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas throughout the 1970s. Comparisons of trends in both kinds of areas are made across three time periods: 1970-74, 1974-77, and 1977-80. Data used in the analysis are from a special file of intercensal county estimates prepared by the Census Bureau. The most important finding is that the turnaround from negative to positive net migration in nonmetropolitan areas was sustained throughout the 1970s. Nevertheless, there was a slowdown in the growth of nonmetropolitan areas in the late 1970s. An even sharper decline was found for nonmetropolitan net migration rates, as natural increase returned to its traditional position as the  most important component of nonmetropolitan growth. Although this could be taken as proof that the turnaround has ended, the overall evidence is stronger that the validity of the turnaround and the slowdown in nonmetropolitan growth by the end of the decade may be incorporated into new theories of urban-rural migration which see a tendency toward balance in the interchange between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.

ECIA established Chapter 1 and 2 block grants which transferred almost total authority for the largest elementary and secondary school Federal assistance programs in the United States to State and local education agencies. These programs had formerly been administered through Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and various Federal agencies. Several speakers contended that such block grants remove Federal funding from urban centers with large populations of disadvantaged students who most need special assistance; reward communities who have made no previous efforts to obtain such funds; unfairly distribute Federal monies to private schools; and enable States  to avoid desegregation. Representatives from the Department of Education and other agencies defended the block grants on the grounds that they greatly reduce administrative paperwork and give more flexibility to the States receiving the monies; that any infringements of the civil rights of students are the concern of the Civil Rights Commission; and that ECIA has been in operation for only one year and that clearer guidelines for the States will be established as the results of this first year of implementation are evaluated.

By most measures, poor children experience disproportionate morbidity and mortality. Yet certain ear and vision problems exhibit a U-shaped relation to family income in both national statistics and the Washington sample. Analyses of this relation suggested crowded housing and limited access to care as possible causes of higher prevalences among poor children in the study sample; mechanisms for the affluent were unclear. Additional analyses identified various economic factors underlying apparent racial differences in children's anemia. Focusing on ambulatory care, the research found different patterns of health outcomes and service  utilization across practice settings. Thus, although lower utilization seemed detrimental to poor children's health overall, utilization levels across settings evidently had less to do with these health outcomes than did other provider or system features. Finally, both national and study data revealed persisting inequalities in measures of utilization and barriers to access. In the study sample, the most significant barriers appeared to be low income practices, high provider charges, and absence of Medicaid. Findings suggest that current policy trends may exacerbate present deficiencies in illness prevention and early diagnosis among the disadvantaged. (Author)",

The early historical context of the reports is set out through a discussion of secondary education and proposals for reform since the 19th century. This is followed by a discussion of the 1983 reports that addresses their focus on the high school, their differences with the reform reports of the 1970s, and their common themes. These themes are identified as the meaning of excellence and the relationship of excellence to equity; the need to redefine and narrow the schools' goals and objectives; strengthening the curriculum; tracking; vocational education and the high school; the place of technology, particularly  computers, in the schools; the use of time; the need to improve teachers and teaching; the importance of school principal leadership; business-school partnerships; and federal, state, and local responsibilities. Finally, an analysis of the reports is offered in terms of their treatment of the crisis in education today; the context of schooling; the poor, minorities, and urban schools; excellence, equity, and standards; reforming the schools, teaching, and learning; school climate and environment; better teachers and better teaching; the intrinsic value of education; and the school and non-educative settings. Throughout this analysis and the preceding discussion, comparisons are made with earlier reform reports. (CMG)",

        "description":"An overall strategy is reported for updating secondary and postsecondary vocational/technical teachers in the technologies of their teaching areas. It is designed for use by vocational educators and others who provide technological update: local school, institution, and district administrators and boards; teacher educators; vocational/technical professional development leaders; business/industry representatives; and state and federal department of education personnel. The first chapter provides background on the need for the strategy, its development, and the nine essential strategy characteristics. Chapters 2 to 10 each treat one of the generic characteristics of a successful strategy for technological update: structure for action, roles and responsibilities, policy, resources,  incentives and rewards, high potential techniques, alternative technique configurations, incorporation of update in programs, and continuing and self-renewing activities. Each chapter presents (1) a rationale for the inclusion of the characteristic, (2) guidelines for implementing the characteristic, and (3) specific details appropriate to the illustration of the discussion. Chapter 11 discusses the implementation of technological update programs at the statewide level and suggests an appropriate structure for administering such programs. Chapter 12 provides related recommendations for action to increase the effectiveness of current efforts to provide vocational teachers with technological update. (YLB)",

        "description":"A project was conducted to identify the major conceptual problems associated with secondary cooperative vocational education (CVE) programs, develop a model that accurately depicts the CVE process, and develop a comprehensive set of measures for quality CVE programs. Based on their review of the related literature, the researchers concluded that an information system is an integral part of the effort to justify and improve CVE programs. They then developed a model that characterized the elements of a CVE program in terms of inputs, processes, and outcomes. According to the model, inputs and processes were divided into three categories: school, job, and linkage. In each category a number of elements were then identified as necessary for an effective CVE program. Having refined  this schema of quality indicators, the researchers then drafted a CVE program evaluation model that encompassed the following activities: clarification of key CVE program outcomes valued by local leaders, establishment of local standards for CVE program outcomes, preparation of instruments to obtain outcome and input indicator data, establishment of a system for analysis and reporting of information, analysis of the outcomes of CVE programs by comparing program results to outcome standards, and dissemination of local program information.

Information came from reports, books, and articles from many countries, coupled with research by soil engineers at Texas A &amp; M University. It is presented in the most nontechnical format possible. The manual describes broadly the kinds of soil that are found in various parts of the world and tells what can be expected of them. It then tells what is best to do with each of them, alone or in combination with others, to make them good enough to use or make them better with the use of stabilizers. Then it explains which of the three general kinds of earth construction is best for use with the kinds of soil available. It also describes simple tests  anyone can perform that tell the builder how well he or she is succeeding in the construction. After chapters on picking out places to build, how to make a good foundation for any kind of house, and how to build a roof, the manual has separate chapters on adobe, rammed earth, and pressed block construction. The manual is illustrated with line drawings and photographs. A list of references, mathematical formulas, soil test procedures, and a glossary complete the manual. (KC)",

        "description":"A study assessed the governance and administration of vocational and technical education in Utah. To gather data for the study, a team of four vocational educators experienced in vocational governance and administration spent one week in Utah. During that time, the members of the team attended a presentation of testimony on governance before a combined meeting of the joint legislative committee on vocational education and the Utah State Board for Vocational Education. In addition, they reviewed the administration of vocational education in the state through interviews with state and local vocational administrators and educators. Based on data obtained from these two sources, the research team identified three major concerns common to several groups and many individuals in Utah.  These concerns centered on: elective versus appointive boards, a third board for vocational education, and placement as a program standard. In view of the on-going conflict between agency boards over who will control vocational education in Utah, the research team recommended that the Utah State Legislature and those responsible for the development of vocational education in the state establish a set of short- and long-term goals for vocational education and then form a governance committee incorporating as many as possible of the principles of effective governance.

During the study, researchers analyzed data pertaining to the system's vocational programs, described the administration and delivery system for vocational education, and suggested actions that the Cincinnati Resource Development Committee should consider in its efforts to assist the schools. Based on interviews with 41 individuals (including school board members, vocational directors, vocational teachers, and local businessmen and employers), the researchers determined that the percentage of juniors and seniors in vocational education (65 percent) is high compared to that of other major cities. The percent of completers employed in the job for which they are trained is about equal to the  average (58 percent). Vocational education in the Cincinnati School System is administered by a Director of Vocational and Continuing Education, with each school governed by a principal and overseen by an advisory committee. Those advisory committee members interviewed mentioned that it is difficult to find business people willing to devote time to serving on a committee. The interviewees listed working with special needs students as a major need and objective of the Cincinnati School System. After analyzing data collected from the interviews, the researchers advanced a series of recommendations concerning facilitation of the involvement of business and industry in vocational training in Cincinnati.

Based on an analysis of data obtained from both of these sources, the researchers described the enrollment patterns and course offerings, assessed the administration and delivery, and made recommendations concerning the involvement of business and industry in vocational training in the Great Oaks Joint Vocational School District. Data from the Ohio Division of Vocational Education revealed that 38 percent of juniors and seniors were enrolled in vocational education,  with an average of 13 percent of these students classified as disadvantaged. Programs for disadvantaged and handicapped students appeared to receive special emphasis in the Great Oaks system. Advisory committees also played an important role in the quality control of the Great Oaks program. The advisory committees also provided the most common type of resource person involved in the school district. To facilitate the involvement of business and industry in the district's vocational program, the researchers suggested that both school and industry supervise closely the activities of and provide recognition and rewards for outstanding advisory committees, committee members, and teachers.

The module includes five learning experiences designed to help prospective teachers become competent in operating filmstrip and slide equipment and in using filmstrips and slides to present information in the classroom or laboratory. The module is also intended to help prospective teachers gain skill in determining when a filmstrip or a set of slides is the best audiovisual device to use for a particular lesson. Each learning experience consists of an enabling objective, several  activities, and a feedback section. The final learning experience requires the student-teacher to present information with filmstrips and slides in an actual teaching situation. A teacher performance assessment form for the student's resource person to use in evaluating his/her performance completes the package. (KC)",

        "description":"The Vocational Leadership Development Program at Indiana University of Pennsylvania prepares individuals for leadership roles in curriculum, supervision, and vocational management. It is based on a series of 136 competencies ranging in categories from management of curriculum to management of personnel to management of business and finance. Students/interns enrolled in the program must develop prescribed skills to a predetermined level of application--guided application, independent application, or mastery. The program follows the career ladder approach and together with the open-entry, open-exit concept permits considerable flexibility to interns in selecting career options. An important, integral link in the training process is the local in-house helper, usually the director or  supervisor of vocational education, who provides access to authentic experiences. Interns are able to undertake projects for the director or supervisor and, thereby, satisfy skills in the leadership program. The local educational agency benefits, since the intern incorporates state-of-the-art theory and practical application skills in addressing project objectives. The university benefits from the opportunity for interns to apply administrative skills in a real school environment.

The first section on source and background of the youth employment problem provides a context within which to view the policy problem being addressed. The second section focuses on what is known about the consequences of youth employment problems, specifically the private and social costs. Next, the policy analysis addresses possible causes of the above consequences as a target for action by vocational education. The fourth section moves from problem diagnosis to prescriptions and discusses what services would comprise a comprehensive policy to address youth employment. Services are linked to  causes, and specific roles for voational education are suggested. The lessons of past experience with vocational education and other employment- and training-related policies are analyzed to assess the likely effectiveness of various services. Next, current youth employment policy is briefly summarized to examine which services are being provided and what limitations in quantity and quality to service might exist. The last section addresses policy alternatives specifically with recommendations to federal policymakers for enhancing the role of vocational education in improving youth employment. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study examined the factors contributing to the nonreenrollment of 4-H Club members in Southeastern Florida. During the study, questionnaires were mailed to 364 4-H Club dropouts who were randomly selected from the total dropout population of 545 youth in Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties. Based on data from the 139 usable instruments, the researcher concluded that the decision of most of the respondents to leave 4-H was a multifaceted one. The most frequently given reasons for leaving 4-H were that the leader quit, the club disbanded, or the student had too much else to do. Older respondents were more likely to dislike project books and 4-H meetings, viewed 4-H activities as repetitious and not fun, had jobs, and had too much else to do. Nonwhite respondents were more  likely to have problems with transportation and paying for projects, were unaware of 4-H opportunities, had jobs, and felt that they did not receive responsibility. Employed respondents were more likely to dislike competition, rules, and the 4-H leader; they could not express themselves, meet the other sex, or do what they wanted.

Each minority group was compared to a matched sample of majority students. The groups were matched on several test scores, education level, age, rank, and source of entry. The performance of the two groups (each minority and its matched control group) was compared on the following criteria: (1) warrant officer candidate military development course (WOCMDC) grades, (2) academic grades by phase of training, (3) flight performance grades by phase of training, (4) overall grade, (5) attrition during the warrant officer development course, and (6) attrition during the flight portion of training. No significant  differences were found in performance grades during WOCMDC. The only group found to have a significant difference in academic grade was the Black group during the primary stage of training; the academic grade average for Blacks was significantly lower. There were no significant differences in flight performance grades or in overall program grade. The Hispanic group was the only group to show significantly more recycles (i.e., repetition of a stage of training) than their matched majority group. During flight training, only Blacks and Hispanics had significantly more recycles than did their matched majority groups. The results of this study will be used by the Army Aviation Center to ensure that the flight training program maximizes the training for all students. (Author/KC)",

The Training Program Evaluation (TPE) system offers advantages over traditional approaches of assessing program effectiveness. TPE involves the direct observation of training and testing and does not rely on second-hand accounts of training given by trainers or trainees. Neither does TPE require the construction and administration of specially designed tests to evaluate soldier performance, but uses instead the tests routinely given after each block of instruction. During its development, TPE was frequently field tested to determine its utility to the Army. The major test of TPE came during the M1 tank Operational  Testing Cycle III (OT-III), where TPE was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the M1 transition training program and to suggest program improvements. The utility of TPE was demonstrated during the M1 OT-III, where several agencies used TPE to gather training effectiveness information that was used to improve the training program. Lessons learned during the field testing of TPE have been incorporated into the TPE system, resulting in a useful product. (Author/KC)",

Thirty division and branch chiefs from the Directorate of Training Developments (DTD) at a large center/school were interviewed concerning their feedback needs, using an interview form specially developed for the purpose. Interviewees were queried about the types of feedback currently available to them, where they get it, how they use it, and where they send it. Interviewees were then asked to state any needs that they might have for additional feedback. The study found that the present feedback system is not providing all the feedback that training developers need for improving training programs and  materials. The study recommended that to increase the quantity and quality of feedback available to training developers, the coordination between the DTD and trainers should be increased; management personnel should increase the number of contacts with the field; more emphasis should be placed on hands-on testing and other objective data collection methods; and computer-based data analysis and management techniques for handling feedback should be developed. The study may interest training developers and evaluators who wish to improve the quality of the feedback that they obtain. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"A study evaluated the validity of the use of digital dexterity and reaction time as variables to predict students' gross typing speed. To gather data for the study, researchers tested approximately 120 students from three typing classes at Jefferson Community College in Louisiana and one typing class at the University of Louisville (Kentucky). In the first test, researchers used an electronic stopwatch, hand-held counter, and a digital computer to measure the digital dexterity of students entering the classes. The second test involved the use of a digital computer to measure the students' reaction time, ability to use their fingers independently, and speed at typing three random characters. Based on the results of the first test, it was concluded that little correlation exists  between gross typing speed and digital dexterity. After correlating the results of the second test with students' gross typing speeds after the completion of a one-semester course, the researchers determined that reaction time and the ability to use fingers independently had moderate correlation coefficients with gross typing speed. The ability to type three random characters was, however, well correlated with typing speed. (MN)",

        "description":"A study evaluated the effectiveness of pretesting infantry soldiers scheduled to take written Skill Qualification Tests (SQT) in order to determine their training needs prior to official testing. During the study, researchers developed and field-tested a pretest for the SQT that was based on the 11B1 Infantryman Soldier's Manual and the 1980 SQT Notice. They administered the validated pretest to enlisted personnel stationed at Fort Bragg and Fort Meyer. Upon completion of the project, participants received immediate feedback about their pretest performance and their units received summaries of troops' results. The pretested soldiers performed better on the written SQT than did the soldiers who were not pretested. Based on these results, it was concluded that developing and  administering pretests as training for written SQTs could save training time devoted to tasks soldiers already know, could supplant post-SQT remedial training, and could reduce soldiers' test anxiety.

The course, which trains airborne personnel to conduct landings of men and equipment, features relatively stressful training programs during which instructors grade the performance of students' activity as jumpmasters for actual airdrops. To gather data for the study, researchers divided one class of 31 jumpmaster students into pairs matched by rank. Members of each pair were then randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. Besides receiving the same regular training that the control group received, the experimental group was taught a method of respiration control to be used immediately before and  during training jumps. The groups were then compared on the basis of heart rate during 2-day and 2-night training jumps, a self-reported measure of perceived stress during the jumps, and grades received for performance as jumpmasters during 1-day and 1-night jumps. Members of the experimental group had significantly lower heart rates during the 2-night jumps of the course, jumps that, because of limited visibility, are somewhat more dangerous and more stressful than daylight jumps.

        "description":"The Military Applicant Profile (MAP) was developed to serve as an applicant screening instrument to reduce attrition in the all-volunteer Army. Since 1979, it has been used operationally to screen 17-year-old non-high school graduate males. The Army Research Institute was asked to explore the extension of MAP to older (above 17) nongraduate males, who have higher attrition rates than younger nongraduate males. Using 1976-77 data, this research evaluated the validity of MAP for education, race, and age subgroups. Results showed that MAP scores were significantly related to the 180-day stay-leave attrition criterion. Neither race (black/white) nor age interacted with the MAP-attrition relationship; education level did. The function relating MAP scores to attrition for graduates was  significantly below that for nongraduates. MAP would appear to have great utility in reducing the much-higher attrition rate of nongraduates. These findings require verification, to be accomplished by research currently in progress.

A representative random sample of 4,360 officers and 2,339 enlisted personnel completed a 178-item questionnaire about their attitudes toward these factors. Results showed that similar dimensions of commitment to the Army, satisfaction with programs, duty environment, and career intentions are found within both categories of service members. Career intentions for officers, however, were more related to overall satisfaction with Army human resource programs and with assessment of housing and pay. However, while about 40 percent of the variance in the career intentions of officers was  accounted for by commitment, only 10 percent of the variance in the career intentions of enlisted members was accounted for by these analyses.

During the study, the researcher administered a branching questionnaire to 1,577 juniors and seniors from four high schools in Wisconsin, 59.6 percent of whom were working at the time of the survey and 14.1 percent of whom had worked during the past year. Despite the variations in population, location, and programs that existed among the four schools, the responses of those students surveyed generally did not vary greatly from school to school. The survey data generally confirmed the fact that large numbers of students at all income levels and levels of school achievement were working at part-time jobs during the school year. It appeared that conflicts often arose between teachers' academic priorities and  students' choices for work as well as between students' and teachers' views of how work related to school. In general, students did not feel the same conflict between job and school that their teachers expressed on an earlier survey. Many students felt that their teachers were not aware of students' jobs and did not relate course work to them. Since the pressures for students to work are not likely to decrease, educators should seize upon work experiences as teaching opportunities rather than as inhibitors to their ability to teach and to students' ability to learn.

        "description":"Evidence from a number of data sets indicates that, despite statements by older workers that they have a strong interest in part-time work, in most cases retirement is sudden. Workers approaching retirement age are not spread evenly across industries. Construction, transportation, and finance/insurance/real estate have a higher-than-average proportion. Trade and government retain the highest proportion of older workers; agriculture and trade accept older workers most readily from other industries. The preferred explanation of why part-time employment for older workers is not the norm is that part-time work is less productive and more costly to employers, per hour. Lower compensation for part-time work is less appealing to workers than full retirement. This explanation for sudden  retirement is supported by six types of evidence: the employment costs themselves, the lower pay for part-time workers, the scarcity of part-time jobs for workers, layoffs in response to declining demand, the concentration of part-time work among married women and students, and the concentration of part-time work in low-wage industries. An analysis of three potential changes in Federal policies suggests that they would not affect the retirement decision of a typical worker. (YLB)",

The first section presents background information on the extent of volunteerism in the United States. It reports that about one out of every five men aged 57 to 71 did some volunteer work in 1978 and about one out of every four women aged 42 to 56 did some volunteer work in 1979. Information on federally sponsored ACTION programs for older Americans indicates that about one percent of the population 60 years and older volunteers in these ways. Section 2 provides a conceptual basis for empirically testing who volunteers and why. Section 3 presents these empirical findings: education has a positive influence, areas with concentrations of people in  need do not necessarily have the greatest number of volunteers, a history of volunteering strongly predicts current participation, and retirement policies concerning the amount of time people work and the amount of income may affect men's and women's volunteerism in different ways. Conclusions and policy implications are presented in section 4. (An appendix describes the empirical model of volunteerism and its results and provides six data tables.) (YLB)",

It answers, as far as can be foreseen, the question, \"Where are the jobs?\" The book is organized into six chapters. In the first chapter, the author examines social science research on the job market and gives some reasons why predicting employment trends is so difficult. In the second chapter, he presents his view on what is not going to happen in the next 10 years or so. For example, he does not believe that computer repair and programming occupations are going to increase significantly. Chapter 3 explores the area of \"pocket marketing,\" a theory that suggests that even in times of high unemployment, areas of opportunity exist,  whether in certain geographic areas or in meeting specific unmet needs. These \"pockets\" could generate jobs for disabled people. The fifth chapter details the five areas of opportunity that the author predicts will provide jobs for handicapped people. The areas explained and focused on are general services, special services, sales, information services, and entrepreneurship. In the fifth chapter, the author matches these five areas to the personal characteristics needed for each type of work. The final chapter offers suggestions for actually making the scenario happen. The chapter outlines the kinds of steps that need to be taken by disabled people themselves, service agencies, other government agencies, and employers in order to put disabled persons to work in the five areas.

        "description":"A study examined the school and labor market experiences of students who either are in or have participated in vocational education programs. To formulate their conclusions, the researchers involved in the study analyzed a subset of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Labor Market Experience--Youth Cohort. These data indicate that students who participated in vocational education to a fairly extensive degree were less likely to drop out than were others. Most vocational students worked while in high school, earning an average of $67 per week for 24 hours of work at a job that was most likely self-obtained. Working did not seem to affect the academic performance of these students; both their grades and their class rank were at least equal to those of their  nonworking counterparts. Once they had graduated from high school, these vocational participants were more likely to be active in the labor force--either working or looking for work--than graduates with less vocational concentration. The typical female vocational graduate had a relatively high-prestige clerical job that demanded moderate use of her intelligence. The average male graduate, on the other hand, tended to choose craft or agricultural employment and was more likely than his nonvocational counterparts to work for himself. (MN)",

During the study, researchers identified factors relating to job placement, provided descriptions of the educational and community processes appearing to influence job placement, and generated hypotheses concerning variables relating to job placement. Data for the study came from a variety of sources, including the following: literature reviews, interviews with 438 individuals involved in secondary vocational programs, mail questionnaires administered to 5,062 individuals representing people involved with secondary vocational education and 2,579 people who either received or provided vocational educational services. After analyzing these data, the  researchers identified a number of labor market, community, and educational factors affecting the placement rates associated first with secondary and then with postsecondary vocational programs. Included among those factors found to have a significant influence on placement rates were the following: community unemployment rates, availability of transportation, types and sizes of industries in a community, demography, the pressure of cooperative vocational education programs, a high rate of participation in youth organizations, and the existence of a good relationship between schools and the community. Based on these findings, the researchers formulated a series of recommendations directed toward Congress, the U.S. Department of Education, state government agencies, teacher education  institutions, postsecondary vocational educational institutions, and secondary schools.

        "description":"In order to provide federal policymakers with an adequate background of information on the issues of vocational education and private sector (VEPS) cooperation, an analysis was made of the context of current VEPS cooperative practices. The analysis revealed that although the concept of cooperation is simple and appealing, it is very difficult to implement. Several factors appeared to undermine the effectiveness of cooperative activities. Included among these were the following: the existence of current cooperative practices that are described as fragmented, duplicative, and ad hoc; the use of volunteerism as the basis for cooperation; and the lack of available funds for vocational education linkage activities. When these factors are coupled with other underlying issues (such as  the infringement of the private sector in the training enterprise, delineation of who should bear the cost of training, and the perceived inability of vocational educators to respond quickly to technological changes), the dire need for policy initiatives in this area becomes evident. Based on an analysis of these issues, four policy options were set forth that gave rise to 28 policy alternatives. These alternatives were then limited to 12 possible policy alternatives. (Appended to this report are a sample listing of VEPS cooperating practices and an initial evaluation of 28 policy options.) (MN)",

The keynote address, by Patricia Jones, describes issues in health care financing in the 1980s and urges researchers to provide the kind of data and guidelines needed to support professional nursing services. The second paper, by Ora L. Strickland, names establishment of an acceptable and stable economic base for the provision of nursing services as the most important public policy issue facing nursing and gives pointers on collaborative research as one approach to contributing to the knowledge base. The third presentation, by Jeanette Lancaster, exhorts nurse researchers to affect policy by identifying critical  study areas and initiating research. Abstracts follow of 32 studies, with almost equal numbers focusing on clinical practice, education, and the delivery of health care areas; the majority have implications in all three areas. They generally underscore the interrelatedness of research, education, and service. Specific topics include nurse-patient negotiations, predictive factors of supply and salaries of nurse practitioners, cultural determinants of health and self-care, job satisfaction, skills of nurse administrators, continuing education, nursing gestalt, nurses' decision making, and factors related to student success in completing a baccalaureate nursing education.

Chapter I illustrates the liability factors that create the insurance and risk management needs. Both legal and humanitarian obligations of human service agencies involved in transporting clients are discussed. Chapter II presents the basic vocabulary and concepts used by risk managers. Other topics are risk evaluation by the insurance industry and management control of losses. Chapter III examines the legal duties of the agency, the risk manager, and the driver(s); and agency liability and responsibility. Chapter IV discusses risk management objectives of concern to various agencies. In chapter V, the identification  of risk areas to be managed is addressed. Chapter VI focuses on measuring the potential impact of a loss due to a risk. Chapter VII identifies various strategies that can be used to eliminate, assume, or transfer a risk. Chapter VIII provides information to make the risk manager an effective procurer of insurance for human service agencies. Provision for evaluation and feedback of risk management programs is discussed in chapter IX. Appendixes include information on a safety meeting; an accident review form; a request for insurance quote; and sample agency, driver, volunteer, vehicle, passenger, safety program, and supervision program profiles.

Chapter 1 offers background information and describes the sample--1,539 people between the ages of 20 and 34, one-half of whom had taken vocational education programs in high school. Chapter 2 describes the broad context within which the labor market effects of vocational education take place, with emphasis on the actions of the labor market and the factors that influence individual decisions. The chapter concludes with an explanation of long-term earnings profiles, or life-cycle earnings progressions, by means of which the earnings outcomes of vocational education are described. Findings, provided in chapter 3, are grouped into four categories: earnings, employment, education,  and aspirations. These results are presented: vocational graduates overall enjoy a long-term earnings advantage over graduates of a general curriculum; they are likely to experience less unemployment than graduates from a general curriculum; about two-thirds are expected to be in jobs of the same kind 5 years later; and they are somewhat more likely to say they need further schooling to obtain desired jobs.

Four issues were identified as central to adult education as it relates to human resource development and the improvement of the nation's economy. These issues are (1) the role of postsecondary institutions to worker education and training; (2) employer involvement in campus-based programs for adults seeking job- and career-related education and training; (3) increased collaboration by educators, employers, and employee representatives on training and retraining for the American workforce; and (4) the articulation of national policies for human resource development. The report cites relevant trends in  demography, technology, and the nation's economic condition and the impact of these trends on postsecondary institutions and adult learners. The report concludes that continuing education is a fundamental link between American postsecondary education and the workplace and that continuing education and better national strategies for human resource development are fundamental to the improvement of the nation's economy, productivity, and competitiveness.

        "description":"This study contrasted current job situations and existing vocational training program enrollments for males and females within clerical, data processing, and technical areas of industry. All vocational schools located in the eight northern parishes of Louisiana were surveyed concerning the numbers of males and females enrolled in clerical, data processing, and technical specialty programs of study. Likewise, a representative number of companies located in the same parishes were randomly selected and surveyed concerning the numbers of employees by sex currently functioning within the representative vocational areas. Data were analyzed and showed that vocational-technical schools continue to train higher percentages of females than males for traditionally female-dominated career  positions and have increased only slightly the percentages of females being trained for traditionally male-dominated career positions. The two exceptions to these practices were in programming, where there was a significant increase in percentages of females being trained for this traditionally male-dominated position, and in quantity foods, where there was a significant increase in percentages of males being trained for this traditionally female-dominated position. The findings suggest a trend whereby greater numbers of females are being trained for many of the traditionally male-dominated positions, although these numbers have not significantly reduced the current discrepancies that exist among males and females currently employed in these positions. At the same time, males are not  moving into traditionally female-dominated positions. (Author/KC)",

Therapists are beginning to appreciate the usefulness of the concept of the &quot;self.&quot; Rychlak (1979) notes that a humanistic approach in psychology emphasizes the importance of an introspective point of view in understanding human behavior. It is impossible to account for human behavior without taking the actor's perspective into account. In a similar vein, Kohut (1977) stresses the importance of the empathy of parents for a child's needs, and of the therapist in the therapeutic situation. A theoretical and technical position that emphasizes empathic sensitivity to the client's experience is particularly useful in considering the  experience of Afro-Americans. Minority clients' early disenchantment in therapy may reflect the failure of therapists to appreciate and respond empathically to the specific introspective point of view that the black client brings to therapy.

To investigate short-term longitudinal changes in memory, intelligence, and perceived competence in everyday situations among older adults, 227 adults were tested. Seventy-four subjects were middle-aged (55-64, MA), 95 were young-old (65-74, YO), and 58 were old-old (75-84, OO) They completed the Adult Mental Abilities test battery, three word-list tasks and a paragraph task, and the Q-Sort (Scheidt and Schaie, 1978). The tests were administered twice, with a 3-year interval. An analysis of the results showed that in general the MA group scored highest on all measures, while the OO group  scored lowest. Sex differences were found for the three word-list tasks, with women remembering more than men. For the spatial tests, men performed better than women. For the time of measurement effects, scores for immediate and delayed recall were significantly higher in the second administration, while word series skills decreased over the time span. Recognizing vocabulary decreased with time for the YO group. Spatial test performance increased over time for the MA group and decreased for the OO group. The YO group performance decreased significantly only for object rotation. For the social dimension, perceived competence increased across all age groups. The MA group rated themselves as active and uncommon, while the OO group rated themselves as passive and common. Women rated  themselves as more competent than men in social, common, and supportive situations; men rated themselves as more competent than women in nonsocial, uncommon, and depriving situations. Overall, perceived competence correlated with changes in memory and intellectual abilities. (BL)",

To examine the relative importance of the model in predicting parent/child solidarity among a southeastern United States older population in rural to urban transition, data collected from 321 adults, aged 65 to 96 (38% male, 94% white) were analyzed. Everyone 65 years or older, within the selected area, (82% response rate) was interviewed using a questionnaire designed to assess family solidarity (association, affection, and consensus) across seven categories of kin. In depth information on kin focused on the relative with whom  there was the most contact. The results supported the Bengtson et al model of family solidarity, as measured through association, consensus, and affection. However, only affection and consensus were significantly correlated. The extent of the exchange of helping behavior between older parents and children was a better predictor of family cohesiveness than was sex of the child, dependency needs of the parent, or the extent of telephoning and writing. Older parents who reported higher levels of mutual help, who had more positive attitudes toward their own aging, who were more likely to envision children as reasonably responsible to them in illness, financial duress and loneliness, and who had educational backgrounds similar to those of their offspring, reflected higher family solidarity  than others.

In order to investigate, under a quasi-experimental research design, the contribution of an educational program on retirement issues to participants' quality of life, and to study the program enrollment patterns, 21 people participated in an informal lecture/discusssion class aimed at maximizing awareness of options in retirement. Participants were 13 male retired veterans, 7 of their wives, and 1 female friend, aged 66 to 83, from a broad range of occupational backgrounds. The curriculum was based on a literature review and interviews with a sample of retired veterans from the outpatient Palo Alto Veterans' Medical Center. To assess the effects of course  participation on retirement adjustment, subjects and interested but not enrolled control group members completed pre- and post-class measures of change including three affective measures (Retirement Descriptive Index, Life Satisfaction Index A, and a likert-type inventory on retirement adjustment), and a cognitive measure covering information on the options for retirement. An analysis of the results showed that the class influenced the participants' satisfaction with their activities but not their quality of life or retirement adjustment. On the cognitive dimension, participants significantly increased their knowledge of option areas. Participants evaluated the interaction and discussion format of the class, the materials on attitudes toward aging, and the myth of senility as being most  valuable. Enrollment patterns showed that individuals who had previous success in educational activities were most likely to participate. (The class syllabus is appended.) (BL)",

As part of a longitudinal project to investigate alcoholism etiology in preschool children, a study was undertaken which compared families with male preschool children who are statistically at high risk for becoming alcoholic adults (N=9) to a sample of same-aged community control peers (N=9). (Male preschool children are \"high risk\" if they are the offspring of untreated, alcoholic fathers.) Home interviews and standardized tests were utilized to assess each child's developmental functioning including: activity level; mood; aggression; attention span; concept formation, using Piagetian-like tasks to determine knowledge of alcoholic  beverages; and parent-child interaction. Parents completed the self-administered Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (SMAST) and a drinking and drug history. An analysis of the results showed that control boys performed significantly better on indices of language, personal/social, fine motor, and adaptive development than did their at-risk peers. On tasks designed to assess knowledge of alcoholic beverages, the high risk boys had earlier and more sophisticated cognitive structures related to the concept of alcohol than did the control boys. No significant differences were found on parent report measures of temperament or child behavioral symptomatology. The data suggest that education programs about alcohol and its uses could appropriately begin with kindergarten, matching the  child's emerging cognitive abilities. (BL)",

To determine in what ways family competence in childhood might be associated prospectively with freedom from psychiatric symptoms in young adulthood for children at risk, three groups of families from the St. Louis Risk Research Project particpated in a longitutdinal study of family dynamics. The families included 25 families of parents with mental disorders, 10 families of parents with physical illness requiring prolonged hospitalization, and 21 families with non-ill parents. When the children averaged 8 years old, an interview was conducted with the family to rate family competence on 19 variables which were reduced to five factors: conflict, undercontrol,  estrangement, father overcontrol, and impoverishment. Offspring were administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule when they were at least 18 years old. An analysis of the data using structured equation methodology showed that parental illness increased family incompetence and family incompetence in turn increased offspring symptoms. However, only parental mental disorder and offspring symptoms were significantly correlated. The findings indicate that the competent young adult offspring of disturbed parents is competent because the parent's illness did not affect the quality of family functioning, and that symptoms of psychopathology in young adulthood may be related to having lived in a dysfunctional family.

To examine age differences across adulthood in relativistic and dialectical thought, and to determine whether formal operations are necessary but not sufficient for these forms of thought, 20 young (mean age, 19.6), 20 middle aged (mean age, 46.2), and 20 older (mean age, 68.5) adults were administered three cognitive tasks. The Ammons Quick Test was administered to determine the presence of comparable verbal intelligence. Subsequently, subjects were administered four formal operations tasks: separtion of variables; three measures of coordination of two frames of reference; and two life-like dilemmas, about which they were asked to react. Reactions to the dilemmas were placed into four  categories of thought (formistic-mechanistic, relativistic, awareness of contradictions, and integration of contradictions into a dialectical whole). An analysis of the results showed that older adults scored significantly higher on the Quick Test than young adults, with middle aged adults falling between the two groups. On formal operations tasks, performance was intact across adulthood. On the life-like dilemmas, older adults showed significantly less rejection and more acceptance of relativistic and dialectical thought. Guttman scale analysis showed that formal operations were necessary but not sufficient for dialectical thought. The findings provide potential support for the hypothesis that dialectical thought is post-formal operational. (BL)",

To investigate whether perceptions of and needs for control vary across different life domains, and whether the discrepancy between perceived and desired control would have independent effects on well-being, 340 adult (61% female) health clinic out-patients in Detroit were surveyed. Study participants completed a questionnaire measuring control (internal, control by others, and chance control), and perceptions and needs across six life domains (work life, health, personal life, emotions, actions and behavior, and life as a whole). Indicators of well being (anxiety, depression, and life  quality) were also measured. An analysis of the results showed that individuals perceived and desired different amounts of control across domains. Both perceived and desired internal control was highest in the self-oriented domain of actions and behavior, and lowest in the health domain and the other-oriented domain of work life. Desired control by others was higher in the health domain than in all other domains. Well-being was most related to perceived control in the domains of actions and behavior and emotions. Well-being was most related to control needs and \"misfit\" in the domains of actions and behavior and work life. On the whole, control in the self-oriented domains of actions and behavior and emotions appeared to be most important among the domains for predicting well-being.  (Author/BL)",

To examine the effectiveness of the programs and the characteristics of program participants, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) visited 17 runaway and homeless youth centers in 13 states to observe program operations, gather statistical information from the administrators, and to interview 353 persons associated with the centers including residents, parents of former residents, staff members, and community service personnel. The GAO's findings were generally favorable and indicated that the programs were operating as intended by the statute. The majority of the youths  sheltered were from the immediate geographic area and were not psychotic, violent, or substance-abusers. Staff members estimated that 20 to 40 percent had been physically abused and 14 to 35 percent were victims of parental neglect. Services offered included family and individual counseling, and outreach activities. Less than 50 percent of the youths were counseled after leaving the center. The majority of the centers were clean, well-kept, and adequately furnished, and had written rules of behavior. The very fact of the program's existence was cited as its greatest strength. Inadequate funding was cited as the major weakness. Participants' suggestions for improvement included expansion of the outreach and prevention services, increased networking with other agencies, expansion of  activities and training for youths, and enhancement of the physical condition of the shelters. The GAO suggested that more attention should be given to aftercare, outreach to high-risk youths on the street, and activities that develop coping and living skills. (JAC)",

Analysis of results showed that 67 percent of the respondents reported helping very much, with older respondents reporting significantly less helping behavior. All felt that helping others was an important activity in their lives. The person helped most frequently was a friend, neighbor, or relative. Most help was  in the form of a service. Types of help spanned a broad range from heroic rescue to small daily courtesies. Most respondents referred to enduring forms of help such as caring for an ill relative, and indicated that they considered the rewards of helping to be intrinsic in nature.

Issues of conceptualization pertaining to the definition of illness, its location in the research paradigm, and the context in which illness occurs must be addressed prior to dealing with methodological problems. Access to physically ill elderly persons is often controlled by health care providers who serve as gatekeepers and/or referral sources in a broad range of studies. The suspicion and reluctance of gatekeepers may be overcome by establishing contacts prior to soliciting participation and by considering the needs and perspectives of the institution. Informed consent is often difficult to obtain from older adults due to deep-seated fears, restrictions imposed by  families, and ethical considerations. Foremost among sampling issues is the difficulty of obtaining a randomized sample due to the potential threats of survivorship, health status, health utilization, and special population biases. Research process issues are hampered by the paucity of appropriate instruments and the effects of the patient's illness on both the process and the content of interviews. Data interpretation must take into account the generalizability of findings given the sampling difficulties with this population. To address these methodological research problems, a dynamic model, in which physical and mental health, the interview situation, contextual factors, and patient responses serve as input variables, is proposed.

Adults (N=284, 60 percent male), known to have chronic illness or substance abuse problems, were administered the IAS as part of a structured interview investigating health generated marital problems. An analysis of the results showed that this population sample had moderate success managing the illness adaptive tasks. Accepting being ill and uncertainty about the future, and keeping  an emotional balance were found to be the most difficult tasks. The area of least difficulty was communication with medical or professional staff. The reliability coefficient of the IAS was 0.88. Item to total correlations were significantly related at medium to high levels. Attempts to ascertain criterion-related validity involving comparisons of respondents' marital and illness adaptation problems were significantly related but were low in correlation, indicating that marital difficulties during chronic illness or health problems are not good criteria for evaluating illness or health adaptational problems. Of the four coping modes which respondents could choose in adapting to illness, the majority of subjects employed instrumentally-oriented coping strategies. Overall, the IAS proved to  be a reliable and valid measure, allowing the determination of coping strategies and adaptational outcomes. (The IAS is appended.) (BL)",

The primary caregivers were also interviewed 2 months after discharage. An analysis of the results showed that affect, socioeconomic status, and social support were predictive  of self-assessed health. These elderly individuals assessed not only their ability to function, but the extent to which other services were necessary to them, the extent to which someone had to be involved as a caregiver and was committed and able, and the extent to which giving care strained or burdened that person. The extent to which services from all sources were planned, received, and considered sufficient by recipients was associated with their perceptions of their own health.

The  research on behavioral parent training, in both group and individual formats, is reviewed. Similarly, Parent Effectiveness Training research, is reviewed, including discussion groups, parents as repondents, children and parents as respondents, and the behavior of children as measures of effectiveness. Research findings on parent training versus direct treatment for children are presented.

Results showed that, as predicted, individuals perceived themselves as both better than average and as more responsible for their partners' marital problems. The two forms of bias operated independently. The optimism bias was lower among  divorced individuals and those with a higher level of conflict. The responsibility bias was unrelated to respondents' marital status or marital conflict.

        "description":"Although many people have studied social intelligence and theorized about it over the past 60 years, no one has been able to provide a clear picture of its nature. Traditional methods have overemphasized the social-cognitive outcomes of human functioning instead of social-behavioral outcomes. Two approaches used to study social intelligence can be categorized as implicit and explicit theories. Implicit theories include four major ideas: being a prosocial person (sensitive to the feelings of others), having well developed instrumental skills (communication and leadership), enjoying social activity, and having a good self-concept. Explicit theories focus on two sets of interrelated abilities: self-assertiveness, which is the ability to maintain and promote the well-being of the  self in social situations, and integrative, which is the ability to maintain and promote the well-being of other people or the social groups of which one is a part. In order to understand why some people are more socially intelligent than others it is important to look at contributing processes. The single most important process is social planning ability. Other processes that appear to be important are an indivdual's perception of control, competence, empathy, and goal-directedness, and degree of interest in social kinds of accomplishments. An empirically coherent domain of social abilities can be identified if one stops trying to conceptualize social intelligence as purely a cognitive phenomenon, and views it instead in terms of effective social behavior that results from the  interaction of a variety of psychological and sociocultural processes.

To determine whether the cognitive distortion found in depressed individuals extends beyond self-evaluation and interpersonal evaluation into abstract decision making, 288 college students completed the Beck Depression Inventory and a variety of experimental materials, including a risky decision task in which they circled their preference in each of 30 pairs of monetary risk. An analysis of the results showed significantly different risk preference patterns for depressed and non-depressed subjects. Non-depressed subjects were considered \"good riskers\" in choosing maximum expected value gains and minimum expected value losses. Non-depressed subjects also  exhibited the reflection effect and reversed their preferences when prospects became negative. Depressed subjects failed to show either the pattern of prospect selection shown by the non-depressed subjects, or a significant reflection effect within their own pattern of prospect selection. The poor planning ability and risk taking strategy of predepressive children may have implications for later depression and learned helplessness. (BL)",

To evaluate residence hall life at Indiana University in 1983 using an ecosystem approach, 799 systematically selected college residence hall inhabitants (58% female, 49% freshmen) completed a questionnaire including forced-choice items and an environmental referrant section. In the environmental referrant section, students identified not more than five items on which they felt strongly, and described why they felt as they did and how the issues could be enhanced. The results of the 1983 study were compared with previous survey results from 1978 to 1982. Conlusions drawn from the results indicated that residence hall programming efforts had  improved over the years and students were more satisfied with the programs available in the halls in 1983 than over the past six years. Residence hall staff were highly regarded by students, especially custodians and resident assistants. Student government was doing a good job of providing leadership opportunities for students and responded well to student needs. Printed material that was provided to students was adequate, and study conditions and the general atmosphere in the halls were perceived positively by students. Food service was doing a fairly good job of meeting student needs. Finally, students liked living in the residence halls.

Subjects were given a brief sketch of each stimulus person, labelled as either middle-aged or elderly. They then assigned chronological age estimations to each slide, and rated each on bipolar traits according to a 7-point scale. An analysis of the results showed that the college age males' judgments of age, more than those of females, were influenced by age labels. When given extrinsic age categorizations, males tended to override facial cues as a  guide to a person's chronological age. However, the greater sensitivity of males to the age dimension did not imply the presence of age stereotyping. Male and female subjects did not differ in their attribution of personality traits to presumed ages. (BL)",

To evaluate age differences in coping strategies and whether these differences are attributable to intrinsic, age-based developmental processes or to differences in the objective or subjective nature of the illness stresses, 170 chronically ill adults completed six scales assessing coping strategies and objective and subjective measure of illness stress. The subjects (67 males, 103 females) who suffered from hypertension, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic blood cancers, ranged  in age from 41 to 89 years. The coping strategies studied were information seeking, cognitive restructuring, emotional expression, wish-fulfilling fantasy, threat minimization, and self-blame. A follow-up interview with 151 subjects was completed 7 months later. An analysis of the results showed that age differences in adults' styles of coping appeared in the areas of threat minimization and information seeking. People over age 75 were more likely to cope by cognitively minimizing the threat posed by the illness and less likely to cope by seeking out information about their illness and its treatment. Results are consistent with theories suggesting that late life represents a shift from active to passive mastery, and that older people are more likely to cope with stress through  self-reliance than by reaching out to friends or professionals.

To assess the prevalence of eating disorders, unusual eating-related behaviors and attitudes, and psychological states among college women, 677 women, from three private northeastern United States colleges, completed a questionnaire assessing depression, self-esteem, assertiveness, body image, size, and eating attitudes and behaviors. An analysis of the results showed that, although distorted eating attitudes and behaviors appeared to be fairly common, extreme responses were characteristic of a minority of the women. Of the 677 respondents, 1.5 percent could be classified as near anorexics, 3.7 percent as clinical bulimics, 3.5 percent as near bulimics, 3.5 percent as overweight,  and 87.7 percent as &quot;normals.&quot; The two bulimic groups were highest in depression and lowest in self-esteem and assertiveness. They significantly overestimated their body size, tended to weigh more than &quot;normals,&quot; to have the most varied and bizarre methods of losing weight, and to have the greatest weight fluctuations. Each group had unique patterns of eating-related behavior, with the overweight group representing a midpoint between the &quot;normals&quot; and the eating-disordered. (Author/BL)",

To investigate cross national differences in the value placed on autonomy versus togetherness in close relationships, 2,079 college students from Hungary, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Yugoslavia completed a questionnaire on intimate relationships. An analysis of the results showed that college students in the Communist countries (Soviet Union, Hungary, Yugoslavia) emphasized togetherness and rejected too much autonomy in relationships, while college students in the Western democratic countries (United States, Ireland, the Netherlands) emphasized autonomy, particularly in separate  friendships and hobbies. Across all countries, an emphasis on autonomy correlated positively with the gross national product per capita and with the level of democracy. In the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, men put more emphasis on autonomy and less on togetherness than women, while this pattern was reversed in the United States and the Netherlands. The higher the gross national product per capita of a nation, the less women valued dependence and togetherness relative to the males in that society.

        "author":["Robbert, Rosamond"],
        "description":"To examine the impact of old age upon an individual's sense of self we must look at the enduring self. An understanding of selfhood or self-consciousness can only be found by reference to the social activity of the individual. The interactional part of the self involves the individual in two forms of active social behavior, subject and object. The subjective form of self presents the self to others, while the objective form observes, interprets, and organizes reality as it is perceived. The interactional self experiences itself through three types of feedback loops: (1) nonsignificant reactive interactions; (2) self-awareness through role taking; and (3) inner consciousness of the objective self through external patterns of social interaction. The goal of the third level of  feedback is adaptation to new social situations. In order for optimal development and maintenance of the self to occur a number of processes must operate throughout the lifespan. Two of these processes are role taking and social comparison. For the elderly, inaccurate role taking may occur due to a discrepancy between self-conception and social definitions. The social forces in an ageist society and the temporal dimension demand readjustment in self-conception. The response is an internal role taking in which the self in its prime is used as a referent. This internal role taking is a dynamic process that involves not only the conscious inner dialogue that produces awareness of self as object but also the interaction between self and former self. Ultimately, the degree of internal role  taking varies from culture to culture according to the relative status of the elderly in different societies. Where old age is a valued status, role taking may remain largely external, using feedback from the environment. The concept of internal role taking can help clarify our understanding of the difficulties of socialization to a devalued position in old age. (BL)",

To explore the behavioral correlates of attitudes toward the elderly, 105 male and female college students, with a mean age of 24.5 years, participated in a two-phase experiment. During phase one, all subjects completed four attitude scales: Tuckman-Lorge Attitude Scale (TL); Semantic Differential (SD); Adjective Checklist (ACL); and Tuckman-Lorge Attitude Scale Revised (TLR). During phase two, those with the highest and lowest positive and negative attitudes (40 subjects) were exposed for a 5-minute period to a structured social situation which involved potential interaction with a 73-year-old female confederate. The interactions were  videotaped through a two-way mirror. Following taping, subjects completed the Ammons Quick Test as a measure of behavior and IQ. An analysis of the results of the tests and of the behavior ratings of the tapes showed that only the TL, the TLR, and ACL correlated significantly with one another. Sex was the only demographic correlate of attitude, with more men than women considering negative ACL adjectives as inappropriate for elders. Behavior in the structured situation was only slightly related to general attitudes as measured by the TL, TLR, or the ACL, in that individuals with positive attitudes produced more positive behaviors than negative individuals. The sum of behaviors was significantly correlated with age, suggesting that the older the subjects the more positive their behaviors.  Although general attitude scales were not useful in predicting behavior, context-specific behavior predictions might be possible using specific attitude items. (BL)",

The first chapter discusses the effects of alcoholism on the family and reviews a whole system of behaviors and strategies that are developed to handle the alcoholic family member and maintain the family's economic survival. Profiles are presented of family life and members' behaviors. The second chapter explains the most frequently used programmatic strategies to reach and help children of alcoholics, as well as the types of caregivers and the contexts in which these strategies are applied. Gaps that exist in the provision of  services are reviewed. The third chapter describes the kinds of agencies found in a typical community as they relate to serving the needs of children of alcoholics, the services they provide, and how they are funded. A case example of developing and financing a new program with children of alcoholics as the primary clients is presented. The fourth and final chapter explains how cultural patterns of behavior, learned by alcoholic families through interaction in differing cultural communities (e.g., Blacks, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans), affect the different ways they seek and respond to service delivery.

A value profile was established for each level of preparation (low or high) by computing median rankings for each value for all respondents in the category. An analysis of the results showed that preretirees with a high level of retirement preparation preferred terminal values which were action-oriented and self-actualizing, and instrumental values which emphasized  virtuous and altruistic, self-assertive, and cognitive interests, e.g., a sense of accomplishment, wisdom, social recognition, and inner harmony. Persons scoring low on the Retirement Preparation Indexes showed a preference for more self-centered and hedonistic terminal values, and for instrumental values that were other-directed in nature, e.g., obedient, polite, forgiving. The findings suggest that value orientation may be a meaningful predictor of preretirement planning. (BL)",

A program at the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, Minnesota, allows students preparing for a career in gerontology to undertake both cognitive and experiential learning activities. This approach enables them to develop a better understanding of the aging process and also fosters positive attitudes towards the aged. Cognitive learning is achieved by attending lectures, reading books, journals, and other materials, and through conducting library research. Experiential learning, which is an integral part of the courses, takes place  through participation in group or individual projects in an applied setting. The Benedictine Health Center (BHC), a health care facility located on the college campus, provides students with a variety of experiential learning opportunities. In addition to these opportunities, cooperative relationships have developed betwen the college faculty and the BHC staff. Students have assisted the faculty in an Andrus Foundation study examining the social interactions of BHC residents and day service adults with students, children, staff, and others. Students also conduct internships, hold part-time jobs, and do mini-projects at the BHC. Faculty invite BHC staff and residents to serve as speakers in their classes. College courses in gerontology and other disciplines are offered at the BHC, and  gerontology faculty provide in-service training to new employees at the BHC. (Author/BL)",

Sternberg, editor, and an essay in response to it. Following a note on the contributions made to the field of cognitive psychology by Sternberg and the Handbook, chapters of the book, which include conceptual issues, multiple definitions for intelligence, and a taxonomy of cognitive competencies, are reviewed. The contributed chapters in the Handbook, which focus on various aspects of intelligence are reviewed separately, with specific consideration as to how each aspect contributes to and broadens the definition of and research on intelligence. Areas which are covered include: psychometrics, perception and attention, learning and  memory, intelligence as reflective thinking, mental retardation and the instructability of intelligence, education, intervention programs, the cultural relativity of intelligence, and intellectual development. The paper concludes with reflections on two issues that were generated by the author's reading of the book. The first issue is whether intelligence research exists as a separate field of inquiry within the broad study of cognitive psychology. Arguments in favor of a separate subfield as well as potential dangers (e.g., stagnation and research issues) are presented. The second concern focuses on a need for the teaching of intelligence in light of the information processing and transmission revolution. The movement of teaching, from specific skills, which are being taken over by  computers, to skills in how to learn, and adaptation, is recommended. (BL)",

The activities involved such things as stopping in the middle of a lecture to have students either paraphrase a principle or definition or summarize what was just said, or having them compose or analyze metaphors and generate new examples or analogies. Instructors provided feedback by presenting one or more prototypical, appropriate elaborations, or by discussing some common misconception in elaborations. Despite the limitations of the study, several observations were made, among them that (1)  generative activities can be developed for most of what is taught; (2) implementing generative activities in large, college classes is logistically possible and worthwhile; (3) the effectiveness of generative activities in large classes reflects student differences; (4) students may not be comfortable when asked to engage in generative activities; (5) students may need training in the use of generative processes; and (6) providing adequate feedback to the students is crucial to the success of generative activities.

It was hypothesized that the special instruction could provide children with an internalized prototype story structure that could serve as a heuristic or planning device for organizing compositions, and that the instruction might indirectly affect other features of writing, such as creativity, cohesion/coherence, syntactic complexity, and length of protocols. Subjects, 19 fourth grade students identified (through story telling and scrambled story recall tasks) as lacking a keen sense of narrative structure, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. The first group received instruction in knowledge of story  structure, while the second received instruction in dictionary word study. Results showed that direct instruction in narrative structure did have a strong positive effect on organization in children's story writing. In addition, the instruction enhanced overall creativity, uniqueness, and language usage, and reduced cohesive errors. There were no meaningful effects on syntax or length of protocols. (Author/FL)",

Data analysis was conducted in three stages: identifying frequency of stragegy use, relating strategy use to test performance, and predicting reported use of strategies that were related to students' performance. Subjects, 224 college students, reported using an average of more than eight strategies when reading--most commonly, rereading to increase understanding. Few students reported using such metacognitive strategies as formulating questions before reading or outlining material after reading. Students' performance on a short-answer test was predicted by their reported use of skimming, anticipating the test, and rereading  strategies. These practices themselves were significantly predicted by one or more of the following components in the proposed strategy use model: strategy knowledge, perceived learner attributes, and strategy efficacy.

The structural-affect theory, however, defines stories on the basis of the emotional responses they elicit in a reader, and, for that reason, considers goal importance to be a critical component of storyhood. A study used the structural-affect theory to predict that two story structures would affect the ratings of storyhood and story liking: the importance of the goal the protagonist pursued and the difficulty the protagonist experienced in attaining the goal. Subjects--32 first grade, 32 third  grade, 38 fifth grade, and 41 college students--read specially created narratives that varied in terms of the importance of the goal to be attained by the protagonist and the difficulty encountered in attaining that goal. Data from all age groups confirmed the predictions. Results also showed that the subjects, particularly adults, expected the two structures to co-occur in stories, namely that important goals would be difficult to attain. The findings indicate that the story grammar and cognitive science descriptions of story &quot;interestingness&quot; are inadequate because they fail to consider readers' affective responses to stories.

Those in the two experimental conditions received instruction in the use of graphic organizers for 14 class periods and 7 class periods respectively, while control group subjects were taught by the reading-recitation method. Criterion measures consisted of both written free recalls administered before, during, and at the end of the instruction period, and a multiple choice test on the social studies material  covered during the experiment. Results indicated that the length of the treatment period was a critical variable, as students in the 14-day graphic organizer group comprehended and recalled significantly more information than control students, while students in the 7-day treatment group showed no reliable difference from control group students.

Students worked either in pairs or individually, with or without experimenter-provided learning strategies. In the cooperative learning situations, one partner summarized the text read while the other either simply listened or provided elaborative and corrective feedback. Recaller/listener roles were either fixed or alternated. Effects of cooperative learning strategies on  individual learning tasks were also assessed in a transfer task and eight measures of cognitive style and ability were administered. Findings showed that (1) cooperative learning was consistently more effective than individual learning, (2) recallers consistently learned more than listeners, (3) the summary recall and feedback strategy transferred positively from cooperative to individual learning situations, and (4) field independent and highly verbal partners facilitated the learning of field dependent and moderate verbal ability partners, with no adverse consequences to themselves.

The tests involved writing cloze tests on poems by poet Ted Hughes and on a poem the boy had written a year earlier. The boy was also asked to write a poem and then to discuss what he was thinking as he wrote. The following constraints were identified as operating during his poetry writing: (1) the subject must be exciting, (2) words must be more carefully chosen than in prose, (3) some details are inappropriate for poetry, (4) words must be vivid but not too vivid, (5) some syntax is inappropriate for poetry, and (6) the poetic line is significant. The interview showed that when writing, the boy generally had a vivid mental image to which he tried to match appropriate  vocabulary. Some words he struggled for, but some metaphors came easily and without self-consciousness. In a few cases he seemed unaware of the startling appropriateness of his imagery. Thus, the boy was aware of the poem as a type of writing with special constraints that encouraged him to express experiences with controlled vividness. He appeared to be very conscious of his overall purpose even though some of his most vivid imagery was presented unselfconsciously. (Author/HTH)",

        "description":"A study explored the attitudes of professors of advertising toward well-known advertising practitioners, and the effect these famous practitioners have had on the teaching of advertising. Four influential and famous advertising practitioners were selected from a preliminary list of 10. Six statements reflecting each practitioner's advertising philosophy were then refined. The 24 statements were randomly ordered and placed on a questionnaire mailed to all members of the advertising division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. The 75 respondents indicated on a four-point scale the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with each statement. The results indicated that the philosophies of William Bernbach and Leo Burnett were the most widely  accepted, that of Rosser Reeves was somewhat less popular, and that of David Ogilvy was not well received. The rank order of these famous practitioners did not change when correlated with the subject's number of years of teaching experience, although those with more experience exhibited more favorable attitudes toward Reeves and Ogilvy. By inference, these attitudes reveal what professors are saying to their students about advertising matters. (The scale used in the study is included in the paper.) (HTH)",

To create a collaboratively run writing workshop, teachers must first determine where students are in writing, in responding to writing, and in collaborating and then decide on the learning goals for the semester. Teachers can model effective feedback both in their written comments on student papers and by responding to student feedback to their own writing. They can monitor peer feedback by taping and transcribing selected discussions. With these transcripts, teachers can determine if, in  their own language, students are raising important issues in the writing process. Instructors can also use the transcripts in class discussions to help students see how susceptible their language is to different interpretations and to help them move toward a more complete response to the writing they read.(MM)",

While usually referring to nonfiction writing, courses labeled &quot;advanced composition&quot; range from expository and narrative nonfiction through fiction and poetry. They also include legal and business writing. Other courses differ from freshman composition in terms of intensity and writing style. Writing across the curriculum programs refine freshman composition with specific applications in advanced courses in the humanities or the social or physical sciences, often team taught or graded by specialists in both composition and the subject area. In terms of skill level, most advanced composition courses expect the students to do a great deal  of writing and to become active, engaged critics of their own writing.

        "description":"Part-time instructors make up an increasingly large percentage of college faculty. In English departments, part-time instructors take on the least prestigious and most demanding work--the teaching of writing--for low wages and without job security or professional recognition. This unfair treatment stems from the belief that the study and teaching of literature rather than writing and rhetoric are the business of English departments. The study and teaching of writing are considered too functional and unscholarly to deserve departmental recognition. As a result, part-time writing teachers are punished because they teach composition and because, given the time-consuming nature of writing instruction, they find it difficult to publish. This self-perpetuating segregation makes the  academic tenure system appear more exploitative of labor and indifferent to talent than are businesses. Although two-year colleges employ the largest number of part-time teachers, these institutions may eventually give quality part-time writing instruction the recognition it deserves, since two-year colleges offer more courses in writing than in literature, reward excellence in teaching rather than in scholarship, and are most responsive to changing educational demands.

Students must first become familiar with the scientific method so that they will have a general procedure for gathering and analyzing data for the project. To use the scientific method, students isolate the problem, observe evidence in order to form a hypothesis, devise an experiment or project that will allow them to collect objective data, and formulate a theory to account for the data gathered. After students understand how to use the scientific method, they must learn the general format for scientific or technical reports. In the Whitman project, students tabulate and analyze data on the vocabulary he uses in &quot;Leaves of Grass,&quot; and then write a short  technical report that presents the results of their analysis. The project demonstrates the possibility of meaningful interaction between the sciences and humanities. (Additional assignments and exercises are included throughout the text.) (MM)",

However, it is the fourth method that provides the underpinning of the freshman research paper. Because of the untrustworthiness of second-hand evidence, Locke outlined six specific criteria for weighing testimonies. Consideration of these criteria may promote the skepticism that student researchers almost entirely lack. The first criterion is the number of witnesses that report on a given incident, while the second is the integrity of the witnesses. The  third criterion is the author's design, intention, and purpose or goal in writing the piece and presenting the evidence, and the fourth is the circumstances that gave rise to the discourse. The evaluation of these criteria requires the students to examine the historical and political contexts of the source to determine what motivated the author to produce the piece of writing. The fifth criterion requires students to examine the internal consistency of the document. Finally, the sixth criterion examines the contrary testimonies on the subject. By using these criteria, students can learn to analyze and evaluate sources rather than use them as support in the simple sense of the term. (HOD)",

Specifically, the study investigated (1) how, in terms of common quantitative language units (mean words per t-unit, mean number of dependent clauses, words per maze, mean number of dependent clauses per t-unit, and length in words), the modes of dictation, independent writing, and retelling compare; and (2) how the aural comprehension elements (knowledge of character, events, and plot) in students' retelling transcripts may be described and compared both with each other and with the t-unit analysis. After the data were collected and the oral retellings transcribed, the dictations were analyzed for t-units, dependent clauses, mazes, and number of words. The  retellings were assessed using the Reading Miscue Inventory Retelling Guide to indicate how well the student retold character, event, and plot information. Findings revealed little difference among the three modes of expression. The only differences observed were that retelling produced more mazes and that fewer words were produced in independent writing than in retelling or dictation. Dependent clauses were used very infrequently, with the fewest number used in independent writing and the most in oral retelling. The data on aural comprehension revealed that the retelling of events was the single best predictor of composition quality. (HOD)",

Data were collected from a telephone survey of 205 households in an eastern United States community. Items used to measure consumer perceptions were based on a 10-point rating scale, and included attributes such as label information, taste, nutritional value, and variety of choice. The results indicated that generics were equally popular among most demographic groups with regard to perceptions or  purchase frequency and that generics were rated less favorably than national brands in all attributes except price. Almost half the respondents purchased generics occasionally, with the remainder evenly split between those who never purchase generics and those who buy them regularly. Findings also showed that the more frequently consumers purchased generics, the more favorably they perceived both the price, taste, and other attributes of generics and the overall quality of generics relative to national brands. The results suggested that price is not the only attribute consumers consider when evaluating generic products. (HTH)",

Results indicated that the MRI recent reading method of determining audience accumulation tended to produce significantly lower turnover levels than the SMRB two-interview method, but that the differences were contingent on circulation size. MRI turnover levels, for example, were no different than those provided by SMRB for publications with circulations under 500,000. The reason for this finding may have been based on complex interactions of the  proportion of in-home to out-of-home readers, the circulation size, and the frequency of reading measure. Since SMRB and MRI defined readership differently, the findings did not indicate which method of determining audience accumulation was most effective. (MM)",

        "description":"In an examination of the way people store and retrieve information from advertising, this paper draws a distinction between &quot;semantic&quot; memory, which stores general knowledge about the world, and &quot;episodic&quot; memory, which stores information about specific events. It then argues that episodic memory plays a more significant role in advertising's effects than has been previously thought. The paper applies episodic memory to questions concerning the role that emotional appeals play in influencing memory, choice, and purchase, concluding that conceptualizing emotional effects in terms of the episodic memory model is both consistent with the psychological literature on memory and useful in understanding how emotion operates in the persuasive process.

        "description":"English teachers have given some attention to aesthetic reading, usually terming it the development of literary appreciation, but many of the classroom practices used to foster that appreciation have been counterproductive. One consideration in developing aesthetic reading has to do with the means for promoting reflection in readers. That is, their willingness to contemplate what they are about to read or what they have read and its effect on them. Another consideration in helping students with their aesthetic reading of literature is developing their ability to engage in questioning and problem solving. Good readers distinguish themselves from weaker readers through the ability to ask questions and search for answers that promote greater comprehension of the text and of the  reading experience that accompanied it. Therefore, teachers need to create situations that provoke students into asking questions of their own in order to arrive at solutions that satisfy them. Reflection and problem solving promote the reading of literature based on an inquiry mode, in which shared discussion plays a major role. To introduce this approach into the classroom, teachers need to focus the attention of students on actual inquiry and response and to provide opportunities for frequent practice in the process. (The paper concludes with a sequence of activities connected with the reading of Robert Frost's &quot;Storm Fear&quot; that shows how such an approach might be introduced.) (HOD)",

Educational goals suggested by theorists include (1) using language and other symbol systems to think and communicate effectively with diverse peoples; (2) developing skills of lifelong learning; (3) acquiring a broad, interdisciplinary general education; (4) developing the ability to solve complex problems by analyzing and synthesizing information, thinking critically, making decisions, implementing plans, and accepting consequences; (5) developing the ability to cope with change; (6) learning to understand and use technology; (7) developing a futures perspective and a value system that includes concern for planetary survival; (8) developing  skills in group processes and concern for social problems through constructive participation in decision-making; (9) developing the ability to respond and express oneself aesthetically; and (10) developing skills and interests for use of leisure time. A close examination of these goals reveals their similarity to the statements on the essentials of education. Excellence in the English language arts programs for the year 2000 can be achieved by combining and blending these goals and essentials in a classroom where the students are actively and personally involved in learning.

Respondents were asked to determine how often they believed specific practices should be used at the primary, middle, secondary and postsecondary grade levels. The 101 responses received indicated that authorities favor a predominantly process approach to teaching writing. Among the responses were the following: (1) writing exercises, such as free writing and brief writing exercises of  about 5 or 10 minutes, should be provided slightly more than half the time at all grade levels; (2) students at all grade levels should be given the opportunity to select their own topics for slightly more than half their compositions; (3) the context for students' writing should involve a variety of audiences and modes; (4) writing needs to be connected to units of study in the content areas and the language arts; and (5) holistic scoring should be used at the primary level about half the time, primary trait analysis should be used for another quarter of the time, and the remaining percentage of assignments should be divided equally between analytic scoring and discourse analysis. These percentages change at the upper levels, with holistic scoring being used only one-third of the time.  (Appended is the questionnaire with responses.) (HOD)",

Fast and slow handwriting were identified from highest scores on any one of four writing &quot;tests.&quot; The writing samples collected were in response to a persuasive task since it required the most complex syntax. To ensure the complete development of ideas and strategies, students were given three prewriting activities. The collected writing samples were then analyzed for 18 direct or derived syntactic variables. Results indicated that enrollment in composition class was a significant main effect for 11 syntactic variables. Basic writers produced fewer words,  fewer T-units, and fewer clauses than traditional college writers. However, the length of the T-units and clauses was not significantly different. Traditional college writers produced twice as many left-branching structures and these were twice as long as those of basic writers. They also produced almost three times as many right-branching structures. The multivariate analysis of variance for handwriting speed indicated that it was not a significant main effect for any of the 18 syntactic variables. However, traditional college writers who were also fast handwriters produced more words, more T-units, and more clauses than any of the other subjects, whether they were also traditional college writers or fast handwriters.

The search program, chosen for economical reasons, was &quot;Classroom Instruction Program&quot; offered by Dialog Information Services. Available for a charge of $14 per hour, the program provides students with access to over 100 different databases. For the assignment, students were asked to prepare search objectives for any advertising-related topic of their choice. Once the students completed their search objectives and a command outline, they were given a very basic search to be typed into the terminal. This basic search provided a vehicle through which students could evaluate their  understanding of the search program before searching. After completing the rote assignment, students made their own bibliographic search. To reduce the telephone connect time, several constraints were included, among them the following: (1) students were assigned to work in teams of 3 to 5 individuals; (2) the number of bibliographic references typed was minimized; and (3) search setups were graded and corrected before signing on the computer. Instructor preparation was provided by the database vendors and Dialog. Especially useful were their training seminar manuals. Initial evaluations of the assignment showed the only deficiency to be too few searches. (HOD)",

The respondents supplied information concerning their schools and newspapers, their journalism training, and conflicts that had occurred between advisers and principals during the past year. In addition, they ranked personality characteristics and interpersonal communication skills on a specially prepared scale. Results indicated that (1) neither the adviser's nor principal's background in journalism affected his or her perception of the importance of advisers being certified in journalism; (2) advisers with journalism training were more likely to have  conflicts with their publication staff members than those with no such training; (3) the more college journalism training an adviser had, the greater likelihood that he or she would have conflicts with the school administration; (4) in ranking training characteristics for advisers, principals ranked teaching certification and college grades as much more important than did the advisers, who gave higher rankings to skills they would actually use in advising a newspaper staff, and (6) in ranking personality traits, principals selected \"supports school philosophy\" and \"understands community mores\" as most important, while advisers chose \"assertiveness\" as most important.

Student evaluators perceived people reporting high levels of communication apprehension as speaking too softly, providing long pauses for no apparent reason, having a shaking voice, apologizing for their message, not responding to their audience, blushing, and having trembling hands. They also evaluated high communication apprehensives more negatively than their peers,  seeing them as less credible, less attractive, less likely to influence opinions, and less effective in communication.

In general, the results support previous  research showing that females may be more communicative in their management styles than males. Specifically, no significant difference emerged between males and females when dealing with personnel problems involving a disagreement about whether a given task complied with an employee's job description.

        "description":"Labeled a &quot;citizen assessment,&quot; this study evaluates the effects of Massachusetts 2-1/2 during the first year after its enactment. The law limited taxes and changed laws relating to school budgets. The study focused on two areas: (1) the effect of loss of fiscal autonomy on school budgeting procedures, and (2) the changes in school spending resulting from the law. The study found major changes in spending, which affected the majority of Massachusetts school districts as school budgets were cut more deeply than other budgets. The total first-year local revenue loss amounted to 9.3 percent with the larger cities and towns sustaining the largest budget cutbacks. Shifts of power profoundly altered school budget processes. Budget-making at all levels became less political and more  hierarchical, while participation of citizens in local budget processes declined. School constituents were found to have less power over school budgets, while the indirect power of state government increased. Close to 12 percent of teaching positions statewide were cut. The study found that the allocation of budget reductions among school districts was educationally arbitrary; the schools in older, poorer areas with the greatest needs were hardest hit. The proposition had a traumatic effect on teacher morale. The study concludes that the impact of the law on Massachusetts schools is just beginning. (MD)",

The conceptual framework guiding the study emphasizes that educational organizations are not governed either by their structure or by the reactions of individuals, but are political organizations in which participants pursue interests reflecting their legitimate roles. Eight papers and an appendix comprise this final report. The first paper elucidates the theoretical and methodological approach taken, and the second proposes a political analysis of schools as organizations as a practical theory. The third paper is a study of political factors predicting turnover of school board members. The fourth  analyzes earlier management ideologies and endorses a multidimensional conception of quality of work life programs. The fifth and sixth papers report, respectively, a study of job-related predictors of teacher stress and a survey of the attitudes of teachers, principals, superintendents, and school boards toward teachers' unions. The seventh paper reports an exploratory study of the impact of interpersonal and intergroup characteristics on the teacher's decision to rely on collective action. The eighth paper presents a study of the impact of various organizational factors on teacher militancy. Finally, the appendices contain survey instruments and information on research design and data collection for this research project. (MJL)",

This position emphasizes micropolitics as well as macroinstitutional analysis and incorporates the elements of structure, cognition, and action, thereby taking into account both structural constraints on individual actors within organizations and the actors' voluntarism. According to this perspective, educational organizations are conceived of as political systems within which participants are political actors with their own needs, objectives, and strategies. The primary arena of  political conflict is the decision-making process; because the ability of the individual or group to have its interests represented is limited, coalitions emerge. Educational organizations are approached dialectically, through a historical perspective and in terms of the specificity and structure of the institutional system of which they are part. Two methodological implications are that the unit of analysis of educational organizations as political entities is the group, and that the case study and the large quantitative comparative study provide complementary information on which aspects of school districts are unique and which are quantitatively recurrent.

The first section reviews the basic elements of comparative structural analysis and demonstrates how these elements both inform and limit the study of school districts as organizations. The alternative &quot;loosely coupled systems&quot; approach is considered, and a political organizational framework for the study of schools is endorsed. The second section outlines the elements of a political analysis of school districts as organizations, identifying key actors in schools, specifying linkages between actors, and  delineating the types of strategies and tactics used to advance various actors' interests. The final section discusses the implications of a political perspective for educational practitioners, particularly those involved in organizational design, offering examples of design alternatives that would assist in the achievement of consensus.

        "description":"Because research on job characteristics as predictors of turnover is of debatable relevance to the study of school board turnover, the research reported here examines the impact of variables capable of capturing the political context. In a survey including data from 263 board members from 83 school districts in New York State, the dependent variable was turnover, measured by expressed intent not to run for another term of office. In the first stage of analysis, a large number of variables were correlated with the dependent variable. The 32 variables emerging as significant were carried to the second stage and subjected to a principal factoring with varimax rotation. True factor scales were then created for each of 11 factors that became the independent variables for the third  stage of analysis. In this stage, the factor scales were regressed onto the dependent variable to identify seven primary predictors of school board turnover. Of the seven significant patterns of activity, administrative deprivation of influence, length of time on board, and agreement with current board predicted board turnover. Factors predicting running for reelection were favoring more union involvement, feeling that teachers had usurped authority over control issues, a pro-administration attitude, and miscellaneous items expressing agreement or discontent with different groups in the district.

        "description":"This essay reviews quality of work life as a management technique and argues that quality-of-work-life programs, conceptualized multidimensionally, offer a unique mechanism for improving working conditions in schools and within districts. A brief analysis of major management ideologies concludes that some techniques advocated under the label of quality of work life share the limitations of earlier theories, such as failing to consider a positive image of the worker as active and knowledgeable. Three quality-of-work-life themes--control, participation, and cooptation--are significant in school districts. Involving a reconceptualization of the fundamental elements of an organization, major aspects of a holistic approach to quality of work life are the integration of levels of  analysis, the reduction of structure to action, the linkage of perception to behavior, and the interdependence and integration of actors in the organization. Broadly conceived, quality-of-work-life programs involve a process of diagnosis based on empirical data, intervention tailored to the specific needs of the organization, and evaluation. For further development of quality-of-work-life programs, issues including communication, supervision, role conflict, intergroup relations, physical work environment, participation, compensation, and career development should be considered in relation to various consequences of work itself, such as stress or job satisfaction.

Organizational stress is operationalized as the aggregate average response to a self-report inventory on the teachers' psychological and physiological states on the job. This analysis does not address the variance within an organization predicted by individual job characteristics and personality characteristics, but analyzes stress using organizational scores, emphasizing the shared variance in stress within organizations. Differences emerged between predictors of psychological and physiological stress and  between predictors of stress for elementary and secondary teachers. Among significant independent variables were rationality of promotion process, student/teacher ratio, decisional deprivation, role ambiguity, teaching support ratio, supervisory behavior, and routinization. The importance of this type of analysis is concluded to lie in its implications for alleviating stress by altering organizational structures and work processes. (MJL)",

Teachers, principals, superintendents, and school board members responded to questions on what areas unions should be involved in, degree of satisfaction with the local, and the state of labor management relations in the district. Teachers showed general satisfaction with their local and favored more union involvement in all areas addressed. Principals felt constrained by many work-related benefits teachers have obtained and saw the union as disrupting their ability to run their schools. Although superintendents were more strongly opposed to union involvement in work-related areas and more unsympathetic to  economic demands than principals, they were very satisfied with the union and with labor relations because they perceived the unions as a medium for dealing with the entire staff. School boards regarded the unions as limiting their ability to develop policy and administer schools economically and wanted unions to decrease levels of involvement in all areas. Thus a graduated shift in attitudes is seen as one moves up the district hierarchy, with attitudes reflecting the degree to which the union has helped or hindered the respondent's job performance.

Four dimensions of interpersonal versus intergroup behavior--social mobility versus social change, personal deprivation versus group deprivation, self-identity versus group identity, and variety versus uniformity of opinions--are presented as integral parts of the social psychological processes of categorization, identity, and comparison that underlie the individual's decision. Applied to survey data from 83 school districts in New York State, measures of these dimensions and of perceived legitimacy of power in the district are used to predict elementary and  secondary teachers' desire to have the union become involved in compensation issues and issues of professional prerogative. Results of regression analyses show the importance of both interpersonal and intergroup factors, particularly deprivation and identity, in deciding to rely on group action. Differences in results between elementary and secondary school teachers, as well as between compensation issues and issues of professional prerogative, reinforce the validity of making these distinctions. Suggestions are made for the further development of the social psychology of interpersonal versus intergroup behavior. (Author/MJL)",

Teachers in 83 New York districts were surveyed as to the most severe measures they would approve of to influence the administration on four items of compensation and seven items of professional prerogative. Independent variables measured teachers' individual and positional attributes and organizational factors including rewards, bureaucratization, work demands, promotional structure, and union and professional identity. The results of the analysis strongly support the study's approach.  First, differences in predictors between militancy over compensation issues and militancy over issues of professional prerogative reinforce the strategic choice aspect. Second, the importance of the organizational context is accentuated by the fact that each of the organizational factors predicted militancy and that different predictors emerged at elementary and secondary levels. Finally, differences between elementary and secondary school staffs also underscore the notion of militancy as a form of collective behavior. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"To investigate school districts' responses to fiscal constraint, this study examined the relationship between districts' expenditures per student and allocations of funds to instructional, support, and administrative costs. Budget allocations, as indicators of the districts' priorities, were compared for 1978-79 and 1981-82 in 46 Oregon school districts whose fiscal situations varied widely. The findings indicate that when fiscal constraint was greatest, priority was given to instruction over other budget categories, and to personnel over other objects of expenditure. As constraint diminished, larger shares of budgets were allocated to administration and to capital outlay. Surprisingly, however, the school districts in the sample generally did not experience fiscal constraint;  none of them had actual budget reductions, and both total expenditures and expenditures per student grew substantially in real dollars dispite Oregon's severe recession. Finally, although the sample districts had reduced the number of teachers, they had increased their total instructional staffs and decreased the student/instructional personnel ratio by adding less expensive instructional aides.

        "description":"This report begins with a summary of the implications of the Systemic Evaluation project as a whole, and then provides a framework for the commonplaces of schooling, along with an extensive sampler of the ways they can be used for building an information system. The first chapter presents some common conceptions of schooling that have typically guided school improvement efforts but that are insensitive to the dynamics of school change. These inadequate conceptions include input-output models, school effectiveness models, classroom learning models, and systems theory models. The second chapter accordingly presents an alternative conception that incorporates an ecological view of the dynamics of school change, recognizing the interdependence of circumstances and activities with the  way people respond cognitively and affectively to the total setting. It suggests a school-focused inquiry process that is compatible with the concept of systemic evaluation. The third chapter reviews several orientations guiding the use of information systems currently in practice and examines them in light of the role of information in school improvement. Fourth, a systemic evaluation sampler is presented and discussed in terms of a framework for sorting out the content of schooling and procedural issues. The fifth chapter outlines the &quot;humanization&quot; of data, or the ways it can be analyzed, organized, and reported back to people for use at different levels. Appendixes include (1) systemic evaluation questionnaires and data forms, (2) examples of feedback packages, and (3) school district  summaries. (TE)",

Chapter 1 traces Milford's \"Native American Heritage,\" from the prehistoric period through the \"infiltration\" of white explorers, missionaries, and traders. The portrait of Milford's first settlers in chapter 2 focuses on one \"Elias Chester\" and slavery on the Chester estate.

Chapter 4 expands the third chapter's focus on ethnography to include separate sections on &quot;Ethnography,&quot;&quot;Ethnography and Historical Method,&quot; and &quot;Educational Innovation and Life  History.&quot; This final volume concludes with a chapter on &quot;Paradigms in Debate.&quot; In order to protect the anonymity of the school district studied in such detail, pseudonyms have been used for all place names (school, school district, city, county, state) and personal names (school superintendents, school board members, teachers, students) appearing in the various volumes of this set.

        "description":"In response to a 1978 mandate, this concluding volume of the School Finance Project's final report concentrates on the broader intergovernmental issues relating to the design and transmission of federal policies and programs, and on the effects of federal activities on state and local education agencies and on schools. The specific Department of Education activities on which the report focuses are the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) (Chapters 1 and 2); the Education for All Handicapped Children Act; the Bilingual Education Act (ESEA, Title VII); the Vocational Education Act of 1963 (as amended); and civil rights statutes. After a brief introduction, chapter 2 traces the development of federal education activities and the changed focus of federal involvement  following passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Chapter 3 examines design features of federal education policies and programs, specifically the transmission of federal intent to states and localities through the concept of &quot;signals&quot; (i.e., formal legal freamework, legislative history, administrative decisions, and congressional review). The combination of program signals is presented for each of the major federal policies and programs. Chapter 4 examines implementation, focusing on how state and local officials shape federally funded services. Chapter 5 identifies the effect of federal involvement on state education agency capacity and functions, local education agency organization and administration, and school staffing and instructional services. An executive  summary of the findings is provided, along with four appendixes giving (1) a breakdown of participating states; (2) a history of individual programs; (3) a list of antecedent programs consolidated under ECIA Chapter 2; and (4) an explanation of legal provisions.

        "description":"A nationwide interest in master-teacher plans has arisen as a response to the general malaise in education, but the viability of such plans depends on finding answers to certain crucial problems. Some basic issues must be addressed before master teachers can even be identified: whether a heirarchy of teachers should be established, or prior conditions be met for appointing master teachers, or a maximum number of master teachers per district be set. Master teachers have generally been recognized through their superior knowledge of the subject, as well as for their teaching skills and ability to command respect. Tests can accurately determine a teacher's knowledge of the subject area; teaching skills may be measured against predetermined school objectives, with professional teams  judging teachers' performance; ability to work with others (command respect) can be guaged by a comprehensive file on teachers. The much-discussed criteron of producing demonstrable results in students is difficult to measure with public school populations, and so should be suspended until it can be more accurately and fairly measured. Once master teachers are identified, local districts must consider contract provisions for special roles in school programs and special compensation. Moreover, school districts must cooperate with government and university in funding and training for master-teacher plans. (JW)",

A discussion of the current context of the merit-pay debate focuses on the claims made for merit-pay programs and the assumptions behind the proposals. Following an analysis of similarities and contrasts among merit-pay plans, the author gives special consideration to the issues in selecting outstanding teachers: performance criteria, quotas per district, temporary or permanent awards, and the problems of evaluation. With the history of merit-pay debate as a background, arguments for and against the concept are then summarized. Since arguments for merit pay are often drawn from the analogy with business, a review of the use of merit pay in business and government concentrates on  the government's degree of success in adapting merit-pay principles to the public sector. The characteristics of a school are then compared to those of businesses, where merit pay has been successful. Finally, the author projects the political prospects of merit pay and assesses its worth in school reform. (JW)",

Accordingly, in response to current public scrutiny of the use of federal funds and of education itself, a historical review and assessment of the role of the federal government in relation to educational knowledge producing organizations is presented. After an overview of the immediate origins of the present proliferation of federally funded agencies in the 1960's and the assumptions behind that expansion, a historical background is provided, tracing earlier initiatives and the federal government's past connections to education. Topics include the original Bureau of Education (est. 1867); the intellectual origins of educational knowledge  production (1900-1945); the Eight Year Study, a pioneer government-sponsored research and followup study of curriculum reform (1932-40); the evolution of the Bureau, Office, and finally the Department of Education; the emphasis on science in the 1950's; the &quot;bureaucratic-professional complex&quot;; an overview of the rapid proliferation of federally sponsored educational research and development from 1964-79; and the formation and purpose of the National Institute of Education. The review concludes with recommendations for clearer understanding and greater coordination of educational knowledge production. (TE)",

        "description":"A comparison is presented of how teachers, students, and parents perceive the climate of the secondary schools in Greenfield, Massachusetts, as measured by responses to eight selected value statements about the purposes of the school. Agreement among teachers, students, and parents indicates a school climate of collaboration, while disagreement denotes alternative, potentially conflicting beliefs producing a school climate of contention. The data suggest that Greenfield students are more confident than their parents or teachers about the ability of the school to prepare them for later life. According to the students, whatever purposes parents and teachers think should be emphasized are being emphasized. By contrast, parents and teachers identified considerable differences between  what they wish to emphasize and what they believe is being emphasized. These results suggest that the differences in teacher, parent, and student perceptions about the purposes of the school will have important implications for the question of school effectiveness in Greenfield.

Having selected the schools for their troubled educational environments, the authors gathered data for 2 years from interviews with students and staff, from a formal assessment and school climate profile, and from such documented evidence of school climate as achievement scores, behavioral records, and attendance data. Three questions were asked of the organization and climate of each school: Will organizational change processes improve overall school climate? Do schools that change organizational processes improve achievement, attendance, behavior, and morale of students? What are the strengths and  limitations of the planned change model being tested? The planned change model given to administrators at the two schools taught skills in leadership, problem-solving and decision-making.

A summary of the history of the widespread adoption of the social promotion policy precedes a literature review outlining arguments against both social promotion and retention. The review then describes studies indicating that retention appears to have a beneficial effect on elementary school students and that the self-concepts of promoted and retained elementary students are virtually the same. Some new approaches to the problem are offered in the following section, which presents guidelines for  selecting children for retention, lists strategies for individualizing instruction, describes one widely publicized example of a district that abolished social promotion and reorganized its schools, and reports the experience of a teacher who decided not to follow her school's social promotion policy. A final section considers competency based education, financial concerns, and legal implications. The paper concludes that while competency testing and remedial programs are expensive and often controversial, schools appear to feel that they are serving students better through such policies. A bibliography is appended. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"Drawing on interviews, documents, and eight studies, this policy research study offers information and recommendations in order to fulfill the responsibility of the National Council on Educational Research to establish general policies for, and review the conduct of, the National Institute of Education (NIE). Questions guiding this study are: the subject and costs of research carried out by NIE's labs and centers; the perceived impact of this research and development on improving educational practices; and appropriate priorities for NIE labs and centers and strategies for more effective dissemination of their findings. Following an executive summary and an introduction, a chapter on reforming American education summarizes a content analysis of national studies, a survey, and  additional documents. The third chapter considers the role of the federal government in creating knowledge for educational reform, and the fourth chapter offers three historical perspectives on NIE's labs and centers. Barriers to effective dissemination of educational research are analyzed in the fifth chapter, and the sixth chapter presents the study's major conclusions and recommendations for improving policy management of the delivery system of NIE labs and centers. Among the appendixes are descriptions of eight projects that contributed to the overall study, steps in designing the research matrix, and lab and center missions and budgets. (MJL)",

After a brief introduction, section II's attention to the evolution of state boards offers a historical perspective of state intervention in educational policy-making, a review of major questions concerning the state's role in the last 20 years, and an analysis of the development of organization and cooperation in and among the states in their approaches to education. Section III, on policy formation, examines current governance structures in each of the five states under consideration and reviews their board agendas, priorities, policy formation and development processes, and research utilization. In section IV, the author itemizes current&quot;hot topics&quot; in policy development for each state and gives a state-by-state list of publications in that area. The fourth and final section outlines four areas in the process of policy initiation and development that need clarification or improvement in several of the states and offers five recommendations for state boards confronted with problems in these areas. An appendix provides a sample of the &quot;Governance Interview Sheet&quot; by means of which information for the report was collected. (JBM)",

Following a review of background information, state education agency initiatives and assistance activities are described, an evaluative overview is presented, and local impact is discussed. The state initiatives consisted of planning, training activities, and technical assistance to local education agencies. Planning was flexible, interactive, ongoing, and based on an open systems approach, resulting in a high degree of local participation and commitment to the program at nearly all sites.  State-sponsored training activities included an assistant superintendent's retreat, an instructional leadership conference, and followup workshops. Technical assistance was provided by an eight-person team that provided statewide leadership while encouraging local ownership and that developed networks and teaching/learning opportunities for local teams to share successes and build expertise. Impacts of the SITIP program on student achievement, student attitudes, teacher's knowledge of models, school environment, and administrators and central office staffs are reported, along with concerns and recommendations by local SITIP participants.

        "description":"A case study describes how a rural local education agency (Allegany County, Maryland) developed a comprehensive staff development system. It presents some contextual and theoretical background information, summarizes the problem as perceived by key actors, and then describes a series of activities resulting in the development of the comprehensive system. The early stages of the activity involved discussion among administrative staff, recruitment of outsiders, and clarification of goals and operating constraints. In the workshops that followed, an action research model was used, in which participants determined how each task (data collection, data analysis, selection, and implementation) should be done and who should take charge. Thereafter, a needs assessment survey was  developed, in which 26 concerns and 29 items relating to knowledge and skills were rated by the various role groups--administrators, teachers, and aides. In general, concerns given priority suggested a need to clarify goals, coordinate resource allocation, and improve cooperation and communication. Analysis of the results also indicated the need for differentiated inservice programs designed specifically to address a particular role as well as areas of common concern to two or more role groups. The nature of the process--particularly the emphasis on equity and interdependence--and the total involvement of the staff are the most important factors in producing effective staff development activities.

Accordingly, this module, the first in a series of two, has been developed as a training guide using the Hersey-Blanchard approach to leadership styles. It can help build principal-faculty relationships, superintendent-governing board relationships, and teacher-student relationships. The first section, &quot;What you need to know,&quot; provides a literature review of leader behavior theory, explaining basic concepts such as influence, task behavior, and relationship behavior. It then provides an indepth explanation of the Hersey-Blanchard Situational Leadership Model, showing the relationships between task-relevant maturity of a group and leadership styles. The second section  provides a series of learning activities and handouts based on this model. These include (1) a scoring and interpretation workbook, (2) five case studies for assessment of task-relevant maturity of groups, and (3) a set of leadership style role-playing kits, illustrating various styles of leadership and patterns of accommodation. A list of resource materials is included, along with sample training designs, references, and a short bibliography. (TE)",
