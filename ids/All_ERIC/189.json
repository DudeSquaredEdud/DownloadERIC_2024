        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the dimensions of the university students' perceptions of their science classes and whether or not the students' perceptions differ significantly as regards to the gender and grade level in six main categories namely; (1) pedagogical strategies, (2) faculty interest in teaching, (3) students interest and perceived competence in science, (4) passive learning, (5) grades as feedback, and (6) laboratory experiences. There were a total of 507 students from two big universities in Turkey, including pre-service middle school science and chemistry teachers, was randomly selected for the study. The study group consisted of 232 males and 275 female students in age ranging between 18 and 23. Questionnaire of Perceptions of Science Classes (QPSC), consisting of a 55-positive and negative Likert scale items, was administered to all students. The statistical results of the QPSC scores indicated that the undergraduates' perceptions of their science classes were significantly differ favoring female students in the grades of third year, and students' perceptions of their science classes showed a significant positive change from first to third years of the universities. Also, there was a significant difference favoring the female students on the factor of students' interest and perceived competence in science in the grades of second and final year. In the grade of third year, female students were significantly better than male students on the factors of faculty interest in teaching, grades as feedback, and laboratory experiences, while male students were better than female students on only the factor of passive learning in the grade of the first year. Appended are: (1) The Perceptions of Science Class Survey. (Contains 5 tables.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of scientific discussions based on student-constructed pre- and post-laboratory concept maps on students' attitudes toward chemistry laboratory in the university general chemistry. As part of instruction, during the first four laboratory sessions, students were taught how to construct and objectively score concept maps using a scoring scheme with a symbol system. Then, students were required personally to construct a map prior (pre) and after (post) each of the five laboratory experiments. Concept mapping was used as a tool to carry out the scientific discussions about chemical concepts involved in general chemistry laboratory experiments between instructors and students, and among students. In the experimental group, students (N=45) performed their general chemistry laboratory experiments using individual, small and large group discussions based on pre- and post-laboratory concept maps, whereas the control group students (N=46) performed their laboratory investigations using traditional approaches. A questionnaire of attitudes toward chemistry laboratory (QATCL) developed by the researchers was administrated to both groups to determine the pre-existing differences between the two groups as a pre-test. At the end of the study, QATCL was re-administered to all of the students in both groups to analyze the effect of the intervention on students' attitudes toward chemistry laboratory. The data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The statistical results of the QATCL post-test scores showed that there was a significant difference favoring the experimental group. Hence, it is concluded that scientific discussions founded on pre- and post-laboratory concept maps are more effective in improving students' attitudes toward chemistry laboratory than traditional teaching.

        "description":"Student-centered approach of scoring the concept maps consisted of three elements namely symbol system, individual portfolio and scoring scheme. We scored student-constructed concept maps based on 5 concept map criteria: validity of concepts, adequacy of propositions, significance of cross-links, relevancy of examples, and interconnectedness. With respect to the concurrent validity of scoring the concept maps in this study, correlation coefficients were computed between total scores of students' concept map and their scores of Prior Knowledge Test (PKT), and Achievement Test (AT) involved in the concepts of science laboratory experiments. The mean scores of students' pre-lab concept maps correlated much better with their scores of PKT (r= 0.615, p less than 0.01), and also mean scores of students' post-lab concept maps correlated with their scores of Achievement Test (r= 0.478, p less than 0.05). In regard to instructional sensitivity, the statistical analysis based on the comparison of both total and interconnectedness scores of pre- and post-lab concept maps indicated that there were significant differences favoring the post-lab concept maps (p less than 0.01).

        "description":"Some of the questions most frequently asked of the North Dakota University System relate to the status of graduates and program completers of state educational institutions. Follow-up Information on North Dakota Education and Training (FINDET) is a consortium of several state agencies formed to provide answers to those questions. This report, based on FINDET data, describes the employment status of 2004 University System graduates who were employed in the state one year after graduation. Highlights of the report include: (1) Approximately 59 percent of all 2004 graduates were either employed in North Dakota or re-enrolled in North Dakota colleges or universities one year after graduation; (2) A higher portion  (71.8 percent) of students who had graduated from North Dakota high schools remained in the state after college graduation; (3) In addition to the North Dakota residents who graduated from an NDUS institution, a significant portion of the 2004 graduates from surrounding states also remained in North Dakota following graduation; (4) A high proportion of programs retained significant percentages of their graduates in the state; (5) Graduates of NDUS institutions make significant contributions, not only to the private sector workforce, but also to local government, including school districts and state government; (6) NDUS graduates at all levels earned a median monthly full-time wage of $2,339 one year after graduation, nearly equal to the state median for all wage earners, even though it represents only the beginning of the income-earning phase for most graduates; and (7) There is a direct relationship between level of education and earnings, and also by area of study. These statistics dispel a common myth that the majority of North Dakota University System graduates leave the state after graduation: not only do a majority of all NDUS graduates remain in North Dakota, but almost two-thirds of students who had graduated from North Dakota high schools stay as well. The data also show that NDUS graduates are gainfully employed and that non-residents who remain in the state after graduation make a significant contribution to North Dakota's workforce. Classification of Instructional Program (CIP) tables and Methodological Notes are appended. (Contains 3 footnotes, 26 figures and 37 tables.)",

        "title":"Creating a University System for the 21st Century. Report of the State Board of Higher Education's Committee on Employee Compensation",
        "description":"The combination of North Dakota's lower standard of living and non-competitive salary and benefits makes it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain the best and the brightest staff and faculty.  Since 1998, campuses have been internally reallocating funding to provide salary increases to staff and faculty above that provided by the legislature. Internal reallocation is not a sustainable long-term solution without severe program and service reductions and/or tuition increases. Maintaining benefits and increasing salaries is critical to sustaining high quality education and entrepreneurial research activities. In order to continue making progress and in order to move North Dakota University System (NDUS) average salaries toward market rates, a significant state investment (in the form of parity and equity) is needed to provide campuses sufficient funding to retain and recruit highly qualified faculty and staff. The report recommends: (1) Total combined increase of at least 7.4 percent for faculty and staff is recommended for each year of the 2007-09 biennium; (2) That the state continue to fund 100 percent of employee health insurance premiums with no changes to deductibles or co-payments; and (3) that the state increase the retirement plan contribution from 10 percent to 12.5 percent and employee contribution from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for employees with over 15 years of service.

        "description":"The aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the implementation of Multiple Intelligences (MI) Theory in K-8 classrooms in Turkey. First, it was made meetings in small groups (3 or 4) with 38 teachers in one of the first MI schools in Turkey during the first semesters. They were 22 elementary teachers from Grades 1 to 5 and 16 teachers teaching science, mathematics, social studies, Turkish language and grammar, art and music from Grades 6 to 8. The main goal of the meetings for the first semester was to determine teachers' knowledge level about MI theory, the sources that they used to learn MI theory and their attitudes toward MI theory. During the second semester, it was focused on exploring these teachers' difficulties in implementation of MI instruction in their classrooms through the individual and group interviews. Also, classroom observations were also done to particularly understand how these teachers use MI theory in their classrooms. At the end of the second semester, some of students and their parents randomly selected were interviewed to identify their ideas and attitudes toward MI theory. The data based on the interviews and classroom observations showed that although most of these teachers, students and parents had positive attitudes toward MI theory, there had some important difficulties in the implementation of the MI theory in the classrooms. These invisible obstacles on the MI theory in Turkish K-8 classrooms were: (1) external pressures imposed upon teachers by Turkish National Curriculum, (2) central assessment system, (3) the parents' concerns about their children's progress through the subjects of the National Curriculum, (4) the problem of finding time for MI activities, (5) limitations in teachers' pedagogical repertoires about MI activities, and (6) the difficulties of managing the MI activities.

These posters were developed through PSTs' online and library research and scientific mini-symposiums in chemistry related topics in the framework of science, technology and society course (STS). During the first four weeks of STS course, PSTs (N=50) were taught about some important issues such as the goals for teaching science through STS, the topics to be taught, how the science and STS content be integrated, how to design STS instruction and how to prepare and present a poster. Fifty PSTs were grouped in small groups of four or five and freely selected their research projects in chemistry topics involving STS content. After their on-line and library research and scientific mini-symposiums, PSTs presented the poster presentations of their studies to all of students and educators in the faculty of education as a group of scientists in a manner of a scientific meeting and responded the questions of the visitors related to their posters toward the end of the STS course. Then, semi-structured interviews developed by the researchers were carried out with PSTs in small groups to identify PSTs' views about their poster presentations. The results of small-group interviews showed that PSTs described their poster presentations as a funny way of learning and they stated that they understood how the scientific developments are achieved by cooperative working which enabled them to feel as scientists. They also stated that this improved their self-confidence. They expressed that their poster presentations made the knowledge they gained in STS course more permanent and increased their curiosity and interest toward STS issues. Appended are: (1) Some photographs of PSTs' posters and poster presentations.",

        "description":"In this study, Pre-service Science Teachers' (PSTs) views about the potential benefits and existing barriers of their argumentation on the World Wide Web about what is happening in middle school science classrooms during two semesters of their practicum experiences were investigated. &quot;Special Web Group&quot; called the &quot;Collaborative Action Research in Science Teacher Education&quot; (CARSTE) was constructed together with seven PSTs. PSTs were individually asked to send their observations reflecting whatever happens in the middle school science classes to CARSTE. Also, PSTs met twice each week for a 3-hour group session in order to carry out face to face argumentation in addition to their online argumentation. Simultaneously, PSTs had online and face to face argumentation about important issues of science education, such as traditional teaching, constructivist approach, attitudes toward and perceptions of science, authentic assessment, and nature of science. At the end of this study, CARSTE compiled an archive consisting of 325 individual e-mails. Both a paper-pencil test consisting of open-ended questions and individual interviews were employed to identify PSTs' views about their online argumentation. The results indicated that the important barriers that PSTs encountered when using the CARSTE appear to be the lack of adequate access to a network computer and structuring time to engage on the Internet. The results of open-ended survey showed that PSTs' online argumentation improved their attitudes toward teaching science and self-confidence, teachers' behaviors as a science teacher and their knowledge and perspectives about the important topics of science education. Also, the interpretive analysis of interview data indicated that PSTs described their online argumentation as an interesting way of sharing information, discussing their ideas as well as improving their ability to use computers and Internet. Almost all of the PSTs stated that their argumentative ability during the time of the study. (Contains 3 figures and 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"Historically, tuition and fee rates of all North Dakota University System (NDUS) institutions (except the 2-year campuses), have been less than their regional counterparts. Average tuition and fee increases at NDUS institutions were significantly higher than their regional counterparts in 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07. As a result, the gap between tuition and fee rates at all NDUS institutions (except the 2-year campuses), and their regional counterparts has narrowed, and the gap at the 2-year campuses has increased significantly since  2003-04. This reversed slightly in 2007-08, when average tuition and fee increases at NDUS institutions averaged lower overall than their regional counterparts' increases. Funding for the needs based state grant program has not kept pace with tuition increases, and has declined as a percent of estimated tuition collections. A number of additional factors to consider when examining the affordability of public higher education to North Dakota residents are suggested, including: (1) Tuition and fees, as a percentage of median North Dakota household income, are about 1 percent higher than the regional average for all NDUS campuses, except the two-year campuses, which are 2.5 percent higher than the regional average; (2) Data suggests that, when comparing NDUS institutions other than the two-year campuses to peer institutions, generally North Dakota's four-year institutions are still more affordable for those families who have the least ability to pay; tuition and fees continue to be significantly higher than the peer average at the two-year campuses for those families who have the least ability to pay; (3) Approximately 29-40 percent of NDUS students qualified for federal and state needs-based aid in 2006-07, a significant decrease from 2005-06; (4) State Grant funding as a percent of tuition collections has declined from more than 2 percent in 1989-91 to 1.88 percent in 2007-09; (5) In 2006-07, less than 17 percent of the qualified needy students who applied for a State Grant received funding due to a lack of adequate program funding; (6) During academic year 2006-07, 84 percent of the total State Grant funding was awarded to students who attend public and tribal post-secondary institutions, and 16 percent was awarded to private post-secondary institutions; (7) Total funding for Federal Pell Grant and campus-based financial aid has remained fairly steady between 1989-90 and 2006-07; and (8) Student loan borrowing for students who attend NDUS campuses has increased each year between 1989-90 and 2006-07. Five appendices are included: (1) History of Federal Financial Aid; (2) NDUS Campus Combined Loan, Grant/Campus-Based Financial Aid Information; (3) Average Student Loan Indebtedness by Year; (4) Tuition s a Percent of Income; and (5) Comparison of North Dakota, Regional and National Averages 2007-08 Resident Undergraduate Tuition and Required Fees.

This study was conducted in the context of a three-year NSF project, namely, Translating Information Technology into Classroom (TITiC). A survey consisting of Likert scale items and open-ended questions was administered to 45 students (29 females and 16 males) from Grades 9 to 12. The results of this study showed that on the average 79.37%, 90.83%, and 81.33% of the students developed better attitudes toward, perceptions of, and self-confidence in science, respectively. These increases were further supported by evidence from qualitative data. (Contains 3 tables.)",

The 2007 report reflects some of the many ways North Dakota University System (NDUS) colleges and universities are developing the human capital needed to create a brighter future for citizens and the state. The Roundtable on Higher Education, a group of state leaders from the public and private sectors, established new expectations for the North Dakota University System. In addition to providing high quality education, roundtable members charged the NDUS with playing a major role in revitalizing North Dakota's economy. Roundtable members also identified key cornerstones on which to build a university system for the 21st century. They developed accountability measures, which then were established in legislation and now are being used to determine how well roundtable expectations are being met. Accordingly, the 2007 Accountability Measures Report is organized by the roundtable cornerstones. Overall, the colleges and universities that make up the North Dakota University System perform very well when compared to other states and national standards. Findings in this report are organized by the following five cornerstones: (1) Economic Development Connection; (2) Education Excellence; (3) Flexible and Responsive System; (4) Accessible System; and (5) Funding and Rewards.

        "description":"This report presents statewide, complex area, and individual school summaries of students' post-secondary plans for the year following their completion of high school. The Senior Exit Plans Survey (SEPS) Coordinator at each school, usually a school counselor, was responsible for distributing, collecting, checking, and returning the completed surveys to the Evaluation Section for scanning and tabulation. The SEPS Coordinator was also responsible for reporting the number of seniors and graduating juniors enrolled at the time the survey was administered. School personnel, primarily teachers and counselors, administered the survey to all seniors and graduating juniors between April and June 2007. The SEPS was distributed to regular public high schools and to charter schools that expressed an interest in participating. At regular public schools, SEPS coordinators were asked to complete a Senior Exit Plan Survey response form that indicated the number of seniors enrolled. Graduating juniors were included in the senior enrollment total. A reported 10,264 seniors (and graduating juniors) were enrolled at the time of the survey. Of these students, 93% (9,536) returned the survey form. At public charter schools, the director was most often the person who completed the Senior Exit Plan Survey form. The participating public charter schools reported 60 seniors enrolled at the time of the survey. Fifty-eight students returned the survey form for a return rate of 97%. To find out about their post-secondary school plans, high school completers were asked what will they most likely be doing in the first year after high school: do they plan to go to school, work, or join the military, or do they have multiple plans, for example, attend school and join the military? More than eighty percent of students included school in their post-secondary plans, and the majority indicated they planned to attend school and work. Less than ten percent indicated multiple plans that would include school, work, and the military. The survey instrument is appended. (Contains 17 tables.) [For 2006 report, see ED500747.]",

        "description":"This annual report provides a retrospective glimpse of Hawaii public schools for school year 2006-2007. Each year, it provides highlights for partners and stakeholders, new comparisons, presentations, and displays of current Department of Education information while maintaining the reporting of core data, such as student achievement, in a user friendly format. This year's report features on-going partnerships with local agencies and provides additional information about the level of kindergarten readiness of the state's youngest stakeholders. Recent statewide initiatives discussed in the body of this report encourage private and community agencies to join together in an effort to ensure children enter schools healthy and well-prepared for academics, the schools provide high quality programs meeting the needs of all our students, and the students exit schools fully prepared to pursue post-secondary education or careers. The annual report highlights information on school performance and improvement in Hawaii's public schools. The report profiles noteworthy academic events, trends, and outcomes at two organizational levels: state and complex. Featured are tables, figures, and narrative sections related to demographic, financial, and educational performance. Also, comparisons to other states with relevant characteristics similar to Hawaii are provided to illustrate this State's relative progress or status on specific indicators. Included herein is a conversation with Superintendent Patricia Hamamoto, strategic goals 2005-2008, and a ten-year strategic plan. Appendix A provides a glossary of terminology; Appendix B contains 19 references and resources; and Appendix C lists 14 data tables that are available online. [For the 2006 report, see ED500302.]",

After Turkish Republic was established by Ataturk in 1923, many radical revolutions, including the Turkish Education System, were made in order for Turkey to reach the level of contemporary civilizations. In the last two decades, Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory has been an important instrument of discussions to improve all learners' cognitive, affective, and behavioral development. The first studies about the MI theory were made after the second half of 1990s. In this study, the initial efforts of the MI theory in Turkey, the reasons for MI theory attracting attention in Turkey, the problems encountered in the implementation of MI theory and the impact of MI theory on the recent Turkish education reform are presented.",

The 4 schools for Women in Engineering (WIE) strategy was to  form all-female teams to train teachers and to serve as in-class resources for them. STEM  Teams developed gender equitable engineering units to be used in 8th grade science  classrooms and helped middle school teachers implement the new units for the engineering  strand of the Massachusetts Frameworks. The strategy was implemented in eight public  school districts in the greater Boston area. The evaluation focused on how teachers and STEM team members experienced the program and what the impact of the intervention was on students. Teachers' and STEM Team members' perceptions were assessed through open-ended anonymous questionnaires completed after the implementation of the intervention. The impact of the intervention on students was assessed through comparing attitudes toward engineering, mathematics, science, and STEM fields and careers before and after the intervention.",

This report is based on data collected from 43 K1 classrooms and 85 K2 classrooms in 67 different BPS schools in the 2005-2006 school year. Integrated classrooms were included in the sample, as were SEI and bilingual classrooms. The BPS Needs Assessment consisted of classroom observations, surveys of classroom teachers and school principals, as well as surveys completed by 844 families with children in the selected classrooms. The report makes nine recommendations: (1) Bring all K1 and K2 programs up to the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) Early Childhood Program Standards and the BPS Citywide Learning Standards for Kindergarten; (2) Ensure that all classrooms meet the NAEYC Early Childhood Program Standards for health and safety; (3) Provide all K1 and K2 classrooms with the equipment and materials needed to provide a high-quality early childhood program for all students; (4) Ensure that all K1 and K2 classrooms have a paraprofessional present for the entire day and that class sizes meet NAEYC Early Childhood Program Standards of no more than 10 children per teacher (and paraprofessional) in K1, and no more than 12 children per teacher (and paraprofessional) in K2; (5) Ensure that all K1 and K2 classrooms have a paraprofessional present for the entire day and that class sizes meet NAEYC Early Childhood Program Standards of no more than 10 children per teacher (and paraprofessional) in K1, and no more than 12 children per teacher (and paraprofessional) in K2; (6) Boston currently has a system of mixed delivery of early childhood education, including the BPS Early Childhood programs, Head Starts and community centers. Planning efforts and programs of BPS Early Childhood should identify ways to strengthen this mixed delivery system to ensure all children enter school ready to learn; (7) Improve school bus transportation for K1 and K2 children; (8) Provide before and after school programs in the schools; and (9) Expand cooperation between schools and families through additional supports for family-school communication.

To address these topics, the authors examined data obtained from all 187 districts that had an approved state program for LEP students in school year 2000-2001. The data were provided on the district annual reports. The authors also used data reported by districts in previous years. The district reports were checked for consistency, and districts were contacted when discrepancies were found. Since school- level data are not collected on the program, the report provides data aggregated at the state and district levels. Districts began reporting the number of LEP students at the school level in the spring of 2000. However, program data are not available at the school level. (Contains 29 tables and 19 figures.)

        "description":"Research on school-age children (those between the ages of 5 and 12) indicates that an estimated 4 million regularly spend time without adult supervision. There is growing evidence that quality out-of-school opportunities matter, complementing environments created by schools and families and providing important \"nutrients\" that deter failure and promote success, in ways that are observable and measurable. This publication highlights a variety of benefits and challenges of after-school programs, including: (1) Health and well-being; (2) Growing need for 21st century skills; (3) Out-of-school time workforce; (4) Economic costs and benefits; (5) Public support; (6) Trends in public funding; and (7) Strengthening the field. The report advocates that after-school programs should complement, rather than duplicate, services offered in the school and community in order to reach more students and sustain funding, while retaining familiarity with the local school improvement plan in order to enhance program quality.

        "description":"More than 60% of all community college students are placed into remedial, non-credit bearing courses. Concerns over the lack of articulation across the K-12 and postsecondary educational systems have led to concerns over whether students have had the opportunity to learn and demonstrate the skills required for success in college level classes. To measure the degree to which the expectations across these systems are consistent, the degree of alignment between the examinations at these two levels was explored. The California Community College placement test content was compared to the high school level California Standards Tests in General Mathematics, Algebra 1 and Geometry. Only the General Mathematics was aligned across a substantial number of standards. Taking into consideration past studies, it appears that the major source of misalignment between the two testing systems occurs within the content areas of Integers and Rationals, Trigonometry and Graphing.

        "description":"For the past 10 years a rural Pennsylvania school system has worked to develop a high quality educational technology program. In 1997 the district surveyed its faculty and found that there was a low level of technology infusion in the teaching/learning processes. Teachers were also found to be uncomfortable with computers and software applications for both the classroom and also in their lives at home. Between 1997 and 2007 there were a number of changes in the district's curriculum, and a significant infusion of hardware and software was carried out. The district also provided continuous professional development and technical support for its teachers. The survey in 2007 provided data indicating that the situation had changed and technology is now widely utilized. One finding from the 2007 survey was that the home use of computers is a significant predictor of a teacher's embracing educational applications for educational technology. Another significant factor in technology understanding is whether the teacher is an elementary or secondary level educator. Survey is attached. (Contains 2 tables.)",

The research method consisted of Likert-scale survey with space provided for students' comments about the two parallel foci of science as inquiry. The data were collected from 45 students (29 females and 16 males) from Grades 9 to 12. The results of this study has indicated that on the average 82.06% and 78.71% of the students developed better understanding of, and abilities necessary to do scientific inquiry, respectively.  These increases were further supported by evidence from qualitative data. This study lays the foundation for future studies on mapping learning progressions on scientific inquiry with information technologies. This study reiterates the need to emphasize the importance of \"how do we come to know what we know in science\". (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "author":["Glanz, Jeffrey"],
        "description":"Drawing on historical research, this paper draws attention to Dewey's oft-neglected, but no less brilliant work published in 1929, The Sources of a Science of Education.  Dewey's critique of efforts in his day to seek \"quick-fixes\" to practical educational and curricular issues by employing premature scientific investigations and findings has relevance not only from a historical perspective, but can provide a lens from which to understand current supervisory practice common in many schools. The paper examines Dewey's work by examining the rise of efforts towards a \"science of supervision\" starting in the twenties and thirties, and continuing through the forties. Dewey and some others harshly criticized attempts to emphasize a definitive \"science of education,\" paying little attention to the artistic side of the field, without mindful attention to the exigencies of scientific discovery. Efforts to quantify, categorize teaching practices in dogmatic ways were criticized by Dewey. Supervisors who tried to apply the \"science of teaching\" to a \"science of supervision\" were similarly criticized. Current standards-based supervisory practices (e.g., walk-throughs) can be viewed as another historical instance of the proclivity of some educators to apply arbitrary standards and unproven supervisory strategies. Through examination of Dewey's critique of scientific dogmatism in his day and use of oral history testimony from selected retired professors of supervision who can comment on scientific supervision at the time, this paper draws historical parallels to current supervisory practices. Interestingly, examining the state and eventual fate of scientific supervision in the last century may provide insights into the future of supervision.",

          "Sullivan, Susan"],
        "description":"This paper reports on an ongoing 3-year study of the current status of instructional supervision within New York City public schools.  Under the influence of a centralized and bureaucratically managed system (i.e., top down initiatives), educational reform in New York City has had serious consequences for both the theory and practice of instructional supervision. Supervision, for the most part, remains a monitoring or inspectional task reminiscent of older forms of supervision. Although reform measures address the need for increased supervision and professional development, principals and their assistants perform predominantly non-instructional duties and evaluative functions. Supervision, as a means to promote instructional dialogue to improve teaching in the classroom, has been the responsibility primarily (although unofficially) of coaches (a position created in the restructuring of schools).  Results from this descriptive study indicate that these coaches have little, if any, formal training in supervision. An underlying motif or question of this study is the extent to which supervision as improvement of instruction has been abdicated by principals or usurped by coaches (not personally but as a result of bureaucratic and administrative fiat) given their charge to work with teachers in the classroom. Factors that precipitated such a situation are explored by reports from interviews with New York City public school teachers (previous research study), coaches (previous research study), principals, and assistant principals. To shed a realistic light on these and related matters, the presenters have invited a former coach and current assistant principal to offer first-hand experiences.  She will offer first-hand testimony regarding reform efforts and the status of instructional supervision in New York City. The final phase of the study will ensue over the course of the next year by assessing the impact of reform measures and supervisory practices on classroom teaching and student achievement.",

Searches on web sites of education organisations, an electronic magazine, and the Australian Education Index were conducted to identify documents, news reports and educational literature referring to the five initiatives. Content analysis method was applied to summarise and categorise the documents. The results showed that policy making during this phase of national curriculum collaboration has shifted from establishing national consistency to introducing standards-based education, and reports published by the news media and the education profession have increased since this shift occurred. The conclusion indicated that, whilst a national debate has emerged on this issue, only a small proportion of policy makers and leaders within the education community has been engaged in contributing to this debate.",

        "description":"Supervision as a field, in the main, remains susceptible and thus vulnerable to various forces, ideological and otherwise, that constrain its ability to play a significant role in instructional improvement and thus in educational leadership. Adherence to inspectional and fault  finding supervision under the guise of standards-based and other practices has serious consequences for the improvement of teaching and student achievement. Unless those of us who are committed to the study of supervision in higher education, as well as school administrators and other practitioners who supervise teachers, are ready, willing, and able to assert responsibilities for best practice in supervision through transformational leadership the educational landscape will remain in its transitory and vulnerable state, inconsequential at best, destructive at worst. Relying on the social and educational critiques of Robert Goldhammer and Jules Henry, this article seeks to raise the consciousness of those committed to instructional excellence by offering insights into ways supervision can serve to enhance teachers' dignity, impact student learning, and transform our work, and even schools themselves, so that vulnerability turns into possibilities and stagnation into transformation.",

The sample consisted of 248 students (121 boys, 127 girls) from grades 3-5 at two private schools in Beirut, Lebanon. Results showed evidence for DISCOVER's concurrent validity with the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices, as correlations between students' DISCOVER ratings in spatial intelligence and their Raven scores were high, whereas correlations between students' DISCOVER ratings in linguistic intelligences and their Raven scores were low. Interviews with teachers and parents corroborated the results, with a few exceptions. Of the total sample, 14.5% were identified, with no gender differences.

        "description":"This descriptive report examines the strategies of the six Southeast Region states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) to improve high school graduation rates and student achievement and to increase the number of students leaving high school with the skills and knowledge necessary for the twenty-first century. These state-level strategies are organized into six themes or &quot;levers for change&quot;: (1) Standards and assessments (Alignment of standards and assessments with expectations for post-secondary education and with twenty-first century skills); (2) Course requirement (Revised graduation requirements to include courses required for college and mandatory course sequences that make a stronger connection to work readiness); (3) Student support and access to courses (Increased student access to both the courses and the support they need through strategies such as virtual schools, support for Advanced Placement courses, and mandated remediation); (4) Model schools and practices (Creating new model high schools, redesigning existing schools, implementing specific practices such as career academies); (5) Local capacity-building (Building the capacity of local schools and districts to support reform by providing direct professional development or providing coaches or technical assistance teams at schools); and (6) Partnerships and public involvement (Establishing partnerships to support high school reform). State leaders are using their visibility to increase attention to high schools. Deciding which strategies within each lever have the highest potential for accomplishing the desired results is a challenge. Engaging states in a systematic examination of strategies can help states make sound decisions about what policies and interventions can best improve student learning in their state. The report provides information to help states engage in such a systematic process. The list of strategies described under each lever can give policymakers ideas about approaches to consider. But the authors do not mean to endorse every strategy or approach currently being used by states. Instead, policymakers should examine the research literature to discover what studies have found about a strategy's implementation issues and its effectiveness in improving student outcomes. Based on the research, policymakers will want to consider the appropriateness of using a specific strategy to improve student outcomes. This report introduces examples of the key research for each lever. After choosing a strategy, policymakers should monitor implementation of the strategy and evaluate its outcomes. The report concludes with three examples of ways states are currently evaluating strategies in three different levers. Appendixes include: Research methodology; State profiles providing more detailed description of how each of the six states in the Southeast Region use the six levers for change; and Protocols for collecting state-level information.

As a result of the No Child Left Behind Act, education systems are finding it important to track students across grades and are realizing the complications in such tracking. Students might move to different schools throughout their academic career, and with multiple variants of non-Anglo-American names, students' academic history might be easily lost. To facilitate tracking within and across schools, states in the Appalachia Region have created identification (ID) numbers. They have also established procedures for ensuring that two students with the same name do not have the same ID number and that a student who moves does not get a different ID number. But systems that depend on ID numbers are not infallible. When ID numbers must be validated, the name that accompanies the number must be consulted. So the tracking system still heavily relies on names. Because some students come from cultures with differently structured names, it is essential to recognize whether two names are truly different or whether they are predictable variants of the same name. A tracking system must uniformly record students' names so that records linked to those names can be retrieved reliably. The parts of a name and the order in which they appear differ depending on language and culture. Many cultures do not follow the typical Anglo-American format: first name, middle name, last name. Problems arise when the student's name is Juan Carlos Hernandez Gonzalez rather than John Robert Smith. And it is essential to be able to accommodate these types of format. When a student's name does not match the expected format of first name, middle name, last name, the person registering the student must decide how to fit the name into the name field provided. Subsequent recordings must be uniform. The report provides an overview of naming conventions and ways to address parents for each of the eight languages other than English that are most common in the Appalachia Region. References are provided by language. Information about the sources in the report is appended. (Contains 2 tables.)

Two distinct trends in the nature of the American student population are identified: significant demographic shifts and the emerging necessity of serving adult learners. These shifts are prompting state policymakers to reexamine education policies and devise new ways to address postsecondary education financing and financial aid issues. During program leadership institutes, several experts provided insight into how states might better align appropriations, tuition, and financial aid policies. Examples from Colorado, Indiana, Oklahoma, Illinois, and Virginia are cited. Through the &quot;Changing Direction&quot; project, the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education and its partners hope to assist state policymakers as they create state higher education appropriations, tuition, and financial aid policy that is more integrated and based on more informed decision-making. Intended to expose important constituencies to critical issues in higher education that affect access and success for all students, the leadership institutes are an integral component of the project.

GAO reviewed: (1) college students' insurance status; (2) uninsured college students' characteristics; (3) the extent to which colleges offered student insurance plans and the characteristics of available plans; and (4) efforts to increase the number of insured students. Data from a national survey on college students' insurance status and uninsured college students' characteristics was surveyed. GAO collected data from 340 colleges on the availability of student insurance plans and the characteristics of available plans, and gathered plan information from case studies of 10 colleges and interviews with experts and insurance industry officials. GAO also reviewed some states' laws. About 80 percent of college students aged 18 through 23 had health insurance in 2006. While 67 percent of college students were covered through employer-sponsored plans, 7 percent were covered through other private health insurance plans, such as student insurance plans, and 6 percent were covered by public programs, such as Medicaid. Most insured students were covered as a dependent, on a policy under another person's name. About 20 percent of college students aged 18 through 23 (1.7 million) were uninsured in 2006, and certain groups of students were more likely than others to be uninsured. The characteristics of uninsured students were found to be consistent with those of the uninsured found in the general U.S. population. Over half of colleges nationwide offered student insurance plans in the 2007-2008 academic year, and plan benefits varied. Colleges customized their plans to reflect their priorities in making premiums affordable for students while providing coverage that meets student needs. Some plans excluded preventive services from coverage and some plans limited payment for benefits such as prescription drugs. Plans also varied in terms of premiums and maximum benefits, with annual premiums ranging from $30 to $2,400 and maximum benefits ranging from $2,500 for each illness or injury to unlimited lifetime coverage. Colleges and states have taken a variety of steps to increase the number of insured college students: about 30 percent of colleges nationwide required students to have health insurance in academic year 2007-2008; some states have health insurance requirements for college students; and some states have expanded dependent eligibility for private health insurance to make insurance more available to college students who obtain coverage as dependents. Officials from the American College Health Association (ACHA) provided a technical comment, which is incorporated. Two appendixes include: (1) Scope and Methodology; and (2) GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments. (Contains 70 footnotes, 7 figures, and 5 tables.)

        "description":"Throughout the end of the 1990s and the early years of the current decade, states experienced severe downturns in their economies. As has happened during other recessions, higher education, often viewed as discretionary spending compared to other budget demands, was hit particularly hard. During these years of severe fiscal constraints, however, a growing recognition of the interrelated nature of appropriations, financial aid, and tuition policy emerged. Decision makers also recognized that policy related to these issues was rarely aligned. In fact, policy decisions on these matters have historically been made by different decision makers at different times and with different agendas and perspectives in mind. Resulting decisions have not always been in the best interest of students. In 2001 Lumina Foundation for Education awarded the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE) a grant to work with state policymakers to integrate higher education appropriations, tuition, and financial aid policy. &quot;Changing Direction: Integrating Higher Education Financial Aid and Financing Policy&quot; works to foster better, more informed decision making on issues related to higher education financial aid and financing in order to increase access and success for all students. As part of this program, WICHE and its partner organizations worked with cohorts of states to provide technical assistance related to these issues. To document the progress in the states, a case study author was assigned to each state to observe the state's work and to write a case study report and analysis. This publication is a compilation of the case study reports of the second and third cohorts of states (California, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Washington). It also includes an update on the first cohort (Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Missouri, and Oregon). Each case study includes a description of the policy context, state actions, and observations. Five appendixes are included: (1) Changing Direction: Hawaii Roundtable Participants (September 29, 2004); (2) Summary of Recommendations from the Noel-Levitz Analysis of Scholarship and Financial Aid Programs for the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education; (3) Tennessee Higher Education Commission Master Plan Taskforce: 2005-2010 Planning Cycle; (4) Tennessee Higher Education Commission Performance Funding Taskforce: 2005-2010 Performance Funding Cycle; and (5) Tennessee Higher Education Commission Funding Formula Taskforce (Formula Review Committee): 2005-2010 Planning Cycle.

One study of &quot;Job Corps&quot; met What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards. This randomized controlled trial was based on a nationally representative sample of all eligible applicants who applied for &quot;Job Corps&quot; in late 1994 and 1995. The study sample included 11,313 students from more than 100 &quot;Job Corps&quot; centers nationwide. Based on this one study, the WWC considers the extent of evidence for &quot;Job Corps&quot; to be small for the progressing in school and completing school domains. This study did not examine the effectiveness of &quot;Job Corps&quot; in the staying in school domain. &quot;Job Corps&quot; was found to have no discernible effects on progressing in school and potentially positive effects on completing school.

        "description":"The purpose of this publication is to provide basic descriptive information about the 100 largest school districts (ranked by student membership, that is, the number of students enrolled at the beginning of the school year) for the 2004-05 school year in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Bureau of Indian Education, the Department of Defense dependents schools (overseas and domestic), and the four outlying areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). In this report, the terms &quot;United States and jurisdictions&quot; and &quot;national total data&quot; refer to these entities. This is different from most National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reports, which include only the 50 states and the District of Columbia in the totals. Among the findings were that the 100 largest public school districts, representing less than 1 percent (0.6 percent) of all school districts in the United States and jurisdictions, were responsible for the education of 23 percent of all public school students. The 100 largest public school districts employed 20 percent of the United States and jurisdictions' public school full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers and contained 17 percent of all public schools and 20 percent of public high school completers. The 100 largest public school districts had larger average school enrollments compared to the average for all school districts (702 vs. 518). In addition to larger school sizes, the 100 largest school districts also had a higher median pupil/teacher ratio than the average school district (16.2 vs. 15.5). Four states--California, Florida, Texas, and New York--accounted for half of the students in the 100 largest public school districts. The percentage of students in the 100 largest public school districts who were other than White, non-Hispanic was 71 percent, compared to 43 percent of students in all school districts. In FY 2004, current expenditures per pupil in the largest public school districts ranged from lows of $4,351 in the Puerto Rico Department of Education, Puerto Rico and $5,608 in the Jordan School District, Utah to a high of $17,337 in the Boston School District, Massachusetts.

The federal government invests roughly $25 billion annually in higher education excluding loans that are ultimately repaid, military benefits that are earned, and tax credits. State policymakers need to understand the nature of this federal investment and the rationale behind it if they are to gain the maximum advantage from their state investments. Then, they can begin to align state and federal policies so that they complement each other to the extent that this is possible and to design state policies in ways that maximize the take-up of federal dollars in the state, both to benefit students and to relieve state fiscal pressures.

        "author":["Rihani, May A."],
        "description":"Countries around the world have achieved huge gains in primary education, reaching a world average of 83.8 percent in net primary enrollment. However, large numbers of students still do not complete primary education, and even fewer continue on to secondary school.  Since so few children complete primary school, those who do must be able to continue their schooling. It is the only way for students and society to reap the full benefits of their initial investment in a literate, educated population. Currently, 83.8 percent of children worldwide attend primary school, but the rate drops to 59.3 percent for secondary school. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 17 percent of the girls are enrolled in secondary school. A renewed push to ensure that girls worldwide have access to secondary, as well as primary education is necessary now if the investments made are to pay off. This report discusses barriers and challenges to girls, and underscores five major benefits of girls' secondary education, including: (1) Pressure on communities and countries to build more secondary schools for girls, and existence of secondary schools increases primary and middle school enrollment and quality, and parental commitment to quality education overall; (2) Social benefits to the whole society (students are less likely to engage in or become a victim of crime, youth violence or human trafficking); (3) Girls are a valuable health resource, uniquely positioned to address some of the most significant health challenges facing developing countries (infant mortality, childhood immunization and nutrition, stunting, unwanted pregnancies); (4) Mitigation of HIV and AIDS; and (5) Tool for poverty alleviation by producing high returns in terms of wage growth. Adopting the recommendations in this report (to increase access and improve retention/survival and completion rates, improve the quality by making secondary classes more relevant and more gender equitable, and increase expectations for girls' independence and success) will result in an environment that empowers girls, benefiting themselves and the world.

        "description":"The American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) conducted a survey in 2003 to gauge the level of service learning involvement in community colleges across the nation. Service learning combines classroom instruction with community service, focusing on critical, reflective thinking as well as personal and civic responsibility. Service learning programs involve students in activities that address local, community-identified needs while developing their academic skills and commitment to their community. This research brief summarizes the findings from that survey and reveals a snapshot of institutional and programmatic involvement during a time of state budget shortfalls and significant cutbacks in education programs. The 2003 survey included many of the same questions asked in 1995 and 1997 AACC national surveys, in an attempt to record the change or growth in service learning programs. The following highlights emerged from the survey responses: (1) Nine out of 10 colleges responding to the survey either offer or are interested in service learning; (2) Seventy-two percent of colleges that offer service learning include it in social science disciplines and many also include it in education, science, health, and languages; (3) Seventy-six percent of colleges with service learning indicated that it is a course requirement, but usually for only a small number of courses; (4) On average, colleges that provide service learning offer it in 18 different courses annually and involve 424 students in service learning projects; (5) Colleges have an average of 14 full-time and six part-time faculty teaching courses with service learning components; (6) Most faculty participate in service learning because of personal commitment and mentoring by other faculty; (7) Service learning programs are most often administered by a service learning director or coordinator or by individual faculty members in different disciplines; and (8) Most colleges rely on institutional funds to implement service learning initiatives, or other areas of support such as the Corporation for National and Community Service and Federal  Work-Study funds. The report concludes that, as reported by respondents to the 2003 survey, service learning appears to be healthy, and growth is being sustained, even in times of financial crisis. While areas for improvement will always remain, service learning seems to be an important part of the climate of the community colleges represented in this study. Suggested resources, both print and online, are included. (Contains 26 figures.)",

        "description":"Calls for more school instructional time are coming from multiple quarters. Academic standards and frequent assessments have changed the nature, but not the length, of the instructional day. Schools find themselves \"robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" taking time from the arts, recess, and physical education to give to reading and math, subjects that carry heavy weight in state accountability systems. Distinguishing between Allocated Time (the time on the school calendar for a given content area) and Academic Learning Time (the amount of time students are working on rigorous tasks at the appropriate level of difficulty for them), mitigated by Student Engagement (the time students are paying attention), the paper advocates that it may at times be necessary to provide additional Allocated Time to the school calendar, while recognizing that scheduling and budgetary challenges exist. By confirming that extended allocations of time for core curriculum are used for high-demand academic learning adapted to individual student needs, and focusing additional funds on the students who need it most, many of these barriers may be overcome.

The main focus of this review is community- or district-based programs that have as their primary focus the re-engagement of out-of-school youth in learning in order to better prepare these youth to successfully enter high growth occupations and careers. This document reviews some preliminary efforts to develop a typology and define &quot;alternative education,&quot; as well as several promising programs, models, and initiatives that provide out-of-school youth with real second chance opportunities. It then turns to the issue of how many out-of-school youth are involved in alternative education, how many need these options, and other evidence concerning youth who need access to alternative education programs. The final section discusses the current policy environment for alternative education, some of the funding streams available to support programs for out-of-school youth, and how underused funding streams might be tapped for this effort. The following are appended: (1) Promising Models of Alternative Education Programs; and (2) Sources of Noteworthy Attributes of Alternative Programs/Schools. (Contains 10 footnotes.)

        "description":"While the transfer of policy between state governments is a well-researched practice, little is known about the state-to-state spread of programs generated and implemented by nonprofit organizations. In 1990, the nonprofit Child Care Services Association in North Carolina began an education and compensation scholarship program for 21 child care workers in three counties. As of August 2003, the program, now known as the T.E.A.C.H. (Teacher Education and Compensation Helps) Early Childhood[R] Project, had spread to 23 states and is annually providing more than 15,000 scholarships. This policy brief examines factors that supported, promoted, and challenged the transfer of the T.E.A.C.H. model to four states (Florida, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Washington). This research finds that effective policy replication involves multiple stages and a number of roles for policy advocates. (Contains 1 table and 2 endnotes.)

        "description":"For roughly half a century, policymakers and researchers have debated the impacts of place, and in particular of inner-city neighborhoods, on employment, education, and mental and physical health. Research on programs that help people move to better neighborhoods has suggested that such programs can improve the life chances of low-income, mostly minority adults and their children. One important way children might benefit is by having access to better schools. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched the Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration (MTO) in 1994 in five cities to try to improve the life chances of very poor families by helping them leave the disadvantaged environments that contribute to poor outcomes in education and employment. The demonstration targeted families living in some of the nation's poorest, highest crime communities (distressed public housing) and used housing subsidies to offer them a chance to move to lower poverty neighborhoods. The hope was that moving would provide these families with access to better schools, city services (police, parks, libraries, sanitation) and economic opportunities. Participation in MTO was voluntary. Those who volunteered were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: a control group, a comparison group, or an experimental group. MTO focused on moving families into better neighborhoods and was not specifically targeted at improving educational outcomes. However, based on the findings from a housing desegregation program, MTO program designers expected that if families moved to low poverty communities, children could have access to better, more resource-rich schools with more advantaged peers, and that this access might lead to the children working harder and achieving more. On the other hand, children who moved to new neighborhoods and schools might respond negatively to competition from more advantaged peers, or teachers might single out the newcomers for sanctions. Two early studies of families in the Baltimore and Boston sites one to three years after random assignment showed promising results for experimental movers, especially significant improvements in school quality. In Baltimore, there was also evidence of positive impacts on reading and math scores. Follow-up research on the entire sample of MTO families at all five sites was conducted in 2002, about five years after the MTO families moved. Contrary to expectations, the results from the interim follow-up showed that children in the MTO experimental group were, in fact, doing no better academically than children in the other treatment groups. In addition, there were only limited improvements in school quality across the five sites. These findings have led researchers to conclude that MTO failed to provide experimental-group participants with real access to high performing schools and without access to better schools, there is less reason to think that MTO might affect children's educational performance. The mostly qualitative Three-City Study of MTO, a large-scale, mixed-method study, was designed to examine key puzzles raised by the interim evaluation, including the lack of effects on children's educational outcomes. The study combined qualitative interviews, ethnographic fieldwork, and analysis of census and administrative data. It was conducted in three of the five MTO sites: the interviews and ethnographic fieldwork took place in 2004 and 2005, 6 to 10 years after families' initial placement through the MTO program. This brief uses data from the Three-City Study to explore factors that seem to have kept MTO participants, who succeeded in moving to safer, less poor neighborhoods, from accessing better schools. Analysis suggests both the potential and the limits of a relocation-only strategy to affect educational options and outcomes for disadvantaged children. (Contains 5 endnotes.)

Then, the expected behavioral skills for student teachers are listed in accordance with interviews with four professors. With the help of these data, to determine both the degree of opportunity and the level of success, the professional activities of six science student-teachers in these schools are observed using an observation chart. As a final step, semi-structured interviews are conducted to get ideas, expectations and comments of six student teachers and mentors. (Contains 1 table.)",

The cost analysis is based on expenditures drawn from two sources: state Near-General Fund appropriations and tuition revenue. By using data gathered from each institution, the study summarizes the cost of instruction at six four-year schools and 34 community or technical colleges in Washington. Information gathered from each institution is broken out in one of two ways: (1) At four-year institutions, instructional costs are provided by level of instruction (both undergraduate and graduate) and by discipline; (2) At two-year institutions, instructional costs are provided by type of instruction (academic, pre-college, and vocational) and by subject area cluster. Both direct and indirect costs are included in the study: (1) Direct costs include salaries and benefits of instructional faculty and staff, personnel who directly support the faculty, and supplies and equipment; (2) Indirect costs include admissions, registration, student services not financed by the students' services and activities fees, and a proportional share of libraries, administration, and facilities and maintenance. This report summarizes data in graphs and tables. Detailed information is divided by institution. An appendix contains a glossary, a listing of &quot;CIP&quot; codes (Classification of Instructional Programs, or Areas of Study)--which are used by the four-year institutions, and a listing of &quot;subject area clusters&quot; which are similarly used by the community and technical colleges.

These case studies of Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Missouri, and Oregon were designed to help equip policymakers and higher education leaders from all sectors more effectively address key public policy issues concerning the structuring of financing and financial aid to achieve goals of access to quality higher education. The overarching question the project hoped to address through the case studies and other project activities was: How can policymakers at all levels (most particularly those at the state level) more effectively integrate tuition, financial aid, and appropriations policies in ways that promote student participation and completion? The results of the states' work are linked back to the overall goals and objectives of the project in an effort to illustrate how the integration of public policies around financing and financial aid might be approached. The overview chapter highlights a number of milestones and accomplishments: (1) States engaged key leadership; (2) New policies developed by the states; (3) States sustained a discussion and laid the ground for further work; and (4) Special studies commissioned by the states. One of the central questions asked by case study authors in the final analysis is: within the context of the state, how important were the achievements of the technical assistance states? The &quot;Changing Direction&quot; project has provided a platform in these five states for a new conversation that helps policymakers and higher education leaders think creatively and constructively about the relationships among appropriations, tuition, and financial aid. They are looking at these issues in a more holistic, coordinated manner than they have in the past. Individual state case study reports provide greater detail and narrative on developments in the states.  [For report of the second and third cohorts, see ED500787.]",

        "description":"The Denver Public Schools (DPS) provide a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of school segregation within the context of rapid demographic changes and key policy changes.  This paper, the first of two reports, focuses on the dynamics of segregation, demographic changes, and implications for graduation rates in the Denver Public Schools. It utilizes the Common Core of Data collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to place the Denver Public Schools in both a national and regional context. The paper begins with a demographic overview of the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Statistical Area before focusing on the composition of Denver Public Schools from 1990 to 2003. The relationship of the dramatic demographic changes to segregation trends is examined by measuring the average exposure of students to all racial groups, as well as to each other and the concentration of students in racially isolated schools during the five years preceding the 1995 &quot;Keyes&quot; decision and in the eight subsequent years following. The Cumulative Promotion Index is used to calculate graduation rates, a measure of student promotion through successive school years designed to offset some of the limitations of official dropout data. The goal of this report is to examine the broader demographic and segregation patters of the district within the context of the 1973 &quot;Keyes&quot; case. It provides general trends that tell an important story in their own right and build a foundation for school-level analyses that will be presented in a subsequent report. A technical appendix provides details on calculating the Cumulative Promotion Index. (Contains 30 footnotes, 9 tables, and 3 figures.)

        "description":"Analysis by the Civil Rights Project has shown that the isolation of Latino and black students from white students in public schools has substantially increased since the l980s. These findings have been criticized recently in a report by the Mumford Center at the University at Albany, \"Resegregation in American Public Schools? Not in the 1990s\" and in Abigail and Stephen Thernstrom's book, \"No Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Learning.\" The Mumford report argues that the increased isolation is not caused by public policy, but by demographic trends and hence, \"it is misleading to label these trends as resegregation.\" The Thernstroms claim that \"black and white students in our public schools have become much less separated over the past thirty years or so.\" Furthermore, they argue that the existing racial imbalance in schools should come as no surprise given the reality of residential preferences and differences in family income. This paper seeks to address these criticisms, clarify the findings of the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University, and reaffirm the Project's conclusion that black and Latino isolation has indeed increased, not only because of demographic trends but also because of public policy changes.

It begins by examining the transformation of racial composition in the nation's schools, the dynamic patterns of segregation and desegregation of all racial groups in regions, states, and districts by using data from 1968 until 2003-4. It examines both the changes over the last decade (1991-2003) as well as those over a much longer period (1954-2003). Unless otherwise specified data from this report are computed from the Common Core of Data of the National Center for Education Statistics of the U.S. Department of Education for the years 1991 and 2003. Where data for a given year is missing, such as the racial statistics from Georgia and Virginia for 1991, it is noted in the tables and the nearest year is substituted and noted. It then explores the relationship between racial and economic segregation, documents the growing presence of multiracial schools, as well as discusses the implications of the lifting of desegregation orders on districts and the possible policy alternatives. The report ends with a brief discussion of what could be done to increase integration in schools. (Contains 81 footnotes, 15 tables, and 3 figures.)",

The catalog provides a basic inventory of the various methods for estimating high school graduation, completion, and dropout (GCD) rates that are currently being used by federal governmental agencies and state education agencies (SEAs). Following an Introduction, Section 2 provides a brief discussion of the high school processes and outcomes of interest in this catalog. Section 3 describes various types of data systems from which an indicator can be developed. These data systems are represented visually using a contingency table approach that closely resembles the kinds of aggregated, group-level data from which many agencies calculate GCD rates. Section 4 discusses different kinds of \"rates\" and the way in which data considerations intersect with mathematical formulations to define a statistical indicator. Section 5 offers a brief overview of several of the major sources of data on high school outcomes. These are the sources from which the most prominent, publicly reported findings on high school graduation, completion, and dropout are derived. Section 6 describes the review process used to identify indicators included in the catalog as well as the format of the indicator entries themselves. Finally, Section 7 presents the individual GCD indicator entries. (Contains 11 exhibits.)",

All too often, though, when complex issues of social and economic importance collide with policy and politics, heat is generated but little light. As a result, it may be difficult for local educators to parse the rhetoric from the reality and to figure out what this all means for their schools and students. This article attempts to provide some practical insight into NCLB and its implications for graduation rates and to highlight some issues of particular relevance to school administrators.

In addition to describing OCR's civil rights compliance program, the report demonstrates how OCR is able to make a real difference in the lives of students. 2004 marks a special year in America's efforts to bring about equal educational opportunity for all people: it commemorates the 50th anniversary of the landmark &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision that declared separate but equal schools to be unconstitutional. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB Act), the comprehensive reform of federal elementary and secondary education programs that President George W. Bush signed into law on January 8, 2002, may be viewed as furthering the intent of the &quot;Brown&quot; decision. The goal of the NCLB Act is to ensure that every child from every background receives a high quality education and that every school in America is a place of high expectations and high achievement. The fair, effective and efficient enforcement of the civil rights laws works to advance both equity and educational excellence. The report includes: (1) Overview of the OCR Compliance and Enforcement Program; (2) Strategic Priorities; (3) Other Efforts to Enforce the Civil Rights Laws; and (4) Measuring OCR's Work.

        "description":"Both the United States and England initiated ambitious standards-based education reform to eliminate large gaps between their highest and lowest achievers. England appears to be ahead, having started in 1988 with a national curriculum, tests, and performance tables. The United States' No Child Left Behind Act began rewriting state rules in 2002 with more incentives and punitive measures aimed at school performance. Viewing the contrasts as opportunity, educators and policymakers from each side of the Atlantic gathered in Philadelphia in mid-October for the second half of a dialogue on urban education. As talk moved to action, participants planned such follow-up activities as sending a delegation of principals and teachers from Georgia to English schools and creating a New York City school with British educators. With communication channels opened, possibilities seemed endless for comparing and analyzing data on education reforms. Inevitably too, all agreed, the education dialogue should expand to more countries. This policy brief offers highlights from their discussions. [The &quot;No City Left Behind&quot; dialogue was a collaborative effort of the British Embassy, HM Government's Department for Education and Skills, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) in London, Temple University College of Education in Philadelphia,  and The Urban Institute.

        "description":"The quality of a school building plays a critical role in student academic achievement as well as teacher retention. Yet, the majority of U.S. public schools are in poor physical condition, and nearly one-quarter are overcrowded, pressuring school systems to invest in both improving existing facilities and adding new facilities to accommodate growing student enrollments. Regional population growth mandates new school construction, while the condition of central-city schools and schools serving minority and low-income students creates the greatest need for upgrade and repair. This brief analyzes patterns of investment for public school construction in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area from 1995 to 2004. It considers the geographic distribution of investments, the allocation of resources for new construction versus renovation, changes in spending over time, and differences in investment for schools with differing student income levels and differing racial/ethnic compositions. The most substantial outlays across the region were for new school construction in the burgeoning outlying suburbs, where rapidly growing student enrollment mandated an expansion of school capacity. Spending in the District of Columbia and the suburbs immediately surrounding the District was directed more toward school renovation. School construction investment increased over time throughout the region, with the most dramatic increase occurring within the District, which in 2000 began the widespread renovation of old schools. Both population growth pressures and the need to improve aging schools influenced spending patterns across the Washington metropolitan area. However, local policy priorities and budget constraints also shape decisions about where to invest, helping to explain wide disparities in school construction spending across jurisdictions. From 1995 to 1999, investment in schools where more than 40 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch was below the regional average. However, starting in 2000, spending at schools where more than 75 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch increased sharply, largely reflecting increased expenditures within the District of Columbia. Construction was also below average for schools attended primarily by minority students (less than 15 percent white) and for schools where African-Americans are the dominant minority group, though these schools also saw small increases in investment over time. Schools with racially and ethnically diverse or a majority white student population garnered the greatest school construction resources. Unfortunately, data are not available to directly assess the extent to which school construction investments addressed problems of poor facility quality. However, the disparities in construction spending across the region are consistent with national studies showing that during the 1990s, schools serving high proportions of low-income and minority students were more likely to have inadequate facilities. Furthermore, despite increased spending in the District of Columbia, as recently as 2002 more than 40 percent of teachers in the D.C. public school system rated their school facilities as educationally inadequate.

        "description":"Education has become one of the most important issues in American society, often dominating the political landscape in response to lagging academic achievement and persistent gaps in performance between advantaged and disadvantaged children. In response, a variety of educational reforms have been implemented ranging from increased accountability to parental school choice and efforts to improve educational \"inputs\" such as teacher skills. An alternative strategy that has gained in popularity involves efforts to expand public and private investments in out-of-school-time programs, particularly those targeting the needs of disadvantaged children. Such programs provide opportunities for children and teens to have positive interactions with caring adults, improve socialization with other children, learn to avoid risky behaviors, and, last but not least, improve academic skills. However, students spend the majority of their time in these programs participating in extracurricular activities that are not designed specifically to improve academic skills. Consequently, this study asks two important research questions: (1) Does participation in out-of-school extracurricular activities improve academic achievement or behavior for elementary school children? and (2) If so, are the impacts of participation related to the types of extracurricular activities that students pursue (e.g., music and arts, language, computer classes, sports)? Initial analyses were conducted using relatively standard techniques to control for the fact that students who participate in out-of-school-time extracurricular activities differ in important ways from nonparticipants. These analyses found statistically significant and positive effects of such participation in arts, music, drama, and language classes. We were ready to write our report at this stage, but then tried to replicate our analyses using alternative statistical models. The results were not only highly dependent on the choice of analytical approach, but the initial positive effects disappeared when more appropriate analytical models were used. We then examined the current literature that has been used to support investments in out-of-school-time extracurricular programs and found that the reported positive effects are likely a result of the same type of analytical error that led us to initially conclude that there were positive effects for elementary school children. At a minimum, these results raise serious questions about the validity of many of the claims that out-of-school-time programs that do not directly target academic outcomes will improve such outcomes nonetheless. The results also suggest that more rigorous evaluation be conducted before further investments are made based on such claims, particularly where such expenditures are made as a trade-off against investments in other, possibly more effective, educational reforms. Four appendixes are included: (1) Detailed Descriptive Statistics; (2) Behavioral Scales Used in the Analysis; (3) Measurement Error and IV Models; and (4) Defining After-School, Out-of-School, and Enrichment.

        "description":"Achievement testing is the centerpiece of the state accountability systems mandated by the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). Accordingly, the public attention directed towards achievement scores has largely eclipsed the crucial role that graduation rates play in NCLB accountability, at least until recently. As a new body of research on graduation rates is gaining wider currency, we are just now coming to an uncomfortable realization: the nation appears to be facing a crisis in high school completion. These findings have prompted much-needed investigations into several key issues: the origins of the law's concern about graduation rates; status of graduates and dropouts for NCLB accountability; the consequences of using different ways to define and measure graduation rates; and state strategies for incorporating graduation rates into their federal accountability plans. This paper draws on recent research and analysis from the Urban Institute in an attempt to clarify these issues and to offer a foundation upon which to ground on-going policy debates, future research into the graduation and dropout phenomena, and the shape of the next generation of educational accountability systems.

        "description":"The early onset of disability (at birth through young adulthood) can affect a person's employment outcomes in myriad ways. In addition to the direct effect of disability on employment, early onset of disability likely affects the acquisition of education and job skills (human capital). This reduced \"investment\" in human capital in turn may reduce the individual's employment and earnings prospects throughout their lifetime. If this is the case, people with early onset of disability may be doubly disadvantaged when it comes to later employment prospects. This study analyzes how early onset of disability (onset prior to age 22) affects employment opportunities both directly and as a result of reduced investment in human capital (education) for a younger cohort (ages 22 to 35) and older cohort (ages 44 to 54). In our young cohort, we find that people with early onset of disability have a lower probability of completing high school and a lower probability of being employed than those without disabilities. Lower employment rates result from both lower levels of high school completion and a direct negative impact of disability on work. In the older cohort, we find the employment of those with disability is lower than those without disability, regardless of age of onset. However, those with early onset of disability have significantly higher employment rates than those with later onset of disability (after age 22). We hypothesize that this is a result of people with onset of disability prior to age 22 either choose careers that can be more easily accommodated than the careers people with later disability onset have, or that people with early onset of disability are more likely to be adept at seeking and using accommodations than those with later disability onset. These results suggest that policies and programs to increase employment of persons with disabilities should focus on ways to increase education levels of those with early onset of disability. They also suggest that return-to-work efforts focused on older cohorts of persons with disabilities may want to separately target programs to those with early onset of disability.

Stream of study, marital status and age based comparisons were made among the B.Ed trainees. 92 B.Ed trainees were the participants in the study. It was found that they have a good level of self-esteem and emotional intelligence. While the variables are correlated, it is found a substantial correlation in all the groups except science stream students. The correlation coefficient between self-esteem and emotional intelligence of science stream students is high. Both in self-esteem and emotional intelligence, it is found no significant difference among the students based on stream of study, marital status and age, except in the comparison of them in their self-esteem based on age.

Participants were purposefully selected--those actively involved in a formal mentoring relationship for a minimum of three years. Primary data were collected through audio taped interviews which were analyzed using a modification of the Stevick-Colaizzi-Keen method of data analysis. Findings suggest that a long-term nurturing mentoring relationship had a positive impact on the self-efficacy, aspirations, and possible selves in at-risk adolescent girls. The quality of the mentoring program played a significant role in the outcomes, and the emphasis on the importance of the commitment of quality time together helped to build nurturing relationships that fostered the academic, social, and emotional skill development in the Little Sisters. This study has provided information that may be useful for the fields of education and sociology and for training and development in mentoring programs.

A set of ten criteria, defining key features of standards-based education, was applied to analyse the contents of two policy documents and a report from an inquiry. The results showed that the documents reflected increasing refinement of the concept of standards-based education, but were only clear and comprehensive in their descriptions for four criteria. The conclusion recommended that policy making should be conceptualised in greater detail as a process of planned change, which a decision making body could apply to design a standards-based education system in a setting involving large change supported by a low level of knowledge.

        "description":"The purpose of this action research project report was to increase the homework completion rate of middle school students through the use of interventions. The participants in this study came from one public middle school. The participants were thirty-four 6th grade students in language arts, respectively. The intervention took place from September 10, 2007 through November 20, 2007. The targeted students at one public middle school in northwestern Illinois exhibited low levels of homework completion. The teacher researchers surveyed teachers, parents, and students, in addition to completing teacher observation checklists for each of the targeted students. The teacher survey asked questions pertaining to students turning in homework, and receiving consequences for not doing so. The parent survey revealed that students do not bring homework assignments home but do ask for assistance when needed. The student survey indicated that parents helped their child with their homework assignments less than half the time (zero to three days a week). Also, students indicated that they fill out their planners most of the time (four to five days a week). The teacher observation checklists showed that incomplete homework assignments were a significant problem for the targeted students. One of the interventions that was chosen to implement was positive reinforcement through the Gotcha system. This intervention has been referred to as a way for students to receive positive feedback, as well as a way to motivate students to increase their rate of homework completion. Another intervention chosen to use included increasing parental involvement in the completion of student homework through the use of daily homework planners. This intervention has been used as a strategy that has led to increased parental involvement, and an increase in the homework completion rate (Bryan & Burstein, 2004, Teacher). This intervention involved students writing assignments in their homework planners daily and taking the planners home to have them signed by their parents. By doing this students and parents were establishing a homework completion routine. The teacher researchers found that the use of Gotcha's and student planners seemed to positively effect the parent involvement rate. However, the percentage of incomplete assignments increased by seven percent. The teacher researchers also found that fewer students asked their parents for help with their homework. The teacher researchers believe that the use of planners helped students to organize their homework, and made parents more aware of homework assignments. Six appendixes are included: (1) Student Survey; (2) Parent Survey; (3) Teacher Survey; (4) Teacher observation Log; (5) Sample of Gotcha; and (6) Homework Planner. (Contains 2 tables and 22 graphs.)

        "description":"This action research project report summarizes the methods used to reduce boredom and frustration and increase students' academic motivation in three mixed-ability classrooms. This action research project included 21 third grade students, 23 fifth grade students, and 28 eighth grade students (n=72) during the dates of September 10, 2007, through December 14th, 2007. The teacher researchers observed students talking during instructional and work time, rushing through assigned tasks, inability to self-select free-time activities, working slowly, and lacking enthusiasm toward tasks. To gather data regarding these problems, three documentation tools, including a parent survey, student survey and an observation checklist, were used. The results of the parent survey allowed the teacher researchers to conclude that the majority of their students spoke positively about school. The outcome of the student surveys provided the teacher researchers with information about their students' attitudes toward school. Over half of their students conveyed feelings of boredom while in the classroom (n=44). The majority of their students also stated that they were always or sometimes distracted during work time (n=66). The observation checklist helped to reinforce the teacher researchers' original beliefs about the problem. Through tally marks, they were able to track 14 targeted behaviors. After calculating the data, they noted that the majority of incidences were those of talking during instructional and work time, and students' inability to self-select free-time activities. The teacher researchers chose Differentiated Instruction as the intervention to be implemented. Three specific Differentiated Instruction strategies, free-time activities, tiered assignments, and authentic assessments, were selected. Free-time activities encompassed different content areas, appealed to the students' multiple intelligences. Tiered assignments allowed the same objective to be obtained at various levels and modalities. The teacher researchers created assignments that appealed to the multiple intelligences ranging from simple to complex. Authentic assessments were culminating activities and tests that targeted learning styles, multiple intelligences, and ability levels. At the conclusion of the project, the teacher researchers compared and analyzed their pre- and post- data to identify several changes that occurred in their classrooms. These included fewer students distracted during work-time and a decreased number of off-task behaviors, however, more students appeared bored, and fewer students were excited about school. After reviewing their results, the teacher researchers recommended the continuance of Differentiated Instruction. They would only introduce one strategy, which would allow the teacher researchers better management.

        "description":"This Action Research Project Report was conducted at one elementary school and two different high schools from August 20, 2007 to December 14, 2007. The purpose of this research was to decrease student off-task behavior in the classroom. There were four teacher researchers and 94 students at the beginning of the research, but during the action research process two students transferred schools, leaving the final total of students researched at 92. The teacher researchers consisted of two 3rd grade teachers, one 10th grade Health teacher, and one 11th grade English teacher. The teacher researchers defined off-task behavior as any time a student was not working on classroom activities, demonstrated a lack of self-control, exhibited rude behavior, was poorly motivated, or any other social behavior that negatively impacted academic performance in the classroom. The three tools that were used to establish this problem were teacher surveys, student surveys, and a behavior checklist. In the teacher survey, 93% reported that they either agreed or strongly agreed that off-task behavior interferes with their students meeting their learning objectives. Furthermore, 79% of the students responded that they either agreed or strongly agreed that they thought that being off-task in class has negatively affected at least one of their grades. From the teacher researchers' own behavior checklists used in observing their classes, they reported 165 incidents of off-task behavior. One solution that the teacher researchers chose to reduce off-task behavior was implementing cooperative learning. Cooperative learning is a method that uses cooperation within student groups to involve all students, increase interactions among students, and promote collaboration in the solution of assigned tasks (Miglietti, 2001). Often times there is an emphasis on improving social skills within these groups. This solution strategy was chosen because it offered students a structured yet interactive environment. Additionally, the students were taught specific social skills when working with their peers and their teacher. After teacher researchers used cooperative learning as the intervention, the incidents of off-task behavior were lessened, according to the behavior checklists. Additionally, 85% of the students reported in the post-intervention survey that they either agreed or strongly agreed that working in groups helped them focus on the assignment at hand. Clearly, off-task behavior was curbed by using cooperative learning. The teacher researchers recommend that cooperative learning be used an intervention to keep students on task.

        "description":"Background: After the failure of several important methods comparison studies in the 1960s, the influence of interaction analysis stimulated interest in foreign language classroom processes. More careful observational studies gradually revealed which process variables were of interest. Also, there has been much research on teacher talk, with a focus on issues such as the amount and type of teacher talk, speech modifications made by teachers, instructions and explanations, error correction and questions have been more or less the center of attention. Purpose: This qualitative-quantitative study is conducted as a classroom research and has focused on two question types: display and referential. It explored recurring patterns of questioning behavior and their interactive effects through non-participant observation. Research design: Forty reading comprehension classes were observed in Tehran, Iran by the investigator. The observations were done by the researcher and the study data were gathered through partial ethnography. Events were coded and analyzed. General patterns were considered in regard with the teacher's questioning behavior and the students' interaction to them. Findings: The findings indicated that display questions were used by teachers more frequently than referential questions. Also, it was concluded that NOT all referential questions could create enough interaction. Further elaboration on the results may be found in the study report. Appendixes include: (1) Typical general questions from the data; (2) Typical referential questions (RQs) from the data; and (3) Typical display questions. (DQs) from the data(Contains 6 tables.)

        "description":"The purpose of this action research project report was to decrease off-task behavior through a dot/point reward system and portfolio reflections. Students involved in this research were in second, fifth, and sixth grade. There were a total of 85 student participants and 35 teacher participants. The dates of this research began on September 4, 2007 and ended on December 15, 2007. There were seven specific off-task behaviors that helped define the problem. These behaviors included daydreaming, talking out of turn, touching others, fidgeting with objects, out of seat at inappropriate times, putting heads down on desks, and putting the safety of others at risk. The three tools that were chosen to document evidence of the problem were an observation checklist, a student survey and a teacher survey. In regards to pre-documentation, the researchers found that off-task behaviors were occurring in the classroom through the observation checklist. By administering the student survey during pre-documentation, the researchers concluded that some students were not aware that their behaviors and how it was affecting their work and performance. Through the teacher survey, the researchers concluded that they, too, found off-task behavior to be occurring in their classrooms regularly. Overall, the researchers added that organization largely affects the students' off-task behaviors. As a means to decrease the chosen seven off-task behaviors, the researchers implemented a dot/point reward system and a portfolio reflection. Each week, a student received a dot chart. The student would receive a \"dot\" on their chart if they chose to engage in any of the targeted off-task behaviors. At the end of each week, the student would receive a reward or consequence based on the number of dots received. After the students earned their reward or consequence, they were to complete a portfolio reflection. Each student was required to analyze their dot chart in comparison with piece of work that was completed in class that week. The students were required to find a correlation between their behavior and the success or failure of the selected assignment. In the end, it should be noted that while the researchers did not feel that the study was a complete success, they learned that the interventions can be easily used and be very successful if used on an as needed, individual basis with selected students. Upon completion of the study talking out of turn was reduced by 19%. Also, while the seven behaviors that were targeted did occur frequently, the researchers felt that some of them could have been replaced. Other off-task behaviors that were not addressed could have been substituted. It should also be noted that the researchers felt that when these interventions are used in the future, they have the potential to be more successful given a longer period of time for completion. Seven appendixes include: (1) Student Survey; (2) Teacher Survey; (3) Observation Checklist; (4) Dot Chart; (5) Portfolio Reflection Sheet; (6) Portfolio Requirements; and (7) Photos of Intervention.

        "description":"The authors of this action research project report were teacher researchers who found student disengagement during classroom activities to have a negative effect on their classroom environments and on their students' achievement. The purpose of this action research project was to increase student engagement in classroom activities by implementing real-world projects that allowed for student choice, goals portfolios, and one-on-one conferencing with teachers about goals. Twelve basic algebra 1 students in all high school grade levels at Site A and 14 sophomore English students at Site B, for a total of 26 students, participated in the study, which was conducted from September 17, 2007 through December 21, 2007. The researchers focused their study on the problem of student disengagement, defined by off-task behaviors, such as talking with other students, blurting out, choosing not to do work, making vocal noises, and tapping pencils, hands, feet, etc. The researchers used a student survey, a faculty questionnaire, and a behavior checklist to document evidence of the problem. Both the student survey (n=25, 96%) and the faculty questionnaire revealed that students were more likely to engage in activities that relate to their lives or the real world. The student survey showed that students were more likely to engage in class when activities offer them choice (n=26, 100%), when they set goals (n=17, 65%), and when they conference one-on-one with the teacher (n=15, 58%). Both the faculty questionnaire and the behavior checklist found some of the most common off-task behaviors to be talking with other students, choosing not to do work, and blurting out. The three interventions the researchers implemented were real-world projects with student choice, goals portfolios, and one-on-one conferencing with teachers about goals. The teacher researchers' were not able to make any significant conclusions based upon their collective pre- and post-documentation, but their individual weekly observations provided insight into their students' behavior. Students were motivated to work on the real-world projects in class, and their engagement increased during the projects as a result. However, this engagement did not continue with other class activities. The goals portfolio seemed to have a negative impact on student engagement. There was an increase in certain off-task behaviors. The researchers concluded that the ineffectiveness of the goals portfolios was a result of students' lack of organizational skills and motivation to complete the work required to keep a portfolio. Thirteen appendixes include: Student Survey; Student Behavior Checklist; Faculty Questionnaire; Goals Portfolio Assignment; Teacher Researcher A's Real-World Project 1 through 4; Teacher Researcher B's Real-World Project 1 through 4; and Student Samples.

        "description":"The authors of this action research project report implemented oral reading fluency-based interventions for the purpose of improving students' reading comprehension. Six students in grade three, six students in grade five and six students in grade six participated in the study from Monday, August 27 through Friday, December 7, 2007. Researchers observed that in the targeted reading groups, deficiencies in any element of oral reading fluency were associated with reading comprehension problems. The teacher researchers used the following tools to document evidence; Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) Oral Reading Fluency (ORF), which indicated that 50% of students at Site A and 83% of students at Site B were below benchmark score for oral reading fluency. The comprehension based assessment (Choose-A-Title) resulted in 61% of the students choosing the incorrect title. As a result of the student survey, it indicated that 17% of the students responded \"almost never\" when asked \"I think others like my reading\". Students' struggles with accuracy, rate, and prosody revealed deficiencies that inhibited the processing of meaning. The interventions implemented were three 20-minute weekly sessions consisting of one session of reader's theater activities including choral reading, echo reading, and poetry, and two sessions of partner reading during which student pairs engaged in repeated oral reading and reading along silently while listening as oral reading was modeled. Teachers are encouraged to model fluent reading illustrating proper rate and accuracy. Reading and rereading exercises such as reading with a model reader, choral reading, reader's theater, and partner reading can improve fluency (Vaughn & Linan-Thompson, 2004). As a result of the interventions, students demonstrated increased awareness of the three elements of oral reading fluency: accuracy, rate, and prosody. Students practiced self-monitoring these elements while participating in paired reading and cooperative learning groups. The post data revealed that there was a decrease in students' positive responses to \"I read with expression and feeling\". Thirty-three percent of students responded \"almost always\" on pre documentation and 28% on post documentation. The \"usually\" category declined from 50% to 44%. Students responded best to interventions that involved repeated reading in the form of rehearsal followed by performance, such as choral poetry reading and reader's theater. Students demonstrated engagement in the activities while becoming more realistic in self-evaluation.

        "author":["Lopez, Doreen M.",
          "Schroeder, Linda"],
        "description":"This action research project was designed to maximize learning for all students by addressing different learning styles and implementing various strategies. The students in the targeted school exhibited difficulty in experiencing academic success while exposed to conventional teaching strategies. The two target schools consisted of an intermediate school which serves students in third through fifth grades and a middle school which serves students in sixth through eighth grades. A student survey was administered to determine a preferred learning style and the researchers used observation checklists, formal assessment, and informal assessments. Probable causes of students not responding to traditional methods are; technological advances and the desire to be entertained are eminent, various types family structure provide different levels of background or prior knowledge, learning has an extrinsic value to children, language barriers may cause a delay in learning, and since the No Child Left Behind Act, demands on teachers are rigorous and individualized instruction or learning types are not always addressed. Teachers are now teaching to the standardized test so that their schools can make AYP. A review of professional literature and the teacher researchers' analysis concluded that students are taught as a whole class not as individuals. To teach students individually, the teacher researchers used the following strategies: varied multiple intelligence lessons, chunking, tiered assignments, differentiated instruction, and cooperative learning groups. Cooperative learning groups were used weekly and all instruction was delivered by chunking information. Prior to the intervention, students were given direct instruction as a class and then they worked independently. After the interventions were executed, assessments revealed higher than average grades when the teaching methods were varied. The researchers recommend surveying the students on their preferred learning style at the beginning of the school year and structure lessons accordingly. Also obtainable goals should be set early in the school year, reviewed frequently, and updated when necessary. The researchers also advocate the use of cooperative learning groups whenever possible.

This two-week summer program provides high school students and teachers from the Appalachian region the opportunity to work with mentor scientists from ORNL on inquiry-based, applied projects in science, math, and computer technology. The goals of the Summer Institute, in operation since 1990, are to (1) encourage more high school students to continue their studies beyond high school, (2) encourage more students to pursue careers in the projected shortage areas of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), and (3) raise the level of math, science, and technology instruction in high schools throughout the region to facilitate the first two goals. To assess the results of its more than $2 million investment in the Summer Institute since its inception 16 years ago in 1990, ARC funded this evaluation to determine the extent to which these goals have been achieved. The evaluation sought to measure short-and longer-term outcomes aligned with the Summer Institute's goals for students and teachers. ARC asked AED evaluators to make recommendations for establishing an ongoing evaluation capability for the ARC-ORNL Summer Institute. These recommendations can be found in the appendix to this report. (Contains 26 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"This report compares district leaders' perspectives on changes in school capacity, student outcomes and district policy over three years of implementation of Middle Start (MS), a comprehensive school reform program to demonstrate the potential for improving the effectiveness and sustainability of CSR at the school level through integrating districts more effectively into the school-CSR program partnership. Middle Start CSR is a school improvement program focused on improving teaching and learning in the middle-grades and seeks to foster academic excellence, developmental responsiveness, and social equity in schools through the implementation of four core principles: (1) reflective review and self-study; (2) effective small learning communities; (3) rigorous curriculum, instruction, and assessment; and (4) distributed leadership and sustainable partnerships. The report is based on a study sponsored by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation as part of a larger three-year qualitative study of 19 rural and urban high-poverty schools in 13 Michigan districts from 1999 to 2002. The author worked with a team of researchers to document coaching strategies, school-based planning and implementation, changes in school structures and leadership, instructional approaches, social supports for students, and social and academic outcomes in all 19 schools, and conducted intensive case studies of four of these schools over the three years. The findings of this study show that the majority (9 out of 13) of district leaders became highly supportive of Middle Start CSR's work in their middle-grades schools over the three years of implementation despite very little contact with CSR program staff such as Middle Start school improvement coaches.",

        "description":"Raising and educating healthy boys is an area of increasing concern among educators, child development experts, and parents nationwide. It was the focus of an invitational meeting convened by the Educational Equity Center at the Academy for Educational Development (EEC/AED) in November 2004. The meeting brought together a national group of researchers and educators to analyze the current situation in terms of boys' development and school performance and to create an action plan to focus national attention on the well-being of boys in school and in society. This publication cites research showing that boys lag behind girls in reading and writing, they are more likely to be referred to a school psychologist, and they are more likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity. Boys represent a majority of students with learning disabilities, commit most of the school violence, and incur the majority of school suspensions. This report examines the crisis in boys' education in four areas: (1) gender and literacy; (2) viewing boys as \"problems\" in school; (3) viewing rates of early expulsion affecting young boys; and (4) the effect of educational policy on school culture and the relational aspects of teacher's work. It then presents a two-pronged strategy that would combine a research-action agenda and a broad communications campaign with the goal of applying lessons learned to teacher training, educational practice, and continuing research.  Appended is the meeting agenda and list of participants.",

        "description":"In 2005, Governor Tim Pawlenty and the Minnesota Legislature charged the Minnesota Office of Higher Education with developing an accountability system to measure the higher education sector's effectiveness in meeting state goals. Minnesota's leaders recognized that the knowledge, creativity and intellectual capacity of the state's people are the most promising strategic advantage in a global economy. The purpose of this report is to provide information that will lead to educational improvement and inform policy discussions relating to higher education. Policymakers, employers and educators were involved in a process to develop five state goals which serve as the organizing framework for this report. To compete effectively, Minnesota must build on its educational strengths and identify and address weaknesses. Among states, Minnesota ranks favorably on several key educational measures such as high school graduation rates and the percentage of the state's citizens who possess college degrees. These select facts, however, in the absence of a more comprehensive set of measures, paint an incomplete picture of Minnesota's higher education effectiveness. Minnesota excels in some areas, but more often performs at or near the national average on indicators important to the state's educational and economic vitality. Throughout the report, Minnesota is compared most often with other states because such comparisons are readily available. However the true challenge to Minnesota's economy and quality of life comes from rapidly developing nations including China and India. Long admired for its higher education excellence, the U.S. now finds its leadership position challenged by efficient, results-driven schools in other countries, making the development of international benchmarks an imperative for global competitiveness. For Minnesota to lead consistently in higher education, the first step is to lead on accountability. &quot;Minnesota Measures 2007&quot; is the first of a planned series of annual reports. The focus of the report will evolve in the future so it can be an effective state policy tool and an agenda for improved focus and quality. Goals discussed include: (1) Improve success of all students, particularly students from groups traditionally underrepresented in higher education; (2) Create a responsive system that produces graduates at all levels who meet the demands of the economy; (3) Increase student learning and improve skill levels of students so they can compete effectively in the global marketplace; (4) Contribute to the development of a state economy that is competitive in the global market through research, workforce training and other appropriate means; and (5) Provide access, affordability and choice to all students. Five appendixes include: (1) Advisory Participants; (2) The Process; (3) Tuition Rates; (4) Rankings; and (5) Definitions, Terms and Sources. (Contains 17 endnotes, 14 figures, and 28 tables.)

        "description":"For most of Minnesota's 150 years of statehood, its distinctive economic advantages were largely a function of its natural resources, such as timber, taconite and tourism. Today, while these and other resources remain cornerstones of the state economy, it is clear that the intellectual capacity of Minnesota's people is emerging as a promising strategic advantage in a global economy. Recognizing this, Governor Tim Pawlenty and the Minnesota Legislature charged the Minnesota Office of Higher Education with developing a statewide accountability system to measure the higher education sector's effectiveness in meeting state goals. In 2005 and 2006, educators, policymakers, employers and other leaders were involved in a process to identify broad goals and indicators of success. Five goals emerged, which serve as the organizing framework for this report. The five goals and 23 indicators serve as Minnesota's public agenda for higher education. No single indicator tells the complete story. However, taken together, some findings begin to emerge. Minnesota's leaders recognize that, in order to lead consistently in these areas, the state must first embrace a system of accountability that can measure progress toward the following goals: (1) Improve success of all students, particularly students from groups traditionally underrepresented in higher education; (2) Create a responsive system that produces graduates at all levels who meet the demands of the economy; (3) Increase student learning and improve skill levels of students so they can compete effectively in the global marketplace; (4) Contribute to the development of a state economy that is competitive in the global market through research, workforce training and other appropriate means; and (5) Provide access, affordability and choice to all students.

        "description":"These three case studies highlight the implementation and impact of Mid South Middle Start by: (1) contributing toward an in-depth understanding of what it means to be a school implementing Middle Start; (2) describing a holistic portrait of the schools' participation in Mid South Middle Start; and (3) assisting the Academy for Educational Development (AED) in giving formative feedback to the Foundation for the Middle South (FMS). Three schools were selected as case-study subjects based on: (1) location of the school (seeking even distribution among the Mid South states of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi); (2) type of grantee school; (3) types of reforms planned; (4) school history in terms of academic performance and stability of administrator and faculty turnover; and (5) the school's availability and willingness to be studied in detail. The studies of Appleton, Jeyson, and Mt. Olive Middle Schools are based on two years of qualitative data collection by a team of AED researchers. The research team examined: (1) the context of implementation of Middle Start; (2) the role of Middle Start in school improvement efforts; (3) the accomplishments and challenges that the school encountered; and (4) the impact of Middle Start in promoting academic achievement, developmental responsiveness and equity in the school. In addition to gathering data specifically for these questions, the case-study research also included more general inquires into each school's background, physical setting, and historical context. Research included one-day site visits in both the fall and spring of each of the case-study years, as well as other site visits and interviews with the Middle Start director of school improvement services. During the site visits, the research team conducted interviews with the following school staff: (1) principal and/or assistant principal; (2) teachers, particularly members of school leadership and grade-level teams; (3) counselors and librarians; and (4) Mid South Middle Start coaches. Generally, classroom instruction was found to improve with implementation of Middle Start, with many teachers in the three schools using a variety of innovative and developmentally appropriate teaching practices. School climate also improved: schools became more student-centered by increasing support for students and celebrating their work. Buy-in among teachers, teaming, and distributed leadership were evident in the three schools and were main drivers of change. Staff in Middle Start schools described Middle Start as providing a &quot;shared vision&quot; and an &quot;alternative way of thinking,&quot; and credited the initiative with improving staff understanding of middle-level concepts and the needs of young adolescents, fostering communication among school staff, increasing family involvement, and helping the school maintain a focus on the improvement of teaching and learning despite numerous challenges and limited resources.

        "title":"Building Capacity for Professional Development in Adolescent Reading: The National Writing Project's National Reading Initiative. Evaluation Summary Report 2003-2006",
        "description":"An area of particular concern in adolescent literacy is comprehension of informational text: many students can successfully decode words without actually being able to understand the texts they read. As they progress through school, they have to read increasingly complex texts but receive little if any explicit instruction to help them. Beyond the third grade, reading instruction tends to focus on fiction, yet students must understand nonfiction texts in order to learn content-area subjects as well as to navigate the informational texts they must read for work and everyday life as adults. The National Reading Initiative (NRI) was designed to address teachers' lack of access to high-quality, well-designed professional development focused on reading of informational texts, especially in grades 4-12. The ultimate aim of the NRI was to develop models, approaches, and resources for professional development in reading that could be disseminated and used throughout the large National Writing Project (NWP) network of sites. To create these models, NRI supported a cohort of nine university-based local Writing Project sites in studying, refining, and expanding their local professional development work in reading with a view toward creating professional development approaches that could be useful to the network at large. The report evaluates the first three years of work by these lead sites. The goals of the evaluation were to document and assess the work of the NRI, to provide formative feedback that could better shape this initial investment in capacity-building, and to examine and understand the impact of participation in the NRI on local writing project sites and participating teachers. The evaluation concludes that the power of the NRI model lies in its ability to build the capacity of an entire system to provide effective professional development that becomes an integral part of teachers' classroom practices. The influence of the inquiry-based professional development in reading that NRI sites facilitated reached far beyond the teachers who participated in site-sponsored institutes or inquiry groups. Through fostering professional \"communities of practice\" focused on reading instruction and by developing teachers' leadership capabilities, NRI sites expanded their capacity to provide high-quality professional development in their service areas and for the NWP network as a whole.

        "description":"In order to fulfill its mission of middle-grades education reform, the Mid South Middle  Start initiative works with schools, organizations, and institutions to improve the social and academic outcomes of students aged 10-14. A vital element of this endeavor is the creation of linkages by the core group of organizational partners with relevant people and groups to promote and sustain middle-grades reform. The concept of building strategic alliances borrows ideas from the best practices of successful collaborations and partnerships by bringing together people and institutions around a set of needs and goals that are addressed with resources, activities, events, and products. Given a shared understanding of the mission and sufficient diffusion of knowledge, skills, contacts, and resources, alliances perform the following functions for their members: (1) Enlarge the mission to make it a more collective one; (2) Foster a spirit of camaraderie; (3) Enlarge the pool of thinkers and doers; (4) Expand the resource base; (5) Broaden the base of ideas, knowledge, resources, and supports; (6) Increase publicity and accessibility to school reform services; and (7) Build the infrastructure for implementation and sustainability. This report, based on documentation and interviews conducted between 2000 and 2003, presents highlights of the strategic alliance-building process in the Mid South Middle Start initiative. Some of these were developed by design; others developed though a less intentional process of creating opportunities that later became the foundation for a strategic alliance. The core partners and strategic allies of Mid South Middle Start have successfully implemented a school reform effort focused on middle-grades education in three states, sparking interest, increasing awareness, and building capacity in the Mid South for comprehensive changes in the education and social lives of youth ages 10-14. Building these strategic alliances with education-related individuals, institutions, and organizations was a conscious agenda of this initiative that has resulted in effective alliance-building, with the potential for more team-building, inter-initiative linkages, and effective partnerships. Core partners worked together, receiving and giving information, making decisions, making grants, and providing services, data, and other feedback in ways to engender good public relations, regional exposure, and the mutually beneficial involvement of a variety of organizations, institutions, and individuals, as described throughout this report. As a result, participating schools now have access to support and expertise from alliance members, and long-term connections and commitments can be expected in all relevant sectors as these linkages are nurtured and connected. In effect, the alliances are an investment that will help maintain and sustain the broad-based comprehensive nature of Mid South Middle Start.",

        "description":"As part of a national Middle Start initiative led by the Academy for Educational Development (AED), Mid South Middle Start is committed to working with high-poverty schools in the Mid South Delta region to build their capacity to foster students' academic excellence, support the development of young adolescents, and achieve social equity in schools with middle grades. The initiative is based on a set of guidelines which emphasize ongoing inquiry into teaching and learning, the cultivation of effective small learning communities, continual improvement of student learning and achievement, and distribution of leadership throughout the school and community to support students' high-level learning and development. Five schools featured in this study received state or foundation grants to participate in Mid South Middle Start and collaborate with a Middle Start coach to implement the Middle Start comprehensive school improvement program. School leadership teams, consisting of teachers and the principal, participated in professional development and leadership training facilitated by AED Middle Start coaches and professional development organizations. These opportunities enabled school staff to build their capacity in data-based inquiry for school improvement, teaming, content knowledge, innovative instructional strategies, and new approaches to scheduling. The report contains four major sections: (1) Essential elements of effective school-wide reform efforts; (2) AED's role; (3) Middle Start schools featured in this study; and (4) Status of Middle Start implementation in study schools. The five schools featured in this study share a common feature: all are high-poverty schools in the Mid South Delta; the majority are striving towards school improvement. The four levels of Middle Start implementation (level 1=emerging, level 2=making progress, level 3=reaching a maturing stage, and level 4=sustaining stage) are evident in improvement efforts. Some schools have made more progress than others, and the underlying reason is primarily due to available supports. Factors and Conditions Promoting School Improvement include: (1) Collaborative culture of reflection and improvement and use of a school's strengths to promote school change; (2) Participatory leadership and practice of broad-based decision making among teachers; (3) Block scheduling, teaming, small learning communities, and other structures to support effective teaching and learning; (4) District and community support for education initiatives to promote community-wide understanding about goals of reform efforts and provide funding for professional development and support; (5) Strategic alliances to expand a school's resource base, increase its visibility, and build a sustainable infrastructure for school improvement; (6) Ongoing technical assistance from coaches who provide on-site support in organizational planning, classroom instruction, and ongoing inquiry and self assessment; and (7) Ongoing documentation of progress and ongoing use of data in school improvement efforts. Middle Start Principles and Practices are appended. (Contains 4 footnotes, 6 figures and 4 tables.)",

        "author":["Johnson, Jerry"],
        "description":"This report presents findings from an investigation into relationships between academic achievement and the distribution of fiscal resources among rural school districts in Oregon. The investigation was prompted by earlier-reported findings suggesting the critical nature of both achievement gaps and resource gaps among rural school districts in the state. A variety of statistical procedures yielded consistent findings indicating that there is considerable disparity in the distribution of fiscal resources among rural districts, and that the level of fiscal resources available to districts significantly influences educational outcomes. Interpreting these findings within the socioeconomic context of rural Oregon, findings include: (1) Districts facing the greatest challenges receive the fewest resources and produce the lowest levels of academic achievement; and (2) Districts facing the fewest challenges receive the greatest resources and produce the highest levels of academic achievement. It is a pattern in which the distribution of resources appears to be compounding, rather than mitigating, socioeconomic disparities. In effect, this maldistribution of resources appears to be working against closing achievement gaps. Results also indicate that the inequitable distribution of resources on a per pupil basis is not the result of the smaller scale of schooling in some parts of the state, offering further support for earlier-reported findings suggesting that school or district consolidation would be a poor policy choice. Three appendixes include: (1) T-test results for comparison of high- and low-achieving districts; (2) T-test results for comparison of highest- and lowest-achieving districts; and (3) Distribution of Key Variables.

This random variation, which is more pronounced for a small school, should be taken into account by education officials when evaluating school progress in a policy climate of high stakes. To do otherwise is to unnecessarily risk the false identification of a failing school. In this monograph, I describe the application of confidence intervals to the evaluation of &quot;adequate yearly progress&quot; for No Child Left Behind (NCLB). Throughout, I demonstrate the particular relevance of confidence intervals for small schools. Upon completion, readers will understand why 27 states included confidence intervals in their NCLB accountability plans (and perhaps wonder why the remaining states did not).

This pilot collection is a research and development effort to see if it is possible to collect and publish teacher-level data from the administrative records residing in state departments of education. Seven states participated in this survey: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, and Oklahoma. These states provided data on salaries, years of teaching experience, highest degree earned, race/ethnicity, and gender for each public school teacher. Data on government expenditures on employee benefits were also solicited, but only three states were able to provide partial employee benefits data. This is a universe survey of administrative records for all teachers in participating states: no statistical testing was required. Selected findings include: (1) Mean base salaries of full-time public school teachers in the seven states participating in the Pilot Teacher Compensation Survey ranged from $34,631 to $44,777 per year; median base salaries of full-time public school teachers ranged between $33,516 and $42,676; median total salary for full-time teachers ranged from $34,973 to $42,500; (2) Median level of teaching experience ranged from 8 to 15 years; median teacher age was between 43 and 45 in each of the states; (3) Number of teachers that held master's degrees as their highest degree varied across the seven states from approximately 28 percent to almost 50 percent; (4) Teachers holding master's degrees earned more than teachers who held a bachelor's degree; (5) Proportion of teachers with one year of teaching experience ranged from 4.4 percent to 10.9 percent; (6) Full-time teachers 66 years old or older comprised from 0.4 percent to 1.0 percent of public school full-time teachers; in three of the five states reporting age data, the highest proportion of teachers were 51 to 55 years old; (7) Majority of teachers in the seven reporting states were White; and (8) More than three quarters of the teachers across six of the seven reporting states were female. Reported findings were chosen to demonstrate the range of information available when using the TCS rather than to discuss all of the observed discoveries and are not meant to emphasize any particular issue.

        "description":"In the FY2007 and FY2008 Budgets, the President recommended that the National Commission on Libraries and Information Sciences (NCLIS) be consolidated with the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). In FY2007, while waiting for Congressional action on the proposal in the President's FY2008 Budget, the Commission recognized the need to summarize its work and document its accomplishments in anticipation of a change in its status. Background and Historical Information are included in the first section of the report. Key statutory functions of the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) are summarized as: (1) NCLIS discovers the needs of the people of the U.S. for library and information services; (2) NCLIS translates those needs into recommended national policy to meet needs of the people of the U.S. for library and information services; and (3) NCLIS advises the President, the Congress, state and local governments, and others on implementation of national policy. To carry out its functions, NCLIS conducts studies, surveys, and analyses of the nation's library and information needs, appraises the adequacies and deficiencies of the current library and information resources and research and development activities, conducts hearings, and issues publications. The final section of the report discusses a recommended research agenda to meet needs expressed by multiple sectors of the information community. From interviews and recommendations elicited from the information community, a specific research agenda emerged that clustered around four broad topics: Public Libraries: Their Changing Role in U.S. Society and Measuring Their Societal Value; Digital Libraries; Building and Sharing Collections; and Disaster Planning and Relief Efforts. Each of the recommendations is keyed to the purpose of ensuring an informed American public with adequate access to information for decision-making, civic engagement, and a higher quality of life. Seven appendixes are included: (1) Enabling Legislation; (2) NCLIS Chairs; (3) Current Commissioners; (4) Former Commissioners; (5) Senior Staff; (6) NCLIS Publications; and (7) NCLIS Timeline.

The focus is on the students' attitudes towards the use of computers for the learning of mathematics. Background information was also gathered which allowed the students' responses to be analysed by a range of equity factors--gender, ethnicity, socio-economic background--and by several other school-related factors. The results indicate that gender was the only equity variable on which significant differences were found. Grade level and type of computer used in class were the other variables for which significant differences were noted. (Contains 1 footnote and 3 tables.) [For complete proceedings, see ED500857.]",

Neither the study conditions nor the social recognition were experienced as adequate for women.

We believe that teachers' education must be focused on teachers' awareness of the complexity of the teaching process, of the incidence of these factors in it, and of the importance of looking at theory as a strong component of their professional development. In this framework, we face the question of the relationship between theory and practice, taking into account some aspects of our Project on Early Algebra (ArAl), which is also an in-service education process. We present the main features of the Project, highlighting not only its influence on teachers' knowledge and beliefs--and, consequently, on their practice--but also the way in which an analysis of such practice has given us a greater awareness of teachers' difficulties in reshaping their teaching, as well as some indications for our future research.

The way that other paradigms such as reflexive methods may enhance qualitative research will be proposed.

        "description":"A 2007 Association of Research Libraries (ARL) survey indicates that research libraries are rapidly developing publishing services: 65 percent of 80 responding ARL member libraries currently deliver or are in processing of planning these services. Established journal titles dominate this emerging publishing sector and are the main drivers of service development, although new titles are also being produced. In the search for transformative approaches to scholarly publishing, research library publishing programs are intentionally exploring the boundaries of what program managers conceptualize as a service core. The challenge is to provide the basic service suite by reallocating resources, partnering, seeking synergies with related services, and developing modest revenue streams. Libraries are focusing on the capabilities and possibilities of new models rather than duplicating or automating traditional models. At the same time, they seek to identify the most promising new kinds of services that are needed to support authors and editors. Following the survey, publishing program managers at ten institutions participated in semi-structured interviews to delve more deeply into several aspects of service development: the sources and motivations for service launch, the range of publishing services, and relationships with partners. The question is no longer whether libraries should offer publishing services, but what kinds of services libraries will offer. Three appendixes are included: (1) Study Design: Data Gathering Instruments and Response Rates; (2) Research Library Publishing Services and University Presses; and (3) Synergies: Building National Infrastructure for Canadian Scholarly Publishing (reprint).

Several models are posed and students discuss and debate their differences and similarities. Analyses of student-to-student and student-to-researcher dialogue reveal an emphasis on sense making and collaboration in the quest for meaning. This resulted in richer and deeper understanding of the conditions of the problem and the varying interpretations developed by the students. (Contains 1 footnote and 1 figure.)

        "description":"This action research project report examined all forms of bullying behaviors and ways to reduce those behaviors. The project included 63 students from both a high school health class and a 6th and 7th grade middle school homeroom. The research was conducted from September 17, 2007 through December 14, 2007. In the specified locations, female to female bullying was the most noticeable problem at both the 6th grade level and the freshman level. The tools used to document evidence of bullying behaviors included an observation log, a parent survey, and a student survey. The observation log showed that the most common bullying behaviors overall, were name-calling and gossiping. The student survey showed that almost half of the kids had been bullied at some time, and were typically bullied once per quarter. The parent survey showed that half the parents thought bullying was a problem and one fifth of those parents complained to the school about bullying. These behaviors negatively affected the safety students felt at school as well as the classroom environment. A variety of intervention strategies were used to both educate about and combat the bullying behaviors throughout the schools. In the first intervention, students defined both verbal and physical bullying behaviors, and then brainstormed everything that could be classified as bullying and created a concept map using verbal and physical bullying as the two main headings. In the next intervention, students determined hot spots for bullying activity and brainstormed ways to reduce bullying in these areas. In the third week, students role played bullying situations, taking turns as either the bully, victim, or bystander, and as a class gave ideas as to how to deal with the different situations. In the fourth week, students created anti-bullying posters, which they hung up around different bullying hot spots around the schools. In the next week, students filled out surveys of how their week went pertaining to incidentsof bullying, whether observed or experienced. In the next week, students got in groups and wrote an anti-bullying rap song, which they performed to the class throughout the week. In the next intervention, students read a story about a bully, a victim and a teacher's decision as to how to deal with it, and the students answered moral questions pertaining to the story. In the last two weeks, the students took a self-esteem test, which gave them an accurate reading about how they felt about themselves, and they wrote a PMI summary of everything they had learned from this study. The students reported that they had felt more comfortable dealing with bullying situations and the results show that the amount of bullying had decreased from 147 instances in the pre-doc, to 101 in the post doc, a decrease of 31%. The amount of verbal bullying, especially name-calling and gossiping decreased the most, 39% and 21% respectively. Through the interventions the participants increased their awareness of bullying and readiness to handle bullying situations. It was concluded that the interventions were successful in creating a safer environment and a more positive classroom climate. The results maintained our initial purpose of the research and interventions.

        "description":"We do not just live in a social world; the social world is already within us determining how we think. At a general level, Vygotsky's sociohistorical theory has its roots in this perspective that emphasized the importance of cultural-historical context in which learning takes place and how that context has impact on what is learned. Later on, Vygotsky's followers suggested that &quot;sociocultural&quot; is a better term when it comes to deal with how this theory has been applied in current debates in the human sciences, at least in the West, because Western European psychologists were claiming that Vygotsky's studies were the subject of a dispute in USSR. However, these two terms get mixed up most of the time. Therefore, this paper is primarily focused on examination, comparison and discussion of sociohistorical theory and sociocultural theory and instructional approaches of socio/historical-cultural theory.",

        "description":"To improve student completion rates in higher education, faculty are using cohort educational models (CEM); however, very few studies were found regarding CEMs effects in educating culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) doctoral students in the field of special education. This study investigated two questions: (a) Are there differences for students in the doctoral experience when they are part of a cohort, as differentiated from not being part of a cohort? and (b) What motivates students to continue in a cohort doctoral program, as differentiated from those continuing independently? Participants included six CLD doctoral students (three in a CEM, three not in a CEM) and three professors (attending or serving as faculty at a Carnegie-designated research extensive university in a multicultural, urban area in the southeastern USA). Researchers included three CLD female special education doctoral students (two in a CEM, one not). The qualitative case study method was used to explore perceptions of cohorts, experiences, and the effects of cohorts on participants. Findings included: (a) organizational efficiency and benefits to student learning outweigh concerns; (b) the cohort structure definitely impacts students who are pursuing their doctoral degrees independently, (c) the cohort structure impacts professors. Non-CEM doctoral students perceived their educational experiences as being very different from that of CEM students. Benefits of a CEM included inter-student support, a flexible learning model, support for CLD learners, opportunities for building trusting relationships, ease in class scheduling, and opportunity for maturation. Presence of the cohort affected the non-CEM students and professors negatively in several ways. Although CEMs are strong mechanisms for supporting students, they call for an awareness of group cohesion within cohorts to effectively engage the students in the academic process to address the retention problem of doctoral students, decrease the disparity between CEM and non-CEM students, and improve graduate studies programs.

To achieve this, a high level of general education is required as well as a viable indigenous scientific community. (Yeboah-Ainankwah, 1984, p. 7). In PNG two institutions prepare secondary science teachers. One is Goroka Teachers College which offers prospective teachers a Diploma in Secondary Teaching after a two year course from Grade 12. The great majority of secondary teachers take this course. The Faculty of Education offers a small minority a Bachelor of Education course which is influential, but the remainder of this paper will refer almost entirely to the GTC diplomates.

Emanuel did not achieve much at school and worked in various jobs until he found his niche as a reporter for a variety of socialist newspapers. He married a wealthy heiress, became a publisher and eventually achieved fame and wealth. The cornerstone of his success was producing little blue books selling at five cents each. Eventually he published 500 million copies of these books which the poor were able to buy because of their low price.   It is argued that Haldeman-Julius's publications made a major contribution to the cultural background, both scientific and literary, of the period in the United States of America. His little blue books were bought by children as the cheapest source of information. They were also purchased by working men intent on self advancement. The booklets reflected his general view and that of his authors, being socialist in politics and atheist in religious outlook. They promoted sex education, evolutionary theory and a wide range of excellent literature. However even with Haldeman-Julius's knowledge of and enthusiasm for evolution, he failed to see the demise of the little blue books, which did not change sufficiently over time.",

        "description":"America's urban Catholic schools are in crisis. This report finds that over 1,300 schools have shut down since 1990, mostly in our cities. As a result, some 300,000 students have been displaced--forced to attend other public, private, or parochial schools. The school closures have cost taxpayers more than $20 billion to accommodate the additional students that public schools have had to absorb. Is this a crisis worth addressing? Are further closures inevitable, or can Church leaders, parishioners, philanthropists and/or public policymakers reverse these trends? Should they try? This report answers those questions and more. The report includes a comprehensive survey of the attitudes of U.S. Catholics and the broader public toward inner-city Catholic schools, examines this crisis and offers several suggestions for arresting and perhaps reversing this trend in the interests of better education. By looking at seven case studies, the report shows that in a few cities, such as Wichita, urban Catholic education is making a comeback. However, in other cities like Milwaukee and Washington, D.C., despite public voucher programs, enrollment continues to decline and/or schools are being closed or converted into charters. Following a foreword by Chester E. Finn, Jr. and Michael J. Petrilli, this report contains eight sections: (1) Wichita: Making Catholic Schools Affordable Again (Bryan O'Keefe); (2) Memphis: Revitalization of Diocesan &quot;Jubilee&quot; Schools (Peter Meyer); (3) Denver: Marketing Efforts Yield Results (Marshall Allen); (4) Independent Networks: Nativity  Miguel &amp; Cristo Rey (Peter Meyer); (5) Milwaukee: The Mixed Blessing of Vouchers (Marshall Allen); (6) Washington, D.C.: Archdiocesan Schools to Go It Alone (John J.

The work and responses of 27 students to a series of questions that solicit information about the graphical implications of the first derivative, second derivative, continuity, the value of limits, and the inter-relationships among these concepts was analyzed from their interviews. A double triad was developed to describe students' schema as a framework for the analysis. The study centered on the way students coordinated the various elements of each question, their strategies and difficulties. It was found that coordinating concepts to solve complex problems in a graphical setting is a difficult process. Only two students were considered to have thematized the schema.

To investigate this question, I collected recordings of primary school EAL students as they worked with peers on a mathematics classroom task. Drawing on theoretical and methodological work in discursive psychology (Edwards, 1997), I analysed students' interaction and identified several patterns of attention, including a pattern of attention to mathematical structure. In this paper I report how the students in the study used attention to mathematical structure as part of their joint work on the task. My analysis shows how EAL students are able to participate successfully in mathematics classroom interaction. My analysis also highlights the social nature of this interaction. (Contains 4 endnotes.)

Drawing on interviews with 12 year old pupils we consider the ways in which some pupils used substitution of numbers for letters to extend their ability to manipulate algebraic expressions. We argue that teaching programmes need to emphasise \"seeing the particular in the general\" alongside the manipulation of general expressions. (Contains 1 footnote and 2 figures.)

Evidence is provided and validated, suggesting that representations provide valuable insights into the depth and accuracy of the knowledge prospective teachers bring to instructional settings. It is conjectured that those with weak subject matter knowledge may ask too many open-ended questions, and over rely on their students to \"remember.\" Those growing in their understanding may be reluctant to cede ownership to their students while those with strong understanding include many representations in their lessons.

        "description":"Based on an individual interest theory as a sensitising theory, empirical data are used to gain social interest concepts, as there are situated collective interest and interest-dense situation. These concepts serve as a basis for a social extension of a psychological interest theory. Its construction combines social interactions, the dynamic of epistemic processes and mathematical valency of situations in maths lessons. However, this paper is restricted to the presentation of results concerning social interactions. The construction process of theoretical interaction types is outlined and leads to a typology of interactions which provides the theoretical background for interaction analyses of interest-dense situations and their genesis processes.

Results suggest that students who engage in whole-class discussions that include metacognitive acts as well as transactive discussions about metacognitive acts make gains in their ability to construct proof. Moreover, students' capacity to engage in these types of discussions is a habit of mind that can be scaffolded through the teacher's transactive prompts and facilitative utterances.

They allowed us to analyse both the short term evolution of students' conceptions about infinity of numbers through social interaction, and their relationships with the cultural environment. Moreover, during classroom discussions we observed an autonomous shift from the original tasks to a new question \"Is it possible that an infinity of numbers exists?\" A number of related naive epistemological positions (that seem to depend at least partly on the students' cultural environment) were detected.

The review period covered  July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2004. Audit findings indicate that more emphasis was needed on data reliability and comparability across states. Six recommendations are presented: (1) Stress to states the importance of using a longitudinal student tracking system; (2) Disapprove any future graduation rate formulas that do not use a true cohort except for states that are in the process of developing data systems that would enable them to calculate a cohort graduation rate; (3) Continue to impress upon states the importance of data quality and the need to provide regular guidance, training, and monitoring of their local educational agencies; (4) Publish a list of data definitions that states will be required to use in No Child Left Behind (NCLB) reports; (5) Continue to develop and implement written policies and procedures to monitor states that are in the process of developing data collection systems to ensure the systems will collect student data in accordance with the requirements in NCLB; and (6) Periodically review procedures to monitor the accuracy of the data used by the states and districts to compute graduation rates and make any necessary adjustments. In comments to the draft report, OESE generally agreed with the finding and most of the recommendations: the full text of OESE's comments on the draft report is included as an attachment.

        "author":["McElroy, Richard H."],
        "description":"This descriptive, quantitative study examined the effects of participation in a 1-year Early  Start Preschool Program for 4-year-olds in a state that requires annual testing at the end  of select grades. This study focused primarily on achievement through grade 3. As no  study has evaluated the effectiveness of the program, this research examined whether it  has positively affected the results of the end-of-year tests. The predictor variable for this  study was participation in the Early Start preschool program. For this study, the only 2  groups assessed were children who participated in Early Start and children who did not  participate in the program. The criterion variables or dependent variables in this study  included the state end-of-year tests for the 3rd grade in English and math from 2003 to  2005. Each group of student scores was compared using a 2 tailed t-test, and the measure  of effect determined using Cohen's d statistic. The results of this study determined that  this program does not positively affect achievement in English and mathematics through  3rd grade. These findings could be used to modify the program to better meet the needs  of children and justifies advocacy for children through social justice by providing  conclusive evidence that an academically-focused preschool program does not meet the  academic needs of young children and their families.

The native and non-native college students who took this course experienced online academic instruction for the first time. WebCT gives learners both knowledge input and interactive practice by encouraging divergent thinking and facilitating complex understanding and instant reflection in online discussion. WebCT provides assessment tools, which assist instructors in designing course curriculum, tracking students' learning process, and assessing students' performance. WebCT includes seven assessment tools: online group discussion, feedback, examination, phone conversations, surveys, quizzes, and written assignments. Instructors and learners are able to share information, join group discussions, and send assignments, and issue grades anytime, anywhere. Lastly, within this course design, instructors had access to new technology tools such as Camtasis, Horizon Wimba, and Macromedia breeze. Finally, this paper suggests ways in which instructors can utilize WebCT's technology tools to facilitate assessment, grading, and active student reflection in an effective learning environment.

The choice of such a unit of analysis takes into account the specificity of conceptualization and learning in mathematics, the interest of pre-conceptual competencies-in-action, and the need of studying culturally meaningful situations.

The intent of the teacher investigations was for teachers to interpret their students' thinking as revealed on non-routine, thought-revealing mathematical tasks, known as Case Studies for Kids (Lesh, Hoover, Hole, Kelly &amp; Post, 2000). This research report focuses on instances during the investigations when the teachers engaged in what the author has termed &quot;mini-inquiries&quot;, discussions during which the teachers addressed why their students thought about the associated case studies as they did or the teachers addressed the underlying mathematical complexities associated with the case studies. During these mini-inquiries, the teachers met some of the challenges of attending to students' thinking that Confrey (1993) and Schifter (2001) have identified. (Contains 2 footnotes.)

The 20 participants included Grades 1-12 preservice and inservice teachers. Data consisted of interviews and classroom observations. The findings indicated 8 ways in which the teachers conceptualized WP, e.g., WP as object and experience, and a model of WP as a nesting of mathematics and social contexts. These conceptions played a significant role in framing their teaching of WP in terms of 4 teaching perspectives, including a paradigmatic and a phenomenological approach. Implications for teacher development based on the findings are also discussed. (Contains 2 figures.) [For complete proceedings, see ED500859.]",

A battery of tests on PSP skills was administered to 5th and 6th grade Cypriot students (n=2519). The Rasch model was used and a scale was created for the battery of tests and analyzed for reliability, fit to the model, meaning and validity. The analysis revealed that the battery of tests has satisfactory psychometric properties. The identified scale verifies previous findings suggesting that a number of variables are interwoven in the problem solving process. Yet, problem representation possesses a critical role in the process. The scale also suggests that achievement in posing problems is affected by the type of given information. The findings are discussed with reference to intended uses of teaching mathematics and suggestions for further research are drawn. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)

        "description":"In this paper the notion of &quot;procept&quot; (in the sense of Gray &amp; Tall, 1994) is extended to advanced mathematics by considering mathematical proof as &quot;formal procept&quot;. The statement of a theorem as a symbol may theoretically evoke the proof deduction as a process that may contain sequential procedures and require the synthesis of distinct cognitive units or the general notion of the theorem as an object like a manipulable entity to be used as inputs to other theorems. Therefore, a theorem could act as a pivot between a process (method of proof) and the concept (general notion of the theorem). I hypothesise that mature theorem-based understanding (in the sense of Chin &amp; Tall, 2000) should possess the ability to consider a theorem as a &quot;formal procept&quot;, and it takes time to develop this ability. Some empirical evidence reveals that only a minority of the first year mathematics students at Warwick could recognise a relevant theorem as a &quot;concept&quot; (having a brief notion of a theorem) and did not have the theorem with the notion of its proof as a &quot;formal procept&quot;. A year later some more successful students showed a concept of the theorem as a &quot;formal procept&quot; and their capability of manipulating the theorem flexibly.

The current study confirmed that there were no significant differences in performance related to the presence of direct or indirect measures in the items, but there were some differences in the applied solution strategies.

It is a mental operation performed by manipulating mental images. The aim of this study was to observe pre-service and in-service teachers' ability to visualize the transformation of a curved solid to its net and vice versa, and to try to classify and to analyze students' mistakes and difficulties related to this kind of visualization. The most significant conclusion is that when lacking any experience, many students are unable to imagine the process of unfolding a curved surface. The findings show poor performance in attempts to produce nets or judge drawings as being possible nets of a cylinder or a cone. (Contains 7 figures and 2 tables.)

Primary pupils were asked to draw a stairway of figures (triangles, squares and rectangles) each one bigger than the preceding one. Pupils use two different strategies to tackle this task: (a) conservation of shape by increasing both dimensions of the figure and (b) increasing mainly one dimension of the figure. Each strategy seems to reflect a different way of reasoning, possibly corresponding to a different level of development in geometric thinking. Implications of findings for teaching geometry are discussed. (Contains 4 figures.) [For complete proceedings, see ED500859.]",

Some studies have shown that authentic contexts, such as model-eliciting tasks, have the potential to engage students in making sense of realistic situations. However, there has been little research on the kinds of knowledge needed by teachers to support this type of student learning activity. In this paper, we report on the results of a case study that investigated the ways in which teachers respond to students' thinking while engaged in a model-eliciting task in data analysis. We describe how one teacher used perspective-taking to initially engage students with the task, to explain and justify their models, to assess the quality of their models, and to make connections to other mathematical ideas.

There is a project being carried out in some southern European countries which aims to identify the needs of maths teachers in the lower secondary schools. The theoretical framework of the project is ethnomathematics and mathematics education in multicultural contexts. Bearing in mind the needs expressed by the maths teachers and the problems pointed out by them, three extensive didactic proposals have been prepared based on the activities of craftsmen in those countries with the highest percentage of emigration towards the South of Europe. In the final part of this article some of the initial indications following the introduction of one of these proposals into some Italian schools are briefly described.

However, the link between the examination of students' work and the teachers' actions in the classroom is largely unexamined, particularly at the secondary level. In this paper, I present the results of a study in which teachers had extensive opportunities to examine students' ways of thinking as the students developed models for exponential growth and decay. I describe two related aspects of the practice of one teacher: (a) how she listened to students' alternative solution strategies and (b) how she responded to these strategies in her practice. The actions of the teacher supported extensive student engagement with the task and the students' revising and refining their own mathematical thinking. (Contains 1 footnote.)

It grew slowly for a number of years, but two changes spurred much faster growth. In 1996, the Illinois Community College Board changed its rules to permit both school districts and colleges to claim dually enrolled students for funding based on average daily attendance (schools) or credit hours (colleges). Further growth came in response to the availability of Accelerated College Enrollment (ACE) grants, initiated in 2001 to cover part or all of participating students' tuition and fees. This brief defines the terms &quot;dual enrollment&quot; and &quot;dual credit&quot;; describes their appeal in addressing several critical and emerging issues; lists data pertaining to colleges and programs of study; presents the results of colleges surveyed who were asked about the quality safeguards used in their programs; presents the main strengths and concerns related to the programs; and examines the future of dual credit/enrollment in Illinois in terms of participation, ACE grants, articulation project, and policy issues.",

By conducting case study research, the authors sought to provide a detailed description of local curricular, instructional and support programs, policies and practices that seek to engage low-skilled adults in adult education and literacy programs that are linked to postsecondary CTE and ultimately to family-sustaining wage employment. Features common to the three pathways and lessons learned about implementation, transferability and sustainability are discussed.

        "description":"The Common Core of Data (CCD) is an annual collection of public elementary and secondary education data administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and its collection agent, the U.S. Census Bureau. Data for CCD surveys are provided by state education agencies (SEAs). This report presents findings on public education revenues and expenditures using fiscal year 2006 (FY 06) data from the National Public Education Financial Survey (NPEFS) of the CCD survey system. Programs covered in the NPEFS include regular, special, and vocational education; charter schools (if they reported data to the SEA); and state-run education programs (such as special education centers or education programs for incarcerated youth). The CCD NPEFS is a universe collection of public elementary and secondary education finance data reported annually by SEAs in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the four other jurisdictions of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The NPEFS provides SEA-level data for all revenues and expenditures associated with each reporting state or jurisdiction, including revenues by source and expenditures by function and object. The nonfiscal data item of average daily attendance is also collected. SEAs participate in the CCD voluntarily, following standard definitions for the data items they report. In some cases, SEAs may be unable to report a key data item or may be unable to report a key data item in exact accordance with a CCD definition. When this happens, NCES imputes or adjusts values for these items. Appendix A, Methodology and Technical Notes, in this report contains a detailed discussion of imputations and adjustments. While the tables in this report include data for all NPEFS respondents, the discussion in the text is limited to the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data for all of the current expenditure functions collected on NPEFS are presented in tables 2, 3, and 4. These 10 functions are combined to make 4 categories in tables 5 and 6. Appended are: (1) Methodology and Technical Notes; and (2) Common Core of Data Glossary. (Contains 8 tables and 3 figures.)

The study was divided into two components. One focused on secondary institutions' CTE transition programs and their effects on secondary student performance and college transition as well as student perceptions of the transition programs. The other component examined the postsecondary effects of the selected CTE programs on student transition and postsecondary outcomes, taking a retrospective look at students who matriculated from the specified high school CTE transition programs and comparing them to non-participants from the same sampled high schools. This analysis examined student persistence in college and whether the transition programs were related to remediation, credit attainment, number of terms attended, and certificate or degree attainment. Both components of the study examined the relationship between student outcomes and institutional engagement in CTE transition programs, a measure of institution-level commitment as evidenced by number of articulation agreements and faculty involvement in delivering CTE transition-related courses, on postsecondary education outcomes.",

It is the difference in location for the delivery of the course and the status of the faculty member that often elicits the question, &quot;Are dual credit students who take courses in their high schools actually receiving credit for a college level course, or are they merely being awarded college credit for a component of the high school curriculum?&quot; However, many believe that the location of the delivery of the coursework should be a minor consideration when questioning the integrity of a dual credit program. Of more serious concern should be the issues of student admissions criteria, faculty selection and the assessment of student performance and competency. If a program can withstand scrutiny in these areas, then the issue of location should be of little consequence.

The aim of this paper is to extend this theoretical approach to the classification of algebra rate problems with respect to their complexity. An analysis of problems in textbooks from three different time periods allows us to circumscribe the respective fields of possibilities that students encountered with respect to rate problems.

        "description":"Early in 2003, the National Assessment Governing Board established the National Commission on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) 12th Grade Assessment and Reporting, following the recommendation of retiring Governing Board Executive Director Roy Truby. The Governing Board's charge to the Commission was &quot;To review the current purpose, strengths, and weaknesses of 12th grade assessment and reporting by the NAEP and set forth recommendations for improvement to the National Assessment Governing Board.&quot; The Commission was instructed to focus on improvements needed for 12th grade NAEP and not on the status of high schools generally or the quality and rigor of the high school curriculum. The Commission has attempted to heed this guidance scrupulously. The Commission has met and deliberated five times since March 2003. It focused on answering the following questions: What do we know about 12th grade achievement, what do we need to know, and what can NAEP provide? The Commission received expert testimony from twenty-four witnesses, commissioned and reviewed six white papers and two research studies, conducted a focus group with the Council of Chief State School Officers, and received comments on preliminary Commission recommendations from the National Association of State Boards of Education and Tennessee state education leaders. This report presents the reasons for the Commission's conclusion that 12th grade NAEP should be redesigned and makes recommendations towards the creation of a systematic strategy to increase school and student participation in grade 12 NAEP. The report observes that NAEP's leaders must focus seriously on increasing participation or face the prospect that the quality and credibility of the 12th grade NAEP achievement results will be compromised.

        "description":"For at least 20 years, America has been engaged in the process of school reform, the most recent of which is the P-16 education reform movement. However, the phenomenon of two- and four-year colleges working closely with schools is clearly not new. A divide has developed between the educational levels, resulting in a lack of collaboration among educational sectors, along with frequent competition for scarce resources. However, efforts to bridge the educational divide are beginning to occur through P-16 education initiatives, with community colleges playing an increasingly important role. While community colleges have an integral role to play in P-16 education reform, their involvement has not been recognized in the literature as much as that of other higher education sectors. This brief presents examples of the ways that community colleges are involved with K-12 schools and four-year universities in P-16 education activities.",

Two tasks frame a specific fraction (3/4) in different contexts: as part of an eight-piece bar (area context) and as a location on a number line. The results suggest that students' understanding of fraction develops substantially from 5th to 7th grade. However, Part-to-Whole comparison is strongly dominating students' thinking, and students have difficulties in perceiving a fraction as a number on a number line even on 7th grade.

Thus, it is essential that the planning process includes the integration of data that are collected regularly and that both internal and external professional partners have the opportunity to reflect upon and respond to these data in systematic ways. This paper presents a viable process for accomplishing the effective drafting of a strategic plan. It includes the following components: (a) an assessment system, which drives continuous improvement and includes feedback from professional partners, alumni, and program completers; program level goals based upon performance candidate and enrollment data; departmental goals based upon alignment with institutional goals and program goals; and goals established at the faculty level, as articulated through college-wide committees; (b) an organizational schemata in the form of a data matrix that streamlines and reports upon the goals as established by all constituencies; (c) a schedule of meetings among upper leadership, as represented through the administrative council and chairs of college-wide committees; and (d) a final faculty retreat and meeting scheduled to allow for presentation and reflection upon all data in the matrix, to collaboratively articulate clear and measurable goals and objectives for the strategic plan.

Students' interpretation of arithmetic equations written in words and then structurally similar equations written in formal notation raise issues about when students perceive order which is not strictly left-to-right and the possible significant role the equals sign has in this.

This Numeracy Project enabled teachers to interview each of their students concerning their mathematical knowledge and strategies. The percentage of students who used multiplicative strategies increased from initial to final assessment. However, the percentage of the students from two low socio-economic schools was significantly lower, both at the initial and final assessment, than that from two upper socio-economic schools. It is suggested that it may be inappropriate to expect secondary school students to repeat the progress through additive stages that Piaget reports for younger children. Instead, it may be better to move them directly to multiplicative thinking. (Contains 1 footnote and 2 tables.) [This Project is copyright by the New Zealand Ministry of Education.

This case was obtained from an exploratory study carried out in a classroom of eighteen students when the employment of certain cultural artifacts was introduced to approach the theme of basic geometrical transformations. The analysis of the activity from a communicational approach to learning (Sfard, 2001) was useful to detect objectification of the geometric properties involved. Also, probable use schema construction derived from the manipulation of Cabri-II software and of large jointed machines allowed for hypotheses to be put forward on the realization of internalization processes (Mariotti, 2002).

Findings show that the use of the technological tool permits students of this age to spontaneously develop variants of these techniques within tasks that simultaneously afford the co-emergence of related conceptual notions.

We report on one class episode and one student as a case study for understanding multimodal learning. Analyses focus on how students use various texts such as speech and calculator keystrokes as resources to create meaning. This work suggests that a broader perspective and use of modes can support learning and provide students, especially those at-risk, with greater access to mathematics.

Their answers reveal a definite preference for students to solve linear equations in a standard order even if it is not the most efficient way.

The purpose of this report is to increase understanding of the achievement levels for the NAEP: what they are, and what they are not. The report is a reference for the American public, especially educators, parents, students, and policymakers. Seven booklets make up the report; each booklet focuses on one of the subjects for which NAEP achievement levels have been set. These include mathematics, science, reading, writing, civics, U.S. history, and geography. The information in this report will be helpful in interpreting accurately the meaning of the \"Mathematics\" NAEP achievement levels and student performance relative to the levels. The information will also aid in understanding the NAEP reports, commonly known as \"The Nation's Report Card.\" Contents for this report include: (1) Understanding Achievement Levels for the Mathematics National Assessment of Educational Progress; (2) Overview of the Framework for the National Assessment of Educational Progress in Mathematics; (3) Achievement Levels: Descriptions and Cutscores; (4) Achievement Levels: Sample Items; and (5) Performance Data.

Our analyses revealed that small gender differences in favour of males persisted but had decreased over time. Consistent with reports from previous studies, gender differences in performance were more marked at senior high school than at junior high school grades. (Contains 1 footnote and 4 tables.)

The assessment tasks along with students' responses to the tasks and classroom observation were major methods of data collection. Interweaving the tasks with analyzing students' responses to the tasks was a valuable way of assessment in which students enhanced their learning and teachers gained better understanding of students learning informing their instructional decision- making.

A similar parallel structure between problem solving and problem posing did not obtain for the U.S. sixth graders in the study. The present study attempts to locate this type of parallel structure by analyzing a broader sample of U.S. students. The results of this study show that U.S. seventh graders are much more likely than sixth graders to use abstract strategies. The findings appear to support a relationship between the use of abstract problem solving strategies and the tendency to pose extension problems (problems that go beyond the given information) for the seventh graders.

        "description":"While the influence of individuals' participation in practices of economic subsistence on the development of mathematical knowledge has been widely reported in the literature, there are not as many studies about the relationship between cultural life and mathematical cognition in the context of recreational practices. This article reports a study on the development of arithmetical knowledge and reasoning in the context of adults' and children's engagement in a game of dominoes. The study was carried out in a small community in Northeastern Brazil, where twenty-five individuals were regular players of the game. The results show that subjects with little or no formal schooling were highly sophisticated in performing arithmetic operations, examining hypothesis, and coordinating the rules and goals of a complex game. Implications for the study of recreational practices and their interplay with school instruction are discussed. [For complete proceedings, see ED500858.]",

Thus, in this study the effects of deliberately teaching the abstraction of the density of numbers on the number line was tested in a quasi-experimental study at the beginning of students' first course in calculus. The results suggest a significant and stable effect in the post test between the test group and control group. This effect had an important relation to the level and quality of abstraction of the number line, which was found in the short essays written by the participants of the test group during the intervention.

These difficulties can be traced back to earlier experiences when they were students of junior and high school. The reflection on these difficulties by student teachers, comparing to informal ways of solving the problems is a fundamental step of the pre-service programme in which they are involved. In this communication I also present and discuss an attempt to promote development of prospective teachers' own knowledge of ratio and proportion as well as their awareness of the pupils' difficulties on this subject.

        "description":"My research involves studying mathematics teachers' classroom implementation of their learning from an 8 weeks in-service course at a university in Pakistan. In this paper I discuss my learning, resulting from participation in collaborative work with teachers in my research. I performed two roles: the role of teacher educator supporting teachers' trying out their new aims of teaching in the classroom and also the role of researcher collecting data during the teachers' engagement in their learning. I was also engaged in self-inquiry into my role as a teacher educator through my own reflection on the processes and issues of the teachers' learning as well as my participation in the two roles. The analysis of my participation in our collaborative partnership reveals that although I tried not to dominate, I recognised that my own ethical and theoretical perspectives of being a teacher educator in the Pakistani context made me react in ways that could be regarded as directing the teachers' thinking and behaviour. This became one of the major issues or tensions in my study. I was not aware of this issue until I experienced the reality of these teachers' practices. (Contains 2 endnotes.)

The aim of such actions is often to repair a communicational breach resulting from differences in the interlocutors' uses of words. As was found in our study, only some of the defining actions would result in texts known as mathematical definitions. The point of departure of our research project is that the effectiveness of the defining actions is as much a function of the action itself as of its contexts. Our focus in this research is thus broader than in the past studies on definitions, and includes the when and why of defining along with their how. (Contains 7 footnotes and 4 figures.)

Drawing from ecological-complexity theory it elaborates on a theoretical framework for observing and acting upon collective learning. To interpret the relation between individual action, social interaction and the collective cognitive domain we adopt the thermodynamic notion of energy-rich matter and the enactivist notion of inter-objectivity. We study the structure, the behavior and the ecology of the collective cognitive domain not only as a catalyst for individual learning, but as a learning body in itself, that emerges from the actions and interactions of individual learning agents.

        "description":"The paper is based upon a case-study of mentoring in teacher education in Norway. It describes the practice of the cooperating teacher and how mentoring in the practice-field contributes to student teachers learning. The main focus is how student teachers develop pedagogical content knowledge in mathematics through reflections with the mentor about their teaching episodes. The study draws attention to how Vygotsky's and others' ideas about scaffolding and assisting in the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) can be useful in understanding how student teachers learn to teach mathematics. This paper specially focuses the role of imitation and modelling. (Contains 8 footnotes.) [For complete proceedings, see ED500858.]",

It is also a key aspect of algebraic expectation, the algebraic skill that parallels numeric estimation. The progress in this ability of 50 students learning mathematics with CAS over two school years was monitored using a novel instrument called the Algebraic Expectation Quiz. Students began with very low facility and confidence and made moderate progress, confirming the importance of addressing this obstacle to using CAS explicitly in the curriculum. We offer conclusions about test items, students' strengths and weaknesses and suggest possible teaching actions. The results demonstrate that recognizing equivalence, even in simple cases, is a significant obstacle for students. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.) [For complete proceedings, see ED500860.]",

Eight students were interviewed at the commencement, in the middle, and at the end of the course to investigate which factors contributed to this change and how. We found that the effect of broad sources informing efficacy beliefs identified by Bandura (1997) supplemented by the influence of individuals involved in the course played a major role in the cyclical process of efficacy change.

Nathan was able to apply the operations of his GNS to his understanding of part-whole relations and his emerging use of fractional language, in order to rename fractions generated through iterations of unit fractions (e.g. 3/8 as another name for six iterations of 1/16). Through structured teaching episodes, Nathan was eventually able to find common partitions for different unit fractions and use the common partition to produce (and name) the sum of the two fractions. The on-screen actions with the computer manipulatives, used in this teaching experiment, were both engendering and constraining for Nathan's construction of these mental strategies.

We focused on 5th graders' learning &quot;division with decimals&quot; as it is known to be difficult to understand in its meaning because of the implicit model. We discuss how children may develop logic beyond the implicit model in terms of formational operational thinking. We suggested that children's explanations based on two kinds of reversibility were effective to overcome the model, and that the overcoming processes enabled them to conceive multiplication and division as a system of operations.

Elementary school teachers from a metropolitan city of Korea (N = 281) participated in this study. To deal with this problem, this study employs the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a research framework and Structural Equation Modeling using AMOS 4.0 as a statistical model was used to analyze the data. The findings indicate that the TPB is a useful model for explaining teacher change in teaching practice, suggesting that beliefs-based programs will be effective for successful teacher education.

In contrast, many of these students employed other non-standard metaphors, involving for example collapsing dimensions, to explore these situations and to build their emerging understanding of limit concepts.

This paper will summarise the major points which have been revealed so far. There appears to have been no previous research on new provincial high school teachers in P.N.G., though internationally there is a massive amount of data on new teachers. However it is interesting to note that almost all this research comes from developed countries: a computer search yielded no comparable data from any other developing country. Other research on secondary teachers in P.N.G. which at times complements this research includes work by Flaherty (1981), Guthrie (1983), Kuhlman (1981), Wilson (1981) and Wohlberg (1979). Research by Richardson and Van der Veur (1968) and Smith, Carss and Power (1979) on primary school teachers is also relevant.

        "author":["Salas, Gayla L."],
        "description":"This action research project was developed in order to increase student literacy, particularly in the area of reading, for students who were considered at-risk. The targeted student population was 2nd grade students who were served within a primary cross-categorical special education program. The classroom was housed in an elementary (K-2) school, located in a small Midwest community. The literature showed many reasons for low literacy development, including lack of reading opportunities at home, lack of background knowledge, and lack of exposure to both fiction and non-fiction resources. The initial analysis of data was determined by looking at the results of DIBELS scores. In phoneme segmentation fluency, one-third of the second-grade students fell below the fall first-grade benchmark. Star Reading scores results showed that all of the second grade students measured ranged in performance from one to one and one-half years behind grade level. The review of literature showed a number of suggestions for improving literacy, including increased reading time, and providing more interesting reading and activities, such as Readers Theater. Also suggested was providing related fiction and non-fiction activities. The teacher researcher chose to focus on increasing fiction/non-fiction resources and using Readers Theater activities. During the 14-week research period, the teacher researcher developed the classroom library with more and often related fiction/non-fiction resources. Students were initially exposed to more visits to the school library, and then offered large selections of school library books within the classroom, as available library time decreased. Readers Theater activities were selected for use each week during the research period. Post intervention analysis of the DIBELS assessment showed increase in reading/literacy areas of phoneme segmentation, and non-sense word fluency. The Star Reading assessment showed growth in grade level performance. However, only half of the students showed growth in percentile rank. Growth or lack thereof can not easily be attributed to the interventions as there were many factors during the school day that may have impacted performance, positively or otherwise.

This paper examines FL difficulties as well as effective strategies that others have used to conquer these challenges. Research indicates that LED students and at-risk students both have FL learning difficulties, due to deficiencies in their native languages. Research suggests that teachers should use multi-sensory approaches; however, they should also explicitly teach phonology/orthography and grammar, as these may be necessary for LED and at-risk students to understand and use the target language.

The protocol highlights the complexities inherent in understanding definitions of quadrilaterals, as reported widely by other researchers.

But how can we get knowledge about the development of individual implicit theories of teacher students? In this article, we propose a method to explore teacher students' individual conceptions about learning and teaching mathematics. It is based on Kelly's personal construct theory and uses repertory grid methodology for data collection as well as formal concept analysis for data analysis. The method was applied in a qualitative evaluation study of a pre-service teacher course in Darmstadt. (Contains 5 figures.) [For complete proceedings, see ED500860.]",

As a result, states may no longer include recipients of general educational development (GED) certificates or alternative diplomas in their graduation rates; (4) All high school teachers who teach core subjects should have met the state's &quot;highly qualified&quot; requirement by the end of the 2005-2006 school year; and (5) Annually test (in the subjects of reading, math, and, eventually, science (by 2007-2008)) all high school students in at least one grade, including limited English-proficient students and students with disabilities, providing appropriate accommodations when necessary.

Early College High Schools (ECHS) are developing partnerships, curricula and schedules necessary to offer college credits to high school students. This report finds that Early College High Schools enrolled students who are representative of populations traditionally underserved in higher education. Adequate funding remains an issue critical to the long-term sustainability of early college high schools: resolving this long-term resource issue remains the top priority on the minds of ECHS leaders, and advocating for friendly dual-enrollment policies at various levels of government clearly will be needed for some time if the option of taking college-level courses is available to an increasing number of students. Lists of additional resources; and examples of state programs are included. (Contains 2 endnotes.) [This publication was produced by the National High School Center.]",

Increasing the capacity of high schools to provide extra help for ninth-grade students to catch up, to learn to read well, and to earn credits in English and algebra is critical, as these academic achievements are key predictors of whether students are likely to graduate on time (Quint, 2006). Transitions into high school can be eased when both structural and specialized curricula reforms are in place. This brief offers several take-aways at the state, district, and school levels.

Findings from these evaluations suggest that positive change is associated with a combination of instructional improvement and structural changes in school organization and class schedules. The brief is organized according to five cross-cutting challenges that high schools face in seeking to influence student outcomes: (1) Assisting students who enter high school with poor academic skills; (2) Improving instructional content and practice; (3) Creating a personalized and orderly learning environment; (4) Providing work-based learning opportunities and preparing students for the world beyond high school; and (5) Stimulating change in overstressed high schools.

Many universities and colleges are struggling with meeting the demands of a rapidly changing world. Reflections in this paper are based on experiences from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Attention has been given to the intelligent use of technology as a means of meeting pressing challenges. What does this mean? I ask a series of questions, the answers of which form the basis for a faculty development program. What qualities and skills should our graduates have? What consequences does this have for the way we approach teaching and learning? And what role does technology play? In short, we must focus on faculty training courses and the ensuing development cycles of trial, error, refinement and sharing. Guiding principles for these activities should be: (1) It is about learning; (2) It is about easy access; (3) It is about emphasizing collaboration; and (4) It is about support.",

Learning is also an embodiment of education which transcends the four walls of the classroom. Therefore, education is an added knowledge to one's existing knowledge which is expected to lead to behavioral modification on the part of the educatee, whose efficiency and performance in his/her daily activities should consequently improve positively. In the same vein, mentoring has a multi-faceted dimension, not limited only to the education industry but also includes all other aspects of human development process. Therefore, this paper analyses the varying dimensions of mentoring phenomenon which may be characterized by flexibility of learning process among different groups of people in any given society. The totality of such a learning encounter through mentoring process is aimed at achieving an all-round development of an individual, whether such is from cognitive, psychomotor or affective domain!",

Attitude Scale towards Chemistry has been administered before and after applications. The application has been started with displaying the chosen simulation experiments with the computer program called CCI-Project (Creative Chemistry on the Web) ETH (Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule-Zurich). When the simulation experiments have been displayed, students have been assigned in groups of 3-4 randomly. Totally 11 Web Based Projects have been prepared. Each of the teams has determined a project question related to their given simulation experiment. When teams have completed their projects, they have presented them by using power-point. Researchers have videotaped project presentations. After presentations, project presentations have been displayed consecutively and discussed in class. Researchers have evaluated each team's projects by &quot;Project Sufficiency Form&quot;. While students' scores of Project Sufficiency Form have been accepted as their project performance, both their final grades and project performance score have been accepted as student performance. Using paired-samples t-test has compared pre- and post-test results of attitude scale and a statistical difference has been found. Also a relationship between students' attitudes and performance has been examined by using regression analyze. (Contains 1 figure and 3 tables.)",

Our goal in the research reported in this paper was to investigate, in a three-tiered teaching experiment, the cycles of learning of two researchers, six teachers, and the students in three grade 4 classes and three grade 5 classes, in a six-month long lesson study project in the first half of 2002. The learning processes evolved in each of the three tiers (students, teachers, and researchers) over the course of three iterations of a lesson on measurement taught respectively in grades 4 and 5 by the three grade 4 and three grade 5 teachers. This paper documents some of these shifts in learning in each of the three tiers and assesses this form of lesson study for professional development, through the eyes of the teachers.

The students were also asked to carry out the experience using a TI 83+ graphic calculator equipped with a sensor, and to discuss and explain the differences between their own graphs and the ones obtained with the calculator. We analyze the students' processes of meaning production in terms of the way diverse semiotic resources such as gestures, graphs, words and artifacts become interwoven during the mathematical activity. Our findings suggest that a complex relationship between gestures and words allow the students to make sense of the time-space graphic expressions. (Contains 4 figures.)

        "description":"In this report, we address the following questions: What aspects of information do preservice elementary teachers rely on when performing inductive reasoning? What contexts enable them to perceive the inherent invariant relationships from a finite sample and, thus, formulate viable generalizations? To what extent are they able to justify inductive results noninductively? Our responses are based mostly on inductors' ability to perceive similarity between compared entities that they compute over numerical and figural cues. We tested a model of similarity and examined predictions of the model in the case of two problem tasks. In the model, we assume that both numerical and figural cues contribute to similarity leading to induction. An analysis of the induction processes of the 42 participants suggests that even if relationships among numerical values have had greater contribution to similarity than did figural ones, those who induced figurally acquired a better understanding of the generalizations they constructed.

After a 12-week course on Cabri and the writing of conjectures and proofs, students were asked to write and prove conjectures based on their observations in six Cabri-based activities. We analyzed the written data in the light of Balacheff's work (1987, 1999). Although progress is shown on the level of the development of knowledge, in that the objects and their relationships become more meaningful, there are still many difficulties in decontextualizing the activities and in the development of a functional language, necessary for the passage from pragmatic to intellectual tools.

This study aimed to seek an answer to the question as to whether Computer-Mediated Communication Technologies be a solution for overcoming these problems. The study was conducted as additional practice to the foreign language lessons with the participation of 60 students. Task-based language teaching principles were taken as basis in preparation of the teaching materials in the study, in which text and voice chat applications among the Computer-Mediated Communication Technologies were used. During the applications data were collected in several ways: participants' perspectives regarding their changing experiences and the types of tasks used were investigated through the use of open-ended questionnaires after each session; a general insight was obtained into the students' experiences with close-ended questionnaires given at the end of the study; and the use of the target language in communications among students were determined by investigating the text communication logs. From a user-oriented perspective, the results of the study shed light on the strategies that can be used in computer-mediated communication technologies valuing the experiences and perceptions of the learners.

With the increased accountability for principals to achieve and maintain adequate yearly progress, test scores are often seen by teachers and parents as principals' top priority. Relationships are seen as secondary and they should be higher on the priority list. It is our contention that if principals spend more time building relationships with students, teachers, parents, and community members, test scores will rise and discipline referrals will diminish. Several methods were used to collect data for this study: (1) A thorough review of literature on principals and relationships was completed; (2) Five principals from China were surveyed regarding ways they build relationships with young children in their schools; (3) Principals were interviewed as to how they build relationships with students, teachers, parents/families and the community; and (4) Teachers were informally questioned as to how principals currently work to build relationships and how they would like to see principals build relationships with people in their school community. Recommendations for practice including getting to know the students on a professional, yet personal level, understanding the needs of teachers, building positive rapport with families, and connecting to the community are given for principals to build relationships with school constituents.",

Initial student reaction was positive. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation indicated a statistically significant increase in motivation as a result of the interactions. Abundant literature is clear that when motivation increases, ability and confidence follow. Students cited several elements of the instructional design in explaining their increased proficiency: the sessions' emphasis on subjects interesting and pertinent to young adults, including American culture and traditions; spontaneous and authentic interaction with a native speaker; and the implementation of techniques to lessen anxiety. Female students reported more of an increase in motivation then their male counterparts.

All public and private universities providing law graduate degree by conventional system but many people are deprived from this opportunity. Thus to increase equitable access to education and to develop the human resources of the country the Bangladesh Open University playing significant role. Large numbers of students of rural areas, particularly women, out of school and adults who must do work to support their families are include with the university. Bangladesh Open University is the only institution in Bangladesh which imparts education in open and distance mode and offers 23 formal programmes, the demand for the introduction of LL.B programme for the benefit of those who have been, for various reasons, deprived of the opportunity of undertaking graduate course in law in conventional mode of education. The decision to offer the programme in distance mode is being taken in response to the earnest desire of the relevant quarters expressed in various dailies and formal applications submitted to the university authority as the learners in the open and distance mode learn at his own place and any time whenever he feels convenient to learn and is not for restricted by time, space or age. Distance learning is, indeed, presently considered as a viable alternative of the conventional system of education to fulfill the growing demand for legal education.

Semistructured interviews with faculty members teaching online courses were used as the primary source to collect data about the experiences of faculty members in online courses. Results of the study showed that faculty members' interest in using technology and the amount of time available to them for online course design affected the quality of online courses. The findings of this study also indicated that design quality of online courses is affected by the interest of faculty members to use the technology and the time that they can devote to planning, designing, and developing online courses. The poor design of existing online courses, high learning expectations of individuals from these courses, and the future of online courses are the concerns of faculty members.

Data were collected from the selected sample employing a questionnaire and an interview (which include open ended items). The results indicate that the nature of the tutorial services provided by tutors does not follow the fundamental principles of distance education. The tutorial programs were devoted largely to teachers' verbal explanation of descriptive facts which is the typical feature of conventional face-to-face instruction. The late arrival of course modules to the students; the distribution of modules very close to the actual dates of the tutorial sessions; tutors' reliance on the conventional face-to-face mode of instruction; large class size and the heavy workloads imposed upon tutors in some tutorial centers were some of the major constraints that caused the program to be implemented in an unsatisfactory way.

        "description":"The impact of ever-increasing numbers of online courses on the demographic composition of classes has meant that the notions of diversity, multiculturality and globalization are now key aspects of curriculum planning. With the internationalization and globalization of education, and faced with rising needs for an increasingly educated and more adequately trained workforce, universities are offering more flexible programs, assisted by new educational and communications technologies. Faced with this diversity of populations and needs, many instructors are becoming aware of the importance of addressing the notions of multiculturality and interculturality in the design of online however this raises many questions. For example, how do we integrate and address this multicultural dimension in a distance education course aimed at students who live in diverse cultural environments? How do the challenges of intercultural communication in an online environment affect online teaching and learning? What are the characteristics of an online course that is inclusive of all types of diversity, and what are the guiding principles for designing such courses? We will attempt to answer some of these questions by first exploring the concepts of culture and learning cultures. This will help us to characterize the impact on online learning of particular cultural dimensions. We will then present and discuss different online instructional design models that are culturally inclusive, and conclude with the description of a mediated instructional training module on the management of the cultural dimension of online teaching and learning. This module is mainly addressed to teachers and designers of online courses. (Contains 12 endnotes, 2 figures, and 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Mobile Learning (M-Learning) is an approach to E-Learning that utilizes mobile devices.  Learning Management System (LMS) should enable M-Learning. Unfortunately, M-Learning  is not the same at each educational institution. Assessment is one of the learning activities that can be achieved electronically and via mobile device. Mobile assessment relies on services that are not part of the LMS. Integrating different external systems and services to be virtually part of LMS is one of integration challenges. This paper presents a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to integrate mobile assessment in LMS. Proposed Architecture consists of two layers: Interface layer, and Service layer. Interface layer interacts with instructors and learners via portals, and with external organization services via Web services. Service layer contains core system services and has three sub layers: Orchestration, Application Services, and Agents layer. Orchestration layer is the layer that holds business logic required by system processes. Application Services layer contains set of stateless services that are capable of performing certain tasks. Agents' layer presents the suggested required software agents to serve the overall system. Suggested agents are Analyzer and Tracker. Analyzer is required to analyze students assessments to detect learning deficiencies. Tracker agent tracks students to remind with missing assessments. SOA facilitated integration of software agents within LMS, and implementation of new processes to support learning. (Contains 15 figures.)",

        "description":"With the vast development of various technologies, learning today is no longer confined to classrooms with lecture delivery as the only method of conveying knowledge, rather, an electronic means of learning has continued to evolve. Electronic learning (e-Learning), which facilitates education using communications networks, has made learning possible from anywhere at anytime using the Internet, wide area networks or local area networks. Notably, e-Learning applications which have now become central to the learning process may be developed using proprietary programming tools and the process of acquiring and using them to develop large software application is not only complex but require a huge sum of money. A viable alternative is to utilize the open source software platform that allows software  engineers and institutions the right to reuse, study, distribute and localize to satisfy user's requirements. This paper provides an overview of e-Learning and the open source domain as well as discusses how open source can be used to speedily realizes the development of an e-Learning application in a web environment using an adaptive process. Specifically, the  authors described their preliminary experiment of implementing an open source e-Learning platform by adapting free PHP source code and MySQL database to suit an electronic class bulletin board.

Our research, and the work of others, indicates that the impact of testing depends on many factors, not the least of which involves how teachers prepare their students for the test. In this particular report we focus on the ways in which teachers engage in what is commonly referred to as &quot;teaching to the test&quot;. Our results indicate that this can manifest itself in many ways ranging from drill on test taking mechanics to the incorporation of more complex problem activities into everyday instruction. We explore how each plays out in the context of classroom instruction, and the implications this may have for students. (Contains 4 footnotes.) [For complete proceedings, see ED500860.]",

Notions from cognitive linguistics have been introduced to research in mathematics education recently, but there have been little studies about what potential the framework of mental space has in understanding mathematics teaching and learning. This paper will present an analysis of classroom data based on that framework. The data was collected at lessons of linear equation word problems of a Japanese seventh grade classroom. It is argued that the mental space theory will provide a useful framework for understanding the process of mathematics instruction, and that the idea of mental space blending could be a powerful tool for analyzing mathematical problems.

It draws from a wider study focusing on language practices in intermediate multilingual mathematics classrooms in South Africa. In the study the notion of cultural models (Gee, 1999) is used as an analytic tool to describe and explain the language practices in a multilingual Grade 4 mathematics classroom where learners learn in English, a language that is not their main language. The main argument of the paper is that in a context like South Africa, where mathematics and English have symbolic power, and where procedural discourse dominates over conceptual discourse in mathematics teaching and learning, a practice is forged wherein it is difficult to move mathematics beyond procedural discourse.

The research suggests that, for students to reap the benefits of working with an accurate image, they need to set aside, during the exploration phase, the traditional attitude of suspicion towards diagrams, and to recognize that dynamic geometry diagrams offer valuable and accurate visual evidence.

Despite its importance in the work of mathematicians, it has been argued that aesthetics cannot be incorporated into school mathematics given students' difficulties with basic problem-solving skills (Dreyfus and Eisenberg, 1986; 1996). In contrast, this paper argues that it is both possible and desirable to incorporate aesthetic concerns into the mathematical activities of students. The argument is based on a re-articulation of both the nature and purposes of the aesthetic in school mathematics that extends beyond the objective, product-oriented interpretations more commonly discussed.

        "description":"This paper outlines a way of connecting theory and reflective practice in mathematics teacher education. The construct of personal theories is put forward as an innovative pedagogical tool for connecting theory to practice through reflective writing. The cognitive process of \"noticing and naming\" emerged as way of theorising practice and helped to track a pathway of professional and personal growth. Personal theories highlight how a narrative and reflective orientation to teacher education can enhance the process of learning to teach mathematics by acknowledging the affective factors involved in developing an autonomous mathematical identity. It is argued that connecting theory and reflective practice can be particularly useful in developing a reflective disposition and should begin with eliciting and analysing personal beliefs and theories.

When the given fractions share a common denominator or numerator, a simple strategy is to keep the common value and choose an intermediate value for the other component. 5th graders used this strategy on both common-numerator and common-denominator problems, and judged it &quot;very smart&quot; when it was modeled. 7th graders typically converted common numerator fractions to a common denominator and often judged the strategy of picking an intermediate denominator &quot;not smart.&quot; (Contains 2 figures.)

Rasch methodology was used to develop a diagnostic  instrument that reveals children's misconceptions. Two versions of this instrument, one with &quot;models&quot; thought to facilitate proportional reasoning and one without were given to a sample of 303 children. We propose a methodology for examining systematically the pupils' additive errors, their effect on ratio reasoning and how contingent on &quot;model&quot; presentation this is. First we provide a measure on which pupils, item-difficulty and additive errors can be located. We then construct a new measure, which we name &quot;tendency for additive strategy&quot;. Finally, we find that the presence of &quot;models&quot; affects this new measure and draw inferences for choices of items in assessment and teaching. (Contains 3 tables.)

While the first theme is at least partly mathematical, the second interweaves cognition and epistemology. Anchored in student data from an extended classroom teaching experiment in the mathematics of change, we focus on key choices needed to build narratives to help researchers capture, in detail, how students understand their own engagement with their mathematics.

The results presented in this report are based on a sample of students in grades 6 through 12 who represented the 28,182,000 students in grades 6 through 12 in the United States in early 2003. The data revealed that roughly nine out of every 10 students (91 percent) in grades 6 through 12 had parents who expected them to continue their education beyond high school, with about two-thirds (65 percent) having had parents who expected them to finish college. Other findings presented in this report show that about one-third (32 percent) of students had parents who perceived that their child's school did very well at providing information to help their child plan for postsecondary education. Finally, among students whose parents expected them to continue their education after high school, 82 percent had parents who reported that the family was planning on helping to pay for their child's postsecondary education costs, and among those whose parents reported that the family was planning on helping to pay the costs, 66 percent had parents who reported that they had enough information about postsecondary education costs to begin planning.

However, research evidence indicates that formative assessment is more likely to raise student achievement. Although some students are able to use summative assessment formatively, devising their own self-regulated learning strategies, which will support them in lifelong learning, many students fail to do so and for them an emphasis on summative assessment often leads to a reduction in self-efficacy and motivation. This paper reports on an investigation into students' beliefs about themselves as learners of mathematics and the strategies they use before and after assessment. Although most students believe in the value of revision, they often fail to employ effective revision strategies and many fail to use assessment results formatively. (Contains 1 table.)

In this approach, virtual copies of real materials are manipulated with mouse movements to replicate the traditional physical manipulation of real materials. The paper reports on three case studies where the approach was used to teach different mathematics topics (e.g., equivalent fractions and decimal fraction scales) to a Year 6-7 and a Year 7 class. It describes and analyses the virtual materials in relation to how they relate to prior teaching with physical and pictorial materials. It speculates on the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, and the effect differences between physical and mouse manipulations have on learning. (Contains 3 figures.)

This phenomenon is called the \"illusion of linearity\". This paper presents a teaching experiment in which we developed and tested a learning environment to help students overcome the illusion of linearity. The experiment was successful in improving students' performance on non-linear problems, but this improvement was disappointingly small. Moreover, there was a decline in students' performance on linear problems. So, the experiment was not successful in developing in students a profound conceptual understanding of proportional and non-proportional relations, which includes the disposition to distinguish between situations that can and cannot be modelled linearly.

Here we illuminate two key concepts that are helping us better understand the affects of various communities on the development of our cooperating teachers. These concepts are Wenger's (1998) modes of participation and regimes of accountability. By looking specifically for variation among different communities' regimes of accountability, and the modes of participation they engender, we are able to better understand the development (or lack thereof) that we are seeing take place in our participants.

Accompanying the recent increases, however, is a growing disparity in life expectancy between individuals with high and low income and between those with more and less education. The difference in life expectancy across socioeconomic groups is significantly larger now than in 1980 or 1990. A similar trend is evident in Great Britain but not in Canada, where the gap in life expectancy between high- and low-income individuals has declined. Increasing longevity, by itself, has clear implications  for Social Security and Medicare expenditures. As beneficiaries live longer, they will receive benefits for a longer period, putting additional pressure on the programs' finances. The implications of a continued widening of the gap in life expectancy by socioeconomic status are clear for Social Security but less so for Medicare. For Social Security, a widening gap would worsen the long-term shortfall in financing and reduce the program's progressivity--the extent to which it redistributes resources from high-income to low-income beneficiaries  on a lifetime basis. For Medicare, it is not clear whether a widening gap would exacerbate the cost increases that will result from increasing longevity. How the share of Medicare spending on low-income individuals would change depends on how the percentage change in life expectancy at age 65 compares for the various groups of beneficiaries.

The essays, written in response to seven different prompts, were scored by automated essay scoring. The results showed significant differences across the four grades and over time for each of the eight outcome variables.

Five questions set the context by assessing understanding of theoretical expectation and representation of repeated trials in a stacked dot (line) plot. Four questions provide opportunity to display appreciation of variation from point expectation and four questions address variation from distributional expectation. A total of 707 students in grades 3 to 9 answered some or all of these questions. A subset of 334 students then took part in a unit of study on chance and data emphasising variation. These students answered a post-test including the same items. Analysis showed a progression across the years of schooling, plateauing at grade 7 and improvement for all grades after instruction.

The participants' explanations focused on attending to patterns, location of zero of the function and pointwise calculation of the function values.

Enriched transcripts and visual displays of the cognitive, social (Dreyfus, Hershkowitz, & Schwarz, 2001) and affective elements (Williams, 2002) of Dean's interrupted abstraction process informed the identification of factors that inhibited Dean's constructing process. It was found Dean possessed an empirical, not theoretical, generalization (Davydov, 1990) about sums of interior angles of triangles that was an inadequate cognitive artifact for constructing the new more complex theoretical generalization.

As part of a semester long classroom teaching experiment in a first course in differential equations, we conducted task-based interviews with six students after their study of first order differential equations and prior to instruction on SDEs in order to obtain baseline data on their conceptual resources for SDEs. Interpretative analysis of the interview data generated the following three themes pertaining to student reasoning in situations dealing with SDEs. First, students used their conception of rate as a reasoning tool. Second, students used quantification as a mental operation, and third, students enacted what we call a function-variable scheme in their efforts. [For complete proceedings, see ED500860.]",

Such undergraduates first understand proof as an algorithm, or a step-by-step mechanical prescription for proving certain types of statements. The students can then condense this algorithm into a processor, a shorter list of global, qualitative steps. By reflecting on the process, successful students can view proof as an argument, something that establishes the veracity of a mathematical statement. I illustrate a student in real analysis who followed this learning progression to learn the concept of proof by induction. Finally, I note that many students who view proof as a process fail to ever view proof as an argument and I discuss the consequences of these students' narrow view of proof.

This book is a collection of the diverse viewpoints presented at the international symposium, \"Examining the Safety of High-Risk Interventions for Children and Young People\" (Ithaca, New York, June 1-4, 2005). It presents frank examination of the legal, ethical, and historical uses of physical restraints and seclusion. Also addressed in this collection are issues of safety, the psychological and emotional impacts of restraint, guidelines for development and use, as well as clinical and organizational strategies likely to reduce use. Intended for use by professionals who want to address the impact of aggression and violence in residential care, this volume contributes to the discussion of the appropriate use of high-risk interventions and the ways to improve the general quality of child residential treatment services though safe and harm-free environments. Following a foreword by Jaap E. Doek, the book contains six parts.

This monograph describes the levels of competence used in developing competency-based educational programs and provides a taxonomy that can be used in developing competency-based instruction.

Level 3 includes domains which are clusters of related competences. Level 4 includes clusters of domains which form a job. The monograph includes suggestions for writing competencies. It describes the A-B-C-Ds of writing a competence including audience, behavior, conditions, and degree. The issues of sequencing objectives and taxonomies of objectives are also discussed.

        "description":"The purpose of this thesis was to create a lesson design to train parent/educators in the art of preparing lessons incorporating biblical reasoning throughout all subjects. It is an introductory seminar and not intended to provide complete training in this area. A sample group of parent educators were made available to pilot the program. Among these parents were two parents who were well seasoned in homeschooling their children, but had no experience with writing their own lesson plans. Their practice had been to use prewritten plans for their school programs. There were other parents just beginning to homeschool their children. Additionally, there was one couple who had not made the decision to school at home. This couple came to gain an idea of how to go about planning lessons should they choose to take the option of schooling at home. A PowerPoint[R] presentation of individual concepts was made for each session. There were times allowed for question and answer, and times allowed for practice and examining of materials. Results of the feedback provided by the parents indicated that this lesson design was effective, but more time was needed for guided practice as the parents research and write their own lesson plans. It is suggested that, for this seminar to be completely effective, subsequent meetings be made available for learners to have the opportunity to plan together and share ideas. There is a further need for additional seminars to be held exploring these concepts in greater detail. A possible answer to the need for more practice could be ongoing work groups.  Included in this lesson design are a summary of the research supporting integration of faith and learning, the PowerPoint[R] slides used to teach each portion of the seminar, notes pages to aid the learner in the taking of notes, and sample lesson plans written within this method.",

        "description":"The purpose of this mixed methods study was to identify what practical applications of shared leadership have been applied and which initiatives will further the building of trust and vision in a small town school district in an eastern region of a western state. A quantitative assessment survey was conducted in the fall of 2004 by the school district. A modified survey instrument was administered by the district in April, 2007. The former superintendent was interviewed at length during winter 2007-2008. A longitudinal analysis of both surveys, plus the interview data, provides a database for the administration as well as other school districts to vision and plan for the present and future development of shared leadership dynamics. The qualitative case study also provides insights for all stakeholders to learn how to participate in their school and community in overcoming embedded challenges to a leadership style change. The structure of shared leadership can be fragile in the early stages of development unless all leadership groups are supportive and engaged. The study seeks to provide an inside look into critical processes which must be in place and operating to achieve maximum effectiveness. Disengagement by any of the stakeholders may ultimately result in mediocrity or complete failure. Superintendent Interview Questions are appended.",

There is a disconnect between the \"core\" books that drive curriculum and what really interests students. I am invested in the process of altering the \"traditional\" English curriculum at a suburban high school north of San Francisco by implementing a multicultural/ethnic literature course. My research examines student engagement in English classes when multicultural/ethnic texts are included, and whether or not an elective class with such texts would be of interest to students. Several theorists and researchers support multicultural education such as Sonia Nieto, Joan Rasool, Cheryl Curtis, James Banks, and Christine Sleeter to name a few. I am looking to adapt a multicultural approach in the formation of an English elective course.

This is one example of second-generation segregation. Low socio-economic status (SES) is highly correlated with minority populations, and therefore hypothesized to play a strong role in the relationship to out of school suspension. Data from all 389 public school districts in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts were analyzed for percentage minority enrollment, percentage low-income (SES) enrollment and out of school suspension rate. Minority and low-income enrollments were hypothesized to affect suspension rates. At the multivariate level, low-income enrollment status was found to play a more influential role than minority enrollment when it comes to out of school suspension rates. As SES is correlated to race, the implications of this analysis call for actions to reduce second-generation segregation in terms of disciplinary actions. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"REL Southwest received a request to review the report &quot;Avoidable Losses: High Stakes Accountability and the Dropout Crisis&quot; to assess the soundness of the study methodology and the appropriateness of the conclusions drawn in the report. The review found that conclusions drawn in this study cannot be generalized and are significantly overstated: (1) the study was conducted in one school district in one city in the state of Texas where the in-depth ethnography that makes up a large portion of the study was conducted in a single high school in that district; (2) Generalizing from a single district to all 1,090 school districts in Texas is invalid; and (3) study authors assume that because Texas's accountability system was a model for the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 their conclusions have &quot;great significance for national education policy&quot;; this review concludes that such broad generalization is unwarranted. Causal claims by study authors do not meet the standards for scientific rigor, even in the single district in which the study was conducted: (1) many of the data in this study were collected through ethnographic methods, essentially unstructured surveys designed to help discover causal hypotheses that could be scientifically tested in later experimental studies; (2) no matter in-depth the observations, a single case study should not be used to draw causal conclusions and &quot;verify&quot; that a &quot;positive answer&quot; exists to the question whether waiver policy caused minority students to drop out of school; and (3) statistical analysis does not lead to causal conclusions unless the study was designed to collect data that can be used in such a manner (as in a randomized controlled trial). That was not the case in this study. The longitudinal data analyzed can be used only to make correlational inferences, not causal ones, no matter what statistical techniques are used.

        "description":"This report presents preliminary findings from the Reading First Impact Study, a congressionally mandated evaluation of the federal government initiative to help all children read at or above grade level by the end of third grade. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) established Reading First and mandated its evaluation. This document is the first of two reports: it examines the impact of Reading First funding in 2004-05 and 2005-06 in 18 sites across 12 states. The report examines program impacts on students' reading comprehension and teachers' use of scientifically based reading instruction. Key findings are that: (1) On average, estimated impacts on student reading comprehension test scores were not statistically significant; (2) On average, Reading First increased instructional time spent on the five essential components of reading instruction promoted by the program (phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension); (3) Average impacts on reading comprehension and classroom instruction did not change systematically over time as sites gained experience with Reading First; and (4) Study sites that received their Reading First grants later in the federal funding process experienced positive and statistically significant impacts both on the time first and second grade teachers spent on the five essential components of reading instruction and on first and second grade reading comprehension, in contrast to study sites that received their Reading First grants earlier in the federal funding process, where there were no statistically significant impacts on either time spent on the five components of reading instruction or on reading comprehension scores at any grade level. The final report is due in early 2009, and will provide an additional year of follow-up data, and will examine whether the magnitude of impacts on the use of scientifically based reading instruction is associated with improvements in reading comprehension.

Parents generally want to be part of their children's academic achievement, but may not always know the most appropriate or effective way to contribute. Teachers encourage at-risk students to read consistently at home and supportive parents often ensure that their children get the proper amount of reading completed nightly. Parents may even sit with their children and listen to them read, making helpful corrections whenever needed. They may even read to their children with great expression. Parents can, however, be more effective during this reading time to help their children improve their reading skills. The purpose of this study is to show that with teacher-scripted directions to parents or caregivers, read aloud practices at home will help at-risk second graders increase their reading fluency level. Previous research has shown that with specific and effective support and guidance from home, at-risk children made significant improvement in their reading skills. (Contains 2 figures.)",

The goals of the study were to describe preservice teachers' beliefs, identify the sources of those beliefs, and determine which interventions successfully modify them. Participants included 210 undergraduates majoring in elementary education or special education. Results indicate that many preservice teachers oppose the use of calculators during mathematics instruction. Teachers report that this belief is related to their own elementary-school experiences and to their own computational abilities. Other teachers believe that calculators and computers can be used as teaching tools but caution that they should not be over used. An introductory methods course positively affected the beliefs of preservice teachers. Researcher-designed calculator interventions did not significantly affect their beliefs. Preservice teachers who have use \"Illuminations\" activities have very favorable beliefs about them and plan to use them in their classes.",

        "author":["Cunningham, Lisa"],
        "description":"Middle schoolers are developing skills for learning. Part of those skills is learning how to be an active participant in class and take control over their classroom behavior. Students who are not actively listening or participating are not internally motivated to learn the material. It was my hope that by reflecting upon their participation each quarter with a series of questions to answer about their behavior, they will be more aware of how to improve in listening, and thus comprehension skills. I analyzed the number of referrals, garbage duties, and parental conferences based upon misconduct and compared that to this years.  Unfortunately the numbers stayed about the same. I had three parent emails, four garbage duties, two detentions, and one referral to the vice-principal. This means that my system of having them reflect upon their classroom participation did not make a difference in those students who are likely to put being social priorities ahead of the learning. Middle school is a time, particularly at seventh grade, when peers become extremely important. I did however interview a female seventh grader who reported that she daydreamed less and realized more what active listening means. I interviewed another female seventh grader who is an A student who said that she loved Spanish because she gets her rewards (meaning points and thus teacher recognition) for being a model student. The result is that those students who are on task feel rewarded for being so. Those who are not on task were not changed by this activity because they place too high a value on  socialization during class time. However, this realization of the overall importance of socialization has led me to have more skits and role-plays in front of the class, their peers. If students realize they will be performing for their peers, they are more likely to place a bigger effort on creating an end-product worthy of presenting, and not spend the time otherwise wasted by fooling around. Therefore, this project has given me ideas on how to use the importance of peer relationships to better motivate middle school learners. One idea for those who do not do their homework, is to have them do it in class, separately, while those who did their homework enjoy a more interactive lesson, such as a game. Those who are off task by constant chatting to neighbors are asked to sit apart from the group, in special seating without a partner until they usually plead that they will be compliant after sitting apart for two or three days. Tactics such as this are external motivation for students who are off-task because they are internally motivated by peer relationships, not the learning of the material or the external reward of an A.

Psychobiography can be applied as a method of teaching personality theory and it can also be used as a research method. Most political personas are crafted through 20 second sound bites from the radio, Internet, and television. However, a much more comprehensive and enriched perspective can be developed when exploring developmental backgrounds of influential figures. In particular, studying psychological features sheds light on the person's personality, motivations, and relationship styles. The Big 5 Personality Model was applied along with the Myers-Briggs Profile. The applications of these models highlight important personality characteristics that contribute to their achievements and failings.  For example, both Clinton and Rice were rated high in the area of conscientiousness but differed in agreeableness and emotional expression. The authors recommend using psychobiography as an innovative method of teaching personality theory and as a method of understanding the lives of influential people.",

        "author":["Anderson, Sharon E."],
        "description":"This report examines the timing of teaching careers of 1992-93 college graduates at three points during the 10 years after graduation. It answers questions about the characteristics of graduates who enter and leave teaching, focusing specifically on their demographic characteristics, academic preparation, teacher working conditions, and compensation. The report uses data from a longitudinal study of students who earned a bachelor's degree in any field during the 1992-93 academic year. Base-year information on this cohort was collected as part of the 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. Graduates were interviewed again in 1994, 1997, and 2003. All comparisons made in the text were tested using Student's statistics. All differences cited were statistically significant at the .05 level. No statistical adjustments to account for multiple comparisons were used. The demographic characteristics of college graduates are found to be related to their career choices. A graduate's gender, age, marital status, and number of dependents may be associated with his or her decisions about the relative benefits of teaching versus working in other possible occupations. The analysis shows that among graduates who taught, a higher proportion of females than males taught consistently. White graduates taught consistently at higher rates than Black graduates. Older graduates taught consistently relatively more often than younger graduates. Marriage and family formation also were related to graduates' career choices: in particular, married graduates and those with dependents tended to teach with greater consistency than did graduates who never married. The &quot;highly qualified teacher&quot; provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) codified almost a decade of increased attention to the academic preparation of teacher: several indicators related to the academic qualifications of prospective teachers are examined and related to the career choices made by 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients. Graduates who had lower grade point averages (GPAs) taught consistently less often than those with GPAs in higher categories. Having a low GPA was also associated with being a late starter in the teaching profession. Teachers' perceptions of their working environment may also influence their decisions to remain teaching in the same school, change schools, or leave the profession altogether. Because the salaries of public school teachers are most often based on salary schedules that take into account years of experience and degree attainment, teacher career choices may be related to their earnings. Among graduates who taught, those who were in the lowest category of academic year base salary for their most recent teaching job taught consistently at lower rates than those in the middle or highest categories, and they left the profession early at higher rates than teachers in the middle or highest base salary categories.

        "description":"A National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy (NCRP) report addresses the questions \"What have conservative foundations done with their grant dollars to promote concepts of privatizing public education through \"school choice,\" primarily linked to school vouchers? What were their strategies in providing resources to an array of conservative education think tanks, public policy advocates, and organizers?\" Funding in support of school choice makes up only a fraction of the annual grant-making by U.S. foundations, \"but it taps a sentiment in philanthropy and in the public that private sector alternatives, with the bottom line motivation of the for-profit sector, somehow are automatically and authentically more efficient and effective than the public sector, statistical data to the contrary notwithstanding.\" The movement's persistence is of a kind seldom attributed to organized philanthropy. Rick Cohen's report, \"Strategic Grantmaking: Foundations and the School Privatization Movement\" serves as \"a case study for other foundation and nonprofit leaders who are interested in effective, strategic movement-building grantmaking.\" This document is a transcript of a panel discussion between Cohen, Leigh Dingerson, Leslie Lenkowsky, and Ben Wildavsky. William Schambra served as moderator. The transcript was prepared from an audio recording. (Contains 3 footnotes and 7 tables.)

        "description":"Background: In June 2002, the State of Connecticut General Assembly (CGA) passed Public Act 02-119, An Act Concerning Bullying Behavior in Schools and Concerning the Pledge of Allegiance. Section 1 mandated that each local and regional board of education (school district) develop a policy to address bullying in its schools. Conn. Gen. Statute Section 10-222d was amended in 2006. Connecticut's school districts have responded by developing bullying policies. School administrators (e.g., principals and assistant principals) are expected to implement these policies at the building level. Although it has been over four years since the passage of Public Act 02-119, a state-level analysis of school district bullying policies has not taken place. Little is known about the ways in which schools implement their policies (e.g., make provisions for anonymous reporting, investigate acts of bullying, intervene). Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore and describe public school principals' reports of: (a) their experiences with implementing the state's anti-bullying law (Conn. Gen. Statute Section 10-222d), (b) related aspects of their school climate, (c) the anti-bullying curricula and programs in use in their schools, and (d) school personnel's need for related training and technical assistance. Setting: Connecticut, 2007. Study Sample: 192 public school principals. Research Design: Descriptive; Statistical Survey. Data Collection and Analysis: Researcher developed questionnaire, &quot;Bullying and School Climate Survey&quot;; descriptive statistics. Findings: Slightly more than half of respondents indicated that their districts had put into place all of the various policy elements as prescribed in the law, with nearly all of the respondents reporting that several elements were in place. Notably, there was unevenness related to participants' reports of full implementation of all of the provisions. In other words, no single element was reported by all participants (i.e., 100%) as being included in their district policies. Conclusion: The policy implementation phase is a critically important time for reflection, analysis, and decision-making about issues that ultimately affect the policy's effectiveness. Citation: D. J., Nestler-Rusack, D., &amp; Freiberg, J. (2007, October). Public school principals' experiences with interpreting and implementing Connecticut's anti-bullying law (CGS Section 10-222d): A statewide survey.

        "description":"In overcrowded urban high schools, students are dealing with many issues in and out of school. Issues at home paired with math curriculum that does not seem relevant to their lives, leads to a lack of engagement in the classroom. This research poses the question: How can project-based algebra engage low-socioeconomic status high school students? Will teaching through projects promote engagement for this population of students? The curriculum in many high schools throughout the US is designed to promote success on standardized tests. Many students who score basic or below basic on these tests, may find in part the skills and concepts they are learning in algebra irrelevant to their lives. Project-based learning is a curriculum approach that is derived from constructivist theory. Constructivism can be traced to the theories of Dewey and later Piaget. This theory states that instruction must be based on experiences, where students build upon their previous knowledge to construct new knowledge with guidance from the teacher. The literature shows that students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and minorities have increased engagement when using a curriculum that includes project-based mathematics. Examining comparative studies on instruction comparable to project-based learning versus traditional instruction, the literature suggests that students are more motivated, engaged and have an increased understanding of mathematics.",

Analytical approach (Whole Language), as defined in the curriculum, was abandoned and phoneme based approach (Phonics) was introduced. This research has a two year longitudinal perspective and aims to collect the opinions of teachers about the phoneme and analytical approaches and to compare the performance of students who were taught to read using the analytical and phoneme based approaches in terms of fluency, accuracy, reading errors and reading comprehension. This report summarizes the overall results of the study. In both years, the majority of teachers had very positive opinions about the phoneme based approach. Results of the reading test in the first year demonstrate that the use of phoneme based approach causes slower, but better understanding. Results of the reading test, in the second year, showed that students achieved similar performances in all parameters tested. The findings indicate that the method of reading instruction is more critical in the early stages. (Contains 2 figures and 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Elementary school science is an often-neglected subject in the current literacy-focused political atmosphere. However, reading informational trade books about science in literacy class can help children increase their science knowledge. Incorporating humor through content-related cartoons is an effective way to engage students in deeper understanding of content and creative play with language. A master's degree student enrolled in a graduate course in instructional design acted as a consultant to a faculty member teaching a course in literacy methods for preservice elementary teachers and engaged undergraduates in creating humorous cartoons to teach science content. The preservice teachers read science trade books designed for an elementary school audience and listed science content ideas and terms about a given topic (earthquakes, volcanoes, fossils, crystals, glacier, or caves). They noted confusing topic-related terms that were homophones, words with multiple meanings, or words that sounded very similar to other common words, thus identifying possible wordings for puns. Next, they analyzed given cartoons for science content and humor, making suggestions for their improvement. They completed partially-finished cartoons to convey science information in a funny way. Finally, they created original cartoons of their own using their choice of scenario. A survey was administered to the preservice elementary teachers partway through the cartoon creation process to determine ways to help them. Students reported that they learned much science information from the trade books, and discovered how difficult it was to produce humor. They noted the motivating aspects of using humor in science and working within a group of peers. They found it difficult to generate creative ideas for cartoons and suggested that they be given more example cartoons and more opportunities for group brainstorming. Color cartoon scenarios made with clip art, along with idea-prompting questions,ere provided and these increased productivity of humorous cartoons related to science content. Forty-eight color cartoons with accompanying science explanations created by the authors and preservice teachers are included as an appendix. These address the science topics of earthquakes, volcanoes, fossils, crystals, glaciers, or caves. We recommend that cartoons be used as part of science teaching because of their motivating and creative aspects. (Contains 8 tables.)",

        "description":"Technology and invention are an integral part of the elementary school science curriculum, addressed by national standards. Student drawings of scientists have been studied extensively, but little is known of student mental conceptions and drawings of inventors. To uncover student's images of inventors, ninety preservice elementary teachers at a mid-sized college in central New York State drew images of both inventors and scientists, which were analyzed and compared. Both sets of drawings portrayed white, mostly male figures. Scientists were shown wearing lab coats and working with fuming chemicals in a lab, while inventors more often wore casual clothing and were shown working with inventions and tools. Two-thirds of the images showed figures of different sex than the sketchers, indicating that the elementary preservice teachers did not readily identify with either inventors or scientists. We suggest that future studies explore effective ways to increase preservice elementary teachers' understanding of and identification with the work of inventors. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the perceptions of technology integration by 90 entry level students in a teacher education program. During their field experience placement, candidates observed teachers' integration of technology in the classroom. During the final week of observation, the candidates completed a modified version of BETA 04-05 Teacher Survey (Biennial Educational Technology Assessment). The BETA Teacher Survey is a self-report online instrument developed by eTech Ohio (2004) to assess how technology supports classroom curricular needs. Demographic information was reported and the second part of the survey identified strategies for technology integration. Candidates ranked the frequency of technology use by K-12 teachers and students in the classrooms. A university statistician unfamiliar with the candidates or the course analyzed the data statistically using the SPSS software program.  Results indicate that teaching experience had a significant effect on use of technology for data manipulation/organization because teachers with less experience were more apt to use technology for data management.  This study illustrates that if teachers possess the requisite technology skills they are more likely to integrate educational technologies in their instructional repertoires which can enhance the learning of all students. It also sheds light on the impact of technological advancements in a variety of academic environments and areas as well as how changes in practice are occurring (or not occurring) in these settings.  It is imperative that teacher education ensure that preservice candidates are indeed provided the opportunity to explore and develop effective uses of technology in K-12 classrooms.  Additionally, teacher education must promote technology use in authentic contexts through curriculum-based, technology-enhanced field experiences.",

This study compares three authentic approaches to teaching a science unit on bird adaptations for habitat that integrate thinking skills and technology skills: a problem-based learning approach utilizing the Cognitive Research Test (CoRT) Breadth thinking skills (de Bono, 2000); a thematic approach integrating several subject areas using &quot;Talents Unlimited&quot; thinking skills (Schlichter &amp; Palmer, 1993); and a process skill-focused approach using object boxes (Rule, Barrera, &amp; Stewart, 2004). Three third grade classes of students (N=60) of mixed ability and Spanish/English proficiency from a western rural community participated in this pretest- intervention-posttest study. Post-test scores showed all classes gained in knowledge of bird facts and adaptations, descriptive vocabulary, curiosity, technology self-efficacy, and knowledge of computer applications. Problem-based learning students showed the most curiosity (measured by questions generated for a topic-related image); thematic unit students excelled in computer application knowledge; while object box students showed largest gains in science knowledge, vocabulary, and computer self-efficacy. Integration of thinking skills allowed teachers to structure and scaffold learning in all three approaches. All three authentic approaches exhibited strengths along with challenges and are recommended. (Contains 12 tables.)",

The appropriate selection of instructional media to support distance learning is not intuitive and does not occur as a matter of personal preference. On the contrary, instructional media selection is a systematic sequence of qualitative processes based on sound instructional design principles and is an integral component of the Instructional Systems Design process. In that role, media selection ensures that a specific distributed instructional medium can support the attainment of the desired learning objectives. Although media selection is often mentioned when studying the discipline of instructional technology or Instructional Systems Design (ISD), it is sometimes overlooked when applying the selection process in a distance learning environment.

However, Internet and computer policies restrict and limit how the Internet and computer can be used in a school. An Internet and computer policy typically limits students to use the Internet and computer for educational purposes. If a student violates this policy he/she will receive some type of disciplinary action. Courts have consistently ruled in favor of school districts policies that limit student use. However, there is inconsistency in courts with regard to punishment of students for improper use of the Internet at home. This article will examine and analyze various court cases related to student Internet use. When examining the authorities of schools to punish students for Internet actions, the courts have focused mainly on three monumental case decisions. These cases are Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser (1986), and Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier (1988).",

Homework completion rates of the students that participated in Site A were reviewed in their five core subjects, while the homework completion rates of the students at Site B were only reviewed in their math classes. Site A had 45 students participate in the study. Site B had two students in the study, both from the same math teacher. Results indicate, at both sites, that a guided study hall helped reduce the rate of homework completion. Overall, the rate before the study was 8% of homework was not being completed. By the completion of the study hall, 4% of homework was incomplete. Results show that with the guidance of a teacher and the presence of a study hall, students are more inclined to get their homework completed and may therefore increase the students' understanding. Educators should consider study halls to be a beneficial time for students who frequently do not complete their homework, and even more beneficial if the teacher assists the students with their homework.

        "description":"The purpose of this action research project report was to reduce bullying in middle school students through the use of student-leaders. Twenty-eight 8th graders, two counselors, and 24 teachers participated for a total of 54 participants. The study was conducted between September 11, 2007, and December 20, 2007. This project focused on four types of bullying: physical, verbal, social, and electronic. The three tools that the teacher-researcher used to document evidence of the problem were a counselor survey, a teacher survey, and a student survey. The data gathered on the student survey allowed the students to identify ways in which they had viewed and/or experienced the roles of victim, bully, and bystander. Seventy-one percent of the student-leaders reported being victims of verbal bullying at least once last spring. Twenty-six percent of students reported observing social and verbal bullying a minimum of every week. The data gathered from the teacher and counselor surveys allowed the teachers and counselors to identify ways they had viewed bullying or when it had been brought to their attention. The teacher survey showed that 67% (n=16) of teachers believed that bullying was an average problem last spring (2007). Both counselors believed that bullying was at least an average problem last spring. Student-leaders were enlisted and trained to go into classrooms to share information about bullying. The teacher-researcher included in this program: direct instruction on bullying prevention, team-building activities, and group discussions. These interventions were intended to reduce the amount of bullying school-wide. The students were also taught leadership and pro-social skills that prepared them to go into classes to share what they had learned and pass along the skills necessary to reduce bullying. The post survey results showed some positive changes. Overall, more teachers considered bullying either not a problem or a small problem in the past month as compared to last spring, where 67% (n=16) saw it as an average problem. Students widened their definition of bullying throughout the intervention, and the amount of social and verbal bullying they participated in decreased. There was an 11% increase in student-leaders helping the victim if they were bullied. According to the counselor post survey, based on the students they worked with, bullying improved slightly. The teacher-researcher believes that this intervention needed more time than one semester to make more of an impact.

The survey was posted on Survey Monkey between April 1 and June 30, 2007, to represent the perceptions of LGBT educators' experiences during the 2006-2007 school year.  The researchers used multiple approaches to build a data set using snowball sampling that would represent all geographic areas, races, cultures, genders and different types of K-12 settings. The 514 survey participants represented teachers in all disciplines and instructional levels, counselors and librarians in all fifty states and Washington, D.C.  Students are more likely to excel to their full potential if their teachers feel safe and fully supported in their workplace environments. Evidence suggests that teachers who feel safe have a higher level of professional efficacy, which in turn contributes to increased student achievement. The study of LGBT educators demonstrates summarized here unequivocably demonstrates that the LGBT educator participants do not feel safe and fully supported in their workplace. Instead, the climate, the overall atmosphere, in which they work is perceived with fear and distrust, and as troubling, unsafe and unsupportive. Our findings also suggest that there are schools in which a minority of LGBT educators perceive some dimension(s) of a professionally responsible school climate. Participants in those schools feel comfortable, safe, and supported.  The responses from these participants hold promise for the future. (Contains 2 footnotes.)",

        "description":"Background: For ten years, the National Science Education Standards (National Research Council, 1996) have served as the foundation for Connecticut's teacher certification in science and the expectations of teacher practice secondary science classrooms. Furthermore, beginning science teachers must demonstrate the ability to teach in an inquiry-based manner as part of their beginning teacher science portfolio. This ability is assessed through the science teaching portfolio that is part of the Beginning Educator Support and Training (BEST) program for all beginning science teachers; it requires candidates to demonstrate the ability to plan a two-week unit, teach the unit, and assess student learning. Despite Connecticut's history of assessing beginning secondary science teachers ability to teach in an inquiry based fashion, little was known about whether teachers who had been certified through the state's portfolio assessment process as capable of teaching continued to practice this model of instruction once they have been deemed qualified to do so. Purpose: The purpose of this investigation was to describe the extent to which secondary science teachers in Connecticut, who were certified through Connecticut's BEST portfolio assessment process between 1997 and 2004 and had taught secondary science during the past academic year: (a) reported practicing the indicators of inquiry-based instruction in the classroom and (b) the factors that they perceived facilitated, obstructed, or informed that practice. The indicators are based upon the &quot;5E&quot; model of inquiry (CSDE, 2001a) described by Lawson (1995) and adopted from Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (1992) 5E model (Trowbridge &amp; Bybee, 1990). Data Collection and Analysis: Researcher developed questionnaire, &quot;Inquiry-based Instruction in Secondary Science Classrooms: A Survey&quot;; descriptive statistics. Findings: Nearly all of the respondents reported practicing 5Es of inquiry-based instruction in their secondary science classrooms. Further, a majority of respondents indicated that they had access to the factors that they considered extremely important to the practice of inquiry-based instruction. Conclusion: The differences between the practice and teaching environment of Connecticut teachers and those in other states may be related to at least three conditions. First, secondary science teachers in Connecticut are required to demonstrate an understanding of, and the ability to implement, inquiry-based instruction; the statewide assessment of student learning includes a component that evaluates competency in some inquiry skills, and survey respondents ranked classroom experience as the primary factor in informing their understanding of inquiry-based instruction.",

        "author":["Schmidt, Tom"],
        "description":"Since the passage of Lyndon Johnson's 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act, standards-based testing has become a government initiative and part of a massive educational reform throughout the country. By January 8 2002, President Bush signed &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; into law as the latest iteration of Johnson's early educational reform. Under &quot;NCLB&quot; legislation, school districts in all states must implement a standards-based test accountability program that ensures the adequate yearly progress (AYP) of all schools in every district. The two fundamental aims of &quot;NCLB&quot; require that a) all states, school districts, and schools work towards closing the achievement gaps that exist primarily between high and low performing, minority and non-minority students; and b) holding states, school districts, and schools accountable by imposing penalties and government sanctions if AYP is not attained and the achievement gap persists. Currently in its fifth year, &quot;NCLB&quot; has generated much discussion, both positive and negative, as evidenced by the research literature. In this thesis I will analyze the impact of &quot;NCLB&quot;'s subgroup provision--requirement for the separation of disadvantaged student test scores in the accountability systems--contrasting its intended purpose of closing achievement gaps and holding schools accountable with what it has actually created in practice. First I will provide a brief history of the origins of the educational accountability movement that &quot;NCLB&quot; exemplifies. Second, I will address the chief educational problem of the &quot;NCLB&quot; policy. Instead of helping schools in greatest need--low-income schools with a high population of variously disadvantaged students classified as subgroup students--&quot;NCLB&quot; places these schools at a greater disadvantage for closing the achievement gaps and further diminishes the quality of education they offer. Lastly, I will discuss possible solutions to these problems and the larger issue of reforming &quot;NCLB&quot; based on the realities that have been presented since it implementation in 2002.",

        "description":"Today's elementary classrooms are becoming more diverse, requiring teachers to provide effective instruction to children with a wide range of academic performance, ability, background, and interest. This work focuses on the development of a menu of differentiated instructional activities for teaching literacy to upper elementary students. The author, a former elementary teacher, worked with a faculty member and her literacy methods class of undergraduate preservice elementary teachers to develop this teaching unit based on a popular, award-winning children's novel (DiCamillo, 2000). The menu of various activities organized in ten different intelligence areas (logical-mathematical, linguistic, bodily-kinesthetic, spatial, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalist, moral, and spiritual) and arranged at different levels of Bloom's taxonomy (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation) allows a teacher to easily select assignments designed to deepen comprehension or appreciation of this literary work to meet the individual needs of students. Each activity is accompanied by an example correct response so that teachers may gauge its demands. The reactions of preservice teachers to this project from beginning to end were examined. Before participation in the project, preservice teachers emphasized fame and recognition as being motivators and effects of publication. After participation in the project, they focused on the effects of the work on their employment opportunities, emphasizing a sense of accomplishment and downplaying fame/recognition. Appended are: (1) Menu of Ideas for Gardner's Ten Intelligence Areas at Different Levels of Bloom's Taxonomy; and (2) Acts of Kindness Writings by Preservice Teachers. (Contains 5 tables.)",

        "author":["Offenberg, Robert M."],
        "description":"This paper presents a family of three hierarchical analyses of trends in the distribution of experienced teachers among schools. The analyses were used to assess whether implementation of key provisions of the 2004 contract between the Philadelphia School District and the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers (PFT) led to a more equitable teacher-experience distribution. HLM was applied to three years of pre-contract school data to create an Elementary/K-8, a Middle School and a High School function describing the relationship between characteristics of the students attending schools and the experience of the teachers in their faculties. The pre-contract equations were then applied to appropriate school data, yielding an estimate of what the experience of each school would have been post-contract if the contract had had no effect. Residuals, the differences between the HLM-based predictions and the actual experience of each schools faculty, were computed and then subjected to additional analyses. The results showed that the teachers' contract provisions were associated with an increase in school faculty experience in the school district. However the increase occurred mainly at more middle class schools, and not in the ones that were subject to contract provisions designed to attract experienced teachers.

This is a combination of his auto-biography, which provides the context, and the lessons he learned in his 50 years as linguist, and language teacher. Brown's experiences indicate that adults can and do learn language with similar efficiency as children, as well as the seemingly non-intuitive idea that language itself should not even be taught, if one is to achieve maximum fluency. The paper covers ideas on what is language in our brain, assessment methodology, why &quot;reality&quot; is often backwards from our perceptions of it, as well as why adult style learning can actually harm or interfere with the ability of a person to really make breakthroughs in their field, (or acquire a new language). This book also tells the story of the Thai Studies Program at the AUA Language Center in Bangkok Thailand, as well as the beginning of the ALG, the methodology developed by Dr. Brown.",

        "description":"Reviewing the Comparator Hypothesis is an article review that explores the historical concepts in research that led to exploring performance as a distinctive process of learning. British empiricist philosophers were interested in thoughts not behavior which led traditional learning theorist's main focus on acquisition processes. However, the performance model of learning assumes episodic and latent memory. The comparator hypothesis makes three major assumptions in attempting to solve problems in Rescorla's (1968) contingency theory. Failure of acquisition and/or retention can be explained by the comparator hypothesis as an insufficiency in performance in comparator processes that occur within an experiment. The comparator hypothesis indicated three specific assumptions unaccounted for in Rescorla's contingency theory then researchers attempted to resolve the missing elements. As a result, differences between learning and behaviors have been defined over time by researchers indicating a distinctive process of performance. Basically, this is the divergence between learning theorist and behaviorists.",

A few books in Russian/Kyrgyz on Political Culture, for example, cannot give diversity of theories for analytical discussions and critical choice.

A national sample of approximately 10,100 AI/AN students at grades 4 and 8 participated in the 2007 reading assessment and 10,300 in the mathematics assessment. Results from this study are compared to those from the first NIES conducted in 2005. The results for 11 states with relatively large populations of AI/AN students are presented in addition to the national results. In both reading and mathematics, overall scores for AI/AN fourth and eighth-graders showed no significant change since 2005 and were lower than the scores for non-AI/AN students in 2007. In 2007 at both grades, AI/AN students attending schools in which less than 25 percent of the students were AI/AN scored higher than their peers attending schools with higher concentrations of AI/AN students, and those attending public schools scored higher than their peers in Bureau of Indian Education schools. Although overall average scores for AI/AN students were lower than the scores for non-AI/AN students at both grades in 2007, they were not consistently lower than the scores for all racial/ethnic groups. Average scores in both grades for AI/AN students were lower than the scores for White and Asian/Pacific Islander students. Scores for higher-performing AI/AN students were higher than those of their Black peers in both grades. In reading, AI/AN fourth-graders attending city schools scored higher than their Hispanic peers, and AI/AN eighth-graders attending rural schools scored lower than their Hispanic peers. In mathematics, average scores for AI/AN students in both grades were not significantly different from their Hispanic peers. (Contains 39 figures and 30 tables.)

Researchers currently have a variety of options when choosing statistical software packages that can perform ordinal logistic regression analyses. However, statistical software, such as Stata, SAS, and SPSS, may use different techniques to estimate the parameters. The purpose of this article is to: (1) illustrate the use of Stata, SAS and SPSS to fit proportional odds models using educational data; and (2) compare the features and results for fitting the proportional odds model using Stata OLOGIT, SAS PROC LOGISTIC (ascending and descending), and SPSS PLUM. The assumption of the proportional odds was tested, and the results of the fitted models were interpreted. The data of a survey instrument Teachers' Perceptions of Grading Practices (Liu, 2004; Liu, O'Connell & McCoach, 2006) is used to demonstrate the PO analysis. This demonstration clarifies some of the issues that researchers must consider in using different statistical packages for analysis of ordinal data. (Contains 3 tables and 8 figures.)",

        "description":"Selective mutism is defined as &quot;the consistent failure to speak in specific social situations despite the ability to speak in other settings&quot; (American Psychiatric Association, 1994 as cited in Zelenko &amp; Shaw, 2000). For many years, selective mutism was considered to be a very rare disorder amongst individuals, and little attention was given to this particular disorder. Research has recently revealed that selective mutism is more common than once believed, and for this reason, K-12 teachers need to know how to identify and assist students who suffer from it. According to the &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,&quot; seven in 1,000 children are diagnosed with selective mutism, making it more common than once believed (Cole, 2006; Frankel, 2007). In this particular study, the researcher conducted sixteen in-depth interviews, including three parents of students with selective mutism, ten teachers who work with selectively mute students, and three psychologists who work in some capacity with the disorder. In each interview, the researcher asked questions with the intention of learning ways that teachers and parents can help children who suffer from this condition. Collectively, the interviews revealed methods that might help teachers and parents assist children with selective mutism, including strategies that teachers can utilize to provide an optimal learning environment for these students, strategies that parents can implement that will benefit their child at home, and treatment plans available for individuals with selective mutism.

        "description":"Every state offers community colleges as the first rung on the ladder of higher education. They prepare students for four-year colleges, educate key professions, offer job training and basic skills, and bolster economic development. However, this education policy brief finds that the 50 states differ widely in the extent to which they use their community college systems. The report ranks the states on five different ways of measuring the use and growth of the community college option that they offer their citizens in terms of: (1) community colleges' share of all higher education enrollments in a state; (2) the share of a state's total population ages 18 and over that's enrolled full- or part-time in a community college; (3) the share of a state's total population aged 18 and over that's represented by full-time equivalent registration in community colleges; (4) the five-year growth rate in community college enrollment; and (5) the amount by which growth in community college enrollments is outpacing (or lagging) the growth in public four-year college enrollments. The report then examines the role of tuition and the condition of the state's economy and population trends as factors impacting enrollment, followed by a discussion of the challenge ahead for community college leaders, policymakers and researchers.

        "description":"In the future, businesses will demand workers with higher-level skills and more education. Community colleges are key providers of career and technical training as well as traditional academic education. These colleges can also play important roles in the one-stop system created by the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), through which a variety of federally funded employment and training programs provide services. Given the importance of community colleges to workforce development, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to examine (1) how community colleges meet the workforce training needs of their communities; (2) what community colleges do to integrate with the nation's one-stop system; (3) the conditions or practices that enhance or impede these efforts; and (4) the actions the Departments of Labor and Education have taken to encourage linkages between community colleges and the workforce investment system, including one-stops. To address these objectives, GAO visited 20 community colleges, surveyed one-stop centers and their associated workforce investment boards, and talked to Labor and Education officials. The community colleges that GAO visited developed various approaches and programs for career and technical training to meet the needs of industry sectors, individual employers, and certain types of students and workers. Through a variety of outreach, relationship building, and data collection efforts, community colleges have come to understand the specific training needs of key industries in their regions and use this information to keep programs current or develop new programs to address these needs. Community college activities include providing contract or customized training to the employees of specific employers; working with small businesses; and targeting training and education programs to specific populations, such as disadvantaged adults, high-school students transitioning to college, and one-stop clients. Nationwide, GAO estimated that about 11 percent of one-stops are operated solely or jointly by a community college, while 34 percent have community college staff colocated at the center. Similarly, GAO estimated that, nationwide, 49 percent of local workforce investment boards have community college presidents represented on their boards. Some of the benefits of these arrangements include cost sharing and improved communication among participating programs. Officials at the colleges and one-stops that GAO visited reported also conducting other joint activities, such as strategic planning and data sharing. Community college and workforce officials cited state funding and leadership as factors that help integration between community colleges and the workforce system but identified WIA performance system measures and WIA funding issues as impediments. Under WIA, states and local workforce areas must meet performance levels in their Adult, Dislocated Worker, and Youth programs that can be difficult to obtain when serving some populations, such as those on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or youth, causing disincentives for the one-stops to serve them. In a 2004 report, GAO recommended that the Labor Department develop a systematic way to account for differences in the population groups served by states' one-stop centers and apply it to all states when establishing their performance levels. To date, Labor has not taken action on this recommendation; however, Labor officials stated that states may use their own adjustment models and that the department has worked to ensure consistency in the process. It is uncertain whether Labor and Education's efforts to build linkages between community colleges and the workforce system will be successful in encouraging community colleges to focus on workforce development. Labor's WIRED, High Growth, and Community Based grants aim, in part, to help community colleges and other workforce entities collaborate. As discussed in GAO's recent report on these grants,Labor's evaluations do not fully measure their effectiveness, and GAO recommends that Labor take steps to do so. Labor and Education jointly funded a $1.5 million initiative in 2006 to help build linkages between community colleges and the workforce system. The agencies did not conduct an evaluation, but plan to issue a report in 2008 about the participants' challenges and successes. Four appendixes include: (1) Objectives, Scope and Methodology; (2) Community Colleges Selected for Site Visits; (3) Comments from the Department of Labor; and (4) GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments.

        "description":"Childhood is the crucial period for early children's reading ability building. Former research (Hanson & Farrell, 1995) found that early reading experience had a positive and long-term effect on reading competence for high school seniors in the future. Therefore, it is of great importance for researchers to understand children's initial reading abilities, their growth trajectories over time, and furthermore, the effects of child and family characteristics on the growth trajectories. The purpose of the study was to illustrate the use of the multilevel modeling approach to assess the early children's reading growth from their entering the kindergarten through the first year in elementary school. The research questions mainly focused on: (1) how child's reading ability grew over time, (2) how the growth varied across children, and (3) how some child-level variables affected the initial status, and the rate of change of reading ability over time. The data was collected from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). SAS PROC MIXED procedure was used for analyzing multilevel growth models. The fixed effects and variance components of the fitted models were interpreted. The prototypical growth trajectories of reading ability were plotted. The results indicated that children's reading ability improved considerably during the first two years of schooling. However, there was great variability in individual change over time. An additional finding was that the relationship between the initial status and rate of change in reading ability was positive and small. This study also found two child-level variables, how often parents read to children, and whether children receive pre-kindergarten daycare were significant predictors of the growth trajectories, either initial status or rate of change. Although tentative, our findings do suggest efforts for improving early-reading skills. (Contains 3 figures and 4 tables.)",

One such program is the U.S. Department of Education's grant program entitled: \"Integration of Schools and Mental Health Systems.\" Established in 2005, the program has funded 51 projects and is in the process of funding its fourth cohort. Since the program's inception, our Center has taken steps to inform the field about this initiative and to advance the work. Now that the first projects have completed their period of funding, it is time to reflect on their contribution to advancing the field. To this end, this is the initial report in a series the Center will be preparing. The first reports will summarize what has been accomplished and learned to date; these will be followed by analyses of commonalities, unique facets, barriers to progress, and lessons learned; the final report in the series will explore implications for future policy and practice. This first report focuses on summarizing the work of the eight state level projects funded as part of the first three cohorts. Appended are: (1) Center for Mental Health in Schools at UCLA Meeting with Nine Teams from the First Cohort; (2) Washington County (OR) Partnership for Student Success; and (3) Berkeley CA Integrated Resources Initiative.

Being a current vogue in communicative language teaching, task-based language learning contains dangers if implemented without care. In particular, it is likely to create pressure for immediate communication rather than interlanguage change and growth. In this process, it may persuade learners to use lexical modes of communication excessively and prematurely, and to fossilize some way short of native-like second language competence. This paper takes a processing-pedagogic viewpoint to review what task-based instruction is, to identify its goals, and to warn EFL/ESL teachers about the potential pitfalls of task-based language teaching.

        "description":"Violent incidents occur frequently in schools and suicide ranks second to accidents as the leading cause of death among adolescents. The purpose of this presentation is to summarize the findings of six studies that used a stimulus-drawing task for access to fantasies, thoughts, and feelings. The studies were based on the theory that the task can serve as a first step in identifying children and adolescents at risk. The studies also examined gender and cultural differences or similarities, and were conducted in schools or in facilities for delinquent adolescents in the U.S.A, Russia, and Thailand. The task presents line drawings of people, animals, places and things, asks respondents to choose two, imagine something happen between them, draw what they imagine, and add titles or stories. Responses are scored on rating scales that range from strongly negative, such as suicidal or homicidal themes to strongly positive, such as loving relationship. In the first study, the task was presented to 290 children, adolescents and adults; 50 were clinically depressed; the others were normal or had different disabilities. Results indicated that significantly more depressed subjects scored 1 point than any other group. Inter-scorer and retest studies found the scale reliable. The second study asked if self-images in the responses of 64 delinquent adolescents could be identified without talking to those who drew them. The third study examined responses by 64 delinquent and 74 non-delinquent adolescents for attitudes toward self and other, finding no significant differences in gender or delinquency, but significant differences in assaultive and solitary content as well as differences in  gender and delinquency. The fourth study used two scales in comparing responses by 30 students who had histories of aggressive behavior with 181 non-aggressive students. One scale assessed responses for emotional content; the other, assessed self-images. The study found significant differences between the groups of aggressive and non-aggressive students. Gender differences and two subgroups of aggression also emerged: reactive aggression and predatory aggression. In the fifth study, Russian investigators compared 27 delinquent and 25 non-delinquent adolescents, finding no significant cultural differences in subjects scoring 1 point on both scales but significant differences in self-image scores and between experimental and control groups. The sixth study, in Thailand, assessed effects of an art therapy program on delinquent adolescents, dividing the sample into experimental and control groups. Pre- and post-test scores of the experimental group and control group differed significantly. The studies seem to support the theory, and suggest that respondents who score 1 point on both scales, or else 1 point in emotional content combined with 5 points in self-image be promptly referred to mental health professionals for further evaluation.",

Mathematics and science teachers are of particular interest because mathematics and science are core subjects in both elementary and secondary public schools. These subjects continue to attract attention as the need for individuals entering the workforce with advanced knowledge in these areas remains high. Maintaining a sufficient supply of mathematics and science teachers depends on both entry rates into these teaching fields and attrition from these fields. This Issue Brief reports on trends in the attrition of public school mathematics and science teachers over a 16-year period and examines the reasons given by mathematics and science teachers for leaving teaching employment. With the exception of leaving for better salary and/or benefits, no measurable differences were found between mathematics and science leavers and other leavers in the percentages rating the selected reasons for leaving as very important or extremely important. The percentage of public school mathematics and science teachers who left teaching employment did not change measurably between 1988-1989 and 2004-2005. However, the percentage of other public school teachers who left teaching employment did increase over the same period. (Contains 10 endnotes and 6 tables.)",

Authorized under the &quot;Elementary and Secondary Education Act,&quot; the SLC program was designed to provide local educational agencies with funds to plan, implement, or expand SLCs in large high schools of 1,000 students or more. The SLC legislation allows local education agencies to implement the most suitable structure or combination of structures and strategies to meet their needs. This final report presents the findings from the implementation study of the Smaller Learning Communities program. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the implementation of the federal education law that authorizes funding for the federal SLC program, by describing the strategies and  practices used in implementing SLCs. The study based its findings on data from 119 grantees from among those funded in 2000 in the first cohort of grantees and surveyed in the spring of 2002 and fall 2003. The report also used data from in-depth case studies of 18 grantees that intended to use freshman or career academies to structure a smaller learning community. The report contains six chapters. The first chapter presents an overview of the SLC program, the study, and related research. Chapter 2 presents an overview of the study design, as well as a summary of the demographic characteristics of the SLC schools described in this report. The remainder of this report describes the implementation of the federal SLC initiative. Chapter 3 focuses on what schools are actually doing as well as the factors facilitating and inhibiting implementation of SLCs. Chapter 4 is devoted to a discussion of the unique implementation features of the two most widely used SLC structures, career academies and freshman academies. Because there is so much interest in how SLC schools are performing, Chapter 5 is devoted to a discussion of student outcomes as reported by schools. Finally, Chapter 6 provides a summary of the findings from the previous chapters, and implications for further SLC implementation and research as well as further analyses for the follow-up report to be completed later this year. The following are appended: (1) List of SLC Cohort 1 Grantees; (2) Annual Performance Report; (3) Periodic Implementation Surveys, 2002 and 2003; (4) Site Visit Reports; (5) SLC Schools' Demographic Characteristics, 1996-97 through 2001-02; (6) Additional Exhibits, by SLC Structure; (7) Measuring Personalization: Technical Summary; (8) Career and Freshman Academy Overviews; and (9) Modeling of Pre and Post Differences in APR Outcomes.

        "description":"This essay shows the range to complexity for assessing academic service learning experiences. Corso recommends that instructors understand expectations for cognition, affective response, and communication competence as they place students into academic service learning experiences and as they assess learning outcomes within such contexts.  Corso recommends that instructors use Bloom's Taxonomy for Cognitive Complexity to understand the range of complexity for any academic service learning experience; that instructors recognize Krathwol et al.'s Taxonomy of the Affective Domain to acknowledge a range to affective response before, during, and after an academic service learning  experience; and that instructors identify how the varied purposes for writing about, for or with an agency may affect the student's success with completing any task, especially if it might require advanced communication competence. Corso shows why instructors struggle with assessing growth of learners in academic service learning experiences, especially if they had not considered the complexity of interpersonal dynamics or intercultural communication for students who may not have studied such skills. What the student knows prior to the experience, how the student feels about the experience before and after the range of interactions or engagement with tasks, all need to be considered for authentic assessment of such experiential learning, sometimes problem-based learning, to occur.

In particular, this study was designed to: (1) develop the HLM models to determine the effects of school-level and child-level variables on children's reading achievement; and (2) investigate children's reading achievement variability by both child-level and school-level variables. The data here was from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). The study sample included 2400 students and 185 schools. The child-level variables included how often parents read to children and the number of hours children spent on watching TV in weekdays, and the school-level variables included percentage of gifted students in schools, and percentage of minority students in schools. Six models including one-way random effects ANOVA model, the unconditional model and the contextual models were developed. Both fixed effects and random effects were discussed in each model. Models were compared based on the proportion reduction in variance in both levels. Assumptions and the adequacy of the contextual model were also examined and discussed. This study included findings as follows: (1) there was a significant difference in mean reading achievement across schools; (2) children in the schools with higher rate minorities tended to have lower reading achievement than those in the schools with lower minority rate; (3) no significant difference in reading achievement was found for children in the schools with higher percent gifted students and lower percent gifted students; (4) children with parents who often read to them tended to perform better in reading achievement than those whose parents seldom read to them; (5) there was no significant difference in reading achievement between children spend more time on watching TV and those who watch less; and (6) no significance of the school level factors (percentage of gifted students and percentage of minority students) on children level factors (how often parents read to children and the number of hours children spent on watching TV in weekdays) were found.

However, this non-linear structure may cause problems such as inefficient navigation, being lost or cognitive overhead for some learners. The aim of this study is to determine how individual differences; cognitive styles, prior knowledge and gender influence the navigation pattern in a courseware. The research has the posttest-only, equivalent-groups true experimental design. The sampling is comprised of 84 first year undergraduate students at Gazi University, enrolled in an introduction to computer course. The cognitive styles (field dependent/ field intermediate/ field independent) of the students were measured with the \"Group Embedded Figure Test\". To determine the navigation pattern of the students, their stratum, compactness and revisit percentage values were computed based on their use of the courseware developed for the research. According to the findings, there is a statistically significant difference between learners' compactness and revisitation scores based on their cognitive styles. Also, there is a significant difference in revisitation scores based on the participants' prior knowledge. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)",

These analyses use information from the original survey and administrative data on case outcomes to explore three research questions: (1) Is nonresident father involvement associated with case length? (2) Is nonresident father involvement associated with foster care discharge outcomes? and (3) Is nonresident father involvement associated with subsequent child maltreatment allegations? The study finds that having an involved father is associated with shorter case length and a greater likelihood of reunification. Findings also indicate that, contrary to some caseworkers' fears, nonresident fathers' contact with the child welfare agency and involvement with their children is not associated with subsequent maltreatment allegations. The results, though exploratory, suggest that engaging the nonresident fathers of children in foster care could potentially improve outcomes for the children. Further research is needed to better understand the association between nonresident fathers' involvement and a greater likelihood of reunification. (Contains 2 tables, 7 figures, and 34 footnotes.)

This decision is an important one, with implications for how much a child and family are involved with the CWS, what services they receive, and how child maltreatment is counted in state statistics. Despite the importance of the substantiation decision, there are few data on how caseworker judgments influence the substantiation process. This research brief examines the relationship of caseworker judgments to the substantiation decision, using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW). It examines (1) how the degree of perceived harm to the child relates to the decision; (2) the importance of the caseworker's perception of the severity of future risk to the child; and (3) how the caseworker's judgment about the strength of the evidence relates to the decision.

NSCAW is gathering information associated with over 6,200 children from public child welfare agencies in a stratified random sample of 92 localities across the United States. The first national longitudinal study of its kind, NSCAW is examining the characteristics, needs, experiences, and outcomes for these children and families. The study will provide information about crucial program, policy, and practice issues of concern to the Federal government, state and local governments, and child welfare agencies. This report provides information about the characteristics of children and families who came into contact with the child welfare system through an investigation by child protective services. It provides a snapshot of the functioning and the potential service needs of children and families soon after a child protective services investigation has taken place. The study provides unique information about the effectiveness of efforts to intervene in the poor developmental trajectories of children involved with CWS. This report is organized into 12 chapters. Following an introduction, Chapter 2 provides a general overview of the NSCAW survey design and data sources, with a particular emphasis on the CPS component. The chapter also addresses response rates and potential sample bias. Chapters 3 through 5 examine the characteristics of the children in the CPS component of NSCAW. These chapters focus on the characteristics of the children, the environment in which these children live, and their developmental and functioning status. Chapter 6 addresses characteristics of the current caregivers. Chapter 7 describes the relationships between these children and their current caregiver. Chapter 8 examines children's service needs and receipt, and Chapter 9 the service needs and experiences of in-home current caregivers. Chapter 10 summarizes findings from a developmental perspective. Finally, Chapter 11 provides a summary of the findings and offers possible lessons for policy and practice that may be drawn from baseline data and analysis. Two appendixes are included: (1) Selected Analyses for Key States; and(2) Reliability of NSCAW Measures. (Contains 247 tables and 35 footnotes.)",

        "description":"Over 530,000 children are in foster care in the United States. These children live in a variety of settings, including non-relative foster homes, the homes of relatives, and group homes. This research brief offers a national portrait of children who had been in foster care for one year. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) is unique in providing not only information on the demographic characteristics of these children and information on their maltreatment and placement experiences, but also carefully gathered data on their well-being. This report ascertains: (1) the characteristics of children in foster care for one year; (2) the experiences of abuse or neglect that have brought these children into the child welfare system; (3) where these children reside; and (4) how children in foster for one year are faring in terms of health and cognitive and social development. The findings indicate that children who have been in foster care for one year vary in age and race. They are most likely to have experienced some form of neglect as their most serious maltreatment, and a significant number had experienced multiple types of maltreatment. Most of these children are residing in non-kin foster care settings. The multiple difficulties experienced by children in foster care suggest that these children require substantial resources that are likely to go beyond the service capacity of most child welfare agencies. This is the first in a series of NSCAW research briefs, developed by Caliber Associates from the Baseline Report, focused on children in foster care who come into contact with the Child Protective System.

However, little research has been available to provide a national picture of the circumstances in which these children reside. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) presents a unique profile of the experiences of children in foster care in the United States. Focusing on a national sample of children in foster care for one year, it provides a portrait of foster caregivers and foster caregiving environments, as well as the perceptions that children themselves have about their foster caregivers and their experiences in foster care. This research brief provides a portrait of those taking care of foster children in our country, the environments in which these children are being cared for, the children's perceptions about their caregiving arrangements, and the plans for reunification of this population. The NSCAW data reveal some favorable findings, such as the positive feelings that children express toward their foster parents and families, particularly those children in kinship care. However, the findings also highlight some issues for future consideration, such as the frequency of children's family visits, the large household size in non-kin foster homes, the relatively low educational and economic status of both kin and non-kin caregivers, and the less positive perceptions of caregiving environments expressed by children in group care.

        "description":"This research brief describes the developmental risks present in a cohort of children coming into contact with the child welfare system between 1999 and 2000, as well as the services the children receive to address these risks. The findings are drawn from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), a unique study that provides detailed information about the well-being and experiences of children and families in the child welfare system. This research brief juxtaposes data on the developmental risks present in children who have been investigated by child protective services (CPS) with their levels of service receipt approximately 7 months after investigation (on average). The brief concentrates on the cognitive and socioemotional development of children and answers the following questions: (1) What proportion of children in this study show significant developmental delays in the areas of cognitive and socioemotional development? (2) Given the level of need, what percentage of children in the NSCAW is receiving mental health and special educational services?; (3) How do these levels of need and service receipt compare for preschool age and school age children? and (4) Are there differences in the needs and service receipt of children in in-home and out-of-home care? The NSCAW data indicate that both preschoolers and school age children in contact with the child welfare system show a variety of developmental risks. Many children involved with the child welfare system are not receiving needed services that will enhance their future development. Moreover, the findings suggest that child welfare agency staff need better tools for assessing children's developmental needs. This is the third in a series of NSCAW research briefs, developed by Caliber Associates from the Wave 1 CPS Report, focused on children coming into contact with the Child Welfare System.

It specifically examines the presence of chronic health conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes) and special needs (e.g., emotional disturbance, speech impairment, developmental delay). It provides information about the rates of these health conditions and special needs over the course of a 3-year period. It asks the following questions: (1) What percentages of children involved in the child welfare system have chronic health conditions and/or special needs? (2) Do the rates of these conditions and needs differ by a child's gender, race/ethnicity, or age? and (3) Are the rates of these conditions and needs related to a child's CWS placement or adoption history? Are the rates related to the type of reported maltreatment? Among the key findings are that children in the CWS show rates of chronic health conditions, particularly asthma, that are relatively comparable to national estimates for all U.S. children. However, children with a history of out-of-home placement have higher rates of chronic health conditions than are described for children across the country.

        "description":"The Early Intervention Program for Infants and Toddlers (P.L. 99-457), now known as Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), was established by the federal government in 1986 &quot;to encourage states to expand opportunities for children less than 3 years of age who would be at risk of having substantial developmental delay if they did not receive early intervention services.&quot; After the child is assessed to determine the need for services, an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) is developed in collaboration with the child's caregiver. A legal document, the IFSP is written to identify goals and individualized supports and services that will enhance the child's development. Little research is available to help us understand how many infants and toddlers involved in maltreatment investigations are in need of Part C services or to what extent such children have already been served under Part C and/or are later referred to special education services and have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), This research brief examines the need for and provision of an IFSP during the first 3 years of life among infants and toddlers involved in investigations of child maltreatment. The brief ascertains: (1) the percentage of infants and toddlers involved with Child Welfare Services (CWS) need early intervention services, based on criteria that states use, and the percentage receiving an IFSP; (2) the child and maltreatment characteristics that predict having an IFSP; and (3) the percentage of infants and toddlers that later has an IEP, and of those, the percentage of those who ever had an IFSP transition to an IEP.

        "author":["Savich, Carl"],
        "description":"The purpose of this action research project was to investigate approaches and techniques that would improve critical thinking skills in history classes at the secondary level. Students demonstrated apathy and boredom in history classes where the emphasis was on rote memorization and the regurgitation of accepted facts and conclusions. The problem was to determine which teaching and learning strategies, techniques, and methods were the most effective in improving critical thinking skills in history. The research methodology consisted in a comparison of the inquiry or interactive method of teaching history with the lecture method. Two groups of high school students were chosen. One group was taught history using the lecture method. The other group was taught using the inquiry method. The criteria were whether students were able to analyze, evaluate, conceptualize, and synthesize information, not just whether they could memorize facts. A comparison of student performances on tests, essays, quizzes, and assignments was used for assessment, evaluation, and comparison. The inquiry strategies included role playing, simulations, re-enactments, examining and analyzing multiple texts, studying oral and visual presentations, analyzing bias by examining different viewpoints and perspectives, and analyzing documents and original and primary sources. The research results demonstrated that when critical thinking skills were emphasized under the inquiry method, students achieved higher scores on tests, quizzes, and assignments and gained a deeper and more meaningful understanding of history. The research results showed that the inquiry method improved critical thinking skills based on the comparison of test and quiz score grades but yielded results when critical thinking skills were integrated with content matter and when students were motivated and engaged and possessed an attitude that placed value on critical and higher order thinking. Finally, the lecture method was more effective in presenting the background and introduction to a topic or issue that the inquiry method was. In conclusion, critical thinking skills were shown to be effective in achieving a more in-depth and meaningful understanding of history by high school students, but relied on the integration of the critical thinking skills with subject content and on student motivation. Educators need to incorporate strategies that emphasize critical thinking skills in order to improve the understanding of history, but the strategies must be integrated with the content matter. Student attitude and motivation must also be stressed. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Teachers at three separate public schools analyzed possible reasons behind low grades. All problems (late work, unprepared students, lax attitudes) related to students who were not organized for learning. Even though these teachers taught a variety of ages ranging from third thru twelve grades, they typically found evidence of a lack of organization inside students' desks, lockers, binders, book bags, and pencil pouches. A review of the professional literature showed that a lack of organization was a problem. Most articles showed a distinction: Many teachers did not directly teach organization skills, and many employers assumed that their employees already possessed organization skills. Students who never shape or settle schoolwork may not have skills to organize tasks and activities later in life. In addition to basic skills, students' education may be inefficient. As disorganization leads to lower grades and achievement, students are not prepared for the school side of life. Teachers also found that while some students knew the subject material, their grades did not reflect their knowledge. Lacking education, skills to display their abilities, and fundamental skills, students are not prepared for life. Few educators have implemented a program for teaching organizational habits. It is often assumed that organization skills will be taught at home with other life skills. Unfortunately, this is seldom the situation. Teachers must provide a structured classroom environment. We did that by holding students accountable for bringing writing utensils, their assignment notebooks, and their binders to class daily. Data collected from journals, surveys, and students' grades indicated that any increase in student organization benefits students. Students lost fewer assignments and were better prepared for class when they had a sense of order. Of all tools, the binder was the most effective, probably because it accomplished such basic necessities for order: students had a placefor homework, they could find returned assignments to review for tests, and they had paper with them for note taking. Organization is a prerequisite for success. Organization crosses all studies for higher education and all life situations. Directly teaching organizational skills aids students for their current task (school) while preparing them for their latter tasks (workforce). Simple tools such as binders increase learning time and grades earned by students while decreasing their frustration. Teachers who teach organization skills to their students are teaching important lessons for school, as well as for life.

The &quot;2007-2008 Illinois Legislative Report Card on Racial Equity&quot;  evaluates the Governor and legislators on their responses to these initiatives. Assessed are whether the legislation (1) explicitly addresses racial outcomes and works to eliminate racial inequities; (2) increases access to public benefits and institutions for communities of color; (3) advances enfranchisement and full civic participation for all Illinoisans; (4) protects against racial violence, racial profiling, and discrimination; and (5) is enforceable and has instituted mechanisms ensuring accountability. The Report Card assigns letter grades to Illinois lawmakers based upon their support in 2007 for 56 pieces of legislation aimed at improving civil rights, criminal justice, economic justice, educational equity, health equity, and housing and community development.

The report compares substance use among this population with substance use in the general population, and compares different disability categories and demographic groups in substance use and in the receipt of substance abuse prevention education and services. The NLTS2 is funded by the National Center for Special Education Research at the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education. NLTS2 was initiated in 2001 and has a nationally-representative sample of more than 11,000 students with disabilities. The study found that adults with disabilities were less likely than those in the general population to report drinking alcohol and using any illegal drugs. Young adults with emotional disturbances were more likely than those in almost all other disability categories to report smoking cigarettes, drinking, and using marijuana or other illegal drugs. Young adults with learning disabilities were also more likely than those in many other disability categories to report smoking, drinking, and marijuana use.

Analyses of results from national standardized tests, such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the SAT and ACT college entrance examinations, as well as other measures of educational achievement, provide an overall picture of trends in gender equity from elementary school to college and beyond. Differences among girls and among boys by race/ ethnicity and family income level are evaluated. Together these analyses support three overarching facts about gender equity in schools today: (1) Girls' successes don't come at boys' expense; (2) girls' and boys' educational performance has improved; and (3) understanding disparities by race/ethnicity and family income level is critical to understanding girls' and boys' achievement. The report finds that many girls as well as boys are not acquiring the educational skills needed to succeed in the 21st-century economy. The report dispels the myth of a boys' crisis and calls for a refocused public debate on the deep divisions among schoolchildren by race/ethnicity and family income level. This report illustrates that while educational trends for both girls and boys are generally positive, disparities by race/ethnicity and family income level exist and are critical to understanding the landscape of education in America today. Two appendixes include: (1) NAEP Supplementary Figures; and (2) SAT and ACT Supplementary Figures. (Contains 59 figures and 25 footnotes.)

Since 1987-1988, the number of preservation programs managed by a preservation administrator has grown 66 to as many as 80 in more recent years, with 77 in 2005-2006. Shifting trends have made themselves evident in many categories. Preservation expenditures for ARL's 111 reporting member libraries were $107,937,836 in 2005-2006, which reflects an inflation-adjusted increase of 27% since the survey's revision in 1996-1997. Total preservation staff grew to just under 1,800 FTEs in 2005-2006, an increase of 5.4% from 2004-2005. Level 1 conservation treatment decreased from 2004-2005 levels, while the number of items treated at Levels 2 and 3 increased; total conservation treatment has increased by more than 50,000 volumes in the past year, bringing it higher than it has been in the last four years. Microfilming activity decreased by about 11,000 volumes, to 154,857; the high microfilming values over the last three years was due largely to a re-organization of counting at the Library of Congress, which reported 121,386 volumes microfilmed. Availability of external funds plays a critical role in preservation activities. In 1988, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) began a multi-year, expanded cooperative preservation microfilming program, in which ARL libraries have participated extensively. However, it appears that cuts in the NEH budget have also negatively affected availability of external funding for preservation, which fell constantly from a high of $11,090,547 in 1992-1993 to a low of $4,917,732 in 1997-1998. In recent years external expenditures have been up and down, with the 2005-2006 figure of $6,270,601 representing a 2.3% decrease from 2004-2005.

It is the most comprehensive and thorough guide to current salaries in large U.S. and Canadian academic and research libraries, and is a valuable management and research tool. Data for 9,824 professional staff members were reported this year for the 113 ARL university libraries, including their law and medical libraries (936 staff members reported by 72 medical libraries and 744 staff members reported by 75 law libraries). For the 10 nonuniversity ARL members, data were reported for 3,832 professional staff members. The tables are organized in seven major sections. The first section includes Tables 1 through 4, which report salary figures for all professionals working in ARL member libraries, including law and medical library data. The second section includes salary information for the 10 nonuniversity research libraries of ARL. The third section, entitled &quot;ARL University Libraries,&quot; reports data in Tables 7 through 25 for the &quot;general&quot; library system of the university ARL members, combining U.S. and Canadian data but excluding law and medical data. The fourth section, composed of Tables 26 through 30, reports data on U.S. ARL university library members excluding law and medical data; the fifth section, Tables 31-34, reports data on Canadian ARL university libraries excluding law and medical data. The sixth section (Tables 35-41) and the seventh section (Tables 42-48) report on medical and law libraries, respectively, combining U.S. and Canadian data.

        "description":"Bullying and harassment negatively affect the learning environment, and school principals can make a difference. Previous research has found that teachers see having a supportive principal as critical to changing school climate. Yet not all principals may have the experience, skills or knowledge to address lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) student issues. In order to get a clearer understanding of the principal's perspective, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) collaborated with NASSP (the National Association of Secondary School Principals) on a study exploring the perspectives of elementary and secondary public school principals on student bullying and harassment and on the policies, programs and training that principals have instituted in their schools to address these issues. A survey conducted by Harris Interactive revealed that K-12 principals underestimate the harassment LGBT students experience in schools. Although principals report their schools engage in anti-bullying/harassment efforts, most do not specifically address school safety for LGBT students. (Contains 40 tables.)

A quasi-experimental design, using covariate matching and comparative interrupted time-series techniques, was used to assess school differences in changes in mathematics performance between program and comparison schools. Following up on an earlier report with just one year of post-implementation data, the study found no significant differences between schools using this practice and those not doing so after two years. The brief summarizes findings from a follow-up study to the Issues &amp; Answers report, &quot;Measuring How Benchmark Assessments Affect Student Achievement. REL 2007-No. 039&quot; [ED499792]. The follow-up study adds another year of post-implementation data to examine the impact of benchmark assessments on grade 8 mathematics achievement, using the same data sources, methods, and reporting as the original study. The study examines whether, after two years of implementation, schools in Massachusetts using quarterly benchmark exams aligned with state standards in middle school mathematics showed greater gains in student achievement than those not doing so. A quasi-experimental design, using covariate matching and comparative interrupted time-series techniques, was used to assess differences in changes in mathematics performance between program and comparison schools. The follow-up study finds no significant differences between schools using this practice and those not doing so after two years. Limitations include the lack of data on what benchmark  assessment practices comparison schools may be using, having only 22 treatment and 44 comparison schools, and having only two years of post-implementation data--perhaps still too few to observe an impact from the intervention.

        "description":"Tinto's integration framework is often assumed to be inapplicable to the study of student persistence at community colleges because one of the linchpins of the framework, social integration, is considered unlikely to occur for students at these institutions. Community college students are thought to lack the time to participate in activities, such as clubs, that would facilitate social integration. Using in-depth interviews with students at two urban community colleges in the Northeast, we examine the ways that first-year community college students engage with their institutions. We find that the majority of them do develop attachments to their institutions. Moreover, this sense of attachment is related to their persistence in the second year of college. We also find that this integration is both academic and social. Contrary to findings from other studies that apply Tinto's framework, we find that these two forms of integration develop in concert for community college students. The same activities lead to both academic and social relatedness. This is particularly true for information networks that students develop in the classroom. (Contains 3 footnotes and 1 table.)",

        "description":"Title III of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) requires state education agencies to develop progress and attainment benchmarks for school districts, called annual measurable achievement objectives (AMAOs), for English language learners (ELLs). AMAOs must be based on annual assessments of English proficiency in the domains of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Conceptually, holding districts accountable for ELL student progress and attainment in English seems straightforward. However, the process for establishing AMAO criteria can be very complex, and current research on system accountability using ELL assessments is sparse at best. Because of this dearth of research, there has been little guidance available to inform states on how to appropriately establish AMAO policies. This paper attempts to fill that void by providing guidance and recommendations on how states might establish AMAO progress and English attainment policies. The first section of the paper provides guidance for AMAO 1--targeted annual increases in the number or percentage of children making progress in learning English. The second section provides guidance for AMAO 2--targeted annual increases in the number or percentage of children attaining English proficiency. The third section offers some alternative approaches to setting AMAO 1 criteria. The data used in this paper come from three member states of the World-class Instructional Design and Assessment (WIDA) Consortium over a 3-year period (2005-2007) across all grades (kindergarten to 12th grade). The WIDA Consortium was originally established with funding from a U.S. Department of Education Enhanced Assessment Grant and includes 17 states. The English language proficiency assessment used by WIDA Consortium states is ACCESS for ELLs[R] (Assessing Comprehension and Communication in English State to State). This assessment is aligned with WIDA English proficiency standards and reflects the state-specific academic content standards of member states as required under NCLB. The AMAO recommendations made in this paper relate specifically to states using ACCESS for ELLs[R]; however, the methods, recommendations, and guidance offered are easily generalizable to other types of ELL assessment systems.

Many big-city systems are also losing enrollment and facing financial deficits. These problems inevitably lead to criticism of the boards that govern urban school districts, and questions about whether some other governance arrangement might get better results. Seattle faces the same problems as other big-city districts. Critics of the school board have pointed to a few cities that have put mayors in charge of public schools in hope of overcoming political paralysis, pursuing consistent reform strategies, narrowing the achievement gap, and bringing expenses in line with revenues. This paper explores the underlying logic of mayoral interventions into public education, their consequences to date, and their possible suitability for Seattle. The report highlights a range of reforms that aim to improve the governance of urban school districts. (Contains 50 footnotes and 1 table.)",

        "description":"The situation of schools in the Democratic Republic of Congo in matters concerning new information and communication technologies remains alarming. Given the primary role of these technologies in teaching and learning, as well as the concern of giving Congolese rural schools access to these tools, considering the problems of lack of electricity, telephones, ventilation, the cost of computer equipment, etc. we propose the following strategies which may facilitate the introduction, access and effective use of such educational tools.   Addressing these problems and through a commitment to the use of ICT in rural schools, the new $100 Laptop, proposed by MIT, appears to be the answer to many of the issues. The cost of the laptop seems to be affordable and it can solve the issue of the lack of ICT equipment and overcome the problem of the lack of electricity, but it is not so straightforward. It is true that these laptops can help to solve the ICT problems being faced in the educational sector. However, even at the seemingly affordable cost of $100, this is still expensive in some local economies. In a country such as Congo, where teachers receive less than $100 for a monthly salary, it becomes improbable that the people or the Department of Education can afford this financial outlay.",

        "author":["Felini, Damiano"],
        "description":"Background: The penetration of video games in media consumption behaviors is statistically very significant all over the world. Education and media education cannot ignore this phenomenon, as it is so relevant for such a considerable part of the population, especially youth. The application of media education principles and goals to video games is very recent, because these electronic media are relatively young, and because of some deeper pedagogical and organizational reasons. In fact, media literacy has to deal with the cultural prejudice that video games, considered just like toys, don't deserve to become the subject of a discipline and to be present in school curricula. Furthermore, media literacy activities about video games require technological facilities, which are not necessarily expensive, but which are not generally available in schools and educational centers; last, these activities require staff with specific video game skills, a background that teachers and educators usually lack. Purpose: Design and experiment a course about video game literacy, including the production of an action game by youth people. Test and improve a new game-authoring software, expressed designed for an educational use. Setting: Public Educational Youth Centers, between the years 2007-2008. Research Design: Single Subject; Qualitative. Findings: The possibility and usefulness of bringing popular culture into education, developing in the adults attitudes of understanding and mediation, not of censorship; The opportunity to develop critical thinking skills in youth, by increasing knowledge and competence about video games; The benefits of a teaching approach that integrates video game analysis and production; and The usefulness of the collaboration among media producers, educators, and researchers. Conclusion: Media education can be applied even in the field of video games; in some way, we are going towards a &quot;video game literacy&quot;, inspired by the same well-known and accomplished philosophy.

        "description":"Understanding the nature of science, especially how scientists err, is an essential tool for: (1) assessing the reliability and scope of scientific claims; (2) perceiving the scope of these claims; and (3) making personal and public decisions. What features of the nature of the science are most important to know? Recent consensus highlights the following: (1) Scientists think critically about claims. Empirical evidence is their ultimate standard; (2) Scientists use a variety of methods: hypothesis, for instance, as well as analogy and induction. Some collect observations; others creatively recognize patterns in data. Imagination, logical reasoning, chance, and interdisciplinary thinking can all be important; (3) Observation is sometimes enhanced by quantitative measurement, by comparison--especially with controls that isolate the effect of individual variables or help distinguish  correlation from causation--and by graphical representation and statistical analysis summarizing patterns in the data and the chances for error; (4) Data does not speak for itself. Rather, scientists interpret findings, and sometimes those interpretations are biased by  theoretical or cultural perspectives; (5) Scientific claims vary in their level of certainty. No method guarantees answers or absolute certainty, yet multiple lines of evidence help reinforce many claims. Even important problems may remain unresolved. In some cases, scientists may justifiably disagree; (6) Science is a human enterprise. Some scientists are motivated by curiosity or a passion to solve problems, others by profit or ambition. Some collaborate; others compete: (7) Knowledge develops historically. Sometimes concepts change dramatically; (8) Science resolves only problems of fact, not values. Nonetheless,  the practice of science and its results have moral dimensions; and (9) Science generally aims to map and explain the world. Technology differs in that it aims to adapt that understanding of the world.",

        "description":"Prerequisite courses are essential tools in many university curricula, but some educators have suggested that they may be detrimental if applied too stringently to exclude students from courses. A measure of the value of prerequisites is whether or not they promote student success. The strongest way to test the value of prerequisites is to compare the success rate of students with and without prerequisites in higher-level courses. Although such comparisons can be based on instructor assessment of preparedness or even on student self-assessment, the most meaningful comparisons of student success are grades and withdrawal rates of students with and without prerequisites. This article presents the results of a comparison of the success rates of students with and without prerequisites in higher-level biology courses at the University of South Florida. Based on this study: (1) the faculty-driven model of the function of prerequisites yielded better course performance than the student-driven model; and (2) both failure and withdrawal rates of students in Department of Biology courses at dropped significantly when prerequisites were enforced.

Although the National Science Education Standards (NSES) provides a framework for teaching precollege science, it does not stress as fundamental the importance of plants in science teaching. The author cites National Research Council (NRC) reports emphasizing that \"our knowledge about the world around us is incomplete if we do not include plants in our discoveries, and it is distorted if we do not place sufficient emphasis on plant life,\" and \"because plants are especially easy to grow and care for, students at every grade level should be involved with gardening projects ... Both domesticated and native plants should be grown and observed. The ecological and agricultural importance of plants should be a major point of emphasis. The historical importance of agriculture in the development of the human race provides an ideal opportunity to integrate the social and natural sciences.\" The writer advocates that lack of emphasis on the importance of teaching about plants by the NSES should not preclude teachers from incorporating NRC recommendations in the classroom.

Articles and books were classified under prewriting, composing, and revising and editing headings. The review results showed that computers can make writers' job easy in the writing process. In addition, literature results revealed that teachers, peers, instructional strategies, and computer software all together have some important roles to develop students' writing ability. Simplifying the revising process is the biggest expectation from computers.",

        "description":"In recent years, a great tendency towards the use of technology and its integration into the curriculum has gained a great importance. Particularly, the use of video as an audio-visual material in foreign language teaching classrooms has grown rapidly because of the increasing emphasis on communicative techniques, and it is obvious that the use of video is a great help for foreign language teachers in stimulating and facilitating the target language. Keeping all this in mind, the purpose of this article was to provide the required information for foreign language teachers (FLT) so that they can make use of video efficiently in the classroom. Reasons for video implication in FLT classroom and teacher's role in this process have been revealed along with some practical techniques for video implication.

The experiments have been carried out in a private high school in Diyarbakir/Turkey on groups of first year students whose pre-test scores of achievements and attitudes show no statistically significant difference. One of the groups received computer assisted, and the other were given instructions based on 7E model of the constructive learning method. An achievement test consisting of 29 multi-choice questions related to subject of electrostatics has been carried out to compare the group's achievements. A statistical analysis of achievement tests showed a significant difference between the students achievements at the knowledge and comprehension levels of cognitive domain (P&lt;,05). On the other hand no difference was noted between their achievements at the application level of cognitive domain. To determine the effect of the instruction methods on the student's attitudes towards the physics course, a physics attitude scale was applied to both groups. The results have indicated that the student's attitudes towards physics learning were not affected by different instruction methods. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "title":"School Improvement Planning: What's Missing? A Center Policy Report",
        "description":"Few would argue against the idea of planning and implementing improvements to the nation's schools. This report contends, school improvement planning processes have frequently not been conceived in ways likely to produce desired learning outcomes for many students. The analyses presented in this report focus on a lack of attention to how schools do and do not address barriers to learning and teaching. Planning guides reviewed for this report stress meeting the demand for standard-based and result-oriented school improvement primarily by elaborating on prevalent thinking about school practices, rather than considering fundamental systemic change. With a view to broadening the focus of planning, the report includes a set of guidelines for a comprehensive component to address barriers to learning and teaching. These guidelines provide a template for assessing what tends to be missing in school improvement planning guides. The report also outlines major problems with the ways schools currently address learning, behavior, and emotional problems. Six major recommendations are discussed: (1) Every school improvement planning guide should have a focus on development of a comprehensive, multifaceted, and cohesive learning supports system which is fully integrated with plans for improving instruction at the school; (2) Guidelines for school improvement planning should delineate the content of an enabling or learning supports component; (3) Guidelines for school improvement planning should incorporate standards and accountability indicators for each area of learning supports content; (4) Guidelines for school improvement planning should specify ways to weave school and community resources into a cohesive and integrated continuum of interventions over time; (5) Guidelines for school improvement planning should include an emphasis on redefining and reframing roles and functions and redesigning infrastructure to ensure learning supports are attended to as a primary and essentialcomponent of school improvement and to promote economies of scale; and (6) Current initiatives for program evaluation and research projects should be redesigned to include a focus on amassing and expanding the research-base for building and valuating such an enabling or learning supports component, with a long-range emphasis on demonstrating the component's long-term impact on academic achievement. Reforms in Hawaii and Iowa are described to illustrate movement in the recommended direction. Five appendixes include: (1) Summary of Analysis of New York City's School Improvement Planning Guide (Performance Assessment in Schools System wide -- PASS); (2) Summary of Analysis of the Boston Public School's School Improvement Planning Guide (Essentials of Whole-School Improvement); (3) Guidelines and Quality Indicators for the Draft of Standards for an Enabling or Learning Supports Component; (4) Hawaii's Quality Student Support Criteria and Rubrics; and (5) Fulfilling a Promise, Investing in Iowa's Future: Enhancing Iowa's Systems of Supports for Learning and Development.

        "description":"Given the range of student learning, behavior, and emotional problems experienced each day by teachers and families, meeting the challenge of supplying appropriate support is complex. Efforts to do so may be handicapped by the way in which student support interventions currently are conceived, organized, and implemented. Student supports are frequently mandated, developed, and function in relative isolation of each other. The result is an ad hoc and fragmented enterprise that does not meet the needs encountered at most schools. Over the years that school reform has focused on improving instruction, less attention has been paid to rethinking student supports. As a result, essential resources are not being used in ways that are essential if schools are to accomplish their mission. This concept paper highlights the problem and suggests new guidelines for student support, including: (1) Major areas of concern related to barriers to learning; (2) Timing and nature of problem-oriented interventions; (3) General domains for intervention; (4) Specialized student and family assistance; (5) Assuring intervention quality; and (6) Evaluation and accountability.

        "description":"Today's school and community stakeholders are attempting to address complex, multifaceted, and overlapping psychosocial and mental health concerns in diverse, fragmented and at-times marginalized ways. This has led to competition for sparse resources and inadequate results. Enhancing mental health in schools is not an easy task. The bottom line is that limited efficacy seems inevitable as long as the full continuum of necessary programs is unavailable and staff development remains deficient; limited cost effectiveness seems inevitable as long as related interventions are carried out in isolation of each other; and limited systemic change is likely as long as the entire enterprise is marginalized in policy and practice. This state of affairs calls for realigning policy and practice around a unifying and cohesive framework based on well-conceived models and the best available scholarship. Initiatives for mental health in schools must be connected in major ways with the mission of schools and integrated into a restructured system of education support programs and services. This means braiding resources and interventions with a view to ensuring there is a system of learning supports that meets overlapping needs and does so by fully integrating mental health agenda into school improvement planning at school and district levels. Policy and practice must end the marginalization of mental health in schools. Six appendices include: (1) A. New Freedom Commission on Mental Health Recommendations; (2) Reframing How Schools Address Barriers to Learning; (3) Some Natural Opportunities to Enhance Mental Health at School; (4) Guidelines for Mental Health in Schools; (5) Examples of Policy Statements for a Unifying Approach in Schools; and (6) Examples of Provisions in Federal Law that Allow Districts to Redeploy Federal Resources to Improve Systems.

        "title":"Integrating Agendas for Mental Health in Schools into the Recommendations of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health",
        "description":"It is long been acknowledged that psychosocial and mental health concerns must be addressed if schools are to function satisfactorily and students are to learn and perform effectively. This reality is reflected in the aims of the No Child Left Behind Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. And, it is consonant with the goals and recommendations of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. Indeed, these initiatives reflect a shared agenda and must coalesce in school improvement policies and initiatives in ways that more wisely invest and use sparse resources. In pursuit of a shared agenda, existing resources can be deployed and redeployed in ways that enhance equity with respect to availability, access, and effectiveness. There are about 90,000 schools in the U.S.A. In a real sense, schools are primary care and public health settings, and thus, school staff are primary care providers and agents for public health, although most don't identify as such. Moreover, our society calls on schools to serve all students without regard to disorder, disability, ethnicity, economic status, gender identity, and so forth. As a result, efforts to transform how mental health is delivered in this country need to include a specific emphasis on enhancing the focus on mental health in schools. To this end, this brief highlights ways in which the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health's recommendations apply to mental health in schools. As conceived here, mental health in schools is (a) part of essential student support systems that enable students to learn so that schools can achieve their mission and (b) a fundamental facet of the initiative to transform the mental health system. (Four appendices include: (1) Highlights of the Goals and Recommendations of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health; (2) Federal Mental Health in Schools Program; (3) Note About Building on Current In-School Practices; and (4) Guidelines, Standards and Accountability for MH in Schools.

        "description":"The internet is emerging as the single most important dissemination tool. For many professionals, it is the primary way they access information and resources. Thus, analyses of what is and isn't online are essential in advancing the internet's value for enterprises such as the New Freedom Initiative. This report presents analyses of a synthesis of online, noncommercial resources that have relevance for advancing efforts to integrate mental health in schools into the New Freedom Initiative. Not surprisingly, the analyses indicate that the online resources in many arenas of concern are limited, and there are major gaps. The importance of this report is not in this statement of the obvious, but in the specifics that provide a detailed needs assessment. The delineation of needs is intended to guide development of a more basic set of online resources with a view to accelerating the envisioned transformation of the mental health system. We conclude by urging those responsible for the New Freedom Initiative to bring together relevant agencies, centers, and organizations to encourage them to establish a coordinated and cohesive approach for filling online resource gaps.

        "description":"In many arenas, the demand for data has outstripped the availability of good data and has increased the tendency to grab for whatever numbers are being circulated in the literature. As a result, when someone says: \"This is the best data available,\" it is essential to remember that \"best\" does not always mean good. This caution is particularly relevant in the mental health field where funding to support data gathering continues to be sparse and sound methodological practices are difficult and costly to implement. The intent of this report is to provide a synthesis of the best data on the prevalence and incidence of youngsters' problems and to clarify the limitations of what has been gathered so far. Because of the inadequacies of current data gathering, people must rely on subpopulation survey data and best estimates of mental health (MH) problems in schools, primary health care systems, and juvenile justice systems. The reality is that the primary sources for widely cited data on mental health and psychosocial concerns represent a relatively small body of studies, each of which makes an important contribution and, at the same time, the researchers are the first to acknowledge the limitations of the reported findings. This report is divided into three sections. The first section presents a sampling of statistical reports covering general surveys, special education data, juvenile justice data, and such specific problems as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, depression and suicide, and substance abuse. This section also presents excerpts from reports addressing cultural and economic influences on prevalence and service. The second section presents an in-depth analysis of key reports, examining how many young people are affected, how the data is commonly reported, whether rates are increasing, and whether the children are being served. The third section, \"Concluding Comments,\" observes that data on youngsters mental health and psychosocial problems provide snapshots, but the pictures are for the most part fuzzy, so data must be used with critical care. Policy is needed that focuses on building a comprehensive system for gathering a full set of indicators that can be used to guide efforts to understand the nature and scope of youngsters' problems and as a report care on the well-being of the nation's children.

As described on the Department's website, &quot;this program provides grants to SEAs, LEAs, and Indian tribes for the purpose of increasing student access to quality mental health care by developing innovative programs that link school systems with local mental health systems.&quot; A funded program must: (1) Enhance, improve, or develop collaborative efforts between school-based service systems and mental health service systems to provide, enhance, or improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment services to students; (2) Enhance the availability of crisis intervention services, appropriate referrals for students potentially in need of mental health services, and ongoing mental health services; (3) Provide training for the school personnel and mental health professionals who will participate in the program; (4) Provide technical assistance and consultation to school systems and mental health agencies, and families participating in the program; (5) Provide linguistically appropriate and culturally competent services; and (6) Evaluate the effectiveness of the program in increasing student access to quality mental health services, and making recommendations to the secretary of education about sustainability of the program. This report summarizes the work from each of the eight state level projects funded in 2005 (Arkansas, Ohio, Maryland), 2006 (Illinois, Utah) and 2007 (Michigan, South Carolina, Delaware.)

        "title":"Addressing Barriers to Student Learning & Promoting Healthy Development: A Usable Research-Base",
        "description":"As schools evolve improvement plans in keeping with higher standards and expectations and increased accountability, most planners recognize they must include a comprehensive focus on addressing barriers to student learning and promoting healthy development. A growing volume of research on the value of schools, families, and communities working together to provide supportive programs and services indicates a number of promising findings, including improved school attendance, fewer behavior problems, improved inter-personal skills, enhanced achievement, and increased bonding at school and at home. Based on these findings, state and local education agencies are delineating ways to enhance social, emotional, and behavioral performance as a fundamental facet of improving academic performance. This brief highlights the research base for key elements of a comprehensive approach to address six major areas of concern: (1) enhancing classroom teachers' capacity for addressing problems and for fostering social, emotional, intellectual and behavioral development; (2) enhancing school capacity to handle transition concerns confronting students and families; (3) responding to, minimizing impact of, and preventing crisis; (4) enhancing home involvement; (5) outreaching to the community to build linkages and collaborations; and (6) providing special assistance to students and families. Taken as a whole, the research-base for initiatives to pursue a comprehensive focus on addressing barriers to student learning and promoting healthy development indicates a range of activity that can enable students to learn and teachers to teach. Findings also underscore that addressing major psychosocial problems one at a time is unwise because the problems are interrelated and require multifaceted and cohesive solutions. Overall, the literature provides models for content of such activity and also stresses the importance of coalescing such activity into a comprehensive, multifaceted approach.",

This brief report analyzes the guidance document with a specific focus on how to ensure Title I schoolwide planning addresses barriers to learning and teaching in a comprehensive way. The emphasis is on planning that fully integrates development of a comprehensive system of learning supports. Such a system is discussed as an essential component of efforts to counter ongoing factors that interfere with equalizing the odds for all students to succeed at school. Failure to develop such a system is seen as contributing to the perpetuation of achievement gaps and dropout rates and as playing a major role in the plateauing of achievement gains.

Instead, they must be able to work together to guide school improvement planners in designing and developing a comprehensive and systemic learning supports component in every school. For this to happen, student support staff need to adopt an unifying umbrella concept, a comprehensive systemic intervention framework, and an infrastructure design for building capacity at the school and throughout the feeder pattern of schools. Also necessary are changes in student support staff roles and functions. The first step in all this is for leaders concerned with enhancing student/learning supports to mobilize their constituencies for moving forward in new directions.

        "title":"New Initiatives: Considerations Related to Planning, Implementing, Sustaining, and Going-to-Scale. A Center Brief",
        "description":"Properly conceived and implemented new initiatives are essential to improving schools and communities. Such new initiatives usually are pursued as projects, pilots, or demonstrations, with temporary funding and staffing. When the funding ends, more often than not much of what has been developed disappears. Sometimes this is appropriate (e.g., when what was developed turns out not to be effective or important). At other times, the loss represents a set back for all stakeholders. Optimally, plans should be made at the onset with respect to sustaining valuable functions developed during the special funding period, and sustainability should be a focus from day one of implementation. With most such work, however, the pressure of just becoming operational often means that sustainability is not a major focus until well into the second year of a three year funding period. Moreover, most staff have not be prepared to pursue their work in ways that maximize sustainability and scale-up. This brief is designed to provide a quick overview of basic ideas, phases, stages, and steps related to the planning, implementation, maintenance, and scale-up of valuable new initiatives. There is a particular emphasis on sustainability. (Cited References, Additional References, and Other Resources are included. Three appendixes include: (1) Readiness for Systemic Change; (2) Social Marketing, Data, and Systemic Change; and (3) Formative and Summative Evaluation of Efforts to Sustain Functions.

        "description":"It is time for reform advocates to expand their emphasis on improving instruction and school management to include a comprehensive component for addressing barriers to learning. In doing so, they must pursue this third component with the same level of priority they devote to the other two. That is, such an enabling (or learner support) component must be a primary and essential facet of school reform. This will require shifting policy to push school reform beyond the current tendency to concentrate mainly on instruction and management. This type of substantive change requires guidance and support from professionals with mastery level competence for creating a climate for change, facilitating change processes, and establishing an institutional culture where key stakeholders continue to learn and evolve. This publication discusses the role of Organization Facilitation as fundamental to establishing an infrastructure for systemic change in districts and schools. Three appendixes include: (1) Expanding School Improvement to Address Barriers to Learning: Rethinking Student Support Services and Enhancing School-Community Connections; (2) Initial Plan for the Organization Facilitator in Phasing-in a Learning Supports/Enabling Component; and (3) Why Rethink How to Use Student Support Resources?

        "description":"This guide/toolkit is designed as a resource aid for those in schools and communities who are concerned about sustaining valuable initiatives and innovations. The focus is on sustaining valued functions and collaborations. A particular emphasis is on efforts designed to enhance how schools address barriers to learning and teaching. The material is oriented to the idea that the essence of sustainability is making systemic changes. This guide/toolkit is divided into two parts. Part I begins with an overview of what sustainability means. It is suggested that not everything is worth maintaining and that what is maintained should be fully integrated into the fabric of existing support programs and services designed to enhance the outcomes for children, youth, and communities. Section 2 of Part I includes a set of tools and aids for sustainability -- with an emphasis on processes that will mobilize partners and develop effective mechanisms for system change. In the third section of Part I, the focus is on evaluating sustainability efforts. Discussed is the necessity of formulating an evaluation action plan, adopting specific benchmarks for monitoring progress, and specifying and measuring both immediate and longer-term indicators that functions are sustained. Part II stresses that the likelihood of sustaining many valued functions and school-community connections is enhanced by connecting the work with educational reforms and school improvement planning. Section 1 outlines basic frameworks to help guide efforts to integrate with education reforms. Sections 2 and 3 of Part II reframes sustainability as an opportunity to enhance intervention and collaboration for addressing barriers to student learning and  promoting healthy development. The emphasis is on playing catalytic, planning, and follow-through roles in generating the type of systemic changes that sustain and enhance functions valued by the school and community. This includes a focus on policy, collaborative infrastructure, and capacity building. The aim, over time, is to improve outcomes for all children and youth by moving initiatives for addressing barriers to student learning and promoting healthy development from the margins into the mainstream of the school and community culture. Finally, appendices and a list of references and resources drawn from a variety of sources provide additional guidance and tools and cover topics such as developing standards and expanding the accountability framework, social marketing, and enhancing working relationships.

        "description":"Efforts to make substantial and substantive improvements related to mental health in schools and student/learning supports requires much more than implementing a few demonstrations. Improved approaches are only as good as a school district's ability to develop and institutionalize them equitably in all its schools. This process often is called diffusion, replication, roll out, or scale-up. The frequent failure to sustain innovations and take them to scale in school districts has increased interest in understanding systemic change as a central concern in school improvement. This report provides examples of steps for turning a pilot project into a catalyst for systemic change and sustainability: (1) Refer to the project as an \"Initiative\" rather than a \"Pilot\"; (2) Establish an initiative director and leadership team; (3) Establish an infrastructure; (4) Adopt a comprehensive vision and write a design document; (5) Start a process for translating the vision into policy; (6) Develop a 5-year strategic plan; and (7) Move the strategic plan to implementation.

        "description":"Educational technologies, specifically computer and the Internet technologies, have apparently become powerful tools in the classroom as they change the way we teach and learn today. That is why pedagogies of school reform are now highly influenced by and built around the \"constructivist\" theories of learning, assuming the use of technology in education for active and meaningful knowledge construction. Due to these trends it appears inevitable that social studies educators do need to know how to use technology effectively in their educational settings. Therefore, after a brief look at the concepts of technology and educational technology including a rationale for the use of technology in education, the current literature specifically on the integration of technology in the social studies with a reference to constructivism is examined. As a result, based on this study it seems that the infusion of technology into educational environments, specifically in the social studies, aligned with constructivist pedagogy bears the potential to inspire new ways of teaching and learning.",

Students from Chemistry Education Department at Dokuz Eylul University (D.E.U) were selected randomly and divided into three groups; two experimental (Eg-1 and Eg-2) and a control (Cg).   In teaching analytical chemistry topics, two different computer based methods--new analytical chemistry learning software called HEHAsit (Method A) and a Microsoft Excel program (Method B)--were prepared by us and applied to Eg-1 and Eg-2, respectively. Whereas the last group (Cg) was taught by the traditional method (Method C). In the comparison of the effects of the three methods, we developed an attitude questionnaire and an achievement test related to Analytical chemistry, and applied to students in all three groups. Students' attitudes towards computers were also tested by a computer attitude test developed by us. As a result of the study, significant differences between control group and both experimental groups and between experimental groups on computer attitudes and analytical chemistry attitudes were found. Furthermore, analytical chemistry achievement in experimental groups was significantly higher from the control group. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Among the factors not to use a computer, however, are shown the obstacles like they do not own a computer, the economic conditions and lack of time.  By means of the study we have found that there is a meaningful relation between the students' preferences to use a computer and the variables like gender, grades and own a computer.

The study was conducted at one public and one private primary school in Istanbul. Focus group interviews were held in each school with thirteen teachers of English and then individual interviews and observations were carried out with four volunteer teachers being 2 from the public primary school during the spring semester, 2004-2005. The four participant teachers were observed in their classrooms ten times along with before- and after-class observation reflections facilitated by the researcher. These observations were accompanied by document analysis. Data from the interviews were inductively analyzed. The findings indicated that public school EFL teachers had limited knowledge to implement learner-centeredness whereas private teachers did not.   [Abstract included in Turkish.]",

Data from the Chicago Public Schools' (CPS) School and Citywide Reports (CPS, 2007) were analyzed to assess the disconnect between urban communities and public education. Although the city is 42% white, white students account for a mere 8.1% of its public school enrollments. In a city where only 16.6% of families and 19.6% individuals live below poverty level, over 85% of public school students come from low-income families. The predominantly black and minority schools, which make up the majority of public schools, have fewer than 50% of their students passing standardized tests at grade level. It was recommended that initiatives to reinvent a more effective urban public school system will only work if educators become better public relations agents, and make schools &quot;less dull&quot; places to learn.",

With the advent of new technological tools; educators, parents, politicians, and administrators are seeking alternative ways of successfully educating the new generations to use these new technologies in their daily lives and to develop new skills to better compete with others. This task, of course, requires teachers who have the knowledge and skills to integrate these technologies in their curricula. Research shows that colleges of education are not doing their jobs effectively in preparing such teachers. This article focuses on research findings that address this issue and attempts to extract lessons that could be useful for other teacher education programs all around the world. The article concludes that there is a growing need of research studies which reports the currently utilized technologies and their impacts on the education and training of teacher candidates.",

        "description":"Although the Internet has opened up a vast new source of information for university students to use and explore, many students lack the skills to find, critically evaluate and intelligently exploit web-based resources.  This problem is accentuated in English-medium universities where students learn and use English as a foreign language.  In these cases, the task of finding and extracting relevant and useful information is daunting for students.  Also, they spend too much time looking for information and become demotivated or end up copying and pasting without enough time to think critically about the issues. In response to the challenges faced by students in effectively exploiting web-based resources, the School of Foreign Languages, Eastern Mediterranean University, has recently begun using a new approach developed in the late nineties in America known as WebQuests.  The Modern Languages Division of the SFL provides service English courses for students studying in various departments, and one of its aims is to link English language with concepts used in the departments by benefiting from the resources on the Internet.  The underlying principles inherent in the design and implementation of WebQuests provide a reason and motivation for students to use and produce English with real tasks relevant to their departments while exploiting the richness of the Internet. It can be further surmised that the use of WebQuests has broader implications in helping students develop better digital literacy, even when English is not their native language. This study introduces the idea of WebQuests and the adaptation of this approach using sample tasks which were developed and piloted at the Modern Languages Division, SFL, EMU. In this article the details in the preparation, design, implementation of WebQuests and the results obtained from teacher and student questionnaires are presented.

Teacher training is another field in which distance education is used widely. Distance education is used for teacher's graduate education as much as teacher's preservice and inservice training at elementary and secondary education level. The main aim of this study is to introduce teacher training programs which have been made through distance education in Turkey between the years of 1986-2005 by Anadolu University Open Education Faculty. For this aim, five teacher education programs at undergraduate compensatory education and undergraduate level used for teacher training for elementary and secondary education were examined in terms of aim, content, teaching-learning process and evaluation. The study indicates that programmes are achieved for different purposes and education is given to big masses in quantity in the beginning.

        "description":"The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of the computer-assisted and computer-based instructional methods on students achievement at computer classes and on their attitudes towards using computers. The study, which was completed in 6 weeks, were carried out with 94 sophomores studying in formal education program of Primary Teaching Department of Education Faculty at Trakya University. The participants were distributed into experimental and control groups by pre-test post-test control group design. A computer attitude scale, a level-designation test and a practice test were used to collect the data. To evaluate the data, t test was used in the program of SPSS 12.00. According to the study results, the students receiving computer-assisted instruction during their computer classes showed higher success on the practice test than the students taking classes with computer-based instructional methods. Additionally,  a considerable difference has not been seen in the attitude of the students towards using computers from the other standpoints of the study. (Contains 1 figure and 4 tables.)

This program was tested for its effectiveness with both low inference as well as high inference observation tools in four studies. Results from these studies show that this minimal training achieved significant improvements on low inference measures of effective discussion and general communicative competence, leading to the identification and validation of effective discussion techniques for teacher training and other settings. Evaluation of the training program in the four and in additional 22 studies was very favorable. (Contains 6 figures and 10 tables.)",

The common shared arguments identified in this study's literature review for using the Deaf Studies curriculum were to empower the deaf students and integrate a Deaf Studies curriculum across various academic subject areas. This study also shows a lack of emphasis on integrating Deaf Studies in any school curriculum due to its limited publications in a literature review of all deaf-related academic journals and other deaf-related periodicals and magazines. The findings from this study led to eight recommendations for the next several courses of action that need to be undertaken to make possible the infusion of the Deaf Studies curriculum into our legislation-dictated (e.g., NCLB) and standards-based deaf education.

        "author":["Salmani-Nodoushan, Mohammad Ali"],
        "description":"Learners of English as a foreign/Second Language (EFL/ESL) can easily learn the correct pronunciation of English words. Linguists have tried to simplify English phonology in general, and English accent in particular, over the past 50 years or so; some scholars have talked about four degrees of primary, secondary, tertiary and weak stress (e.g., Bowen, 1975); some have considered only three degrees of stress: primary, secondary and weak (e.g., Stageberg, 1964) and some have concentrated on two levels of stress: accented vs. unaccented, or stressed vs. unstressed (e.g., Chomsky and Halle, 1968). No one of these scholars, however, has adopted an orthography-based approach to their discussion of English accent. Since orthography or spelling is the most fixed and static way of representing words in English, like in almost any other language, spelling-or orthography-based rules of accent/stress placement can relieve almost any ESL/EFL learner. In this paper, four easy-to-understand spelling-based rules for stress placement are presented which can help EFL/ESL learners to master correct pronunciation of English words. Appended are: (1) Basic Anglo-Saxon; and (2) Most Frequent Latinate Prefixes. (Contains 6 tables.)",

For low-level learners, especially those not in full control of the first 2000 most-frequent words of English, listening may be the fastest route to acquiring a larger, more effective and retained vocabulary. At higher levels, word learning can also be enhanced through exposure to aural input.

Thru a brief look at the initiation of language acquisition in children and the generalizibility to language teaching and learning programs, it is realized that the ego of every learner is the main axis of their language articulation. Plus, as nervousness is an indispensable trait in language production, learners, unconsciously and as one's nature decrees, put themselves at ease by giving egoistic and--at the same time--positive language articulation. These two traits are both looked high upon, but in cases they go hand in hand to make prominent the role of a teacher to have power over this by means of various and ever changing techniques of teaching.

This report looks at the reasons behind students' low performance and what matters for doing well on this test. CPS students are highly motivated to do well on the ACT, and they are spending extraordinary amounts of time preparing for it. Most of the CPS students who took the ACT entered high school with eighth-grade test scores that met state standards and were on par with or better than state and national averages. However, the predominant ways in which students are preparing for the ACT are unlikely to help them do well on the test or to be ready for college-level work. Students are training for the ACT in a last-minute sprint focused on test practice, when the ACT requires years of hard work developing college-level skills. Key findings include: (1) Low ACT scores reflect poor alignment of standards from K-8 to high school and from high school to college; (2) Test strategies and item practice are not effective mechanisms for improving students' ACT scores; (3) ACT performance is directly related to students' performance in their courses; and (4) Incorporating the ACT into high school accountability is not an effective strategy for high school reform by itself, without accompanying strategies to work on instructional practice. Five appendixes include: (1) Sample ACT Questions; (2) Sample PLAN Exam Questions; (3) Content of ACT Math Subject Test as Described in the ACT Teachers' Manual; (4) Statistical Models; and (5) Survey Measures Used in Analyses.

        "author":["Stevens, W. David"],
        "description":"Since 2002 the Consortium on Chicago School Research, in collaboration with the Mills College in Oakland, California, has conducted a series of studies on the Chicago High School Redesign Initiative (CHSRI)--a partnership between Chicago Public Schools (CPS), the Gates Foundation, and local Chicago foundations to create approximately two dozen small high schools across the city. This latest report in the CHSRI series describes the practices and characteristics of CHSRI schools with better than expected freshman-year course performance. Drawing on both qualitative and quantitative indicators across a sample of ten CHSRI schools, our analysis identified three conditions found in schools with comparatively high student achievement: strong teacher professional communities, deep principal leadership, and strong teacher influence. In addition, CHSRI schools with high achievement tended to provide a personalized and supportive environment for their students. Through qualitative fieldwork, we also show how these characteristics work together in high achieving schools. Teacher professional communities that engage in collective work on academic improvement are supported by strong leadership in schools. Involved principal leadership is important for organizing and sustaining collective work, while teacher influence helps make it more relevant for schools' staff. Both of these supporting conditions are necessary to make collective work more meaningful. This work highlights that how adults work together in small schools is a crucial factor in raising student achievement. In particular, it suggests that collective work on improving instruction is a key lever for raising achievement. In addition, it points to the benefits of balancing the direction and initiative provided by principals with teacher voice and leadership. Given that reducing size does not automatically lead to such developments, however, schools will need to intentionally focus on creating these key organizational characteristics.

This study examined the viewing habits and personal opinions of Turkish Cypriot children. The participants were 250 children and adolescents whose ages varied between 4-17. This study revealed that children and adolescents are spending most of their time in front of the TV. Besides most of them admire a character and want to act like their famous character. It is one of the most important finding of some certain studies about the role of television on socialisation and shaping values.  In this study, viewing habits and personal opinions of children and adolescents are revealed. From that point of view, some suggestions are put forward in order to benefit more from TV. Also a comparison about viewing habits, effects of watching TV is made between other cultures and Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. (Contains 2 footnotes and 11 tables.)",

Gained results are in favor of convictions that view note taking as an effective learning strategy. At least it was more effective than concept mapping in the experiments of the present study. A possible reason for this is that students benefited from their notes by recapitulating lesson contents whereas concept maps were not used in such a way. This assumption is supported by other experimental evidence that ascribe the advantages of note taking to its function as external memory store that helps students to better process lesson contents.

For this reason, a digital portfolio assessment rubric was prepared in order to evaluate students' drawing and story writing works. For the validity and reliability analyze was applied to 52 high school students. According to analyzes, the digital portfolio assessment rubric, which is valid and reliable, can be used in order to evaluate students' drawing and writing performance. For the application of program, an experimental and a control group were used in the study. The study was conducted during 4 months. The data was gathered 52 students, 17 in the experimental groups and 35 in the control groups. Digital portfolio assessment process was used in the experimental group and traditional assessment plan was used in the control group. In both groups students were wanted to engage drawing and writing. Results indicate that no significant differences (p greater than .05) were found on drawing and writing performances pre-test scores of the groups but a significant difference (p less than .05) were found in favor of experimental group in post-test scores of both groups.

This study employed an &quot;attitude scale&quot; to provide insights into the prospective pre-school pre-service and their cooperating teachers' attitudes towards the use of technology in the classroom. A 36 item, 5-point Likert-type scale was administered to all entry level preschool pre-service student teachers (n = 160) enrolled in the Faculty of Education of Selcuk University during the 2005-2006 academic year and their preschool cooperating teachers (n = 100) working in Konya. Results indicated that significant differences exist between pre-service and their cooperating preschool teachers from their &quot;views on the use of educational technology&quot;, &quot;use of activities in preschool classes&quot; and &quot;use of educational technology in preschool classes&quot;. Implications for pre-service and cooperating teacher education and further research are discussed. (Contains 9 tables.) [Abstract included in Turkish.]",

One option is already being moved forward: Pursuing the improved state-level collaboration toward which legislation AB 365 (Postsecondary education: Task Force on State Workforce Needs: California Community Colleges Economic and Workforce Development Program) was targeted. Several options may be relatively low on the state's policy &quot;radar screen,&quot; but provide opportunities for Commission initiatives. In priority order, these options include: (1) Compiling and disseminating &quot;Best Practices&quot;; (2) Aligning system and campus research and planning; (3) Increasing focus on Career development; and (4) Better articulating the role of postsecondary general education. Finally, about half of the recommended policy options are now being pursued by postsecondary education stakeholders and others in the state; these should be monitored and supported rather than prioritized for immediate Commission action, especially in light of limited resources. These options include: (1) Improving and linking data; (2) Encouraging regional strategies; (3) Improving alignment with K-12 education; (4) Strengthening career technical education; and (5) Securing adequate resources.",

        "description":"In June 2006, the California Postsecondary Education Commission adopted an Accountability Framework for Higher Education, consisting of four goals and 17 measures for evaluating the performance of public higher education in California. The initial series of reports from the framework presented a variety of information on the affordability of postsecondary education, access to colleges and universities, and success and progress of students. In addition, the first year of reporting offered insight to how well the framework measured the performance of California's higher education system and what needs to be done to make it more useful. Key issues identified during the first year of reporting include: (1) Statewide goals must strike a balance between clearly defining the desired direction for higher education performance and being too prescriptive or narrowly stated; (2) Some goals may innately be in conflict with one another; (3) Performance indicators should be few in number; and (4) A successful framework and reporting is dependent on reliable and complete data sources. In order to create a clearer, more concise framework, the process has been revised to include four primary areas of assessment: (1) Preparation; (2) Student Success; (3) Affordability; and (4) Public Benefit. The revised framework offers greater simplicity while providing robustness in evaluation. After analysis in the coming months to determine best methods for assessment and formal adoption of the proposed measures, staff will begin the next round of performance assessment.",

In 2006-07, federally funded adult education programs met nine of 11 performance targets. This is a substantial improvement from 2005-06, when only three out of 11 performance targets were met.

This program is part of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), and continues the work that began as the Eisenhower Teacher Professional Development Program more than two decades ago. In recent years, the program has evolved into an effort that focuses on major priorities in K-12 education, and seeks to evaluate whether the professional development being offered actually affects teacher practice and student achievement. This report provides an update on current grants, project activities, a recent Project Directors meeting, publication of a research field guide to help with evaluation of the projects, and the 2008 Request for Proposals process. The ITQ program benefits California educators by fostering partnership between colleges and universities and K-12 educators, and emphasizing sustained, site-based, teacher-driven, collaborative professional development that has shown itself to be effective.",

        "description":"Educational centers serve a number of purposes. Foremost, they are a more cost-effective way of meeting increased student demand than building costly comprehensive full-service campuses. Educational centers also promote shared facility use and intersegmental collaboration, which enables higher education systems to use resources more efficiently. Educational centers can increase learning productivity because students can spend more time engaged in learning and less time traveling to classes at a main campus. Public colleges and universities can also use educational centers to expand access in rural and remote areas. Rural centers are especially beneficial when universities and community colleges have large service areas that include significant rural and remote areas. This report clarifies the California Postsecondary Education Commission's review process, and provides analyses supporting a recommendation that further study be undertaken jointly by the Commission and the Chancellor's Office before proposed revisions to regulations governing community college educational centers are finalized. The proposed revisions would impact the full-time equivalent student (FTES) threshold for educational centers, and exceptions to that threshold. Calculating FTES for Educational Planning Purposes is appended. (Contains 3 figures.)",

        "description":"Shifting focus from typical data and information about the status of educational achievement in the United States and about gaps in achievement among the nation's students, this report undertakes investigation of less-frequently-asked questions. As required by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), educators are continuously monitoring whether more or fewer students are scoring at a level termed &quot;proficient.&quot; The authors examine what is happening to both top-performing and lower-performing students and how the distribution of scores is changing in the United States, and make a case for measuring growth throughout the school year, rather than the end. NCLB also requires that states provide information about gaps in student performance among racial/ethnic groups. The report contends that different states have established different definitions of what it means to be proficient, and cautions about comparing numbers across states. The authors discuss changes in the demographic characteristics of the student population over the past several decades, and how these changes have affected national test scores. Acknowledging that the world is increasingly competitive, the authors conclude by presenting a case for an understandable, summative view of where U.S. students rank globally, by summarizing results from international assessments, which vary by participating countries, subjects assessed, and grades and ages covered. The authors advocate that there are many aspects of achievement that require further review and research by parents, educators, policymakers, researchers, and the media. Three appendixes are included: (1) Changes in Four NAEP Reading Measures, Grade 8, 2002 to 2007; (2) Changes in Four NAEP Mathematics Measures, Grade 8, 2000 to 2007; and (3) Regression Analysis Used for Predicting Eighth-Grade NAEP Reading Proficiency.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to identify the concerns of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career changers to better inform teacher education programs on how to best address their unique needs. We identified three career-changers with former STEM-related careers, each seeking a secondary teaching credential in biology and currently enrolled in a post-baccalaureate fifth-year secondary-level credential program. Data were collected using a variety of qualitative methods including open-ended interviews and non-participant observations. Teaching portfolios (including employment resumes and program assignments and lesson plans) and academic transcripts were also collected. Qualitative data were analyzed by organizing the data into topics, codes, and then categories based upon predetermined themes from the research questions and emergent themes from the data set. A case for each career changer was then developed and further analyzed for similarities and differences. This study raises questions about designing alternative certification programs exclusively for second career teachers. The findings of this study in several ways agreed with other literature on the reluctance of career-changers to become students again; however, this study presented an alternate picture as well. Two of the three study participants expressed initial misgivings about their needs to enter a credential program because of either their previous experiences in working with youth or teaching at the university level. However, by the end of the first semester of student teaching, all three saw the value in learning about students especially when working with diverse student populations. In conclusion, we found that these STEM career changers benefited by entering the teaching profession alongside more traditional peers in the credential program. A longer term and future goal is to follow these individuals into their teaching careers to determine if their collegial experiences inthe credential program are related to the development of their teacher identity and what impact that may have on their success in the classroom and on teacher retention.",

A test and a questionnaire were administered to 1838 undergraduate freshmen from five major institutes of higher education in Aguascalientes, Mexico. The results of the test are analysed in their association with main features of previous educational studies, as well as with students' exposure to language in and outside formal education. This research replies the one carried out by Gonzalez, Vivaldo y Castillo (2004). The results obtained for the case of Aguascalientes are higher than those reported by these authors in relation to Mexico City. Although, both cases point out an unacceptable situation: majority of freshmen do not satisfy a basic level of LCE. The type of previous institutions was identified as the main factor associated with LCE: Students who attended public schools observe disadvantages in comparison to students who accomplished previous levels at private schools. As there is a pattern of continuity in the type of schools, the students who enrolled in a private higher education institute got significant CLE scores than those who attended a public one. The results show that English language teaching and learning, not only in public schools but also in private ones, requires urgently dealing with aspects of quality, more than those related to quantity.

The A-PLUS Act of 2007 (Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success) will revitalize education by allowing states flexibility in spending their federal education dollars while still requiring accountability to parents and taxpayers. The A-PLUS Act will restore the principles of federalism to public education. States should have the option to stay under the No Child Left Behind regime or choose to have the flexibility in policymaking while maintaining transparency for results.

The increase in access in higher education in America largely came before massive federal involvement in student financial aid programs. Evidence suggests that federal subsidies for student aid may be counterproductive. Modest provision of financial assistance serves to increase the proportion of college graduates in society, but a vast financial aid effort such as we have had in recent years has actually had a negative impact on that ratio. Importantly, evidence suggests that increasing subsidies for higher education has contributed to inflation of college costs. As a long-term objective, the federal government should largely exit the higher education business. Shorter-term, lawmakers should oppose vast increases in student-aid  programs.

The MSA arose out of a number of separate state lawsuits against tobacco manufacturers seeking reimbursement for their Medicaid and other smoking-related health costs. States and communities have used MSA payments to support out-of-school time programs, literacy initiatives, and school health services; often linking these investments to broader state MSA priorities, such as tobacco control or health promotion. This policy brief provides an update on the use of MSA payments across the 46 states party to the agreement; highlights the unique opportunity provided by the increased payments under the Strategic Contribution Fund; and offers strategies for policymakers, community and program leaders to access MSA funds for youth programs.

        "description":"Using an experimental research design, this project investigated the effects of teacher read-alouds when students did, and did not, have access to companion texts. Based on Connectionist theory, the researchers hypothesized that students in the Companion Text group would outperform students in the Listen Only group on the three examined variables: reading achievement gains, vocabulary scores, and comprehension scores. Twenty, Caucasian second graders from a NJ suburban classroom were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. The IRI (Burns & Roe, 2002) was used as a pre-and post-test to measure reading achievement gains during the intervention. Additionally, teacher-made comprehension tests and vocabulary were administered for all texts. Students listened to teacher read-alouds for fifteen minutes a day, three times a week, for 12 weeks. All students simultaneously heard the teacher read-aloud, although students in the Companion Text condition sat on one side of the classroom rug while students in the Listen Only condition sat on the other. Results of independent t-tests indicated that students in the Listen Only group had significantly greater reading achievement gains following the 12-week intervention than students in the Companion Text group. Analyses of the comprehension and vocabulary measures did not reveal significant differences between the conditions. Results did not support the hypothesis and suggest that, for young children, companion texts during read-alouds may interfere with, rather than facilitate, reading achievement. Further investigation of this phenomenon is warranted as contradicting results have been reported at upper grade levels.",

It describes practices that have led to allegations and findings of fraud and abuse in the student loan system, and recent federal and state legislative and administrative responses. The report was requested by Assembly member Sally Lieber in order to better understand the national student loan scandal and responses to it. (Contains 9 charts, 4 tables, and 136 endnotes.)",

        "author":["Julianelle, Patricia F."],
        "description":"The California Research Bureau (CRB), in participation with the California Council on Youth Relations (CCYR), and with support from The California Wellness Foundation, has been conducting a major research and policy initiative to bring attention to the issues facing homeless youth in California. These include lack of shelter and educational opportunities, health and mental health needs, and problematic interaction with law enforcement agencies and the courts. This report represents one of the research components of this project. Homelessness places youth at extreme risk of victimization and violence. Youth living in public places are often victims of physical and sexual assaults and robberies. Some youth are forced to engage in \"survival sex\" in exchange for shelter, food, or money. Crowded living situations and exposure to the elements lead to higher rates of illness, and the mental and emotional stress of homelessness leads to increased risks of substance abuse, depression, and even suicide. Given this context, school can be an oasis for homeless youth, where they can find security and support and obtain the skills they need to survive safely on their own. Yet, three-fourths of California homeless youth surveyed by the CRB were not in school. Most of the 54 youth surveyed were between 17 and 24, yet very few (six) had graduated from high school or attained a GED. This data is consistent with national surveys of homeless youth on their own. At the same time, a majority of California youth surveyed expressed the desire to return to school and had life goals (such as becoming a teacher or social worker or working in the medical field) that require extensive education to achieve. This report discusses seven key issues related to challenges homeless youth face in achieving their educational goals. It also presents policy options that address these challenges. A list of resources is included. Appended are: (1) Education Contacts for Homeless Children and Youth; and (2)Education Funding for Homeless Children and Youth. (Contains 112 endnotes.)",

This study focuses on specific concerns about postsecondary education access in three geographically diverse areas of the state: suburban Macomb County; the city of Saginaw; and six rural counties in the northeastern Lower Peninsula. The report provides a summary of findings regarding access to higher education in each of the three areas and proposes broad recommendations and policy alternatives to address the challenges of access to postsecondary degrees and institutions statewide. While findings from the three regions varied due to differing demographic and geographic conditions, a number of consistent patterns were found, including concerns about the affordability of a college education; poor public transportation systems; a lack of easily accessible four-year institutions; and, above all, the need to develop a college-going culture among Michigan residents.

        "description":"This monograph details the process Building Engagement and Attainment for Minority Students (BEAMS) institutions used to craft data-driven action plans to improve student success. More than 100 four-year Historically Black, Hispanic-Serving, and Tribal colleges and universities participated in the five-year program that produced best practices available for replication by institutions across the nation. Among the key findings and practices that have emerged for successful data collection and use include: (1) align data collection methods with institutional capacity; (2) draw on available internal and external resources; (3)  develop a framework to interpret data results. Certain practices have emerged during the BEAMS project that have led to short-term successes in identifying campus concerns and  implementing action plans: (1) establishing a strong team; (2) linking BEAMS work with a larger campus initiative; and (3) building support from senior administration, faculty, and  staff. The monograph recommends that institutions must make greater technology and staff  investments in their institutional research and assessment offices.  State systems must continue to support and encourage data capacity building at their institutions.  A report is needed to document the data capacity status of Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). Finally, investments are needed to build the capacity of MSIs to collect, analyze, and use data for institutional decision making and accountability efforts. Lists of BEAMS Participating Campuses and BEAMS Consultants are appended. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)",

        "description":"The elimination of student overcrowding--the objective in writing this report and the objective in seeking reforms of the school facilities construction process--must be the top priority for the city in the next decade. The premise of this report is that much of the planning process for building and repairing schools requires fundamental change, not a hunt for villains or merely a change in who builds the schools. If non educational objectives continue to guide key decision makers, a decade's worth of future investments in school facilities could result in very little improvement in the instructional environment for children by 2010. After three years of interviews, visits to newly constructed schools, and a review of funding for capital projects, the Educational Priorities Panel (EPP) has arrived at the surprising conclusion that, despite the possibility of mismanagement and fraud, neither one is the central problem. There are no villains, rather, a confluence of parochial politics and narrowly focused strategies of facilities and budget staff. The result is fewer new schools and a perpetuation of student overcrowding. This report proposes that the capital budget for the schools be split into three distinct capital budgets so that there is no &quot;drift&quot; between priorities and funds for ending overcrowding are protected. Second, two of these capital budgets should be based on objective formulas of each school district's overcrowding problem and need for capital repairs. And third, it recommends a process for planning that ensures decision making by district and school staff as well as parents. The following appendixes are included: (1) Overcrowding in the New York City Primary Schools in 1989 and 2001; (2) School Construction from 1989 to 2001; (3) Map of Community School Districts; and (4) State Building Aid Claims and Formula-Generated Aid Amounts.

Funds are designed to assist the Institute in expanding its leadership role in creating an informed and educated citizenry, and transmitting the values of American democracy. In recent years the Institute has strategically invested in the nation's libraries and museums to enable them to build the capacity of their facilities, digital infrastructure, staff expertise, and collections so that they can better meet the educational and cultural needs of the nation. The President's 2008 Budget proposes to entrust IMLS with new responsibilities for core library data collection activities and a strengthened policy advisory role, specifically, by assuming a more active role in information policy analysis and development, identifying models of best practice for library and museum operations, and analyzing and sharing trends. In FY 2008, IMLS will incorporate the policy advisory role and other activities of the National Commission on Library and Information Sciences and assume responsibility for collecting public library and state library data currently under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics. IMLS will also pilot the collection of statistical data from the nation's museums.

The intent this time is to look at the broad picture. The NYS Education Department reports student test data for these students, but the Department's funding analysis does not. The Educational Priorities Panel wanted to evaluate how districts with a majority of African-American and Latino students fared in funding and expenditures. This bottom-line analysis looked at seven measurements: (1) increases in per-pupil state aid and per-pupil total expenditures from the 1995-96 school year to the 2000-01 school year, a time of robust increase in state school  aid during a time of a good New York State economy; (2) a comparison of instructional expenditures for general education students and for special education students in the 2000-01 school year; (3) increases in Building Aid to school districts during this same period; (4) local tax effort for public schools during this same period; (5) a comparison of 2002-03 estimated state aid to 2003-04 estimated state aid, when overall school district funding was reduced because of the weak national and state economy; (6) a comparison of student achievement on test scores in the 1997-98 school year and the 2001-02 school year on the state's fourth and eighth grade English Language Arts and Math tests; and (7) student access to schools where a majority of students are testing at or above grade level at the fourth and eighth grades. It is important to note that this report's analysis is limited to school districts based on their funding and expenditure levels and their average performance on standardized tests. This report's measurements reflect how districts serving a majority of African-American and Latino students are faring, but not how African-American and Latino students are faring within these districts, which would take a significantly more detailed analysis.

        "description":"This newsletter summarizes an IES practice guide titled \"Organizing Instruction and Study to Improve Student Learning,\" which aims to supplement and inform teachers' instincts and experiences by identifying research-based instructional strategies that teachers of all content areas can use to improve student learning. The practice guide makes seven recommendations: (1) space learning over time; (2) interleave worked example solutions with problem-solving exercises; (3) combine graphics with verbal descriptions; (4) connect and integrate abstract and concrete representations of concepts; (5) use quizzing to promote learning; (6) help students allocate study time efficiently; and (7) ask deep explanatory questions. The strategies of encouraging students to become more metacognitive and asking deep-level questions go hand in hand. The ultimate goal is for students to learn to ask themselves and their peers deep-level questions in order to assess and build their own deep understanding of mathematics.

        "description":"The examination of historical trend data on the number and percent of students lost from public school enrollment prior to graduation from high school is becoming increasingly important since distinct trends are emerging on a regional basis. This study examines regional trends in Texas on the number and percent of students lost from public high school enrollment prior to graduation with a high school diploma. A comparative analysis of 1985-86, 2005-06 and 2006-07 attrition rates in Texas' 20 education service center (ESC) regions shows that eight Texas regions have persistently higher rates of losing students from public school enrollment. Education service center regions with traditionally high attrition rates include: ESC Region 1 (Edinburg), ESC Region 4 (Houston), ESC Region 10 (Richardson), ESC Region 13 (Austin), ESC Region 19 (El Paso), and ESC Region 20 (San Antonio). The highest attrition rates are primarily concentrated in regions with the largest student enrollment counts, particularly those in urban areas and those with the largest low-income and minority populations. Schools and communities in Texas and nationwide must work together to improve school holding power and student success. (Contains 12 exhibits.)",

This fact sheet presents statistics on immigrants and higher education in New York, describes how New York state policymakers and advocacy groups recognize the needs of immigrant students, and shows how the City University of New York (CUNY) plays an important role in access to higher education for immigrants. The fact sheet recommends: (1) that increased support is needed for programs that address the barriers experienced by immigrants seeking a college education; (2) the creation of more transparent financial aid and college application processes, including widespread dissemination of information, resources, and contacts; and (3) the creation of state, local, and institutional policies that target the differing needs of various immigrant populations.

Although this balanced approach can not be interpreted monolithically, due to the various ways that whole language and phonics can be taught and combined, learning to read fluently functions as its intrinsic goal. Such a goal, moreover, implies that learning evolves through strategies. Central to this article is the assertion that Siegler's overlapping waves theory and microgenetic analysis can be employed to gauge children's learning, or acquisition of strategies, within a balanced reading instruction framework. Implications regarding how classroom instructional procedures employing Sielger's work exert their effects on balanced instruction are discussed.",

        "description":"The number of charter schools has grown rapidly from 250 in 1995 to about 4,000 by 2007, now enrolling more than 1.1 million students in the United States. Charter schools face many challenges when they attempt to purchase or lease permanent facilities and frequently operate in temporary space that is poorly suited for delivering educational services. Unlike regular public schools, they typically do not have separate facilities funding from their school districts. Moreover, charter schools generally cannot issue bonds backed by property taxes to finance facilities. Finally, since charter schools often lack tangible assets and an operating history that could be used to support a loan application, securing facilities financing may be particularly problematic. In response to this problem, the U.S. Department of Education established the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities Program, which makes available grants on a competitive basis to eligible entities which use Program funds for credit enhancements so that lenders will make loans for: (1) Acquisition of an interest in improved or unimproved real property that is necessary to commence or continue the operation of a charter school; and (2) Construction of new facilities, or the renovation, repair, or alteration of existing facilities, necessary to commence or continue the operation of a charter school. The purposes of this study are to describe how the Grantees implemented their activities, as outlined in their Program document. Findings include: (1) the Program provides for improved access of charter schools to capital markets for facilities (Credit enhancements funded by the Program reduce lenders' exposure to losses in the event that a charter school defaults on its loan, improving charter schools' access to capital markets and resulting in more lending than would have occurred without the Program); (2) the Program provides for better rates and terms on financing than would otherwise be available for the charter schools served by the Program Grantees (Many of the assisted schools, according to representatives of Grantees, commercial lenders, investment banks, and rating agencies, would not have received facility loans at any price before the Program, because lenders believed that these schools reflected a prohibitively high level of risk); (3) Results regarding the differences between a Vertically Integrated model and a Fully Distributed model of service are preliminary: analysis does not provide conclusive evidence that favors one model over another, but data suggest that both models of service play a significant role in facilitating capital investment in charter schools that otherwise would not be able to secure conventional financing (lending volume to date may be lower for Grantees using a Vertically Integrated model of service, but they appear more willing to serve slightly more risky charter schools than those supported by the credit enhancements provided by Grantees using a Fully Distributed model); (4) Grantees used selection criteria to choose assisted schools that include: extent to which the applicant selects geographic service areas in which a large proportion or number of public schools have been identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring; extent to which the applicant selects geographic service areas in which a large proportion of students perform below proficient on state academic assessments; and extent to which the applicant selected communities to serve with large proportions of low-income students; (5) Based on a review of loan-level data and information provided by Grantees and assisted schools, there was evidence that Grantees are using innovative methods, especially related to helping charter schools borrow directly from private lenders; and (6) Overall, the Grantees and assisted schools were highly positive about the Program and believe that it is making a difference in the market. Five appendixes are included: (1) Glossary of Terms; (2) Interviews Conducted; (3) Discussion Guides; (4) Characteristics of Census Tracts and Counties in Which High Schools Assisted by Grantees between FY 2003 and FY 2005 Were Located; and (5) Program Grant Recipients: FY 2002-FY 2007.

The report uses data from state-level interviews, from surveys of a nationally representative sample of district officials, principals, and teachers, surveys of parents in eight school districts, surveys of supplemental educational service providers in 16 districts, and student-level demographic and achievement data in nine districts, to examine the implementation across the country of the school choice and supplemental educational service components of Title I through 2004-05. This report addresses three broad areas in evaluating the Title I provisions for providing school choice and supplemental services for students in low-performing schools: (1) Who is eligible to participate in parental school choice and supplemental educational services under Title I of &quot;NCLB,&quot; what choices are made available, and who participates? (2) How are states, districts and schools providing information to make parents aware of their options? What information do parents have and use to make decisions about their school choice and supplemental service options? and (3) How do states, districts, and schools support, monitor, and collaborate in the implementation of supplemental educational services under Title I?

        "description":"Although many may think that a child learns to read in kindergarten or first grade, research indicates that learning to read and write can start at home, long before children go to school. Children can start down the road to becoming readers from the day they are born. Very early, children begin to learn about spoken language when they hear family members talking, laughing, and singing, and when they respond to the sounds that fill their world. They begin to understand written language when they hear adults read stories to them and see adults reading newspapers, magazines, and books for themselves. These early experiences with spoken and written language set the stage for children to become successful readers and writers. This booklet is targeted to parents, grandparents and caregivers, supplying ideas for playing, talking, and reading with young children that will help them become good readers and writers later in life. No special training or expensive materials are required. For babies and toddlers, simple language games and activities can be incorporated into the everyday routine. For preschoolers, parents are urged to keep in touch with teachers so that they know what children are learning in school and can support that learning at home. This booklet contains: (1) Summary of what scientific research says about how children learn to read and write; (2) Things to do with children from birth through age 2 to help them become readers; and (3) Things to do with children between the ages 3-4 and what to look for in quality day care centers and preschools to help children become readers. Parents are urged to keep it simple and have fun, incorporating activities into a caring parent-child relationship. A glossary, bibliography and a list of suggested additional resources are included.

        "description":"This paper presents a picture of risk and challenge for youth in distressed communities and outlines how these communities can band together to create a continuum of supportive activities to bolster youth's success in school and life. As youth grow and develop, individualized support and exposure to new experiences has a significant impact on their life trajectory. Youth in economically distressed communities deserve to have access to these types of opportunities, which are much more readily available to their peers in other communities. This investment in youth can have a positive effect on academic success, future life earnings, family stability, and the livelihood of the community. This paper may be helpful in guiding a community's thinking about how to get started in creating a sustainable support system for all of its youth. Data from ten communities across the country are used in this paper to highlight the magnitude of the challenges faced by youth growing up in these cities. The ten cities highlighted in this paper are: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Oakland, and Philadelphia. These cities represent both areas of the country traditionally labeled as \"distressed,\" as well as others where problems are more masked because the community appears to be thriving. The statistics in these ten communities show a highly distressing situation for the youth who live there. More than one in three live in poverty--twice the national average.

        "title":"What is Known about the Impact of Financial Aid? Implications for Policy. An NCPR Working Paper",
        "author":["Long, Bridget Terry"],
        "description":"Years of research support the notion that financial aid can influence students' postsecondary decisions, but questions remain about the best ways to design and implement such programs and policies. This paper serves as a discussion of the research literature on the effectiveness of financial aid with special attention to its implications for policy. As such, the goal of this paper is to address issues central to today's debates about how to improve college access and affordability while encouraging researchers to continue to advance the line of inquiry. Following an introduction, Section 2 of this paper gives a summary of the costs of higher education as well as an overview of current financial aid policy and the degree to which students' financial needs are currently being met. Section 3 discusses what families know about financial aid and the role of information in the federal application process for aid. Sections 4 and 5 review the long literature on the effects of financial aid on student behavior by examining the role of grants, loans, and other forms of financial aid. Section 6 focuses on the behavior of colleges and universities in reaction to financial aid policy. It addresses concerns about the Bennett Hypothesis, the notion that colleges raise their prices when aid becomes more generous. Finally, Section 7 concludes by summarizing the main points. It also discusses the growing debate about the degree to which financial aid can address the barriers to college access and success. The paper concludes by outlining several major issues that need additional research and by discussing how the research could be made more policy relevant.

        "author":["Gasbarra, Paul",
          "Johnson, Jean"],
        "description":"In many respects, Hispanic families share the aspirations and anxieties of many other families nationwide: They are keenly focused on the role completing high school and going to college will play in their children's future. Students and young adults see success in school and college as key to interesting work and a prosperous future, and most are optimistic about their prospects. Yet Hispanic parents, students and young adults also describe concerns, ideas, approaches and relationships with the public school system in ways that are sometimes distinctive. This brief, graphical summary, based on Public Agenda surveys taken over the last few years, lays out the chief differences and similarities. Summarized findings are taken from three different Public Agenda reports: (1) \"Life after High School: Young People Talk about Their Hopes and Prospects\" (2005); (2) \"Reality Check 2006\" series; and (3) \"Squeeze Play: How the Public and Parents--White, African-American and Hispanic--View Higher Education\" (2007). Unless otherwise indicated, analysis compares results from Hispanic respondents with those from all other populations combined. Reported findings include: (1) Hispanic parents place a very high value on college, and they are more likely than other parents to believe that a college degree is necessary for a decent job and middle-class life; (2) Most Hispanic parents trust and respect educators; they are more likely than other parents to believe that teachers and school officials are doing a good job in many key areas; (3) Despite their respect for educators, Hispanic parents are substantially more likely to say that a lack of resources and dropout rates are \"very serious\" problems at local schools; (4) Hispanic parents are more likely to question whether local schools are preparing their children for high school, teaching English quickly and effectively and offering strong math and science education; (5) Hispanic parents are considerably more likely than parents in general to voice concerns about safety and discipline in local schools; (6) Hispanic parents voice strong support for continuing to raise standards and other measures to improve high schools, but they are somewhat more concerned than other parents about toughening requirements for a high school diploma; (7) Hispanic middle school and high school students, like other students nationwide, voice many positive views about their schools and teachers; (8) Hispanic students confirm many of the key problems their parents see in local schools; (9) Most Hispanic young adults say their parents and teachers encourage them to go to college and that their friends respect people with college degrees; however, they are considerably less likely to have friends who are going to college; and (10) Hispanic young adults are more likely to voice concerns about getting enough money to go to college.

        "description":"In summer and fall of 2007, Public Agenda completed five focus groups with principals in high-needs districts and sixteen one-on-one interviews with superintendents and other high-ranking education officials including a state superintendent of education. Interviews followed a systematic interview guide revolving around two broad questions: (1) What makes an effective leader in a high-needs school? and (2) How can we attract, train, retain and support more effective leaders of this kind? Based on this qualitative research, twelve insights are outlined as a way to promote discussion about how to define, advance and find more effective leadership for high-needs schools: (1) Transformers versus Copers; (2) Instructional Leadership--Talk versus Action; (3) \"Walking the Halls\"; (4) Drinking in the Data--Not Drowning in It; (5) Parent Involvement; (6) Shaking Things Up versus Consensus-Building; (7) Recruiting from the Farm Team; (8) What Money Can Buy--and What It Can't; (9) Most Current Training? Irrelevant; (10) Mentors--What They Can Teach and What They Can't; (11) Want to Help Me Out? Cut the Red Tape; and (12) Just Let Me Focus on my Job. Acknowledged limitations of the study include its small-scale exploratory nature, a lack of independent analysis of student achievement in the schools and districts where leaders were interviewed, and under-representation of middle schools and high schools.

        "description":"Learning communities are a popular strategy that community colleges nationwide have embraced in support of developmental students. In a learning community, a cohort of students takes two or more courses linked by integrated themes and assignments that are developed through ongoing faculty collaboration. While the number of learning community programs continues to grow, rigorous studies measuring their effectiveness are limited. To address this need for evidence, the Learning Communities demonstration, launched in 2007, uses random assignment to test models of learning communities at six community colleges: Kingsborough Community College, Queensborough Community College, Hillsborough Community College, Merced College, Houston Community College System, and Community College of Baltimore County. The study is designed to determine: (1) how learning communities can be designed to address the needs of academically underprepared students; (2) the effects of learning communities on student achievement, as measured by test scores, credits earned, and grades; (3) the effects of learning communities on students' persistence in higher education; and (4) what learning communities cost and how these costs compare with the costs of standard college programs for students with low basic skills. Preliminary findings will be available in 2009. This working paper describes the study's design, including a summary of the theoretical and empirical research relevant to learning communities, descriptions of the sites and their learning community models, the random assignment procedures, and plans for data analysis.

        "description":"Hispanics are one of the largest and fastest-growing minority groups in the United States. Projections indicate a need for an increase of 20% of practicing engineers by 2010. Despite the growing number of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) careers in the American economy, education statistics suggest that too few Hispanic students are being encouraged and equipped to take advantage of opportunities in technical disciplines. American business and industry and the nation's Hispanic communities would both benefit from addressing this mismatch. In summer 2007, the IBM International Foundation asked Public Agenda to interview Hispanic and Latino leaders in a variety of fields, asking for their views on what will be needed to bring more Hispanic students into the technical and scientific disciplines. This report is based on 19 30-minute telephone interviews conducted in the summer and fall of 2007. Public Agenda spoke with Hispanic scientists and inventors, officers at technology corporations, leaders from prominent non-profit and corporate entities, as well as government and educational institutions. Each interviewee had a strong interest in Hispanic and Latino affairs and was able to speak on the challenges of improving math and science education for Hispanic students. Primary observations included: (1) Socio-economic conditions of many Hispanics. Most saw poverty and poor schools as a primary, first-order-of-business barrier; (2) Schools in poorer urban areas with a high concentration of Hispanics tend to have a lower quality of education, poor bilingual education programs, high dropout rates and inadequate curricula; (3) Potential jeopardies to learning such as illegal immigration that may undercut a child's ability to learn, even when they do have access to better schools with better teachers and courses; (4) Barriers caused by need to master academics in a non-native language, and an associated high drop-out rate; (5) Specific failures in the way math and science are taught, on top of the over-arching educational failures; (6) Need for more Hispanic role models in the STEM fields; (7) Traditional gender roles continue to discourage young Hispanic women from pursuing careers of their own, particularly in STEM fields; (8) Limited parental educational attainment and traditional conceptions of the school's role in childhood development can have a variety of effects on the success of education; (9) Obstacles to college caused by poor preparation and/or lack of financial resources; and (10) Need for strong mentorship, faculty support and study groups to mitigate pressures on first-generation college students. All of the scientists and business people, government officials, community organizers and advocates voiced enthusiasm for the goal of bringing many more Hispanic and Latino youngsters into the scientific and technical disciplines. But many also pointed to a long road ahead. A list of interviewees is included. (Contains 6 footnotes.",

Flaws and inaccuracies were examined and discussed. The results showed that researchers used inconsistent, inaccurate, incomplete, and flawed measuring methods in determining high school graduation rates in the U.S. The conclusion was that a more uniform, consistent, and accurate measuring method was needed to produce accurate, consistent, and reliable graduation rates. In future research on graduation rates, researchers and educators must rely on a consistent, uniform, and accurate method of measurement. [Appended is a PowerPoint presentation.]",

        "author":["Heppler, Brad"],
        "description":"This is a book about quality and how to control quality through deliberate actions on the part of the professionals developing and implementing the instances of instruction available at an organization. Quality control theory favors no particular learning philosophy and is only directed towards aspects of how, what, where and when measurements are collected on instruction and upon how these measurements are leveraged in order to maintain and improve the efficacy of instruction. Measurements must contain less than 3% inaccuracy due to the three main sources of inaccuracy: (1) Content Sampling; (2) Mis-classification; and (3) Guessing. Combined measurement errors related to repeatability and reproducibility must be 10% or less of the range of measurements expected in the implementation environment. Having all measurement meet these rigorous standards is of critical importance and is covered in Chapters 2 and 3. When quality control methodology is applied to the courses offered by a specific organization, the result is a quality control program. Quality control methodology involves the repeated application of a series of statistical techniques that have proven useful historically for quality improvement activities. These techniques are introduced in Chapter 1. The quality control program becomes the summation of the organizations efforts at collecting and using measurements in order to establish, maintain and improve the efficacy of instruction. Implementing a quality control program that lacks rigor will result in additional costs without realizing the expected gains. Cost efficiency is an integral aspect of quality and is therefore a key focal point. Lack of rigor is the overwhelming reason for failure of quality control programs. Establishing and maintaining quality is accomplished through extensive monitoring of ongoing quality. When measurements are graphed as one or more time series, the monitoring function generates signals that indicate when quality has slipped and requires actions that restore quality to the previous level. A second role of the monitoring function is to validate improvement efforts made to instruction using signals such as a persistent upward shift in one or more relevant time series. The monitoring function is of little value without high quality measurements. The monitoring function is the topic of Chapter 6. An almost universal experience for organizations applying quality control methodology to an existing courses is that the reliability of these courses will have been dramatically overestimated. Reliability is the ability of a course to produce acceptable performance for all students in the population of interest. Reliability is the topic of Chapter 5. Quality control theory provides concrete rationales for defining acceptable performance and these are the topics of Chapter 4. Upon encountering low reliability, there is a tendency to recoil from quality control implementation as if measuring the outcomes of existing instruction caused the results. Do not become discouraged, the road to excellence is long and challenging. (Contains 10 figures and 39 tables.)",

As program developers and administrators demand fidelity when commercial programs are implemented, teachers are left with difficult decisions about how to meet the needs of their students when programs fail to live up to their promises. This paper examines the evidentiary sleight of hand techniques--misdirection, palming the evidence, and the shell game--practiced by program developers assuming dual roles of promoter and evaluator and the difficulties public school administrators face as they evaluate the effectiveness of commercial reading programs.",

The central report, \"A Call to Action: Changing the Culture of Drinking at U.S. Colleges,\" has proven influential in the college alcohol and other drug (AOD) prevention and treatment field. Statistics first introduced in the report are now routinely used to convey the magnitude of college drinking problems and their consequences. Policymakers, legal experts, and organizations that provide college programming assistance have modified their efforts to reflect the Task Force recommendations. College drinking research remains a high priority for NIAAA, and ongoing projects continue to yield important new information. This bulletin summarizes these recent findings with updated statistics, analysis, and recommendations. (Contains 1 footnote.) [For the central report, see ED467732.]",

        "description":"Six priority health risk behaviors contribute to the leading causes of death, disability, and social problems in the United States. These behaviors are often established during childhood and adolescence. They include tobacco use; unhealthy dietary behaviors; inadequate physical activity; alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that may result in HIV infection, other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and unintended pregnancies; and behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence. School health programs need to focus on these priority health risk behaviors, as well as other key health issues such as asthma and mental health, that have a great impact on the overall health and well-being of students. Health programs also can make an important contribution by promoting protective  factors--such as a positive relationship with a caring adult and participation in after-school activities--that foster positive health and academic outcomes. Research has shown that school health programs can reduce the prevalence of health risk behaviors among young people and have a positive impact on academic performance. To help states, districts, and schools improve school health programs, The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has developed science-based guidelines, strategies, tools, and other resources, and has identified priority actions states can take to support coordinated school health programs (CSHPs) at local levels. This publication provides research findings confirming that school programs can reduce the prevalence of health risk behaviors,and have a positive impact on academic performance.",

        "description":"Background: The Waterford Early Math &amp; Science (WEMS) program is a comprehensive educational software program designed to build math and science skills and concepts in grades K-2, alone or to supplement existing curricula. The program's capability to individualize lessons, assess and track student progress, and reteach lessons is aimed at keeping potentially &quot;at risk&quot; students at grade level. Purpose: The present evaluation of the Waterford Early Math &amp; Science program is the first independent study of its effectiveness. Setting: The study was carried out in five low-income, largely Hispanic schools in the Tucson Unified School District during the 2005-06 school year. Study Sample: This report covers the 22 kindergartens (345 students) of a larger study of 59 K-2 classrooms (923 students) in the five schools. Intervention: Treatment classrooms were provided with four to six computers loaded with the Waterford Early Math &amp; Science program. The teachers received initial and on-going training in its use and were instructed to give every student at least four 22-minute sessions on the program each week. Research Design: The study used an experimental design in which classrooms were assigned through a process of stratified random selection to the treatment (Waterford Math &amp; Science program) or control group. Control or Comparison Condition: Control classrooms were to use the district curricula and any supplemental programs or educational software already in use, except for Waterford Early Math &amp; Science. Data Collection and Analysis: Data collected included pretest data on student achievement in math and science in the fall, and posttest data on the same in the spring. The Stanford Achievement Test (SAT10 Form A, SESAT1 and SESAT2) provided the pre-post measures for math and the environment (science). Usage data stored in each computer provided the measure of exposure to the program. Usage was filtered at 1100 minutes corresponding to six months of 45 minutes a week in order to see program effects on student achievement. Statistical analyses included paired and independent sample t tests, analysis of covariance, and chi-square tests for non-parametric measures. Treatment and control groups were also analyzed by subgroups of gender, ethnicity, primary home language, English language learner (ELL) status, pretest achievement quartile, and by program dosage. Findings: The most significant findings were: Qualitative data showed the attitudes of the treatment classroom teachers and principals to be very favorable toward the program; The general level of implementation was as expected for first-year implementation, with moderately high use of the software and limited use of supplementary materials; WEMS students significantly outperformed the control students in math and the environment tests; Program effect sizes were moderate;When compared with their counterparts in the control classes, the WEMS students made significantly greater gains in math and the environment tests in the case of boys, girls, Hispanics, Spanish home language students, and ELL students; WEMS English home language students and English-proficient (non-ELL) students also made significantly higher gains in the environment test than their control counterparts; WEMS Spanish home language students and WEMS ELL students made greater gains than other WEMS and control students and scored above the national mean on both tests; Kindergartners at all levels of program usage made greater gains than the controls on both tests.  Native American, African American and white children showed greater gains in the WEMS classrooms than in the controls, but their samples were too small for results to be conclusive. Conclusion: The WEMS program appeared to benefit all children in kindergarten, particularly Hispanics, students whose primary home language was Spanish, and English language learners. Appended are: (1) Teacher Survey; and (2) Comments from Teacher Surveys. (Contains 28 tables and 19 figures.)",

This evaluation report presents interim results for the Salem, Oregon, site in the national ERA project. The study found that (1) a pre- to post-employment model of providing retention and advancement services was difficult for program operators to implement; (2) VISION operated in a difficult economic and fiscal environment, suffering from staff turnover and cutbacks, funding shortages, and management issues; and (3) VISION did not achieve its goals of helping participants secure better jobs and advance in the labor market. These results are not the final word on the VISION program in Salem. MDRC will continue to track the impacts of VISION using unemployment insurance records.

        "description":"To be successful in the workplace of the 21st century, individuals must not only have an extensive store of knowledge, but also must know how to keep that knowledge current, apply it to solve novel problems, and function as a member of a team. This modern view of the workplace has compelled many educators to rethink the ways in which students are prepared (Hmelo & Evensen, 2000). Unlike the traditional, objectivist approach to teaching that focuses on identifying the elements that the learner must know, this new, constructivist approach emphasizes the importance of learning in context. That is, it is no longer enough for learners to acquire concepts in isolation; knowledge which often remains inert. Instead, learners must develop and continually modify their understanding of the world as they interact with other learners to solve realistic problems situated in meaningful tasks (Driscoll, 2005). For many educators, problem-based learning (PBL) represents a particularly useful example of instruction that is consistent with constructivist learning principles. Problem-based learning is an instructional method in which students learn through facilitated problem solving. In PBL, students learn by focusing on a complex problem that does not have a single correct answer, and they work together in collaborative teams to identify what needs to be learned in order to solve the problem. Furthermore, learners \"engage in self-directed learning and then apply their new knowledge to the problem and reflect on what they learned and the effectiveness of the strategies employed\" (Hemlo-Silver, 2004, p. 235). In theory, learning in PBL environments not only promotes more effective knowledge construction, but results in better learning transfer over time (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2000). The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview and analysis of current research on PBL environments. To achieve this goal, the paper is organized into two main sections: a brief survey of the goals of PBL, and a review of relevant research on the effectiveness of PBL.",

The problem occurs due to the large number of hypothesis tests that are typically conducted across outcomes and subgroups in these studies, which can lead to spurious statistically significant impact findings. The guidelines, which balance type I and type II errors, involve specifying confirmatory and exploratory analyses in the study protocols, structuring the data by delineating outcome domains, conducting t-tests on composite domain outcomes, and applying multiplicity correction procedures to composites across domains. Guidelines are discussed for subgroup analyses, designs with multiple treatment groups, power analyses, and reporting impact findings. The report also provides background for applying the guidelines, including a detailed discussion of the multiplicity  problem, statistical solutions that are found in the literature, and weighting options for forming composite domain outcomes. Four appendixes include: (1) Panel Members Attending the Multiple Comparisons Meetings; (2) Introduction to Multiple Testing; (3) Weighting Options for Constructing Composite Domain Outcomes; and (4) The Bayesian Hypothesis Testing Framework.

        "author":["Geckeler, Christian"],
        "description":"Lumina Foundation for Education created the Dreamkeepers and Angel Fund Emergency Financial Aid Programs to assist community college students who are at risk of dropping out because of unexpected financial crises. Both programs are multiyear pilot projects that began in 2005 and are administered by Scholarship America and the American Indian College Fund, respectively. Eleven community colleges are participating in Dreamkeepers; 26 Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) are participating in Angel Fund. Each Dreamkeepers college receives up to $100,000 over three years; each TCU receives nearly $26,000 over five years. The colleges are responsible for designing the programs and raising funds, both to sustain their programs and to continue receiving matching funds from the initiative. Lumina asked MDRC to evaluate these programs during their first two years of program design and implementation. This final report shares their findings on the design and implementation of the programs and draws lessons and recommendations from the colleges' experiences. The study found that Dreamkeepers award recipients were more likely than other students at their colleges to be older, parents, first-year students, enrolled full time, in vocational study, and recipients of other financial aid. At some Dreamkeepers colleges, women and African-American students were more likely to receive aid. According to recipients and administrators at both the Dreamkeepers and the Angel Fund colleges, the aid helped students remain in college. Because MDRC did not use an experimental research design to evaluate the programs, it cannot be concluded that the emergency aid alone was responsible. But the data does show that aid recipients reenrolled at rates roughly comparable to the average on their campuses. Moreover, nearly all of the colleges met or exceeded their fundraising goals, which means that the programs will be able to continue to help more students after Lumina's funding has ended. For colleges interested in starting similar programs, this report suggests several key challenges to address: defining what constitutes a financial emergency, building a flexible administrative structure that safeguards funds yet quickly responds to student needs, ensuring that all eligible students are aware of the program and have equal opportunities to access funds, finding sources of funding, working with technical assistance providers, and using data to evaluate programs.

These teachers are called &quot;floating&quot; teachers in most schools, but in some schools they are called &quot;push-in&quot; teachers, shorthand for teachers that come into the classroom to provide remediation services for children. The Educational Priorities Panel's (EPP) 2000 monitoring report, &quot;Smaller is Better,&quot; primarily looked at schools where early-grade class sizes had been reduced with state funds, but staff interviews were also conducted at two schools using floating teachers. In the second year of the implementation of this federal program, EPP took a closer look at the assignments of floating teachers and staff perceptions of the usefulness of the program. The present report presents data on all the assignments of floating teachers, including strengths, weaknesses, assignment and scheduling problems, and attitudes of school administration.

The study found that fifteen percent of children were declassified between 2003-04 and 2004-05. Children were more likely to be declassified when they transitioned from preschool to kindergarten or from kindergarten to first grade. Over that same year, 23 percent of children who continued to receive special education services had a change in their primary disability category. Teachers indicated that 89 percent of the children received speech or language therapy in the 2003-04 school year, and 86 percent of the children received it in 2004-05. Occupational therapy and learning strategies/study skills assistance by a special educator were also commonly reported services both years. The mean overall performance of preschoolers with disabilities increased significantly from 2003-04 to 2004-05 on the Woodcock-Johnson III: Letter-Word Identification subtest, a measure of early literacy skills, and Applied Problems subtest, a measure of early math skills.

        "description":"A proposal in the New York State Assembly in 2000 considered eliminating Tax Equalization Aid to school districts in order to fund the elimination of aid caps, called Transition  Adjustment. In response to that proposal, this report examines the equalizing or disequalizing effects of three types of New York state aid to school districts--Extraordinary Needs Aid, Equalization Aid, and Tax Effort Aid. Extraordinary Needs Aid (ENA) provides  additional funds for school districts with high needs students such as a large number of students living in poverty or a large number of students with limited English proficiency. Tax Equalization Aid, or Equalization Aid for short (EA), provides additional funds to school districts in which a given tax rate on local property is unusually high. Tax Effort Aid (TA) provides additional funds to school districts in which revenue raised from property taxes  exceeds 3 percent of adjust gross income. These aids are not intended to be specifically equalizing or disequalizing, but their effects on the inequality between districts is important, and in many cases Tax Effort and Equalization Aid have disequalizing effects. This report finds that Equalization Aid and Tax Effort Aid act as poorly functioning regional cost aids, and thus recommends replacing them with an outright regional cost factor. Replacing Tax Effort and Equalization Aid with a regional cost aid and eliminating caps on aid could make the state school system more equitable and more rational. (Contains 13 charts and 3 tables.)

While some research supports this strategy, little research assesses the relative costs of these smaller schools. Data on over 200 New York City high schools, from 1996 through 2003, is used to estimate school cost functions relating per pupil expenditures to school size, controlling for school output and quality, student characteristics, and school organization. The authors find that the structure of costs differs across schools depending upon mission--comprehensive or themed. At their current levels of outputs, themed schools minimize per pupil costs at smaller enrollments than comprehensive schools, but these optimally-sized themed schools also cost more per pupil than optimally-sized comprehensive schools. The authors also find that both themed and comprehensive high schools at actual sizes are smaller than their optimal sizes. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"The No Child Left Behind Act requires schools to begin testing new English Learners (EL) in English language arts within three years after they enter school and holds schools accountable for their performance on these exams. Yet very little empirical work has examined exactly how long it takes EL students to become proficient in English and how the time to proficiency varies for different types of students. Linguistic theorists suggest, for instance, that the age at which students begin learning a second language may substantially  influence their probability of obtaining proficiency quickly. Using panel data on English Learners (EL) in New York City public schools, I examine how long it takes students to become minimally-proficient in English and how the time to and probability of proficiency differs for students by their age of school entry. Specifically, I follow four entry cohorts of ELs and use discrete-time survival analysis to model variations in the rate at which different age groups acquire proficiency. I find that approximately half of the students become  proficient within three years after school entry but that age of entry lowers the speed with which children can become proficient. Age of entry differences are robust to controls for differences in other student characteristic and the schools they attend. The results suggest that federal, state, and local policies regarding the testing of EL students in academic English should consider more flexible time limits. (Contains 6 tables.)",

In this paper I will examine the biographies of a number of nineteenth century British and American chemical textbook writers and see what, if any differences stand out in the chemical pedagogies that they expressed in the textbooks that they wrote. A conclusion is reached that by the early twentieth century there were increasing numbers of American scientists in the top rank. Although some of these were refugees, many scientists were born in America and schooled using the science textbooks, which have been referred to in this paper. These scientists and inventors provided the intellectual base on which the American economy was able to expand and overtake the economies of European countries during the twentieth century.",

        "description":"In this study, we examine the role of academic preparation in the transition from community colleges to four-year institutions. We address two specific questions: To what extent do academically unprepared students transfer to four-year institutions? And, can positive experiences in community colleges diminish the role of inadequate academic preparation? The results, which are based on analyses of Florida's unit record data of first-time community college students, indicate that a substantial proportion of students who enter community colleges academically unprepared do indeed transfer to four-year institutions. Moreover, successful completion of intermediate outcomes--such as passing college-level math and writing courses, meeting specific credit thresholds, and earning an associate degree--enhances students' probability of transfer. However, the ability of community colleges to mitigate the negative effects of inadequate academic preparation is limited: successful completion of even the most demanding intermediate outcomes does not alleviate the negative consequences of entering higher education unprepared. The policy implications of these findings are discussed. (Contains 15 footnotes, 2 figures and 5 tables.)",

        "description":"New Leaders for New Schools, a non-profit organization committed to training high-quality urban public school principals, received grants from the U.S. Department of Education in 2006 and 2007 to support the development of innovative teacher compensation strategies. New Leaders is partnering with four urban school districts and a consortium of charter schools to implement the Effective Practices Incentive Community (EPIC), offering two types of financial awards to educators: (1) a reward for principals and instructional staff in schools that are effective in raising student achievement and (2) a financial incentive for teachers who are identified as effective and are willing to document and share their practices. New Leaders contracted with Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (MPR) to help design methods for identifying effective schools and teachers. The approach used for each partner differs, depending on the priorities of the partner and the type of information available to measure school and teacher performance. This report presents the method used to identify effective schools in the Memphis City Schools (MCS), one of the partner school districts, during the first year of this project. The methodology focuses on a &quot;value-added model&quot; that measures how much a school contributes to test score improvements for their students rather than average test score levels or the percentage of students who meet state proficiency levels. The model &quot;handicaps&quot; both the students' starting point and factors that affect their growth over the year, to account for factors that systematically affect the academic growth of different types of students and initial student performance differences across schools. MPR will work with New Leaders and MCS to revise the model in future years, and to incorporate any additional data that become available. The results of this work were given to New Leaders but are not presented here in order to maintain the confidentiality of the individual schools. The identification of effective teachers will be addressed in later reports. An appendix presents technical details of the value-added model (estimation sample; dosage variables for students who attended multiple schools during the 2006-07 school year; controlling for measurement error; the value-added model; and estimating effects by grade and subject).

        "description":"This report introduces a quantitative index that measures the degree of similarity between native- and foreign-born adults in the United States: the ability to distinguish the latter group from the former is defined as &quot;assimilation.&quot; The Index of Immigrant Assimilation relies on Census Bureau data available in some form since 1900 and as current as 2006. The index reveals great diversity in the experiences of individual immigrant groups, which differ from each other almost as much as they differ from the native-born. They vary significantly in the extent to which their earnings have increased, their rate of learning the English language, and progress toward citizenship. Mexican immigrants, the largest group and the focus of most current immigration policy debates, have assimilated slowly, but their experience is not representative of the entire immigrant population. Collective assimilation rates are lower than they were a century ago, although no lower than they have been in recent decades. This is true despite the fact that recent immigrants have arrived less assimilated than their predecessors and in very large numbers. In addition to country of origin, the Index categorizes groups on the basis of date of arrival, age, and place of residence. Some groups have done far better or worse than the Index as a whole; Assimilation also varies considerably across metropolitan areas. The methodology used to compute the assimilation index is outlined in the report and detailed in an appendix. The assimilation index points to marks of success, to encouraging recent trends, and also to areas of concern. Within areas of concern, the index provides some insight into the nature of the problem and the universe of appropriate potential policy responses. However, the report neither proposes nor endorses any policy responses: its purpose is to present information in a manner useful to concerned citizens and policymakers who hope to make informed decisions regarding the proper course of action.

        "description":"This paper evaluates the impact of exposure to a voucher program for disabled students in Florida on the academic performance of disabled students who remain in the public school system. The authors utilize student-level data on the universe of public school students in the state of Florida from 2000-01 through 2004-05 to study the effect of the largest school voucher program in the United States, the McKay Scholarship Program for Students with Disabilities (McKay), on achievement in math and reading by students who have been diagnosed as disabled and remain in the public school system. The report is an empirical evaluation of the impact of exposure to a voucher program designed to allow students with disabilities to enroll in schools other than their local public schools on the achievement of disabled students who remain in their local public schools. Vouchers for disabled students are the fastest-growing type in the United States. Programs similar to McKay are currently operating in Ohio, Georgia, and Utah and have been recently considered by other states. Highlights of the study include: (1) Public school students with relatively mild disabilities made statistically significant test score improvements in both math and reading as more nearby private schools began participation in the McKay program, contrary to the hypothesis that school choice harms students who remain in public schools; (2) Disabled public school students' largest gains as exposure to McKay increased were made by those diagnosed as having the mildest learning disabilities; and (3) Academic proficiency of students diagnosed with relatively severe disabilities was neither helped nor harmed by increased exposure to the McKay program.

        "description":"One of the challenges that we currently face in achieving universal education is how do we ensure that girls, who have missed the school bus or simply got off the bus too early, can still realise their right to quality basic education? This paper reviews several key education initiatives implemented in the last decade to reach out to the out-of-school children and young women in particularly difficult circumstances through condensed or short-term residential education programmes--also known as &quot;accelerated learning&quot; (AL) programmes. The review indicates that evidence on the ground regarding the impact of the interventions is rather mixed and fragmented. AL programs have provided a much-needed opportunity to learn in a congenial environment characterised by child-centred learning and a multi-dimensional teacher-pupil relationship. Discussions with young women and girls who participated in condensed programmes across the country are revealing--in one voice they all said the experience was valuable and it was their only window into the world of education. However, at the same time programmes are often unable to sustain their achievements through forging of effective multiple linkages with the formal education system to ensure continuous learning. The paper asserts that since the demand for such interventions is increasing, the limitations as well as the potential of AL as a strategy needs to be critically engaged within our quest for achieving universal elementary education.

        "description":"Though most interactions between parents and school personnel about students with disabilities are positive and productive, disagreements can arise. Disputes may range in intensity from minor miscommunications to significant conflicts that trigger the use of procedural safeguards available under federal law. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides for several distinct dispute resolution processes including mediation, filing of a due process complaint, which may lead to a resolution meeting and/or an impartial due process hearing, and civil action [P.L. 108-446 Section 615(e)(i)]. Some states and localities voluntarily choose to adopt alternative mechanisms for resolving disagreements over the provision of special education services. This In-Depth Policy Analysis summarizes results from a national survey of states' use of non-IDEA required alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes and findings of an in-depth case review of those processes in eight states. The ten processes studied are: (1) conflict resolution skills training; (2) stakeholder management or oversight council; (3) parent-to-parent assistance; (4) dispute resolution case managers; (5) telephone intermediary; (6) IEP facilitation; (7) non-IDEA mediation; (8) third-party opinion or consultation processes; (9) early complaint resolution; and (10) resolution-meeting facilitation. Each of these processes is defined and findings are described under each process. Factors that impact the use of these processes are examined and conclusions are drawn. (Contains 2 footnotes.)",

The purpose of the new scholarship program was to provide low-income residents, particularly those whose children attend schools in need of improvement or corrective action under the &quot;Elementary and Secondary Education Act,&quot; with &quot;expanded opportunities to attend higher performing schools in the District of Columbia&quot; (Sec. 303). As part of this legislation, the Congress mandated a rigorous evaluation of the impacts of the Program, now called the &quot;DC Opportunity Scholarship Program&quot; (OSP). This report presents findings from the evaluation on the impacts two years after families who applied were given the option to move from a public school to a participating private school of their choice. The report studies five key outcomes of the OSP: school differences; academic achievement; parental perceptions of school satisfaction and safety; student reports of school satisfaction and safety; and the impact of using a scholarship. The study found no significant differences in student achievement between those who were offered scholarships to attend a participating private school and those who were eligible for, but were not offered (as assigned by a lottery) a scholarship. However, being offered a scholarship may have improved reading test scores among three subgroups of relatively more advantaged students: those who had not attended a School in Need of Improvement (SINI) school when they applied to the program, those who had relatively higher pre-program academic performance, and those who applied in the first year of program implementation. Students in the program did not report being more satisfied or feeling safer than those who were not in the program. However, the program did have a positive impact on parent satisfaction and perceptions of school safety. This same pattern of findings holds when the analysis is conducted to determine the impact of using a scholarship rather than being offered a scholarship and when estimating the effects of attending private school versus public school, regardless of whether an Opportunity Scholarship Program scholarship was used.

This report presents findings from the evaluation on the impacts 2 years after families who applied were given the option to move from a public school to a participating private school of their choice. The evaluation is based on a randomized controlled trial design that compares the outcomes of eligible applicants randomly assigned to receive or not receive a scholarship through a series of lotteries. Primary findings to date: (1) After 2 years, there was no statistically significant difference in test scores in general between students who were offered an OSP scholarship and students who were not offered a scholarship; (2) OSP had a positive impact on overall parent satisfaction and parent perceptions of school safety, but not on students' reports of satisfaction and safety; (3) This same pattern of findings holds when the analysis is conducted to determine the impact of using a scholarship rather than being offered a scholarship; (4) There were some impacts on subgroups of students, but adjustments for multiple comparisons indicate that these findings may be due to chance; and (5) Second year impacts are generally consistent with those from the first year.

They currently carry out these assessments in the context of the practice of inclusive education that involves providing for all children's educational needs in regular classroom settings. Recently, some psychologists have advocated for a &quot;psychology of inclusive education&quot; (Kershner &amp; Hick, 2005) and enquired about how psychologists can assist teachers regarding inclusion (Anderson &amp; Klassen, 2005). This paper describes how psychology can support the implementation of selected recommendations found in New Brunswick's recent review of inclusion. Examples of these recommendations include: (1) explication of a  comprehensive approach to early intervention and preschool education supporting inclusion; (2) the development of a provincial-level approach to serve children with learning disabilities and autism; (3) the need to develop appropriate educational strategies with Aboriginal and First Nations communities to address the processes of cultural inclusion, discipline and instruction; and (4) evaluating all students in relation to the goals of academic achievement, social skills and citizenship. Finally, selected findings from recent psychological research providing data in support of these recommendations are presented.",

Part I, An Analysis of NAEP Data, authored by Brookings Institution scholar Tom Loveless, examines achievement trends for high-achieving students (defined, like low-achieving students, by their performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP) since the early 1990s and, in more detail, since 2000. Part II, Results from a National Teacher Survey, authored by Steve Farkas and Ann Duffett of Farkas Duffett Research Group, reports on teachers' own views of how schools are serving high-achieving pupils in the NCLB era. A foreword by Chester E. Finn, Jr. and Michael J. Petrilli, states that the major finding of this dual study is that, in one respect at least, NCLB  is working precisely as designed. A good thing, surely, but not entirely so. What we see in this study is one of its unintended consequences--and one that's worrisome for America's future competitiveness. A positive trend is that our low-performing students are starting to make respectable gains, but if gains by low achievers are our only measure of success, America faces big challenges in the years ahead. Part I appendixes present: P-Values for Gains at the 90th and 10th Percentiles in the Era of NCLB; P-Values for Gains at the 90th and 10th Percentiles Pre-NCLB; Descriptive Statistics and Standard Errors; and Sources for Independent Variables in Question 4.

No similar study had been carried out in Papua New Guinea (PNG) so this study was designed to find out more about the social background, motivations and conditions of new teachers there. In countries such as the United Kingdom, U.S.A., Canada, Australia and New Zealand the topic is very well researched, but in Third World countries there is very little research data about new teachers. The idealism of PNG tyro teachers became apparent to the author in analyzing the research of the main project and evidence of the considerable degree of idealism that these young teachers possessed. It was concluded that young Papua New Guineans are idealistic and those who take up teaching as a career are particularly idealistic. They generally work hard in difficult conditions for low pay but remain optimistic about their chosen profession. (Contains 2 tables.)

The Task Force brought together AACTE representatives with the two major federally-recognized accrediting agencies in educator preparation--the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC)--and asked them to utilize AACTE's Principles for National Accreditation in Educator Preparation in developing a unified approach to accreditation. The charge from AACTE's Board of Directors included these elements: (1) Identify common beliefs, values, and resources present in current approaches to accreditation of educator preparation; (2) Outline the vision of accreditation in educator preparation that would guide the future structure of accrediting activities; (3) Identify building components that would serve this vision of accreditation in educator preparation; and (4) Recommend next steps and implementation needed to achieve these accreditation goals for the education profession. This Final Report seeks to provide, in brief, the background and context within which the Task Force carried out its work. The most important elements of the report are the shared vision for a unified accreditation system and the recommendations for an implementation plan to move the process forward. Every element and word of the vision statement and the implementation plan was debated and agreed to by all members of the Task Force. No votes were taken, so this is a consensus document.",

The study draws on public and private sector resource allocation literature to identify key elements of resource allocation decisions. These elements are used to highlight different allocation practices used in two urban districts, and the findings illustrate the importance of understanding how district allocation practices determine the distribution of resources within districts. This paper also provides a framework for comparing resource allocation mechanisms in the context of four district reform strategies: (1) targeted resources to narrow the achievement gap; (2) decentralized reform with school-based accountability; (3) centralized reform or \"managed curriculum,\" and (4) integrated (or personalized) services. For district leaders pursuing any one of these reform strategies, this analysis should serve as a roadmap for more strategic resource allocation.

        "description":"Australia's adoption of outcomes based education (OBE), sometimes known as Essential Learnings or outcomes and standards based education, has been at the centre of a good deal of public scrutiny and debate. In Western Australia, during 2006, the planned introduction of OBE into years 11 and 12 led to a strident and vocal media campaign, in part, led by &quot;The West Australian&quot; and &quot;The Australian&quot; newspapers, that culminated in a parliamentary review and Premier Carpenter taking control of the issue in an attempt to ameliorate some of the more contentious aspects of the proposed senior school certificate. In Tasmania, a similar debate about curriculum reform related to Essential Learnings, led to Minister Bartlett replacing Minister Wreidt as the education minister and a decision, announced in late August, 2006, to re-badge the curriculum as the Tasmanian Curriculum and to modify some of the more problematic aspects of the Essential Learnings curriculum as it was originally designed. At the national level, debates about the impact of outcomes based education on history, literature and music curriculum have also highlighted the fact that school curriculum has become the focus of attention. A number of education activists and academics have also criticised Australia's adoption of outcomes based education on the basis that OBE does not represent &quot;world's best&quot; curriculum and that it fails to successfully support teachers in their work.

In appropriate settings and conditions, CBT is an effective training strategy, but obviously it is not the only way to design training. If managers and curriculum specialists have a clear understanding of the theory and values on which CBT and other curriculum models are based, the programs they design will be more effective in meeting educational needs.

Finally, the efficacy of the system has been tested and refined over a 30-year period in a large, statewide social services training program. These procedures could readily be adapted to manage a broad spectrum of training programs both in the public and private sector.  (Contains 5 figures and 1 table.)

The methodology was to examine and analyze the briefs filed and the court decisions to analyze the legal arguments made by the parties to the lawsuit. The results were that the U.S. Circuit Court for the Sixth Circuit found that the language of the NCLB Act was ambiguous and did not give clear notice to the states and school districts regarding funding. The U.S. Secretary of Education appealed the court decision. States and school districts concluded that they did not have to pay for implementing provisions of the NCLB Act unless those funds were provided by the federal government. The case raised questions about future spending for education and spending priorities. Should federal education funding be increased?",

        "description":"This paper describes an evaluation model called embedded training evaluation (ETE) which can be used to evaluate different types of training ranging from basic skills through constructed learning. The model was developed for the New York State Child Welfare/Child Protection Services Common Core training program. ETE is particularly effective in evaluating high-level performance skills using items that require examinees to construct responses. It can be used to assess in-service and on-the-job training, either independently or in combination with regular classroom instruction. It uses constructed tasks integrated with the curriculum and blends instruction with evaluation. These tasks are situated in realistic, job-related settings within the classroom that are a natural part of training. ETE strategies are authentic because trainees demonstrate what they can do as workers in a job-like setting. When properly designed, assessments are indistinguishable from instruction. ETE takes place in a setting analogous to the workplace using a training design similar to an assessment center. It incorporates key aspects of a cognitive apprenticeship that allow trainees to emulate processes experts use to solve job-related problems. ETE uses skill-based items derived from the curriculum that combine assessment and training into a single, coherent package. ETE provides a context appropriate for assessing constructive knowledge, but does not preclude testing objective and cognitive knowledge. Since this analytic, controlled process makes evaluation an integral part of training, it is a cost-effective, controlled alternative for assessing trainee competence. Three appendixes are included: (1) Sample Trainee Performance Report; (2) Counselor Rating Scale; and (3) Supervisor's OJT Checklist. Appendixes are referenced separately. (Contains 8 tables.)

        "author":["Smith, William G."],
        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation between online survey non-response and various demographic factors, including gender. Studies have shown that trends exist with regard to who responds to surveys, at least with regard to traditional modes of survey administration. Reports suggest that many demographic and other correlates with non-response to online surveys may indeed mirror those of more traditional modes of survey administration. However, the influence of such a basic demographic factor as gender on online survey response behavior is unclear. In this study, a record-linking technique was employed to compare the gender of online survey respondents directly to available demographic data of all members of a sampling frame, thus allowing comparison of demographic information of both respondents and non-respondents. The sampling frame, which consisted entirely of university faculty members of a large research university in the southeastern United States with a full-time faculty of approximately 1000, was specifically chosen to minimize the effect of other potential correlates to non-response behavior, such as education level, Internet access, geographic location, occupation, and income. Pearson's chi square analysis showed a significant relationship between gender and survey response rates: female faculty members contributed disproportionately to the respondent data set. One possible explanations for the observations is that the observed differences in female and male faculty response rates is a product of differences in female and male values operating in a gendered online environment. Results of this study suggest that researchers should not assume that response behavior toward online surveys, and therefore data gathered from online surveys, is free of gender bias.

        "description":"This review samples ten of the nation's most widely used junior and senior high school history textbooks comparing what respected historians say about Islam in authoritative histories to what is being said in textbooks. It assesses how today's history textbooks characterize Islam's foundations and creeds; changes and additions that have occurred in textbook material written before 2001; and what textbooks say about terrorism. Further, it assesses what textbooks say about the September 11 air attack on the United States, weapons of mass destruction, Islamic challenges to global security, and looming dangers to the United States and world. The review concludes that many political and religious groups try to use the textbook process to their advantage, but the deficiencies in Islam-related lessons are uniquely disturbing. History textbooks present an incomplete and confected view of Islam that misrepresents its foundations and challenges to international security. Misinformation about Islam is more pronounced in junior high school textbooks than high school textbooks. Outright textbook errors about Islam are not the main problem. The more serious failure is the presence of disputed definitions and claims that are presented as established facts. Deficiencies about Islam in textbooks copyrighted before 2001 persist and in some cases have grown worse. Instead of making corrections or adjusting contested facts, publishers and editors defend misinformation and content evasions against the record. Biases persist. Silences are profound and intentional. Islamist activists use multiculturalism and ready-made American political movements, especially those on campus, to advance and justify uncritical Islam-related content makeover in history textbooks. Particular fault rests with the publishing corporations, the boards of directors, and executives who decide what editorial policies their companies will pursue.

        "author":["Russman, Maxine L."],
        "description":"The mid-1990s saw the initial establishment of one-stop delivery systems, a collaboration of work force development entities in which a facility serves as a single-point-of-access, a place where individuals seeking employment and employers seeking employees may receive needed assistance. Some community colleges, because of their comprehensive mission to address community building through economic and workforce development, elected to voluntarily enter into the one-stop delivery system collaboration. To better understand the role of the community college collaborative agent in the development of one-stop delivery systems, a case study was designed and conducted. The perspectives of collaborative agents, community college leaders, and one-stop collaborative partners were examined to better understand what it means to be a community college collaborative agent, how community college collaborative agents balance the mission and interests of the college and those of the partners, and how they facilitate or inhibit the process of maintaining commitment for the collaboration. The study was designed to explore the characteristics of an effective community college collaborative agent and issues related to where the collaborative agent is physically housed. As federal and state policy encourages an increased level of participation of community colleges in one-stop delivery systems, colleges need to make decisions regarding the level of resources to commit to the one-stop centers. This may involve assessing the value of having a collaborative agent physically located at the one-stop center. If a decision is made to have the collaborative agent present, adequate support and communication structures are needed to keep him/her linked to and engaged with the college. If the choice is to not have a collaborative agent on-site, communication structures and support are needed to link the collaborative agent to the purpose and interests of the one-stop delivery system. Community colleges need to assess their mission and interests in light of federal and state policies that require colleges' engagement in community collaboration. To opt for a comprehensive mission with limited resources means making choices among competing program priorities such as expanded academic offerings, student access, and generating enrollments versus providing community services that may or may not generate enrollments. For college personnel representing the college in community outreach, understanding the mission and the college leadership's priorities is critical to the fulfillment of their role in fostering an effective collaboration.",

        "description":"Keeping middle school students focused and engaged in the classroom is a challenge amid the physical, intellectual, emotional, and social changes that young people experience during this phase of their lives. Youth aged 11 to 13 years are characterized by a growing desire to think and act independently while at the same time caring about being accepted by peers and being part of a group. Add to those dynamics the feelings of vulnerability and self-consciousness that come with puberty, and educators have a complex combination of forces to consider when designing strategies to effectively reach middle school students. Literature about middle school reform acknowledges the importance of an academically challenging and supportive environment to engage young adolescent learners. Student motivation, a meaningful curriculum, and student choice also are important factors for engaging middle-level learners. This newsletter addresses student motivation and illustrates three strategies that can help create a meaningful curriculum to engage middle-level learners: (1) Relating lessons to students' lives; (2) Making learning authentic; and (3) Giving students choices. The strategies draw from effective classroom practices across grade levels as well as from research about the social, emotional, and physical development of middle-level learners.

By the standard measures most commonly cited (test scores, dropout rates, rates of college entry and completion), the achievement gap experienced by foster youth is significant, translating into fewer economic opportunities and more adverse outcomes, relegating many foster youth to a life-long sentence of struggle just to get by. This brief cites three key policy areas to focus improvements that lead to better educational outcomes for foster children and youth: (1) School Readiness; (2) School Success; and (3) Data Sharing. Recommendations within each area include measures to strengthen and increase access to high quality preschool; ensure school stability and increase training, support and incentives for educators; and improve the collection and sharing of data related to the educational progress of foster care youth.",

        "description":"Due to the technological advance that has swept our societies, students have become more and more engaged with new burgeoning technological tools such as computers, cell phones, iPods, digital cameras, and the like. As a result, the disparity between what students do inside school and what they do at home has grown wider. Buckingham (2007) refers to this gap as the &quot;new digital divide&quot;. In this research paper, I set out to investigate how digital technologies mediate a group of Al Ittihad Model School (AIMS) students'  literacy practices outside of formal academic settings by investigating their online life and engagement with one contemporary &quot;semiotic domain&quot;: Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs). I will approach the topic from the perspective of an ESL teacher to shed light on the definition of MMORPGs and focus my discussion on a particular game named &quot;World of WarCraft.&quot; I will also discuss the effects of this game on my subjects in as far as forms of learning and social interaction are concerned. Criticisms and new trends in the field of online gaming will be briefly reviewed throughout the paper. (Contains 6 figures.)",

However, little research examines the impact of flexible scheduling. The school examined the impact of flexible scheduling, open class labs, and modified democratic modeling on student attitudes about self and community and on student success rates. This qualitative case study used open-ended questionnaires, a review of the school program and student outcomes, and observations to determine the nature of and extent of such an alternative school program related to student motivation, self-efficacy, performance, sense of community, and graduation rates.  Results indicated the program positively impacted not only success rates, but also self esteem and self efficacy, student success, reduced student-teacher tensions, and increased teacher and student satisfaction with student outputs and performance. This research raises several important questions concerning student maturation and student success, as well. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "author":["Sarsar, Nasreddine"],
        "description":"The technological advance that has dominated various aspects of our daily life has led to the emergence of new literacies. This created a need for reconceptualizing the old notion of literacy which was restricted to the ability of reading and writing. It has been stated forward by many scholars that we now require a richer and more diversified concept of literacy that includes not only verbal literacy, but also visual literacy (Buckingham, 2007; Jewitt, 2005; Makin & McLachlan, 2006; Pahl & Rowsell, 2005). In order for schools to respond to \"digital native\" (Prensky, 2002) students, many of the new emerging literacies should be embedded in the curriculum. Working these new literacies into the curriculum will serve a two-fold purpose: keeping the \"new digital divide\" (Buckingham, 2007) to a minimum and relating students' out-of-school literacy practices to in-school literacy instruction. In an effort to embed the new burgeoning literacies into the curriculum, I have created a classroom website that would allow me to rely on my students' \"digital capital\" that has often been overlooked. The website will also help students move from a monomodal approach that relies mainly on print-based text to a multimodal one that requires them to explore a variety of modes to get access to meaning.

The methodology used was to analyze, compare, and critique the proposals based on educational research on apathy and boredom in the instruction of history. The results were that the engagement techniques and strategies could be effective in reducing apathy and boredom. Sam Intrator found that they were effective in his classrooms. The conclusion reached, however, was that engagement techniques and strategies cannot be entirely successful and effective unless they address the core cause of apathy and boredom. Governmental and societal policies in the U.S. have devalued history and discouraged the application of critical thinking skills and higher order thinking to history instruction. Educators and researchers must address this issue in future research on engagement strategies and techniques. Strategies and techniques cannot be completely effective and successful unless they confront the issue of governmental and societal policies on the values and purposes placed on history instruction.

The aim of this paper was to see how students used the Internet group in the learning of literature so that the effect of the use of an Internet group on learning literature can be discussed. In this study, content analysis was used to understand the nature of the activity situated in the Internet group. The results of the analysis of the Internet group suggest that the Internet group was mainly used by the course takers for formal interaction. It is seen that very little collaboration or real interaction took place amongst the course takers towards creating meaning together. The results support the view that using technology in literature learning has advantages mainly because the students were interested in working in this group although they were neither graded in the activity nor were mandated to take part in it.

        "author":["Scott, George A."],
        "description":"In 2002, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that veteran students were awarded similar amounts of Title IV aid as nonveteran students, and veterans' total federal aid was greater when Chapter 30 GI benefits were included. This report responds to request from the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, Committee on Veterans' Affairs about whether this has changed, resulting in veterans receiving less federal financial aid. To address this question, three areas were addressed: (1) how the amount of Title IV financial aid awarded to veteran students compares with that awarded to nonveteran students; (2) how higher education institutions allocate Title IV financial aid among veteran and nonveteran students; and (3) how federal agencies and higher education institutions provide information to veterans on Title IV financial aid. The following findings are reported: (1) overall, veteran students received similar amounts of Title IV aid as nonveteran, independent students (however, when including Chapter 30 GI benefits, veterans received more total federal aid than nonveterans); (2) laws and regulations largely dictate how higher education institutions allocate Title IV aid among veteran and nonveteran students, but five of the eight schools interviewed used their limited flexibility to allow veterans to be eligible for larger amounts of certain types of Title IV aid; and (3) although federal agencies and schools provide the same information on Title IV aid to all students, some of the schools interviewed in areas with nearby military bases specifically reach out to veteran students. In addition, there are some recent federal efforts to inform veterans about Title IV aid, such as workshops on federal aid for personnel separating from the military. Information is included in four appendixes: (1) Briefing Slides on Title IV Aid; (2) Objectives, Scope, and Methodology; (3) Estimated Federal Title IV Aid Awarded to Students; and (4) GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments.

This final report presents findings from an analysis of the &quot;National Early Intervention Longitudinal Study&quot; (NEILS) and the &quot;National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being&quot; (NSCAW) to provide information about the developmental status and early intervention service needs of children under age three who are substantiated for maltreatment. The study found that: (1) children ages birth to 36 months who have been maltreated are at substantial risk of experiencing subsequent developmental problems; (2) compared to classification at the time of initial contact with Child Welfare Services, over time a higher proportion of children are described as having fewer risks or with a low score on a developmental measure while over time a smaller proportion of children are described as having more risks; (3) few infants and toddlers with substantiated cases of maltreatment are reported to have a diagnosed medical condition (an established risk condition) as described in IDEA (e.g., Down syndrome, blindness, cerebral palsy) that would make them automatically eligible for Part C services; (4) among children who have substantiated maltreatment, the proportion with a low score on a developmental measure does not differ markedly from those of children investigated but not found to have substantiated maltreatment; (5) maltreated children between 24 to 36 months of age have relatively high levels of behavior problems reported by their caregivers; (6) a sizeable proportion of infants and toddlers with substantiated maltreatment were reported to have an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP), reflecting eligibility for Part C services; (7) families are receiving parent training and family counseling services through Child Welfare Services or by referral. It is unclear the extent to which these services provide interventions focused on enhancing child development; (8) Part C providers may not be familiar with the unique challenges associated with providing services to maltreated children and their families; and (9) increased training and collaboration of Child Welfare and Part C service providers may be a useful approach to facilitate CAPTA compliance and enhance developmental outcomes for children. This study confirms that the level of risk for developmental delay is high for maltreated children and that it remains high, years after the initial maltreatment. (Contains 15 exhibits.)",

It supplies demographic profiles of 1972, 1980, 1992, and  2004 seniors and discusses their senior-year coursetaking and extracurricular activities, life  values, educational expectations, and post-high school education and career plans. Chapter 1 describes changes in the racial/ethnic makeup of high school seniors from 1982 to 2004. Chapter 2 examines the courses taken by seniors during their senior year (in contrast to  courses accumulated throughout their high school program, as examined in, for example, Bozick and Ingels 2008 and Dalton et al. 2007). During this last year of high school, seniors took higher-level courses in mathematics, science, and foreign language in greater proportions in 2004 than in 1982 (the first year for which coursetaking data are available). Seniors participated in a variety of extracurricular activities. The ones examined in chapter 3 are student government, honor society, athletics, newspaper or yearbook, vocational club,  and academic club. There was both some overall change and a good deal of stability in the  patterns of participation among seniors. Chapter 4 examines plans for work and school immediately after high school, as well as the importance of certain factors in choosing a postsecondary education institution. Plans for highest educational level and occupational attainment at age 30 are examined in chapter 5. Two appendixes include: Technical Notes and Glossary; and (2) Standard Error Tables.

The methodology consisted in analyzing and comparing research findings on the benefits and costs of inclusion. Federal legislation and regulations on inclusion were examined, analyzed, and discussed. The results showed that inclusion, the practice of integrating students with disabilities in regular, general education classrooms for all or nearly all of the day instead of in special education classrooms, had both advantages and disadvantages. The benefits of inclusion consisted of, in general, reduced cost, the development of greater self-esteem and social skills in students with disabilities, and a greater integration of students with diverse needs. Equity and equality were fostered for all students. The cons or disadvantages of inclusion were that time and attention were diverted from regular and advanced students with a concomitant lowering of standards. The conclusion was that the benefits of inclusion outweigh the costs. Inclusion fostered the goals of education, which are tolerance for diversity, equity, equality, community integration, and achievement for all students.

        "description":"This report describes the characteristics of the 100 largest public elementary and secondary school districts in the United States and its jurisdictions. These districts are defined as the 100 largest according to the size of their student population. The information in this report was provided by state education agency officials to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for inclusion in the Common Core of Data (CCD). The report uses data from the 2005-06 school year and includes student membership and staff in public schools and school districts in the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the Bureau of Indian Education, the Department of Defense dependents schools (overseas and domestic), and the four outlying areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). This report also includes graduate counts, high school dropout rates, and graduation rates for the 2004-05 school year and revenues and expenditures for fiscal year (FY) 2005.  Highlights of the report include the following: (1) The 100 largest public school districts, representing less than 1 percent (0.6 percent) of all school districts in the United States and jurisdictions, were responsible for the education of 23 percent of all public school students (table 1); (2) The 100 largest public school districts employed 22 percent of the United States and jurisdictions' public school full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers and contained 17 percent of all public schools and 20 percent of public high school completers (table 1); (3) The 100 largest public school districts had larger average school enrollments compared to the average for all school districts (695 vs. 518) as well as a higher median pupil/teacher ratio (15.9 vs. 15.4) (table 1); (4) The percentage of students in the 100 largest public school districts who were other than White, non-Hispanic was 71 percent, compared to 44 percent of students in all school districts (table 2); (5) In FY 2005, current expenditures per pupil in the 100 largest public school districts ranged from lows of $5,104 in the Puerto Rico Department of Education and $5,503 in the Alpine District, Utah to a high of $18,878 in the District of Columbia Public Schools and $17,988 in Boston, Massachusetts (table A-14); and (6) Three states--California, Florida, and Texas--accounted for 45 percent of the 100 largest public school districts (table D-3).

        "description":"This annual report provides detailed information concerning tuition and mandatory fees at public higher institutions in the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education's (WICHE's) 15-state region, including an institution-by-institution historical review of tuition changes from year to year as well as a 10-year average. Also included are comparisons of tuition and fees by Carnegie Classification based on the 2005 Carnegie Classification of Higher Education Institutions. Among the key findings of an annual survey were that the average tuition and fees for resident undergraduates in 2007-08 at public four-year institutions in the region were $4,789, an increase over the previous year of $367 (8.3 percent). After adjusting for inflation, the change in average resident undergraduate tuition in the region was 5.2 percent over 2006-07. Tuition and fees for resident in-district students at public two-year colleges in the WICHE states, excluding California, averaged $2,391 in 2007-08, an increase of $91 (3.9 percent). Differential pricing is occurring in several public institutions in the West, though it is not yet a widespread practice. Appended are: (1) The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education; (2) Number of Public Four-Year Institutions by Carnegie Classification in the WICHE Region, 2007-08; (3) Number of Public Two-Year Institutions by State in the WICHE Region, 2007-08; (4) Procedure for Converting Current Dollars to Constant Dollars; (5) Methodology; (6) Mandatory Fees at Public Four-Year Institutions in the WICHE Region, 2007-08; (7) Mandatory Fees at Public Two-Year Institutions in the WICHE Region, 2007-08; (8) Differential Tuition Policies at Public Four-Year Colleges; (9) Differential Tuition Policies at Public Two-Year Colleges; and (10) Survey Instructions.

        "description":"Advanced information, communication, computation and collaboration technologies, known as  &quot;cyberinfrastructure,&quot; have become essential elements for research, education, and innovation in the 21st century. A major challenge confronting the United States today is how to ensure that all colleges and universities, including those that have not traditionally benefited from leading-edge research infrastructure, can participate seamlessly in national and multinational cyberinfrastructure-enabled efforts. The minority-serving-institution community has unique expertise, knowledge, and resources to share. Western leaders from the fields of science, education and cyberinfrastructure recognize an urgent need for  action. Participants in the 2006 &quot;Lariat Summit on Minority Institutions and Cyberinfrastructure in the West&quot; gathered in Bozeman, Montana to develop strategies and recommendations for connecting minority-serving institutions in the West to national advanced cyberinfrastructure. This document is a first step towards developing both the will and the resources to ensure that minority-serving institutions are among the   &quot;connected&quot; institutions in the Western states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, and Washington.

The Quality School Project is a joint effort of the DC Office of the State Superintendent of Education, the 21st Century School Fund, the Brookings Institution, and the Urban Institute. While the city's overall population is growing, the number of school-age children living in the District is actually in decline. The availability of quality public schools, especially near housing that is appropriate for and affordable to families, will help determine how successful the city can be in attracting and retaining families with children. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (the OSSE) commissioned this project to study the patterns of school supply and student demand in order to better understand the choices parents are making in choosing schools, the relationship between school choice and school quality, and between school choice and neighborhood development. The Quality Schools Project will explore policy changes that can improve the availability of and access to quality school options throughout the city. The Quality Schools Project is divided into three phases. This Phase One report provides a comprehensive profile of the supply of public primary and secondary educational schools in the District and of the students attending these schools in the 2006-07 school year. This report addresses questions such as: What types of public schools are available in the District and who is attending them? How do students get access to various types of public schools? Where are students attending school? Where do students live in relation to the schools they attend? The Phase One report looks at patterns of school supply and student enrollment across the full spectrum of public education options in the city: DC Public Schools (DCPS), public charter schools, and voucher-supported private schools.

There are many specific skills and competencies that young people will need to succeed, but more than particular skills, they will need the cognitive capacity to educate themselves throughout their entire lives. Young people need the ability for complex reasoning and the self-confidence to apply it in new situations. These are precisely the skills that are developed in higher-level mathematics courses, beginning with the foundational Algebra I and extending beyond Algebra II, in which students begin to use abstract reasoning to solve complex problems. Since higher-level mathematics is the foundation for success in college and careers, we must change the way we approach mathematics and understand the importance of higher-level mathematics for all students. This paper explores the intellectual and practical benefits to all students of taking higher-level mathematics courses, through and beyond Algebra II, or its equivalent, during high school.",

        "description":"Today, society has a greater understanding of what constitutes children at risk.  Unlike years past, educators within society can no longer take the luxury of ignoring students facing emotional and social challenges.  Instead, they must respond quickly and positively to the needs of students faced with many of these challenges by developing programs to address their unmet needs.  In addition, with the growing understanding of the nature of both family systems and education systems, educators can target behavior patterns among identified family systems as they recognize them.  This paper first examines today's school-aged students' vulnerabilities and needs, particularly those in rural areas, using Maine as an example.  It then proposes the creation of a new position, the Family Education Consultant, to assist strained rural families by helping them develop support systems to address identified needs.

        "description":"The correlation between positive and negative group interactions and one or another of individuals' attitudes or characteristics--moral development, critical thinking, resilience, and self efficacy--has been examined previously. However, no systemic examination of individuals' development of patterns of these characteristics and those patterns' potential correlations with either positive or negative group interactions has ever been conducted. Building on divergent previous research, including intergroup salience and acceptance research and group dynamics research, this paper posits the importance of examining individuals' positive or negative group interaction behaviors and attitudes not just as individual factors, but as systemic patterns among factors such as critical thinking, moral, resilience, and self-efficacy development. The reality is that most, if not all, individuals will not develop each of these skill areas optimally. Knowledge about the nature of these patterns and their correlations to intergroup interactions would allow expansive social change if used to foster development of positive patterns and help ameliorate negative patterns in future adults through the development of appropriate educational and community-based programs.",

The majority of those doing the course are working primary teachers from a variety of backgrounds. The first part of the course consists of the history and philosophy of science, whilst the second part concerns science issues. The reason that I introduced some basic principles of ethics into the course, was so that, as a group, we could try to use some common benchmarks to judge the different issues that students presented to us. This was the starting point and in the paper I will discuss a number of case studies that have aroused some interest and debate. It is hoped that there will be some time for discussion of other scientific issues that colleagues may like to raise.

The participating schools served predominantly Caucasian students in suburban and rural areas. Approximately 30% of students at these schools received free or reduced lunch. Parents, students and school staff were asked to complete the Indicators of School Quality survey, which includes items regarding parent support, teacher excellence, student commitment, school leadership, instructional quality, resource management, and school safety. An average of 1098 parents, 159 teachers, and 3108 students completed surveys each year across the three years. School staff tended to rate their schools more positively on average than parents. Female students, younger students, and students claiming ethnic majority status all tended to rate their schools higher than other students. These results suggest that administrators could benefit from understanding how stakeholders differ in their perceptions of school quality, particularly as they engage in school improvement efforts.

        "description":"War is so devastating that if at all possible, it should be avoided. But if reasoning and negotiation fail to yield peace between nations and countries and war results, the loss to children must be minimized. In the last decade, two million children have been killed in wars and conflicts, 4.5 million have been disabled and 12 million have been left homeless.  Environmental damage due to the use of nuclear and chemical weaponry is horrendous; there are higher cancer and disease rates as well as higher rates of offspring born with birth defects. Also, disproportionate spending on war takes funding away from programs that improve the quality of life (Marshall, 2004). Children must be kept in mind during times of war; they  need to be with their parents, protected within their home communities and have basic health, educational and social services. In as much as education is the foundation on which all professional and service endeavors are built, any decision for engagement in war must protect the educational system; there must be contingency plans in place to safeguard children and meet their developmental needs. This presentation focuses on the issue of war and how it impacts school children. It addresses war as a last-resort strategy, but because of the probability of war continuing to occur, means are offered for various sectors of society to minimize the loss for school children.

Administered in 1986, the tests revealed the disheartening answer: not enough. Unfortunately, today there is no good measure of how much our children know about American history and literature. In this issue of &quot;Education Outlook,&quot; the author describes a new study he authored for the Washington, DC-based nonprofit Common Core to fill this void and determine just how much today's seventeen-year-olds know about history and literature. His study found that America's seventeen-year-olds fare rather poorly when it comes to familiarity with major historical events and significant literary accomplishments. Perhaps these results should not come as a great surprise. For all the attention paid to school improvement in recent years, particularly at the high school level, the focus has been on reading, math, and graduation, a focus that has not served the broader aim of ensuring that our children are educated in the liberal arts and sciences. The author presents five recommendations deserving attention. (Contains 2 tables and 8 notes.)",

        "description":"Some four decades after the advent of collective bargaining in public education, the labor agreements it has produced now touch virtually all aspects of school district operations, from how teachers are paid and assigned to how they can be evaluated, how or whether they can be disciplined or fired, when and where they complete professional development, and how much time off they are allowed for union activities. In &quot;The Leadership Limbo,&quot; the authors of this issue of &quot;Education Outlook&quot; examined how much flexibility school leaders enjoy on key dimensions of management in America's fifty largest school districts. Culling data from the National Council on Teacher Quality's collective bargaining database, and sorting them out into twelve key components within three categories--teacher compensation, personnel policies, and work rules--they graded each district on a scale of A to F based on the degree of flexibility it granted school leaders, allowing readers to identify and compare the most and least management-friendly contract language on a variety of important issues. Their study find that the problem is less that collective bargaining agreements prohibit leaders from acting and more that they are murky; they send mixed signals about the bounds of permissible action; or they conflict with federal, state, judicial, or district practices and policies. There is a need to move on multiple fronts to promote flexibility for district and school leaders--and to ensure that leaders are prepared for their roles and held accountable for using their authority effectively. Four recommendations based on their research are presented. (Contains 2 tables and 6 notes.)",

        "description":"This guide is designed as a resource for leaders and evaluators of K-12 online learning programs. In this guide, the term &quot;online learning&quot; is used to refer to a range of education programs and resources in the K-12 arena, including distance learning courses offered by universities, private providers, or teachers at other schools; stand-alone &quot;virtual schools&quot; that provide students with a full array of online courses and services; and educational Web sites that offer teachers, parents, and students a range of resources. The guide features seven evaluations that represent variety in both the type of program or resource being evaluated, and in the type of evaluation. These evaluations were selected because they offer useful lessons to others who are planning to evaluate an online learning program or resource. Part I of this guide focuses on some of the likely challenges faced by online program evaluators, and it is organized into the following sections: (1) Meeting the Needs of Multiple Stakeholders; (2) Building on the Existing Base of Knowledge; (3) Evaluating Multifaceted Online Resources; (4) Finding Appropriate Comparison Groups; (5) Solving Data Collection Problems; (6) Interpreting the Impact of Program Maturity; and (7) Translating Evaluation Findings Into Action. Part II synthesizes the lessons learned from meeting those challenges and offers recommendations based as well on research and conversations with experts in evaluating online learning. These are geared to program leaders who are considering an evaluation and to assist them and their evaluators as they work together  to design and complete the process. Brief profiles of each of the seven online programs  can be found at the end of the guide, and details about each evaluation are summarized in  table 1. For readers who are less familiar with evaluation, a glossary of common terms is included. Appended are a list of resources for further information about evaluating online learning and the research methodology used in this guide. (Contains 4 figures, 2 tables, and 19 notes.)

        "description":"The &quot;Gaskin&quot; settlement resulted from a class action lawsuit brought on the behalf of students with significant disabilities in Pennsylvania. With the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 2004 and the &quot;Gaskin&quot; settlement, schools in Pennsylvania are mandated to increase the placement of students with disabilities in the general education classroom. The purpose of this research was to investigate principals' attitudes as they relate to the &quot;Gaskin&quot; Settlement in Pennsylvania. This important case demonstrates what may happen in other states if the supports and services are not available to fully include children with disabilities, as per the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 2004. There is little written about this topic and yet the ramifications for schools are great. Since the &quot;Gaskin&quot; settlement has an impact on the roles and responsibilities of school principals, a study was conducted to assess their attitudes toward the &quot;Gaskin&quot; Settlement. Survey responses from 446 principals were compiled as part of this project. The findings from chi square tests of goodness of fit indicate that elementary principals report a more positive opinion of the &quot;Gaskin&quot; settlement than do secondary principals or principals of &quot;other&quot; secondary institutions (such as charter schools, vocational technical schools, magnet schools, etc.). Scheduling of courses and staff discomfort are conjectured as possible reasons for this relationship. In addition to affecting the public schools in Pennsylvania, the implications go far beyond and will impact colleges and universities in their teacher preparation programs. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Perfectionism has been related to an individual's academic performance and mental health. Western research on perfectionism has shown inconsistent factor structures of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS). This study recruited 283 high school students ranging from 15 to 18 years old from urban areas in Taipei to examine factors of perfectionism in different cultures. Confirmatory factor analyses were applied to evaluate how well the following four perfectionism models fit: Frost's six-factor, Stober's four-factor, Stumpf's four-order, and Stumpf's two second-order models. None of the models examined fit well. Nevertheless, Frost's six-factor model was superior to the others. Results imply that the current perfectionism models in the West cannot appropriately describe dimensions of perfectionism of adolescents in Taipei.",

For the past 35 years diagnoses of DID, previously referred to as Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), have increased exponentially, causing various psychological researchers and clinicians to question the validity of this disorder. DID is, however, currently recognized by the DSM-IV-TR as a true psychological disorder that emerges, most commonly, as a result of early childhood sexual abuse (DSM-IV-TR, 1994; Haddock, 2001; Zimbardo, Johnson, & Weber, 2006; Comer, 2007; Lev-Wiesel, 2005). In this essay I will first provide background information on DID, and identify and define the terminology commonly associated with the disorder. Second, I will discuss treatment modality, in addition to options for health insurance coverage. Third, I will discuss the argument of Dr. August Piper and Harold Merskey that contradicts the validity of DID. And lastly, I will address the ethical importance of recognizing DID as a severe and complicated disorder that continues to defy a mechanistic definition.",

The project is intended to contribute to the CWDC's ability to support and develop the children's workforce. The main aim of the project was to conduct a literature review and supplementary investigation of the range of issues around and approaches to working with Travellers, Irish Travellers, Gypsies, Roma and Showpeople, and the support, training and other programs available to staff involved. The study will reflect the wider range of services working with children and families, including education services. The project sought to learn: (1) the main findings on existing best practice in support, training and provision of information in relation to the groups examined; (2) the gaps in support, training and information exist for those working with children, young people and families; and (3) what needs to be put in place to support those working with these groups through training, information provision and support. The project aimed to produce a review of the most relevant evidence of good practice in provision of services to Travellers, Irish Travellers, Gypsies, Roma and Showpeople, with evidence of what works, particularly in relation to information, training and support requirements and provision. The report is accompanied by an annotated bibliography [see ED501878] which relays a range of issues and approaches to working with Travellers, Irish Travellers, Gypsies, Roma and Showpeople.

        "description":"Accelerated middle schools are self-contained academic programs designed to help middle school students who are behind grade level catch up with their age peers. If these students begin high school with other students their age, the hope is that they will be more likely to stay in school and graduate. The programs serve students who are one to two years behind grade level and give them the opportunity to cover an additional year of curriculum during their one to two years in the program. Accelerated middle schools can be structured as separate schools or as schools within a traditional middle school. One study of accelerated middle schools met the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards, and two studies met them with reservations. The three randomized controlled trials included more than 800 students in school districts in Georgia, Michigan, and New Jersey. Based on the three, the WWC considers the extent of evidence for accelerated middle schools to be medium to large for the staying in school and progressing in school domains. The studies did not examine relevant outcomes in the completing school domain. (Contains 6 footnotes.)

        "description":"This literature review was commissioned by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) to draw together current and recent studies of integrated working, in order to build an overview of the theories and models of such working. The review is important for current work on evaluating the early impact of integrated children's services and informing the direction of further work in this area. The review aimed to: (1) collate and analyse findings on models and theories of multi-agency working, integration and collaboration from relevant sources identified in recent and current NFER literature reviews in these areas; (2) collect any further relevant sources that involve model and theory building in integrated services, and analyse these sources to audit examples of theories and models of integrated working; and (3) present an overview or meta-analysis of models and theories in the area of integrated working. The report therefore represents a synthesis and meta-analysis of the most relevant evidence of models and theories of integrated working, primarily drawn from children's services research, but also including other transferable research on integrated working that focuses on models and theoretical analyses. Criteria for inclusion in the review included: (1) a focus on empirically based research (rather than descriptions of practice); (2) a focus on models and theories of integrated working/services (for example, multi-agency, collaborative, partnership, interagency and so on) within children's services; (3) inclusion of other research on integrated working that focuses on models and theoretical analyses, not captured in the above reviews, for example, concerning adult services; (4) literature published from 2000 onwards; and (5) literature that refers to the UK context (although some international literature has been included if particularly pertinent). Thirty-five sources met the criteria. The review findings are presented under thematic headings which reflect the main dimensions of the models and theories of integrated working. These dimensions comprise: (1) the extent of integration: the &quot;stage&quot; or depth of the collaborative activity in integrated services; (2) the integration of structures: layers of an organisation's functioning, for example, governance and strategic levels, and frontline operational service delivery levels; (3) the integration of processes: the ordering of work activities across time and place, at different organisational levels; and (4) the reach of integration: the extent to which partnerships in integrated services reach out to include diverse agencies. Each section of the report discusses different models of integration and identifies the challenges, enablers and impacts across each of the main dimensions. Overarching issues that arise from the integration of services are also discussed. Appended are: (1) Definition of terms relating to multi-agency activity; and (2) Search strategy.

Further work was then undertaken to explore the overall role of the LMCS in more detail, including the manageability of the role; arrangements for continuity; and support and training issues. The research consisted of three phases: (1) an audit of the role of the Lead Member for Children's Services as corporate parent via the completion of a proforma (March-April 2007). A total of 169 proformas were sent to Lead Members in 151 LAs, and 74 were returned; a response rate of 44 percent of Lead Members and 49 percent of local authorities in England; (2) telephone interviews with 32 Lead Members for Children's Services to explore the wider remit of the role (May-July 2007); and (3) case studies in five local authorities to explore the LMCS role in greater depth (including a focus on good practice relating to various aspects of the role) (August-October 2007). This involved telephone interviews with LMCS, DCS and a range of other professionals and partners working and interacting with the LMCS. This summary includes three of the case-studies.

An academic library is defined as an entity in a  postsecondary institution that provides all of the following: An organized collection of printed or other materials, or a combination thereof; a staff trained to provide and interpret such materials as required to meet the informational, cultural, recreational, or educational needs of the clientele; an established schedule in which services of the staff are available to the clientele; and the physical facilities necessary to support such a collection, staff, and schedule. This definition includes libraries that are part of learning resource centers. Branch and independent libraries are defined as auxiliary library service outlets with quarters separate from the central library that houses the basic collection. The central library administers the branches. In ALS, libraries on branch campuses that have separate NCES identification numbers are reported as separate libraries. These academic libraries are informational resources within degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the United States, including institutions that are eligible for Title IV aid and branch campuses of Title IV-eligible institutions. When academic libraries are referred to in this report, they will always be entities that are part of the degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the United States, including institutions that are eligible for Title IV aid and branch campuses of Title IV, eligible institutions.

        "author":["Kispal, Anne"],
        "description":"Skills of inference are needed not just to be able to \"read between the lines,\" to detect the unspoken hidden meanings that enrich overall understanding of a text or to draw one's own personal conclusions about a text. They are needed for all the other tasks that teachers want their children to do in handling texts: to understand the effects achieved through choices in vocabulary, to recognize what the writer is trying to accomplish through the whole text and to appreciate what the impact on the reader may be. Almost any reading activity that goes beyond literal understanding involves some degree of inference. A literature review to uncover what is known about the reading skills of inference and deduction was conducted in late 2007, under contract to the Department for Children, Schools and Families. The specific purpose was to distill implications for teaching from academic research. Much of the literature concerned the nature of inference and the taxonomies of different types of inference that various researchers had identified. The search was guided by four research questions: (1) Are there different skills within inference? (2) How can pupils best be taught to use inference skills? (3) What strategies are most effective in teaching inference skills to pupils of different ages/abilities? and (4) What does progression in inference look like and how can it be supported? Overall, few studies explicitly investigating best methods for teaching skills were identified. A key finding of the review was that the ability to draw inferences predetermines reading skills: that is, poor inferencing causes poor comprehension and not vice versa. Practical suggestions for teachers for inference instruction are also presented in this report. (Contains 3 tables.)",

The council and its partner agencies wanted to find out what children and young people thought about a range of issues related to the five Every Child Matters (ECM) outcomes. The  purpose of the research was to provide information to support self-evaluation and planning for improvement at county, cluster and school level. The study involved two specifically-designed questionnaire surveys: one for primary pupils (aged 7-11) and one for secondary and college students, including those participating in work-based learning (aged 11-19). Pupils in special schools and pupil referral units were also included in both surveys. In total, 31,527 children aged 7 - 11 from 382 schools took part in the paper-based primary school survey. It was administered in schools, at a class level, by teachers. A total of 11,305 children and young people aged 11-19 from 98 secondary schools and other educational provision completed the secondary online survey. The 42,832 children and young people who took part in the survey were generally representative of all children and young people aged 7-19 in Kent according to the following characteristics: gender, looked after children, free school meals, special educational needs, speakers of a first language other than English, and year group. The key findings are presented under the five ECM outcomes: (1) Being healthy; (2) Staying safe; (3) Enjoying and achieving; (4) Making a positive contribution; and (5) Achieving economic well-being. Overall, the survey findings were relatively positive in relation to the five ECM outcomes. Children and young people had a good understanding of  &quot;being healthy&quot;, of the activities, inside and outside of school or college, that they enjoyed participating in and which helped them to learn. They also had a good awareness of economic well-being and had positive aspirations for their future. The main issues appeared to be in relation to two of the five outcomes - staying safe and making a positive contribution--where there were particular areas highlighted that required further attention.

It also explored the overall role, including issues like manageability; commissioning; partnership working; engaging with the end user; arrangements for continuity; and training. The report draws on the data from all three phases of the research and is set out in three parts: Part One draws on data from the phase 1 proforma returns to explore the LMCS role as corporate parent. Part Two presents details from phase 2 telephone interviews examining the wider role of LMCS (with additional case-study interview data inserted in text boxes throughout). Part Three presents illustrative case studies to outline specific aspects of good practice in relation to the LMCS role in partnership working, commissioning and devolved commissioning, corporate parenting and engaging with end-users. Among the key findings were that there is a diversity in the ways the Lead Member for Children's Services role is undertaken in different authorities, with variation in the time said to be committed to the role; the amount of information, training and support lead members think they receive; and how involved they were in national and regional networks. The effectiveness of the LMCS role involves three core elements: partnership; proactivity and proximity. (Contains 13 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"This study aimed to identify the pathways, intentions and relevant perceptions of (non-UK) European Union (EU) students entering English higher education. It sought to identify why students wished to obtain an English HE qualification, their attitudes towards the uptake and repayment of tuition fee loans and their future career plans. Drawing on longitudinal data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) and from a national survey of (non-UK) EU students in English Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), it aimed to provide a better understanding of their views on (and use of) the Student Loans system, in order to inform government policy and strategy in this area. Following chapter 1, Introduction, this report divides into 4 more chapters. Chapter 2 provides a national profile of non-UK EU students studying in England, the courses they were following and their post-graduation destinations, where known. It also provides a profile of the non-UK EU students who responded to the survey, examining their routes to higher education in England, their reasons for coming to England and their expectations with regard to academic, economic and social provision in English universities. Chapter 3 explores the financial circumstances of non-UK EU students, looking at their expectations and experiences, their knowledge and take-up of financial support mechanisms (particularly tuition fee loans) and their approaches to debt and to the repayment of loans. In Chapter 4 the report looks at the factors that appear to be predictors of the post-graduation status of both UK and non-UK EU students, drawing on the HESA destinations survey data, before exploring the plans of the non-UK EU students who responded to the survey. Finally, in Chapter 5, the implications of the findings from the study, particularly in relation to student pathways, intentions and financial and occupational behavior, are summarized and explored. Throughout the report, references are made to the 42 tables that can be found in Appendix 3. Other appendices include (1) Drawing the Sample; (2) EU Member States and Date of Accession; (4) Changes in Non-UK EU Population; and (5) Higher Education Institution Recruitment and Liaison.

This second phase of research, focusing on teachers' views, builds on the findings produced from the initial phase, looking at provision of the work of built environment education providers in the three regions. This research will be used to develop an overall sense of how &quot;fit for purpose&quot; the built environment sector is in terms of meeting school requirements. The report draws on data from the two strands of the research. Following the summary of findings and an introductory chapter, the report is divided into five main chapters as follows: Chapter Three discusses teachers', headteachers' and governors' current awareness and use of the built environment as a learning resource. Chapter Four considers the services, resources and support teachers, headteachers and governors need or already access from built environment education. Chapter Five highlights the perceived challenges and facilitators to using education focusing on buildings and local places within teaching. Chapter Six looks at what school staff think will encourage greater school take-up of built environment education opportunities. Chapter Seven concludes the report by providing an overview of the key findings. (Contains 1 box, 4 tables, 17 figures, and 1 footnote.)",

It was set up by DCMS to develop an approach that can make people more aware of the learning opportunities available in the built environment and to &quot;unlock&quot; the educational potential for schools of the historic and contemporary built environment. &quot;Engaging Places&quot; hopes to increase schools' engagement with the built environment by developing a national advocacy network which can harness and improve the delivery of the built environment learning services to schools. This report summarizes two research projects which independently considered the supply side (built environment education providers) and the demand/audience side (teachers/schools) of built environment education. Both sets of research focused on three pilot regions (London, the South East and Yorkshire and the Humber). The report describes the key findings and issues from the research. &quot;Engaging Places&quot; may be the effective vehicle to develop and promote the role and value of buildings, places, and spaces in teaching.

The main focus of this research is to determine if the students with disabilities feel included by their peers and teachers as active and important members in the class. The qualitative research was conducted using semi-structured, one-on-one interviews with three students with mild learning disabilities in an inclusive English Language Arts class. Observations during a period of three months were also used in this research to obtain student interactions with peers and staff, as well as responsibilities and roles the students maintained. The most significant results were obtained from the interviews with the three subjects in the study. Two of the three students, when asked about disabilities, only associated physical handicaps with the word; they did not think of themselves as having a disability of any kind. The other student commented that she used to have a disability, but since then has been corrected and wasn't disabled anymore. Overall, the students liked their classes and the help they received from the staff. All of the students interacted well with their peers in class; some held classroom responsibilities everyday such as helping with attendance and homework collection. Appended are: (1) Key areas interviews were concerned with; (2) Types of information to be looked for via observation; and (3) Category and sub-categories regarding interviews and observations.

A mixed method design using simultaneous methodologies was employed. For the quantitative methods, an experimental design was used, with the school as the basis of randomization. The qualitative methods used interviews, focus groups, and observation. Data were collected on the macro- and micro-level using the theoretical framework of context, process, and outcomes. The results of the study are presented in terms of the strengths of the model and the limitations, based on examples from results of two years of evaluations. The model's strengths were the mixed methodology model, the theoretical framework, macro-level and micro-level approach, and the School Social Behavior Scales. Limitations included referral rate data and the conflict resolution training pre-test and post-test. Concluding statements suggest that the model can be used in evaluating other violence prevention programs. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Starting from a two-year infant to an adult, stress takes an entry in different forms but it alters the normal functioning of a person. One cannot eliminate stress but can reduce stress in their life. The stressors are normative demands and critical life events. Normative stressors include appearance, school grades, employment, relationships, educational plans, careers, personal health, self-esteem etc. Others include lack of social resources, relationship with peers, family and altruistic issues like poverty, gender inequality etc. The stressors are responsible for low self-esteem among adolescent students, increase in antisocial behaviour, rise in anxiety, drug abuse and even to the extent of suicide. In order to provide comprehensive measurement of stress experienced by students in general and higher secondary students in particular, the investigator and his supervisor had developed Students' Stress Rating Scale (SSRS). The tool was developed through factor analysis, which consists of 35 items and were grouped under five factors namely Physiological, Emotional, Social, Examination and Behaviourial Stress.

The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) has reservations about the results because they may be affected by differences between the research groups that were not controlled for in the analysis. Strengths recognized by WWC include: Used statistical procedures to match similar middle and elementary schools. The following cautions were identified. Despite statistical matching, there were still some differences in the characteristics of the two groups of schools. For example, middle schools were in larger districts and had fewer economically disadvantaged students. The study authors used statistical techniques to adjust for these differences. However, differences in district policies, characteristics of the student body, and other factors not controlled for in the analysis may affect the results.

The research described in this manuscript is consistent with the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards with reservations. Strengths recognized by WWC include: Used differences in the timing of APIP implementation across schools to estimate effects. The following cautions were identified. The study compared schools that had implemented APIP to those that had not yet done so. It also examined whether a school's outcomes improved after APIP implementation. Schools implementing APIP early and later in the study period may have differed in ways not controlled for in the analysis. In addition, APIP may have been more likely to be implemented in schools that were about to improve anyway--because of new school leadership, for example. If so, the study might have produced misleading results.

In North America, Europe and other advantaged regions, this is supported by cultural consensus, legal mandate and enriched resources; and teachers routinely receive advanced training to support inclusive outcomes. This is not typical in other, less advantaged, regions where teachers struggle to educate all students, including those with disabilities. They achieve much on behalf of their students despite serious cultural and technical challenges. They often do so without specialized training common in more advantaged settings. For these teachers, e-learning offers an opportunity to acquire critical information and skills that are otherwise unavailable. The purpose of this presentation is to report on research in progress regarding: (1) Identifying common cultural and technical challenges to e-learning experienced by educators in less advantaged regions and countries; (2) Identifying information critical to e-support for international teachers engaged in educating and including children with disabilities; and (3) Incorporating this information into prototype, e-leaning modules that minimize challenges and maximize access to information for teachers of children with disabilities in regions where comparable training is limited.",

The passage of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) [Public Law 105-220] by the 105th Congress has ushered in a new era of collaboration, coordinator, cooperation and accountability. The overall goal of the Act is to increase the employment, retention, and earnings of participants, and increase occupational skill attainment by participants, and, as a result improve the quality of the workforce, reduce welfare dependency, and enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the Nation. The key principles inculcated in the Act are: streamlining services; empowering; individuals universal access; increased accountability; new roles for local boards; state and local flexibility; and improved youth programs. The purpose of Title II, The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, is to create a partnership among the Federal government, states, and localities to provide, on a voluntary basis, adult basic education and literacy services in order to assist: (1) adults to become literate and obtain the knowledge and skills necessary for employment and self-sufficiency; (2) adults who are parents obtain the educational skills necessary to become full partners in the educational development of their children; and (3) adults in the completion of a secondary school education.

In an attempt to take as many hindering variables out of this process, such as test anxiety, socioeconomic influences, and latency in cognition, Improvisation: A Complement to Curriculum seeks to provide an aerodynamic attachment to existing instructional designs intended to warm up the neuro-pathways of synthesis and cognitive response. Through the application of improvisational based ice breakers and exercises with scaleable levels of risk written to approach learning styles as architected by Multiple Intelligence theory, students will develop their natural proficiency for synthesis and recognition in an environment that mimics real-life decision making. One of the challenges with improvisational based methodologies has been data to show measurable growth. With the use of authentic assessment, specifically portfolio and performance models, as well as subsequent traditional testing applications, evidence can be gathered to demonstrate improvement in overall academic achievement with the correct implementation of improvisational methodologies.

        "title":"Corroborating the Role of L[subscript 1] Awareness in FL Pedagogy",
        "author":["Paradowski, Michal B."],
        "description":"Underlying the mainstream of current SLA research is the Ansatz that some level of attention to the formal aspects of language is necessary for acquisition to take place. It is self-evident and commonsensical that focusing on specific linguistic aspects helps the learner to acquire and internalise them. Numerous recent studies investigated the complex relationships between the role of cognitive processes (consciousness, attention, awareness, detection) and the process of language learning, and there is nearly global consensus among researchers that some degree of attention to problematic aspects of the input seems be essential for understanding and learning to occur. At the same time, learning invariably proceeds by relating new facts to the already familiar (which is why we learn in terms of prototypes). This is particularly vital in the process of foreign language learning (FLL). In this context the familiar is, of course, the student's mother tongue (L[subscript 1]). It is therefore incumbent that this resource be actively capitalised on by the teacher. Drawing on the learner's L[subscript 1] (or another mastered language) and showing comparisons and contrasts between this and the target mirrors, facilitates, and accelerates the processes which occur independently in his/her mind. The role of pedagogic intervention is unquestionable, as transfer of operations from the L[subscript 1] to the FL usually requires additional correction and clarification (cf. A. A. Leontiev 1981:28). This is not, however, the end of the story. The basic reason why we look for familiar orientation points and similarities when in new circumstances is our natural need for safety. We feel more comfortable and at ease at home, in our district and city, than at a new venue, even though the latter may be objectively better-appointed, more attractive and safer, just because in the former we could take more things for granted. This is also why the target language should literally be taught in the framework of the learner's L[subscript 1]--as in the Language Interface Model (LIM; Gozdawa-Golebiowski 2003a). This proceeds from an explication of how grammar rules operate in the learners' L[subscript 1], through an explanation of relevant L[subscript 2] rules and subsequent modification of the L[subscript 1] rule to accommodate L[subscript 2] data, with practice first expecting the learner to apply the FL rules to L[subscript 1] (!) examples, to finally end with competence expansion. The LIM allows the learner to link new language items with his/her present knowledge or experience; i.e., placing them within his/her Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky 1934/1962). By such a gradual, multi-stage method the learners gain command of the FL system before actually starting to use the operational principles in the TL itself. The juxtaposition and use of L[subscript 1] and L[subscript 2] rules alongside help the latter merge with the former (leading to the development of linguistic multicompetence) and thus, hopefully, submerge to the subconscious, indicating that the material has become successfully automatized and internalized. This novel, eclectic method is supplemented with learner-friendly insights from generative syntax and cognitive semantics. A controlled longitudinal classroom experiment carried out on secondary-school students (n=284) across a representative range of grammar areas reveals appreciably improved results of experimental groups over control groups not only in a follow-up test, but also in a deferred post-test, thus corroborating the importance of explicit learning, attention, and L[subscript 1] awareness in interlanguage development.

        "author":["Oz, Huseyin"],
        "description":"This article reports on a study that investigated metacognitive knowledge or beliefs about language learning of 470 Turkish EFL learners in secondary education. The primary aims of the study were to explore what beliefs Turkish students in secondary education held about learning English as a foreign language (EFL), how their belief systems were organized and whether there were significant differences in belief systems among learner groups according to variables such as social and school contexts, gender, age and grade level. Popular conceptions of language learning were collected using a structured questionnaire based on Horwitz's Beliefs About Language Learning Inventory (BALLI) (1987). An exploratory factor analysis was performed to identify Turkish EFL learners' patterns of beliefs about language learning. Subsequently, various statistical tests were carried out to find out intra- and inter-group variability in belief categories. The results of this study demonstrated that Turkish EFL learners have a broad range of conceptions both similar to and different from those reported in the current literature. It is further evident that learners' metacognitive knowledge or beliefs about language learning have variability in terms of social and educational contexts, age, gender, and stages of language learning. The study also suggested that curriculum designers and decision-makers as well as language instructors attend to the accumulation of metacognitive knowledge or learner beliefs.

        "description":"The &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; Act (2002) requires that all students have access to the general curriculum at their designated grade level. Federal guidance received from the US Department of Education noted that these extended standards are intended only for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. A key goal is to assure that the extended standards represent both the content standards and the range of cognitive skills of all students. A group of approximately 50 regular education teachers, special education teachers, parents, university personnel, school administrators and system administrators convened with staff of the five divisions in three sessions between September 2005, and January 2006, to further delineate the extensions at three entry points. These three entry points were defined as symbolic, early symbolic and pre-symbolic (see Behaviors Demonstrated at Entry Points). The extended standards represent an effort to assure a balance of functional and academic skills within the North Carolina Standard Course of Study. Also, a goal of the extended standards is to provide concepts at a level accessible to the student within a grade-level context. It is critical that the IEP of each student continues to address both academic skills and functional skills necessary to assure positive school and adult outcomes. The intent is to provide the student what he needs to succeed through the IEP and instruction.",

        "description":"The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship between acculturative stress and spirituality among Chinese immigrant college students in the United States. The sample of this study was obtained by utilizing a convenience sample of 63 first-generation Chinese immigrant college students. The participants each received a self-administered questionnaire which was developed to measure their acculturative stress level and spiritual well-being level. The results indicated that there was a significant correlation between acculturative stress level and spiritual well-being. The respondents who had a higher level of spiritual well-being reported having a lower level of acculturative stress. Those who attended church activity on a regular basis, at least once a week, also reported a higher level of spiritual well-being. Findings from this study suggest that spirituality and church involvement could be used as a coping strategy in the face of acculturative stress among Chinese immigrant college students.

Participants for the study were 66 preservice candidates completing student teaching in a large mid-western university. A four-page long questionnaire was administered to gather data. The first part requested demographic information. The second part of the questionnaire was composed of four sections listed above. Scales' grounded in related literature support the content validity of the instrument. All items used a modified Likert scale (the extent to which selected mentoring characteristics are actually used and the extent to which they ideally should be used). Analysis of paired t-tests resulted in significant differences, in which the student teachers' ideal ratings of mentoring practices were higher than their actual ratings.

The objective of the study was to understand how academic libraries help students learn and assist faculty with teaching and research. From March to May 2005, nine Colorado institutions administered two online questionnaires--one to undergraduate students and another to faculty members who teach undergraduate courses. A total of 3,222 undergraduate students and 395 faculty responded. Student surveys indicated they access library resources both remotely and at the library, students have success at finding needed resources at their library, and they use the library website in a variety of ways. Faculty responses indicated that their library supports instructional plans through access to course specific materials and by providing students with library instruction. The study also compares undergraduate library use to faculty use and concluded that faculty use remote library access more than undergraduate students.

The study analyzes data collected from 40 intermediate/advanced nonnative speakers of English enrolled in freshman composition for international students at a large private university. It also examines student reflections on peer review, which indicate that the process is helpful for their writing in many ways. From a Vygotskian perspective, peer review helps students become more aware of their writing needs, and it helps them assume more responsibility for their writing improvement. Further, this research shows ways to train for more successful peer review work, which includes models of helpful student revision comments, and methods to help facilitate better cooperation between peer reviewers. The latter has been seen as essential for successful peer work (Zamel 1985; Anson 1989; Cohen and Cavalcanti 1990; Mangelsdorf and Schlumberger 1992; Nelson and Murphy 1993; Mendonca and Johnson 1994). Ideally, peer review training should also include some cultural awareness training, so that students begin to appreciate the subtle differences in peer responses; this will also be discussed. The teacher-researcher has been using and refining peer review methods for over 6 years, and has confidence in its positive effects on writing improvement.

Such contributions ranged from providing sufficient food and shelter so the students did not have to work to physically forcing them to attend school, to providing assistance with homework and school assignments. The analysis of the data was conducted following general guidelines for qualitative data. The interviews were considered \"narrative\" life stories.

The purpose of this study was to examine the short-term effects of a summer program on the literacy and mathematical development of LEP students in a K-12 urban school setting. A mixed method descriptive design using pre and posttest measures was utilized. The quantitative component included the use of (a) descriptive statistics and (b) two-related-samples nonparametric test (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The assessment instruments that measured students' knowledge in reading and math was administered before and after participation in the summer program. The qualitative component consisted of a focus group conducted with the program teachers. The summer program LEP participants demonstrated an overall statistically significant increase in all reading and mathematics assessment scores from pretest to posttest. The program appears to be working most effectively for students with the least amount of reading and math skills, as measured by scores on pretest. Moreover, teachers' positive feedback regarding progress on the socialization skills necessary for success in the classroom makes the program critically supportive for this at-risk population. Educators need to increase their knowledge of the effects of instructional summer programs on the language acquisition of LEP students in order to improve the students' academic development.

        "description":"&quot;2P1&quot; is the Carl Perkins label for an institution's graduation performance rate. Systems receiving Perkins funds, like Virginia's 23 community colleges, are expected to meet a federally approved 2P1 target rate. For the 3-year period 1999-2001 Virginia Western Community College (VWCC) was one of seven community colleges in the VCCS (Virginia Community College System) that failed to meet the 2P1 target rate. The VCCS defines 2P1 as the percentage of full-time, first-time occupational technical students who graduate within 150 percent of the normal program completion time. Whether the student is enrolled in an Associate, Certificate, or Career Studies program, 150 percent is assumed to be three years. Each Fall produces a new cohort of first-time, full-time OT students; any student in the cohort who earns a degree within the subsequent 3-year period is counted, even if the degree eventually earned is not OT. The small size of the VWCC cohorts enabled transcript data to be analyzed on a student-by-student basis to determine why the 2P1 graduation rate was so low. Recommendations for improving the rate include: a new emphasis on tutoring, especially for African American students; special attention to programs that have zero or low cohort graduation rates; the addition of new Career Studies programs that could be more easily acquired in the first three years as a prelude to the Associate degree; modification of VWCC's graduation policy to address the problem of students who complete graduation requirements but do not apply for graduation; a reinterpretation of the first-time rule for health technology students, most of whom take prerequisite classes before entering an Associate program; and extension of the 3-year period to include the summer of the third year. A preview of the 2003 cohort, whose 3-year span ends with the 2006 spring semester, shows VWCC on the brink of another 2P1 shortfall unless intervention occurs.

Using Eisner's model, the key technology connoisseurs at a state university in the Southeast were interviewed to shed light on the evaluation practices of educational technologies. The results of this study are summarized for those who are interested in alternative evaluation models. The findings should also serve as a guide for technology leaders in making educational improvements. (Contains 6 tables.)",

Results reinforce early studies revealing the intense and fragmented nature of principals' work, but results question whether ISLLC provides sufficient guidance for principals' instructional leadership performance as compared to Kentucky's SISI.

        "author":["King, Deborah Lynn"],
        "description":"The premise of this dissertation is that humans are energetic beings whose lives are influenced by the \"qi\" energy that flows within and around them. An individual's qi energy can be increased or decreased according to how a person lives their life. The profession of teaching is all-consuming. Little time is provided to attend to the holistic self. To maintain strong qi, individuals must attend to the whole self, to their mind, body and spirit. Stress depletes a teacher's mind, body, and spirit of energy. To further complicate these matters, teachers are not aware of self-healing practices that are known to increase energy, decrease stress and tension, and balance the mind, body and spirit. This qualitative phenomenological study examined the professional and personal experiences of 7 rural and urban public school educators. These teachers were instructed in a variety of mind/body/spirit techniques and exercises for a total of six bi-weekly, 2.5 hour sessions. They learned self-healing techniques such as acupressure, deep breathing, visualization and practices such as meditation, intent, Tai Ji Quan, and Qi Gong. The educators included 20 minutes of meditation practice and 20 minutes of movement exercises in their daily routine for two months. Data was gathered from pre and post study interviews, field notes and participant journals. This study identified three domains of knowing that influenced this group of teachers' beliefs and   values--Folkway, Formal and Multi-Dimensional Knowing. Mind/body/spirit practices helped this group of teachers become Multi-Dimensional Knowers and understand their emotional, contemplative, artistic/creative and spiritual selves more deeply. The study also found that the regular use of mind/body/spirit techniques and exercises provided teachers with the ability to transform destructive emotions into energy that was less destructive on the mind/body/spirit and to become more effective at managing stress in their lives.

        "description":"A major challenge to state and jurisdictional policy makers in implementing the Early Intervention Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities, Part C under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), continues to be determining definitions of developmental delay and criteria of eligibility for services to young children, birth through 2 years of age, and their families. Under Part C, participating states and jurisdictions must provide services to two groups of children: those who are experiencing developmental delays, and those who have a diagnosed mental or physical condition that has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay. In addition, states may choose to serve children who are at risk of having substantial developmental delays if early intervention services are not provided. Over the years, several states have revised their definitions: some have narrowed their eligibility criteria and others have expanded them. This paper updates earlier versions of the same title. It provides the most recent information on how the 50 states and 6 jurisdictions that participate in the Part C program define developmental delay and, as applicable, at risk in their definition of eligibility for services.",

The HLM results indicate significant differences among departments in student motivation (2 (31) = 260.90, p is less than 0.000). This variation among university departments suggests that the department-level variables might have accounted for the differences in motivation scores. An Intra-class correlation for this sample is 0.17, indicating that 17% of variance in motivation was among departments. Further, the reliability of the sample mean in any department for the true mean department motivation was 0.82. All three level-1 variables were found to vary among departments. Cross-level interactions showed that main effect of quality of teaching and learning was significant while student satisfaction with course did not provide significant contribution to their learning or to the explanation of the variation in motivation.

Researchers of self-esteem have debated the effects of parental marital status on the self-esteem of adolescents and children in general, and the results have supported differing points of view. To further investigate this topic, the purpose of this thesis was to examine the various impacts of religious, educational, and demographic factors on the self-esteem [and self-actualization] of adolescents from divorced and intact families. Some of the factors investigated were parental marital status, traditional norms and customs, gender, tribal affiliation, and age-group. And where necessary and appropriate, the Igbo native laws, customs, and traditions were used for clarification. Findings suggested that there were no significant differences between gender and tribal affiliations on the self-esteem of adolescents from divorced and intact families in Nigeria. Of note worthy significance was that the Nigerian adolescents from intact and divorced families experienced painful emotional stresses and economic difficulties before and during marriage and, after divorce because of native laws and customs, extended family system, traditional/cultural norms, political influence, religious upbringing, and spousal age at marriage. For obvious reasons, children see divorce as something very traumatic. It is recommended that divorced parents should make time to instill in their child(ren) that both father and mother will still be and act like their parents, discipline them when needed, protect them from harm, follow consistent rules, not lean on the child(ren) for support but will provide support for the child(ren), and love the child(ren) and will remain in their lives. Implications on research and counseling were noted. (Contains 2 tables.) [Master's Thesis, University of Nigeria-Ibadan.]",

        "author":["Neal, Kimberly L."],
        "description":"The purpose of this applied dissertation was to examine the effects of constructivist pedagogy when addressing the issues associated with below proficiency scores in basic skills in mathematics on the state exit exam. Scores of thirty-four 11th and 12th grade students who did not perform at the state-mandated levels of proficiency in basic skills in mathematics on the state exit exam were used for individualizing each of the students' instruction in the computer lab and for matching students together with strengths and weaknesses for peer-assisted instruction and group learning. Collaborative learning, cooperative learning, and computer-assisted instruction were used for a 16-week period. Results indicated that the applied dissertation program utilizing constructivist teaching strategies to improve mathematics outcomes for high school students was effective in two of the four identified outcomes. The program was effective in improving the scores of students repeating the state mandated exit exam and improving student motivation, however, the program was less effective in improving in-class achievement test scores. Nor was the program effective in improving classroom grades, in mathematics, of the students in the program. None-the-less, the pre- and post test data did show an improvement for 91% of the students after implementation of the applied dissertation program. It is recommended that further research be completed using a student group not enrolled in a class set-up specifically for remediation of basic skills, that teacher in-service be provided on constructivist methods to enable the teachers to understand the importance of these methods and to correctly implement the use of them, that the class students are required to take, if they scored below standard on their first or second attempt on the mathematics subtest on the state mandated exit exam, be changed from a required elective to a suggested elective, and it is recommended that additional training be provided on technology use so that teachers can best provide programs that are tailored to the individual students needs. The Student Questionnaire Form is appended. [Ed.D. Applied Dissertation, Nova Southeastern University.]",

        "description":"In 2005, Alberta's Minister of Advanced Education initiated a comprehensive exercise to establish a new vision for the province's advanced education system. Through the A Learning Alberta initiative, a revised vision and new policy outcomes for Alberta's advanced education system will be articulated. A key question of A Learning Alberta is how to ensure that opportunities are available to every Albertan to advance their education - to maximize their own potential as well as to contribute to their communities and the continued prosperity of the province now and in the future. To explore the issues impacting accessibility, information was gathered on policies and programs, and recent research and consultation reports were reviewed. This paper discusses the multidimensional nature of access; describes learning pathways for youth; summarizes the advanced education system with a focus on foundation skills and basic upgrading; outlines the challenges faced by specific populations; suggests opportunities for increasing accessibility; and concludes with key questions for stakeholders. This paper on accessibility is complemented by a number of other discussion papers including Ensuring affordability, Investing in Alberta's advanced education system, and Advanced education in rural Alberta.

To assist in the development of the vision and policy framework, discussion documents have been prepared. Each discussion document identifies key issues, outlines challenges to achieving policy objectives, and identifies advanced education system opportunities. This paper supports three discussion documents: &quot;Ensuring Affordability in Alberta's Advanced Education System&quot;; &quot;Investing in Alberta's Advanced Education System&quot;; and &quot;Advanced Education in Rural Alberta: Challenges and Opportunities&quot; by providing a brief overview, citing both national and international examples of programs and policies that other jurisdictions are using (or contemplating using) to ensure accessibility, affordability and quality within their respective advanced education systems. This overview, however, should not be considered an endorsement of any one system or model, but merely a starting-point for discussion. Although accessibility and affordability are discussed separately throughout this document, it is important to note that affordability and access are closely linked since student financial assistance provides support to learners facing financial barriers to access. A review of affordability must also consider policies regarding tuition, which not only impact learners' costs but also the resources available to advanced education. (Contains 13 endnotes.)

        "description":"The Alberta Initiative for School Improvement (AISI) was developed through a collaborative partnership in 1999 and first implemented in all Alberta school authorities in the 2000/2001 school year. The goal of this program is to improve student learning and performance by fostering initiatives that reflect the unique needs and circumstances of each school authority. AISI provides $68 million targeted funding annually to school authorities for specific local improvement projects. Initially allocated for three years from 2000 to 2003, funding has been extended for a second three-year cycle from 2003 to 2006. The Alberta Government invested $204 million dollars in support of school improvement projects during Cycle 1 of AISI. Cycle 1 achieved the Minister's 1999 expected outcomes: improved student learning and performance, established a foundation of trust between government and education stakeholders, created a model for collaboration, and established accountability measures. Continuous improvement has become AISI's modus operandi. For the over 800 AISI projects, the most commonly used measures were descriptions of quality (62.5%) and surveys (59.4%). Descriptions of quality differ from other measures in that they are narrative. Achievement tests were used extensively: provincial achievement tests (39.0%), standardized tests (22.9%), and locally developed teacher tests (14.9%). Other measures included school records (15.2%), observation/checklists (13.5%), and program participation (12.5%). Alberta Learning performed four types of analyses to determine project success: results improved over the baseline, results that met or exceeded annual targets, the magnitude of improvement through effect size analysis and the relative effects of various project categories through meta-analysis. The major conclusion is that major investments should continue to be made in educational research, especially active classroom based research. This report provides color enhanced tabular, and graphic data. Appended are: (1) Financial Information; (2) AISI Projects; (3) Calculating Effect Sizes and Percentiles; and (4) Provincial Achievement Test Results. (Contains 4 tables, 4 figures, and 17 endnotes.)

Adults who possess a strong sense of efficacy, employ a wide range of self-regulatory strategies, and maintain high motivational levels during the course of their learning are likely to be successful. In contrast, those who doubt their abilities, lack metacognitive activities, and exhibit low motivational levels tend to fail at accomplishing their goals.

Specifically, the study tested the prediction of cognitive theories of anxiety that anxious and non-anxious individuals process threatening information differently. High school students (n = 187) from a moderately sized Midwestern city were screened for anxiety using self-report measures. Students (n = 18) who obtained scores above a designated cut-off, and a contrast group matched on gender and grade (n = 18), completed implicit and explicit memory tasks along with a second administration of the self-report measures. Subsequently, adolescents were divided into anxious (n = 8) and mixed (anxiety and depression; n = 10) groups. These groups produced more threat-related words on a word-stem completion task than the contrast group. However, their ability to reproduce the primed (i.e., previously studied) threat words did not differ from the contrast group. The mixed group identified more threat words on a word recognition task than either the anxious or contrast groups. When recognition was adjusted for guessing, no group differences existed. Results did not support the hypothesized implicit memory bias for threatening material among students experiencing symptoms of anxiety. However, consistent with predictions, no or explicit memory bias was found. Implications of memory methodologies in the study of anxiety are discussed. (Contains 4 footnotes and 4 tables).",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of homophobic language and verbal harassment in North Carolina high schools, the intervention rates of school personnel, and the effectiveness of school non-harassment policies. Data was collected from six high schools in central NC that had active Gay Straight Alliances. Gay Straight Alliance members and teachers assisted in data collection and distributed the survey instrument in classes or to individual students who agreed to participate. A total of 904 students completed the survey and were included in data analysis. Results indicated that most respondents heard homophobic remarks frequently in school, homophobic remarks were more often made by students than school personnel, school personnel infrequently intervened when students made homophobic remarks in their presence, homophobic remarks were heard frequently across various school areas, and schools with non-harassment policies that did not include sexual orientation had more reported verbal harassment than schools whose policies did include sexual orientation. These results depict a homophobic, hostile climate at school.  Such a climate may lead to students feeling distressed and unsafe at school. Furthermore, homophobic school climates often lead to students being truant, performing poorly, and dropping out. Failure of school personnel to curtail homophobic verbal harassment may be interpreted by students that this form of harassment is permissible. Verbal harassment left unchecked may escalate into physical abuse and violence. A hostile school climate denies students the fundamental right to learn in a safe environment. Based on these results and implications, Safe Schools NC recommends (1) training school personnel on how to intervene and prevent harassment and bullying of sexual minority students; (2) including sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in school policies against harassment, bullying, and discrimination; (3) assisting students in creating or maintaining Gay Straight Alliances in schools; (4) providing information resources to students and school personnel on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression; and (5) assessing the school climate on a regular basis regarding sexual orientation harassment. The following are appended: (1) Survey Instrument; and (2) Resource List. (Contains 7 tables and 5 figures.) [This document was produced by Safe Schools NC.]",

This paper reports on a PhD research project which investigated marine education and learning with high school students in coral reef environments along the Queensland coast of Australia. The study explored relationships between the learning outcome variables of environmental knowledge (awareness), attitudes and the ecological agency skills of students who were trained in coral reef ecology in a classroom setting along with a structured learning experience of reef monitoring in offshore sites along the Great Barrier Reef in 2002 and 2003. The research investigated the question of whether experiential marine education can change the reported environmental knowledge, attitudes and ecological agency of the student participants. Some key data outcomes are presented and implications for effective marine education strategies and pedagogies are discussed concerning outdoor education and the effects of taking the students on field trips to a coral reef.

The survey was sent to the Texas school board presidents of districts with 500 or less students. The survey had five conceptual organizers: school board elections, school board service, school superintendent, policy issues and district/board president demography. A 40% return rate was achieved; Results: The results were reported as key findings by the conceptual organizers. Key findings include: 77% of board presidents were male; 90% of board presidents had a positive relationship with the superintendent. The average length of service for a superintendent was 4.3 years; 95% believed their district was prepared to meet the No Child Left Behind Standards; and, 93% of board presidents were Caucasian. Conclusions: All school boards are not the same. There are elemental differences between large, medium and small school districts; and Recommendations: Our lack of knowledge leaves us ill equipped to address the challenges small school boards face. Additional research is necessary to add to the body of literature and our understanding of governance as it applies to small school boards. School Board Survey Analysis Addendum is also included.

        "description":"(Purpose) The case study's purpose was to examine Participative Management Style, high performance strategies, intangible and tangible indicators, trust and its creation of superior achievement in a school district for elementary and middle school children (Illinois). (Methodology) A collaboration effort by Superintendent, administrative staff, and Consulting firm (CCI) focused on establishing &quot;Flow in Education&quot;. One of the methods used was creating an effective participative environment for teachers and students, so all could excel and flourish. In addition, a measurement process was developed that tracked both tangible and intangible relevant measures of superior education achievement. First, an assessment was administered that would give us a baseline concerning performance. The assessment utilized was the &quot;Ten Indicators of Superior Performance&quot;. Superintendent, Dr. Rosemarie Carroll and her management team developed improvements related to each of their school's performance with a goal of &quot;continuous improvement&quot;. In the process of continuous improvement, a measurement system was taught and developed that would track a key indicator of performance. The intangible we decided to track was trust. We worked with the Administrative team to design an assessment for the teachers and the students at Palos 118 reflecting the effects of improved administration-teacher-student relations. Specific recommendations were developed and implemented which improved this critical area of superior achievement. (Results) CCI worked with administration and within a year Palos 118 improved their performance by 5%. This placed Palos 118 into the top 10% of all Illinois elementary and middle schools. (Conclusions) Results show that a student, when exposed to a trusting environment, performs better and reflects in his or her test scores. This atmosphere improves teacher morale, motivation, and fosters mutual support and respect. (Recommendations) Educators need to consider tangible factors in the development of higher student achievement strategies. Education professionals and students would benefit greatly, if they would embrace more participation and measurement practices which represented a more open learning environment. Practical steps have been defined that would accelerate this implementation in any school district.",

According to the dictionary, &quot;to educate&quot; means &quot;to bring up and train the mind and way of thinking.&quot; Education is an important thing which can brighten people's minds and expand their knowledge. To some degree, the educational systems of two big countries in the world, the United Kingdom (UK) and China, are very complicated. They both have advantages and disadvantages in each phase of education. This document provides a brief comparison of the educational systems in the UK and China relating to the following levels of education: (1) Primary Education; (2) Secondary Education; and (3) Higher Education. It provides suggestions for how the educational systems in each country could be improved, concluding that education is one of the most basic, yet most important elements in a society, thus countries need to try to improve their educational systems to the extent possible.

While some teachers may have a special gift to help students learn, good teaching encompasses critical elements, such as knowledge of the learning process, child development, teacher experiences, academic ability, and content knowledge. The notion of &quot;highly qualified teachers&quot; is the backbone of recently enacted U.S. federal legislations such as the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act of 2001&quot; (NCLB) and other similar initiatives. Teacher preparation is instrumental in improving performance of all students.

The present study examines the lives of elementary school children who participate in acting both as an extracurricular activity and as a profession, by considering a wide variety of theoretical frameworks to illustrate their characteristics as students. This presents an interesting addition to the existing body of research on extracurricular activities, as acting differs greatly from most other \"traditional\" extracurricular activities in nature and it has frequently been stereotyped to lead to unhealthy developmental outcomes--usually based on anecdotal evidence. Two case studies revealed that participation in acting per se, even as a profession, may not necessarily be predictive of children's characteristics at school. Instead, children's as well as parents' attitudes and beliefs concerning acting as it fits into children's lives may relate to such characteristics.

This paper discusses the impacts this staff professional development model. The model was used to train 18 teachers to effectively use and integrate technology in their ESL classrooms in ways that improved learning for students, especially ESL students in economically disadvantaged, low performing, and high need schools. The year-long training, which took place in the Piedmont Triad area of North Carolina, was part of a state-funded grant initiative aimed at improving performances of teachers in &quot;high need&quot; and/or economically disadvantaged schools in the state of North Carolina in support of the federal &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; mandates. The teachers were drawn from two school system classified that met the state's classification as &quot;high need and/or &quot;economically disadvantaged schools.&quot; Baseline data were collected via product rubrics; observations; analysis of end products and their use and application in the classroom; structured interviews from participants and their building principals. In addition, pre and post surveys using Technology Integration Survey were conducted to determine the teachers' technology integration skills. Participants' pre and post-ratings on the survey were based on a Likert-type scale of 1 to 5, with 1- lowest and 5-highest. Posttest ratings were moderately higher than pre-ratings for most of the skills/areas surveyed. Findings from observations and interviews with the participants and their building principal also indicated that they developed improved skills, abilities, interest and confidence in using and integrating technology in the classroom more effectively than they did prior to participating in the professional development. Based on experiences and preliminary findings from implementing the product-based model of staff professional dded that technology professional development designers and implementers should review all materials to determine the merits of grouping participants by level of proficiency. Likewise, timing and duration of the professional/workshop should be based on preassessment feedback. The mix of individual and group assignments should be carefully examined to ensure the efficient coverage of certain topics in the appropriate timeframe; attention should be paid to different learning styles. Appended are: (1) Project goal, objectives, outcomes, and assessment measures relating to technology integration; and (2) Technology Integration Survey. (Contains 2 tables.)",

The data presented in this paper come from our research in Ando Elementary School, a typical municipal elementary school in Shizuoka, Japan. We employed a case study method for data collection and a qualitative approach for teaching analysis. We examined the effect of ethnography field notes on the teachers' assumptions about students. Our analysis of the data from various perspective and viewpoints provides insight into the professional development of teachers who participated in Jugyou Kenkyu.

In order to review this study, the author uses a descriptive analysis methodology. In addition, to research the study systematically, this paper first of all outlines the historic and political context of post-World War II in Korea. Next, the author examines transformations in Korea's higher education system under the rule of the U.S. Military Government, with a particular focus on educational systems and administration. Finally, implications for the educational administration in Korean higher education are described in terms of organizational structure and culture. This article says: as far as the U.S. Military Government's impact on Korean higher education is concerned, the positive effects of the U.S. military presence in Korea are greater than the negative. Overall, the U.S. Military Government brought about marked improvements in contemporary Korean higher education, by introducing American educational philosophy, administration, and culture.

        "author":["Davis, Linda"],
        "description":"This applied dissertation was designed to increase the academic achievement of 4th-grade students in science. The problem to be solved was that 4th-grade students in a rural elementary school exhibited low academic achievement in science. The researcher utilized the multiple intelligences (MI) theory and brain-based learning to develop the IMPACT strategy. This acronym was based on the essential components in the treatment program: introduce the focus lesson, make it relevant, practice the new concept in MI learning centers, allow time to set goals and reflect on learning, choose an independent learning project, and take time to celebrate. The independent variable consisted of the MI learning centers, and student achievement was the dependent variable. In the one-group/pretest-posttest research design model, the participants were given a pretest, exposed to an intervention program (i.e., the IMPACT strategy), and given a posttest to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. As a result of the intervention, 3 of the 6 expected outcomes were achieved: Twenty students completed and turned in science class work assignments daily, displayed appropriate behavior for learning during science, and displayed a positive attitude about learning in science. Analysis of the results indicated that there was a significant improvement in students' achievement, behavior, and self-esteem. Recommendations based on the results of this applied dissertation are as follows: (a) Students should be given more input regarding learning activities; (b) monthly parental involvement should be encouraged; (c) the school should seeks business alliances and apply for more grants; and (d) a longitudinal study be conducted to investigate the long-term implications of the IMPACT strategy in an interdisciplinary approach. Teachers can use this strategy as a way to increase student academic achievement and to enhance their own professional development. The following are appended: (1) Learning Instrument; (2) Interview Instrument; (3) Climate Instrument; (4) Multiple Intelligences Instrument for Learning in Science; and (5) Multiple Intelligences Journal Writing Instrument.

        "description":"The purpose of the current study was to look at whether a child's activity level was correlated with the level of stress a mother experiences. Parents can describe their children as having distinct and recognizable patterns of behavior as young as in infancy (Paaren, Hewitt, Lemery, Bihun & Goldsmith, 2000). Even at birth, some children are much more challenging to parents, while other children are notably more easy going and carefree (Oliver, 2002). Since parenting involves the relationship between a child's personality style (temperament) and the parent's response, the relationship is a reciprocal process in which parent and child are constantly affecting each other (Suarez and Baker, 1997). It was hypothesized that child activity level would correlate positively with the level of stress a mother experiences. When mothers rated the activity level of their most active, pre-kindergarten aged child, results revealed that the percentile of mother stress was positively correlated with child activity at a statistically significant level (r =.294, p < (less than).05). The relation of parent stress and additional demographic variables (e.g., family income, number of children, marital status) was analyzed, resulting in insignificant results.

        "description":"The purpose of this article is to show teacher competence is due to not only experience but also knowledge of the subject matter. Many schools in Lebanon are suffering from teacher incompetence in general and English language teachers' incompetence in particular. Twenty pre-service and eighteen in-service Lebanese English teachers teaching in Lebanese schools across all levels from preschool up to secondary classes were observed. Primarily, they were observed for classroom management, knowledge of the subject matter, methodology, student-teacher relationship, and personal character. However, a striking factor of teacher incompetence was detected in an inadequate knowledge of the subject matter. Although all language teachers had an adequate command of the English language, it was found that incompetence was mainly manifested in an inadequate command of the subject matter.  Most in-service teachers failed to provide culturally enriching classes, cater for students' needs when language arts were taught, and be wise decision makers concerning what material to teach and what to leave out. The conclusion was that language teachers needed to master the language, and be trained mainly in their practicum courses to enrich their cultural background, evaluate source material, be decision makers, and create their own resource material.",

        "author":["Davis, Wes"],
        "description":"This experimental, statistical study investigated the effects that Francis Christensen's \"Generative Rhetoric of the Sentence\" (1967) would have on overall writing quality and the number of subordinate clauses attached to the main independent clauses for more complex sentences in college freshmen's essays. In the experimental group of 42 students, the professor taught \"cumulative-sentence\" lessons based on Christensen's work. However, the other professor did not give these lessons on cumulative sentences to the 41 students in the control group. In overall writing quality, the statistical results showed that the experimental group made very highly significant gains. The control group also made highly significant gains in overall writing quality. However, the experimental group's posttest essay scores were still significantly higher than the control group's. On complex sentences, the results showed a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in gains of writing subordinate clauses attached to main independent clauses. The experimental group made very highly significant gains over the control group. These statistics implied that lessons on Christensen's  \"Generative Rhetoric of the Sentence\" contributed to the experimental group's remarkable gains and outcomes over the control group in writing quality and in the number of subordinate clauses, most of which came after the main clauses for more detailed complex sentences.",

In other words, they make surface-level changes to grammar, spelling, and punctuation but tend not to re-conceive content, structure, style, and cohesion. This paper argues that we need more instructional strategies that will help students understand what revision is, why it is essential, and how it can be done effectively. It presents the \"4S\" Method for Helping Students Revise Their Writing. The Method reminds students they must reconsider structure, substance, sequence, and style as they revise successive drafts of their texts. It also recommends instructional strategies that will help writing teachers help students revise their work to improve its content, structure, cohesion, and style.",

Starting from the premise that literacy is a prerequisite for mathematics learning, a causal model was proposed to account for gender differences in mathematics on multiple choice (MC) and constructed response (CR) items in conjunction with the effects of reading and writing. Two separate path analyses were conducted using the statewide 2002 Hawai'i State Assessment (HSA) data of the grade three and grade five cohorts. With their verbal advantage taken into consideration, girls are found to be disfavored on both MC and CR items, with MC items proving to be more challenging than CR items.

        "description":"&quot;Teaching Students with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder: Building Strengths, Creating Hope&quot; is Book 10 in the Programming for Students with Special Needs series; a revision and expansion of the 1997 Alberta Learning teacher resource, &quot;Teaching Students with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Possible Prenatal Alcohol-Related Effects.&quot; Much has been learned since the 1997 publication. This new guide offers teachers information and specific ideas to better meet the learning needs of students with FASD. This document is divided into five chapters and a set of appendices. The first chapter of the resource provides background and terminology to help educators understand the current medical diagnostic definition of FAS and the term FASD. It also explains the diagnostic process, primary and secondary disabilities, and the strengths and protective factors often seen in students with FASD. Background information covers the complexity of this disability, outlines variations in patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure, contributing factors to learning and behaviour, and the range of strengths and needs evident in this population of students. Chapter two presents key concepts for planning effective education programs; how professionals can work together from the point of medical diagnosis to the coordination of services in schools and the larger community. The next chapter provides overarching strategies on structuring the learning environment, developing effective routines, building skills for whole-class, instruction, teaching social and adaptive skills, and helping students generalize new skills and concepts. This chapter also includes information on developing and implementing individualized program plans (IPP). Chapter 4 offers suggestions for building a positive classroom climate and maintaining a supportive learning environment. It includes specific strategies for understanding the intent of behaviour, structuring the environment to accommodate active behaviors, ensuring smooth transitions, establishing clear rules and expectations, and using positive reinforcements. This last chapter includes strategies related to specific areas of developmental functioning. The strategies are organized by domain, including attention, memory, language and communication, and academic skills. These domains are defined and described, and are followed by suggestions for remediating and compensating for these specific needs. Appendices include reproducible blackline masters to use with students, parents and other educators, sample visuals teachers can customize to use with students, and three in-service activities to familiarize school staff with this resource. Appendices include: (1) A section on parent involvement; (2) A section on classroom involvement; and (3) A section with activities.

Focus on Research was developed in response to suggestions from Alberta teachers during the implementation of Focus on Learning: an Integrated Program Model for Alberta School Libraries (Alberta Education, 1985).  Inquiry-based learning is not an &quot;add-on&quot;, but rather a way to achieve the goals of the Alberta programs of study, since inquiry-based learning is a component of all Alberta curricula. Focus on Inquiry provides supports for implementing inquiry-based learning activities in the classroom and is intended for teachers working on their own or in teams, with or without the support of a teacher-librarian or other library personnel. It provides an instructional model that can be used by all teachers, Kindergarten to Grade 12, in guiding inquiry with students. Chapters cover questions on teaching the planning, retrieving, processing, creating, sharing and evaluating skills required in inquiry-based learning. Appendices provide various inventories and related aids for self assessment, planning, presenting, and reflecting for both students and teachers. The following are appended: (1) Perceptual Preference Inventory; (2) Learning Styles: Teaching Strategies; (3) What Worked: Effective Teaching Strategies; (4) How I Learn Best; (5) Know Your Own Strengths Inventory; (6) How I Like to Learn; (7) Know Myself Inventory; (8) Inquiry Research Project: Questions to Be Answered; (9) Overall Plan for Inquiry-based Learning Activity; (10) Scoring Criteria for Presentation; (11) Determining the Reliability and Relevance of Resources; (12) Refocus; (13) Clarify and Refocus; (14) Product Forms; (15) Planning the Presentation; (16) Presentation Planner; (17) Reflecting on My Inquiry Project; and (18) Reflecting on the Inquiry and Presentation.",

        "description":"This resource is a revision of the teaching resource Individualized Program Plans (1995), Book 3 (ED392232) in the Programming for Students with Special Needs series. It aims to create a bridge between the product, the process and the underlying vision of Individualized Program Planning (IPP). The Standards for Special Education (Amended June 2004) outlines required components of an individualized program plan (IPP) in Alberta. Many schools and jurisdictions have their own guidelines for completing these components. Some jurisdictions also use electronic management systems to develop and monitor IPPs. This resource provides additional information on the required components, as well as sample strategies that teachers and other educators can use to develop and implement successful, student-focused IPPs. It includes chapters on involving parents and students, collaborating with other members of the learning team, using classroom assessment, selecting accommodations, establishing meaningful goals, planning for transitions and using assistive technology. It also discusses the unique needs for IPP processes in Early Childhood Services (ECS), in junior and senior high settings, and with students who are gifted. Each chapter contains a number of appendices offering sample tools for enriching the IPP process. These tools should be used selectively and can be adapted to best meet the needs of individual students. Many of these tools will be used informally as part of the development process and not as products in the student's permanent school record. Chapters in the resource cover the following: Working through the IPP Process, Encouraging parent involvement, Supporting student participation, Creating a network of support, Using classroom assessment to support the IPP Process, Selecting accommodations and strategies, Making goals meaningful and manageable, Planning for transitions, Infusing assistive technology for learning into the IPP process, Getting off to a good start in ECS, Planning for students who are gifted, Promising practices for junior and senior high school. Appendices include sample target skills for cross-curricular goals in Junior and Senior High, a curriculum matrix, and student accommodations for Junior and Senior High. Other books in the series are: Teaching Students Who Are Deaf and Hard of Hearing (ED392233), Teaching for Student Differences (ED392230), Essential and Supportive Skills for Students with Developmental Disabilities (ED392231), Teaching students with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Teaching Students with Visual Impairments (ED407776), Teaching Students with Learning Disabilities (ED461193), Teaching Students Who Are Gifted and Talented (ED442237), and Teaching Students with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.

While there has been concerted effort to study the lives of female academic faculty in terms of class (Dews, Leste and Leste, 1995), race (hooks, 1989, Williams, 1994) and sexuality (Mintz & Rothblum, 1997), relatively little of this attention has been devoted to the female ex-patriate experience. This void has left us with a series of questions: How do female foreign academics' private and public lives intersect?  Do the relationships they have outside the academic sustain or undermine a foreign professor's chances of success? This paper seeks to answer these questions by studying foreign academic women's lives holistically: one person trying to carve out an academic identity for themselves in the East, the other in the west. In examining the interplay of multiple forms of marginality, these hidden interstices will shed light on the struggles involved in teaching in the diaspora.",

        "description":"Educational assessment is a process of collecting evidence and interpreting it to provide instructors with information regarding students' learning. However, the current design and scoring of most standardized educational tests are insufficient to serve this purpose. The limitation exists primarily due to the lack of cognitive information incorporated into traditional psychometric models. To date, some psychometricians have applied cognitive psychology principals to psychometric models of educational assessment data. Of these models, one of the most extensively researched and empirically supported is Tatsuoka's rule-space methodology (RSM). RSM can be used to validate a proposed cognitive model. A list of cognitive attributes, which describe what knowledge, strategies, and processing skills the TIMSS-R mathematics test measures, was developed with RSM by using the U.S. sample. Research using these cognitive attributes of the TIMSS items appears to adequately describe student performance for several other countries. In our current study, we intended to explore how a list of cognitive attributes expresses student performance in Taiwan. Three analyses, including calculation of classification rates, multiple regression analyses, and comparisons of attribute mastery probabilities across four booklets, were conducted. Successful classification rates ranged from 99.3% to 99.9% for four booklets, and R2 and adjusted R2 for each booklet were estimated using multiple regression analyses and ranged from 0.943 to 0.979. All ranges of mean attribute probabilities across booklets were less than 0.25, except for the Recognize patterns attribute (S6). Generally speaking, a list of cognitive attributes and the incidence matrix used as a proposed cognitive model in the current study represent the performance of Taiwanese eighth graders on the TIMSS-1999 mathematics tests very well.

        "description":"English is a Right Branching Direction (RBD) language in which relative clauses appear to the right of the head noun. In contrast, Chinese primarily relies on a Left Branching Direction (LBD) in which relative clauses premodify the head. Many studies have provided evidence that the differences in principal branching directions between the two languages often cause difficulties in acquiring complex syntax (e.g., Flynn, 1984; Flynn and Espinal, 1985). However, most studies concerning the cross-linguistic influences in relative clause acquisition compare English with languages other than Chinese. Little research has been done to investigate the extent to which the relative clauses produced by Chinese learners of English are influenced by the difference in branching direction. The purpose of the present study is to analyze and describe the difficulties that Chinese learners of English encounter in acquiring the relative clauses. A total of 237 English-major freshmen participated in the study. One written composition from each participant was collected. In addition, a 44-item-multiple-choice test on relative clauses was administered. Data were analyzed in terms of: 1) the total number of relative clauses in each pattern, and 2) the number of errors produced in each pattern of relative clauses. Evidence of cross-linguistic influence was found in both areas. (Contains 8 tables.)",

A &quot;Mathematical Mystery Object Box&quot; is a box containing a set of objects with corresponding clue cards. The student reads the mathematical clues addressing numeration, algebra, geometry, and measurement and attempts to locate the object that satisfies them, checking work with the picture of the correct object on the reverse side of each clue card. The study used an identical pretest/post test design with a 20-item instrument tied to the New York State Standards for Mathematics for grades four through six. Preservice teacher scores on the pretest administered the first day of class were low (mean = 54%, standard deviation = 18%). However, without any class instruction or review, but through creating teaching materials for elementary students, the post test scores of preservice teachers increased significantly on the post test given nine weeks later (mean = 71%, s. d. = 14%). This indicates the amount of learning that occurs when preparing materials to teach others. Example mystery object box materials created by the preservice teachers are provided.

        "author":["Williamson, Gary L."],
        "description":"The purpose of this research was to elucidate a continuum of postsecondary text difficulty and to use it to quantify gaps between the text difficulty of high school textbooks and various reading materials likely to be encountered in the most widely chosen postsecondary domains of endeavor--the university, the workplace, the military and citizenship in general. Wide-ranging samples of texts were identified to represent the typical texts found in each domain of endeavor. Using The Lexile Framework [R] for Reading, each text was analyzed to produce a Lexile measure of text difficulty. The resulting 1730 text measures were statistically analyzed and summarized to show the differences in distributions of text difficulty across the identified domains of postsecondary endeavor. The results indicate a systematic continuum of increasing text demand that extends from high school texts to university texts. Furthermore, there were statistically significant increases in text demand from high school texts to citizenship materials, workplace materials, community college texts and university texts. Whether a student aspires to postsecondary education, a job, the military, or just to be an informed citizen, the reading ability required is likely to be higher than what is typically required in high school based on texts that are widely used in this country. This finding is consistent with much of the extant literature about readiness for postsecondary endeavors. However it is dramatically distinct from that literature in applying a more unified theoretical framework and in producing results that are comparable across the investigated domains. It gives new insight to possible methods to address student readiness. For example, if the gap in student readiness is really a gap in text difficulty rather than a result of student failure to learn what has been taught in high school, then any policy solution should address the text gap instead of providing (remedial) &quot;solutions&quot; for a perceived gap in student ability. Furthermore, because reading ability is generally measured with many different scales it currently is not possible to investigate a performance gap with the definitive results observed in this study for text difficulty. Therefore, this paper also calls for a more systematic effort to identify and quantify the reading ability gap in terms of a metric for both ability and textual difficulty. The advantage would be more meaningful measurement of reading ability and findings that are more conducive to instructional and policy actions. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

One of the main objectives of this paper is to highlight the challenges facing the school during implementation of the ISO 9001 standard and the benefits of successfully implementing such a quality system can bring to higher education. Based on the experience of a Romanian business school, the paper provides a framework for systematic interpretation of the integration of ISO 9001:2000 into higher education. The requirements and factors for the successful attainment of ISO 9001 certification are discussed. Advantages and possible pitfalls of such a development are also addressed. Results demonstrate that the effective and efficient implementation of a quality management system is ensured whether the following variables are engaged: commitment of top management towards quality and process improvement; awareness of faculty and staff, as well as students, regarding the importance of quality and implementation of required changes; identifying processes and designing communication system; focusing on learning, teaching, training, and research enhancement; documenting quality management system and controlling documents; performing internal audits, undertaking corrective and preventive actions, keeping quality records; and commitment to the continual improvement of results. The development and integration of the ISO 9001:2000 model of quality management system in business and economics education is not only possible, it is useful and desirable. (Contains 3 tables)",

        "description":"The experiences of African American professors reach back nearly 150 years beginning with their pioneering efforts to educate Africans in Liberia. With the gradual racial integration of the American professoriate in the post-World War II era and the redoubled effort of the federal government and private agencies, along with the support of colleges and universities, African Americans too would have opportunities to travel, teach, and study abroad that previously they had rarely enjoyed. Institutional funding, it was thought, would establish ties between Americans and foreigners that could lead to a more peaceful, tolerant, and enlightened world. Not relying on institutional backing, increasingly black professors seeking to expand their horizons with international experiences have through their own initiative found the means to bring their longer term goals to fruition. An impressionistic survey of the variety of their experiences is presented in this paper.",

The major focus was based on the found factors which might relate to the students' decisions for dropping out or staying in the distance education program to establish a set of strategies to reduce dropout from distance education courses. The participants in the study were undergraduate students who originally enrolled in the distance education undergraduate program at the National Open University of Taiwan. The instrument used in this research was a mailed questionnaire for investigating the factors of dropout or retention for distance education students, demographic variables, goal commitment, social integration, and academic integration. Results indicated that the factors of external attribution, intrinsic motivation, and students' perceptions of distance learning showed significant relationships with students' decisions of dropout or retention. Based on the findings, the researcher made certain recommendations to institutions for reducing student's dropout rates from distance education courses.",

This task can not be taken lightly by policymakers except by inviting failure and disappointment resulting from the mismatch between the education and the requirements of time, i.e., living in the age of \"global village\". Arts with their unique function in cultivating enlightened and deep seated attitudes and values can play a pivotal role in this respect. This is attributed to the arts' capacity to produce \"cognitive feeling\" or \"feelingly cognition\" which amounts to what Broudy refers to as \"enlightened cherishing\". Aesthetic approach to values education is, thus, a potent strategy to accomplish this end, namely the celebration of universal as well culture-specific values.",

        "description":"The journey for children who are gifted and talented can be exciting and challenging. There  are so many twists and turns, detours, and confusing signs that many parents feel they need  some sort of road map to guide their children on this journey. Because each child is different,  there is no one road map to follow. What this handbook can offer is travelling tips that parents can use to help their children get a good start on their educational road, so they have the best opportunities possible to develop the skills and attitudes they need to live a satisfying and happy life. This handbook represents a synthesis of current research and effective practices for supporting children who are gifted and talented at home and at school. Because parents know best what makes a difference in their children's happiness and success, Alberta Learning collaborated with the Alberta Associations for Bright Children  (AABC) in the development of this resource. The sample strategies in this handbook will not  be effective or appropriate for all children who are gifted and talented. As parents, it is up to  you to consider what will work best for your child and for your family. For those children  who are extraordinarily gifted (less than one in 10,000 children), these strategies may have  limited application and parents will need to search out highly individualized solutions for  these children. Throughout the resource the term &quot;gifted and talented&quot; will be shortened to  &quot;gifted.&quot; This handbook is a compilation of information and sample strategies for parents. Information is aligned with current legislation, Alberta Learning policies and the Standards for Special Education (2003).",

The process of development was one of consultation, information gathering, drafting, more consultation and re-drafting. The contributors to this resource include Aboriginal Elders, teachers and psychologists, as well as other members of Alberta's Aboriginal communities. Culturally-relevant approaches effectively serve the learning needs of Aboriginal students. Traditional and contemporary Aboriginal cultures offer a number of frameworks for understanding, guiding, learning from and teaching students. The relationship between student and teacher is the heart of Aboriginal education. The teacher's relationship with each student is based on observing and learning about the individual child and his or her unique learning needs in order to help the child grow holistically--spiritually, physically, mentally and emotionally. This resource offers information about Aboriginal cultures and perspectives, practical ideas, and sample strategies that will help teachers meet the needs and recognize the gifts of Aboriginal students. Many of the sample strategies are good for all students and are relevant for a range of educational settings and contexts. The guiding principles reflect understanding and respect of diversities of aboriginal cultures, languages and histories, respectful classroom atmosphere, collaborative relationships with families and communities and teacher recognition and continued assessment of the learning strengths and needs of each Aboriginal student. The resource is organized into seven chapters: (1) Worldviews and Aboriginal Cultures: Where hearts are rooted; (2) Aboriginal Students: Who are they? How do they learn?; (3) The Classroom: A community of learners; (4) School, Family and Community: Sharing the responsibility; (5) Learning Strategies for Aboriginal Students: Opportunities to make learning meaningful; (6) Assessment: Authentic reflections of important learnings; and (7) Teaching Aboriginal Students with Learning Disabilities: Recognizing gifts and strengths. Each chapter contains information, sample strategies, shared wisdom from Aboriginal scholars and Elders, and related stories shared by Aboriginal teachers and liaisons.

The purpose of this study was to highlight the practices pursued by the US entrepreneurial universities in their journey towards increasing performance excellence and strengthening the prestige of the university. The study builds upon two quality management principles--continuous improvement and customer focus-- materialized, in the frame of American entrepreneurial universities, in the wide-spreading and strengthening of partnerships with all parties interested in the university's educational process. Results indicate that the entrepreneurial model of university is concerned with the quality of its &quot;products&quot;, specifically students' competencies and qualifications, but also with the results and performances obtained both scientifically and technologically, and on the labor market. Results show that the development of the entrepreneurial university model should be supported by direct involvement and total commitment of the entire teaching staff, in partnership with the business environment, other educational institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and society as a whole. To help consolidating and expanding the concept of entrepreneurial university, schools should be concerned with assessing themselves against three criteria: the teaching and learning activity; the institutional culture and its impact upon society; and the orientation towards market/ business environment.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to systematically gather advice and insights from veteran school leaders on how to prepare and support the next generation of educational administrators through professional development and mentoring programs. Two hundred school administrators who were members of the American Association of School Administrators were randomly selected of an open-ended survey consisting of questions pertaining to the adequacy of professional preparation and the role of professional development and mentoring activities in promoting and sustaining sound leadership skills. Surveys returned by eighty veteran school administrators--principals, assistant superintendents or superintendents--who had a minimum of five years of educational leadership experience, were considered. This resulted in a high usable response rate of 0.40. Through the analysis of the in-depth open-ended responses using rigorous qualitative methodology, several common themes related to professional preparation emerged from this study: (1) coursework and field-based experiences that were designed to link theory with praxis were most valuable; (2) instructors who were themselves experienced practitioners appeared better able to connect text and course material with real world application; and (3) a limited foundation in the social sciences--psychology, political sciences, public relations, cultural diversity, conflict management and change management--appears to be missing from the school leadership curriculum. Study findings also suggest that the veteran respondents hold similar views on how best to support administrators once they join the profession: (4) through fostering networking opportunities with colleagues from across the region, state or country; (5) by encouraging the formation of mentoring relationships whenever possible; and (6) by promoting professional development opportunities, like study groups, that minimize time away from the job while maximizing time devoted to the specific applicable material. Collectively these results suggest that veteran school leaders have common views on how the next generation should be prepared and supported. Organizations and institutions of higher education should consider these findings when designing appropriate academic and professional development experiences for aspiring and veteran educational administrators alike.",

While some in the community contend the deaths were tragic but unrelated, other citizens argue that the collective set of circumstances points to a series of mysterious murders--perhaps committed by a &quot;River Killer&quot; that local authorities are unable or unwilling to bring to justice. An examination of local newspaper narratives and claims from a televised town meeting shows the narratives resulted in establishment of two contrasting frames. Each offers a different explanation and has a different perspective of responsibility for the tragedies. The contradictory frames complicate the efforts of community leaders who missed a prime opportunity to build a consensus of opinion that could have lead to much-needed resolutions.",

        "description":"Effective academic advising is recognized as key to college student success and academic retention (Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 1991; Mastrodicasa, 2001). There are at least seven different structural models for academic advising; each depends to a greater or lesser degree on a level of &quot;engagement&quot; by faculty in the process (Kramer, 2003). Despite devoting large amounts of resources toward improving academic advising, many institutions find a less than adequate level of engagement is achieved. Based on a review of recent studies, including data from a national study of faculty recently completed, the author identifies six key threats to engagement. These include: institutional role competitiveness, increasing faculty workloads, inadequate advisor training and preparation, legal concerns, technological barriers, and escalating levels of challenge presented by students and their parents. As a whole, these threats add up to a system of institutional disincentives that prevent full participation by faculty in academic advising in many higher education settings. The author shows how to turn these challenges into opportunities, by illustrating the recent success story of one higher education institution whose students took the lead to demand--and receive--significant institutional improvements in academic advising.",

(2) What is the role of content instruction in offering a second language? (3) What are the effects of learning a second language on students with special needs? (4) What are the effects of learning a third language on students for whom English is a second language? And, they were to look at the overview for the challenges and benefits for those who are learning a second language. The range of literature surveyed is very broad. Academic journals, books, conference proceedings, technical reports and online materials were consulted. Findings include: (1) Exposure to a second language can: enhance the complexity of first-language syntax used; enhance language use skills; enhance non-linguistic skills; Acquiring knowledge in a second language does not impede the ability to access that knowledge in the first language; (2) Numerous models of content-based language programs exist, each illustrating a different balance between content-area and second-language learning outcomes. Student second-language proficiency levels, the nature of the content material and the amount of time devoted to the program all need to be considered in choosing an appropriate model for any given context. In terms of language learning, content-based language teaching is a time-efficient and effective way of promoting the development of general second-language skills; (3) There is a great deal of research that looks at the difference between students who are culturally and linguistically diverse versus those with disabilities. In sum, all of this research looks at how to assess students in second-language classrooms; how to teach students with special needs in second-language classrooms; and problems related to specific concerns such as dyslexia, word recognition, learning disabilities and differences between learning a first language and learning a second language; and (4) The acquisition of a third language is a common occurrence around the world. Learning a third language is aided by proficiency in the first language, and acquired skills can be transferred among the languages spoken. Students for whom English is a second language may benefit from third-language acquisition, depending on the model of instruction.

        "description":"In the spring of 2000, Alberta Education (previously Alberta Learning) appointed the Review Committee on Outcomes (RCO) to consult with Albertans to find out what they expected from the K-12 education system and how these expectations are being met. The committee consisted of stakeholder, as well as a parent and a member at large. This committee worked for more than a year to develop outcomes for the education system by gathering public input on key results for a number of areas such as student learning, quality teaching, leadership and governance. In its second year, the committee and its performance measurement sub-committee focused their attention on developing a set of indicators and measures to help determine whether outcomes are being achieved. Overall, more than 1400 Albertans provided feedback on both the outcomes and measures during the consultation process of RCO. A total of 39 outcomes were established with 80 measures to form a framework that will help establish educational policies and priorities at the system, jurisdictional and school levels. Mostly, these measures are based on views of parents, teachers, students, boards and employers as well as the public besides objective quantitative measurements. These measures will provide a basis for monitoring system performance and bringing about continuous improvement over time. The current report presents the main findings of the 2005 Satisfaction with Education in Alberta. Surveys (which are telephone surveys of the public, teachers, school board members, senior high school students and parents of kindergarten to Grade 12 students) that related to 28 RCO outcomes and 34 survey measures for the kindergarten to Grade 12 education system. These satisfaction surveys are conducted annually by Alberta Education to obtain perceptions on how the education system is performing in meeting learners' and society's needs and expectations. 2004 was the first year that questions based on the RCO measures were included in the surveys. Similarly, 2004 was the first year that school board members and teachers were surveyed. The analysis of the results in this report is based on a rolled-up summary percentage for all questions in the measure for each respondent group. For each measure, overall results are calculated based on average of rolled-up summary percentages for the related respondent groups. A historical perspective of results is provided, where possible, through comparison of 2005 results with those obtained in 2004. The appendix contains: Sample Sizes and Confidence Intervals in the Satisfaction with Education in Alberta Surveys. (Contains 65 charts and 1 table.)

        "description":"School jurisdiction plans and reports align with and build on Alberta Education's vision, mission, goals and outcomes for the basic education system. They help ensure that the entire learning system is focused on key priorities that meet the educational needs of Alberta students. At the same time, jurisdiction plans and reports incorporate local goals, priorities and outcomes that reflect the unique characteristics and circumstances of their communities. In short, they reflect local needs and priorities within the context of a province-wide framework. Accountability in the basic education system is an ongoing cycle that enables continuous improvement and critical reflection. Key components are measuring progress and using results to inform decision making. For school authorities, the cycle involves: (1) developing plans aligned with provincial goals and outcomes; (2) incorporating community input; (3) identifying and implementing strategies to improve student learning; (4) allocating resources to achieve goals and improve results; (5) monitoring progress; (6) measuring and assessing results; (7) using results to identify priorities and design or adjust strategies; and (8) communicating with stakeholders (staff, learners, parents, school councils, the public, and Alberta Education) about school jurisdiction and school plans and results. This guide provides information on the components and requirements of education plans and on preparing, updating, communicating, submitting and reviewing them. It also provides an overview of the result reporting components and requirements. Appendices include information on performance measurement, measuring performance through surveys, and setting targets, and provide a sample format for school board plans.

The nominal group technique was selected for this curriculum review. Seven area farm managers accepted the invitation and participated in the curriculum review. Three of the seven participants were graduates of the NDSCS farm management program. Program faculty did not participate in the nominal group process. Tables list the items that the participants considered to be &quot;important&quot; knowledge and skills needed by farm management graduates. The final step in the curriculum review process was to provide general recommendations for curriculum changes. Participants were given the program of study for the farm management program and each of the courses in the program were discussed. Course syllabi were reviewed to understand course objectives and outcomes. Participants developed lists of important concepts and strategies for financial analysis, agronomy risk management/Insurance, agricultural technologies, and government interaction. These recommendations are presented in a series of tables. The NDSCS Agriculture Department faculty reviewed the recommendations and suggestions found in the curriculum review summative report, and chose to propose changes to the Farm Management/Agricultural Mechanics program. The report details the course changes that have been approved. (Contains 9 tables.)",

In each of these years, all eighth graders in the state were also required to participate in the state's accountability testing, which included the reading test in the Stanford Achievement Tests, Ninth Edition (SAT 9). State-level comparisons of performance on these two assessments showed improvement in the SAT 9, but a slight decline on NAEP (not statistically significant). To examine whether this trend discrepancy might be attributable to content differences between the two tests, SAT 9 reading items were coded into categories corresponding to the NAEP content strands plus a category for items not aligned to the NAEP framework. Analyses of performance within strands indicate that content differences probably cannot explain the discrepant trends on the state accountability test versus NAEP, although differences related to item format are a strong possibility. Implications and alternative explanations are discussed. (Contains 7 endnotes, 6 tables, and 10 figures.)",

All of the reviews have been checked for accuracy in two ways. First, each author received feedback from the professor. After each feedback session, authors then revised their papers. The topics represent a range of interests emerging from the individual author's background, experience, and curiosity. The importance of the topics is reflected in their reasons for uncovering the impact of various specialized interventions in terms of effects on special populations (e.g., students who are angry, youth with eating disorders, children with emotional and behavior disorders, individuals with autism and autism spectrum disorder, and so on. The types of interventions that were critiqued include reading intervention programs, reinforcement, and cooperative learning. In addition, authors tackled challenges such as how to fit into a single subject paradigm the response to intervention method of assessment compared to the standard method of utilizing IQ-achievement scores as a way to identify students with learning disabilities. The types of single subject research designs that were reviewed were comprehensive and included reversal, multiple baseline, alternating treatment, and changing criterion designs. In addition to discussing the critiques, each author poses a question for future study that could be addressed using single subject research design. The unique contributions in the 2006 volume include reviews of the single subject designs that might lead to systems change; response to intervention model for identifying students with learning disabilities. Evaluating methods to decree over-representation of African American students to special education in elementary schools, and evaluating two co-teaching methods in terms of both teacher behavior change and child behavior change.

However, theoretical efforts aiming at proper formulation of this stage are disappointingly rare in the curriculum literature.

In this formulation the author has identified four interactive phases with distinct characteristics which can introduce a fresh perspective in this regard. Mention must be made, though, of a major assumption built into this formulation. The proposed needs assessment model presupposes a curriculum decision making system in which the central (national) authority plays a major role while power sharing with actors at other levels is deemed desirable.

The study demonstrates how teachers' actions on September 11, 2001 in New York City show the essential qualities of public service, including selflessness and placing the needs of others above their own needs. By focusing on the personal, emotional and professional responses of teachers to the attacks as compared to the same responses of individuals in the private sector, the study shows a specific contrast, particularly in the professional responses between teachers and student teachers in public service and individuals in occupations in the private sector. The second objective is to include the voices of women, primarily elementary teachers, but also women in the private sector, in the historical narrative of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center.

        "description":"Professional occupations will account for more than half the total U.S. job growth in the years to come, and talent is the principal resource that underpins this new economy. Creative individuals who can develop new ideas and new applications of existing  knowledge are the entrepreneurs who will ensure future economic well-being. Education is the foundation upon which this community of South Dakota's future citizens will be built. The task ahead will fall largely on public education. The public education system is not just K-12 schools but includes as an integral part the public universities. In South Dakota, the Board of Regents is fortunate to have a strong partnership with the state's elementary and secondary education system. South Dakota's residents must continue to work hand in hand--pre-K-12 and with higher education--to develop a highly-educated workforce. One of the most important ways is to make sure young people strengthen their academic preparation, especially in math and science. This is one of the objectives of the South Dakota Opportunity Scholarship. The scholarship's second objective is to retain this talent in state for their postsecondary education. Higher-achieving young people who stay in South Dakota will offer a talent pool to compete with any in the world. Building a research-oriented faculty is a major change for South Dakota. The more than doubling of federal funding support for grants in recent years indicates the quality of the work that can be done in South Dakota. New Ph.D. programs, targeted research centers, graduate assistantships, and individual faculty research grants all work toward building a more robust research infrastructure for South Dakota. This will ensure that Governor Rounds' 2010 Initiative goal of developing the state as a research and technology leader is met. To gauge progress across the public higher education system, this &quot;Fact Book Fiscal Year 2006&quot; provides the single best source of information and data from the South Dakota Board of Regents.

Challenges are many-how best to deliver educational services in view of demographic shifts in South Dakota's population base, limited state resources, and far-reaching economic changes both nationally and internationally. The South Dakota Board of Regents is actively engaged in far-reaching discussions with policymakers and the public. The regents' 2003 report, &quot;Opportunities for South Dakota,&quot; initially put focus to these discussions. Then in 2004, Gov. Mike Rounds launched his 2010 Education Initiative, a series of specific goals and action plans intended to improve the state's education system by the year 2010. The governor's initiative creates the roadmap for the future. In that future, Gov. Rounds sees a South Dakota education system &quot;second to none in America--brimming with opportunity and innovative entrepreneurial thinking.&quot; From the regents' statewide conversations about issues and opportunities, four policy goals for the Board of Regents' system became evident:  (1) Access--Every qualified South Dakotan shall have access to public postsecondary education; (2) Quality--South Dakota public universities and special schools shall provide a quality educational experience; (3) State Wealth--South Dakota public universities shall engage in activities designed to enhance the state's long-term economy; and (4) Efficiencies--South Dakota public universities and special schools shall continue to seek means for improving efficiency in the delivery of educational services.

        "description":"This research investigated the effects of a technology based learning program on 219 5th graders' reading and technology skills. Central to the program's design is its capacity to deliver reading materials that are on students' individually differentiated reading levels. That is, on any given day all students in a classroom receive a reading selection via the Internet on a single topic (e.g. Hurricane Katrina), however, the exact reading level of the selection and its follow-up activities are determined by each student's individual reading ability. The intervention tested the program in two conditions--differentiated and non-differentiated. The differentiated condition (n=84) provided access to the program using its full capability (e.g. delivery of individually differentiated text and activities). The non-differentiated condition (n=51) provided only grade-level texts and activities to students. A control condition (n=84) was also used. Following an eight-month implementation results revealed that students in the differentiated classrooms significantly outperformed students in the control classrooms on five measures. There were no cases in which students in the undifferentiated condition significantly outperformed students in the control condition. This finding suggested that the critical factor associated with students' success was reading at their correct level of difficulty, rather than Internet-delivery or time-on-task. This study suggests that the Internet may hold the potential to provide students with easy and inexpensive access to reading materials at their correct level of reading difficulty and that such access may be positively associated with achievement.",

Teachers of both genders appeared equally likely to refer students for most behaviors; however, females may be more likely to refer for certain externalized behaviors.

TIPs are best-practice guidelines for the treatment of substance use disorders that make the latest research in substance abuse treatment available to counselors and educators. The content was generated by a panel of experts in the fields of family therapy and substance abuse treatment, and reviewed by independent experts. The first two chapters provide an introduction to substance abuse treatment and family therapy and explore the impact of substance abuse on families. Chapter three discusses various approaches to family therapy, including the current models, approaches and concepts that have shown effectiveness in family therapy, as well as basic information about theory, treatment modalities, and the role of 12-Step programs in substance abuse treatment. Chapter four contains a discussion on integrating the different models for substance abuse treatment with those of family therapy. The fifth chapter provides background information about substance abuse treatment in various racial and ethnic groups and the applications of family therapy to each population. Administrators and trainers will find guidance on effectively combining family therapy and substance abuse treatment in chapter six, as well as a discussion on the importance of improving services to families.

The primary intended audience for this volume is substance abuse treatment providers and administrators who work in OTPs. Recommendations in the TIP are based on both an analysis of current research and determinations of best treatment practices by an expert panel. Initial chapters present introductory and background information. Remaining chapters focus on the components and important considerations of a well-run OTP. Reference citations point readers to recommended resources for more specific information, including Internet sources. Exhibits and appendices summarize key information for quick reference. The book simultaneously develops several consistent themes reflecting the beliefs of the expert contributors: (1) opioid addiction is a medical disorder and should be treated as such, not as a failure of willpower or morals; (2) comprehensive maintenance treatment, including pharmacotherapy integrated with a wide range of support services, is the treatment modality with the best record of patient recovery; (3) patients should be fully involved and respected in planning and monitoring their own treatment; and (4) OTPs need to be fully engaged with their communities to overcome the pervasive stigma that can limit program effectiveness.

In the first year of teaching only three teachers taught as constructivist teachers. In the third year of teaching, the classroom practices of the teachers converged more closely to their beliefs and pre-service preparation in constructivitism.

This framework is inspired by the ecological risk assessment frameworks of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1995) and G.W. Suter (1993), which are primarily used in ecotoxicology and environmental toxicology. The methodology used to develop the framework is called anasynthesis which entails an iterative process comprising of analysis, synthesis, prototype and simulation steps, leading to the proposition of a model. The framework includes three phases by which an ecological risk assessment can be performed: problem formulation, measurement, and risk characterization. By outlining each of its phases, this article defines, illustrates, and explains the possible applications of an ecological risk assessment framework to the field of special education. For practical reasons, we provide an example of this first application based on persons with intellectual disabilities. Further empirical research in special education is taking shape using this framework and will be compared to the usual risk analysis techniques.",

        "description":"The purpose of this presentation was to interpret the results of two large-scale assessments of textbook usage in light of criticism that textbooks are ineffective teaching/learning tools. One assessment occurred as a follow-up to a Schools and Staffing Survey involving 3,994 classroom teachers, who were asked about their classroom practices in 1994-1995. The other assessment involved 29,000 students in Grades 4, 8 and 12 as part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress in U.S. history in 2001. Results from the earlier study indicated that reading from a textbook peaked as a classroom activity in the intermediate elementary grades and high school grades, and that at the secondary level, it occurred more often in social studies than in any other core subject. Results from the 2001 study indicated a positive association between frequency of textbook usage by students and scores on measures of knowledge and skills in U.S. history in Grades 4 and 12, but not in Grade 8.  The results of these two large-scale studies suggest that frequent usage of current textbooks helps students develop basic knowledge and skills in U.S. history in elementary and high schools. Current social studies and U.S. history textbooks seem better adapted to assimilation of knowledge and skills, however, than to the development of new understanding, which should peak during a period of transition such as middle school or junior high school.

        "description":"Differentiated instruction is an educational approach that adjusts instruction to accommodate individual students' needs, rather than beginning at a predetermined set point. This approach is meant to increase both student learning and motivation. Because traditional instruction tends to \"teach to the middle,\" or primarily focus on reaching average children, the needs of struggling and advanced learners are often not adequately addressed. This review explores the creation of a differentiated classroom by introducing the philosophy behind differentiated instruction and some common approaches to differentiation. Because differentiated instruction assumes certain degrees of literacy and independence, some of these strategies are more appropriate for young children than others. This review synthesizes and presents a variety of techniques appropriate for use in elementary schools, particularly in the primary grades. Because few authors have written extensively on differentiation, the field would benefit from the addition of further viewpoints, as well as scientific studies on the efficacy of differentiated instruction.

        "description":"Academic research and publishing, particularly at the higher education level, are activities that do not only complement effective teaching but are also sine-qua-non for the achievement of academic excellence. However, due to myriad of factors, many academics in Tertiary Institutions have a myopic belief that universities are meant, essentially for teaching and not so much for research, hence, the lukewarm attitude towards engaging in research. This process may lead to some devastating consequences, such as the deficiency in the quality of the final products from such higher institutions. Universities are expected to serve as repositories of knowledge, the think tanks for their varying governments and the overflowing tanks from where the society is expected to drink. This theoretical paper therefore, posits that in order to avoid the process of compromising quality and academic standard, the academics in academia should serve as excellent role models for their students. This can only be achieved if the university lecturers engage in meaningful and consistent research and publishing activities in their different fields of specialization. This will lead to the production of knowledge bank, through the improvement in the quality of their performance.",

Participants were: 182 graduates with and 1304 without disabilities from three large junior/community colleges, 57 college based professionals providing disability-related services, and 300 students with disabilities who were registered to receive disability related services from their college. While current students with disabilities indicated that disability-related accommodations such as extended time on exams were important facilitators, for the most part these students, as well as graduates with disabilities, mentioned the same facilitators as their nondisabled peers. The same was generally true for obstacles. The main difference here was that students and graduates with disabilities cited disability-related issues, such as health, as a major obstacle. Graduates with and without disabilities continued their studies and obtained jobs at the same rate as nondisabled graduates. Appended is: CEGEP Experience Questionnaire: English and French versions.

Yet with the wide variety of professional development options available, which methods have the most impact on student learning? Research on professional development is scattered throughout subject areas, with its focus ranging from classroom processes and structures to teachers' personal traits. \"Research Points\" has limited this review to learning opportunities for teachers that are explicitly aimed at increasing student achievement. Studies suggest that the more time teachers spend on professional development, the more significantly they change their practices and that participating in professional learning communities optimizes the time spent on professional development. Changing goals for learning, coupled with shifts in curriculum emphasis and a deeper understanding of teacher learning and student thinking, have led to new findings about the impact of teacher professional development and how best to sharpen teachers' skills and knowledge.",

Factors driving the demand include China's economic growth, which has prompted the College Board to add Chinese to its list of Advanced Placement tests. Meanwhile, President George W. Bush, citing national security concerns, has called for the expanded teaching of languages not typically offered in public schools, including Arabic, Farsi, and Chinese. Also fueling interest are the growing ranks of &quot;heritage&quot; language students who are raised in homes where a language other than English is spoken. At the same time, more parents and schools are recognizing the value of preparing even very young children for life in a broad international community. In funding and implementing language programs, three questions policymakers and instructors often ask about foreign language learning and teaching are: (1) At what age should foreign language learning start; (2) What teaching methods should be used; and (3) To what extent is there a special aptitude for foreign language learning?",

Most states now fund or are creating preschool programs, many have developed learning standards for young children, and it is becoming widely accepted that high-quality early childhood education enhances school readiness and reduces racial and ethnic achievement gaps. Policy makers need to know where to direct their efforts before students can fully reap the rewards of early education. In designing high-quality early childhood programs, many important choices need to be made, such as deciding whether to provide universal care or to target services to the most vulnerable youngsters; how much time is needed in preschool (i.e., what age to start, how many years it should last, and whether it should be full day or half day); and what kind of follow-up might be needed in \"regular school.\" The first step in making such decisions is knowing what makes a program \"high quality.\"",

Graduates need this level of readiness if they are to succeed in college-level courses without remediation and to enter workforce training programs ready to learn job-specific skills.  The study results convey an important message to U.S. high school educators  and high school students: All high school students should be educated  according to a common academic expectation, one that prepares them for both  postsecondary education and the workforce. Only then--whether they are among  the two-thirds who enter college directly after graduation or those who enter  workforce training programs--will they be ready for life after high school. Although the contexts within which these expectations are taught and assessed may differ, the level of expectation for all students must be the same. Anything less will not give high school graduates the foundation of academic skills they will need to learn additional skills as their jobs change or as they change jobs throughout their careers. The results of this study provide ample evidence that we must move the agenda for high school redesign in a direction that will prepare all students for success no matter which path they choose after  graduation.

The preeminent national authority on physical education and a recognized leader in sport and physical activity, NASPE is partnering on the 2006 Shape of the Nation Report with the American Heart Association (AHA), a national voluntary health agency whose mission is to reduce disability and death from cardiovascular diseases and stroke. This joint project is important to both organizations because, in a time of increasing health risks and health care costs in America, prevention is key and exemplary physical education programs must be part of the solution for inactivity, obesity, and related chronic diseases. The challenge of the first &quot;Shape of the Nation&quot; Report in 1987 continues in this latest survey. That is, typically state mandates are broad and general, leaving many specifics open to interpretation. The purpose of this &quot;Shape of the Nation&quot; Report is to provide current information about the status of physical education in each state and the District of Columbia. This report will not only bring attention to the importance of quality, daily physical education programs for all school age children; it will also provide information that can be used as a basis for expanding and improving physical education programs in those states that need assistance. The vision is that every student will become physically educated and thus possess the knowledge, skills, and confidence to be physically active and healthy for a lifetime.

This debate is primarily the result of frustration; despite the investment of billions of dollars, learner outcomes have not significantly improved. One possible explanation is that most education programs and specific interventions are not informed by the same type of scientifically based research (SBR) used in medical and other scientific fields. There is a growing call for concentrating future research investments in the field of education on experimental SBR because other methods, including quasi-experimental and non-experimental studies, cannot identify effective practices and programs. Proponents of scientifically based research in education argue that education is a science, like chemistry, medicine, or psychology, and therefore is subject to the same rules of evidence as any other applied field. Federally supported adult education and literacy research activities are increasingly emphasizing experimental studies. The landmark No Child Left Behind statute highlights the importance of experimental research that can identify  educational programs that have demonstrated their effectiveness through scientifically based research.

        "description":"A 2003 qualitative study examined the perspectives of 70 stakeholders in two adult literacy programs in Manitoba, Canada. Two stakeholders were Literacy Working Group (LWG) chairpersons, who held administrative positions akin to public school boards. Of particular significance to these administrators were issues related to program coordination, instruction, finances, and community image. The experiences that they shared reveals a familiarity with program operations that is unrecorded elsewhere in the literature on adult education. Therefore, in addition to exposing the challenges faced by voluntary board members, this article's examination of their perspectives opens an avenue for further exploration of similar administrative bodies in other settings. The primary lesson to be learned is that optimally successful programs/organizations depend on more than just the good will of their volunteer boards and paid staff; they also rely on administrative savvy and the mutual exchange of information for the purpose of improving policies and procedures.",

        "author":["Jenkins, Davis"],
        "description":"The purpose of this study is to identify the policies and practices of community colleges that are effective in enabling their students to succeed in postsecondary education. The study was conducted through a partnership with the Florida Department of Education's Division of Community Colleges and Workforce Education and funded by the Lumina Foundation for Education as part of its Achieving the Dream initiative. Achieving the Dream is a national effort to increase the success of community college students, particularly those in groups that have been underserved in higher education. The initiative works on multiple fronts including technical assistance to community colleges, research, public engagement, and public policy-and emphasizes the use of data to drive change. This study builds on earlier research that the Community College Research Center (CCRC) has conducted using national survey data. Transcript-level data on 150,000 students in three cohorts of first-time Florida community college students and a regression methodology to estimate the effect that each of the 28 Florida community colleges has on the  probability of its students' achieving a successful outcome, after controlling for characteristics of the individual students was used. This effect can be seen as a measure of value added-the impact that a college has on its students' educational success independent of the characteristics of individual students. The colleges according to their estimated effects on student success, were then ranked. Appended are: (1) Methodology for Measuring Institutional Impact on Student Success Using Student Cohort Data from the Florida Community Colleges; and (2) Profiles of High- and Low-Impact Community Colleges.

        "description":"The United States is a world leader in scientific and technological innovation. To help maintain this advantage, the federal government has spent billions of dollars on education programs in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields for many years. However, concerns have been raised about the nation's ability to maintain its global technological competitive advantage in the future. The testimony in this report is based on the October 2005 report and presents information on: (1) trends in degree attainment in STEM- and non-STEM-related fields and factors that may influence these trends; (2) trends in the levels of employment in STEM- and non-STEM-related fields and factors that may influence these trends; and (3) federal education programs intended to support the study of and employment in STEM-related fields. For this report, the researchers analyzed survey responses from 13 civilian federal departments and agencies; analyzed data from the Departments of Education and Labor; interviewed educators, federal agency officials, and representatives from education associations and organizations; and interviewed students. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that while postsecondary enrollment has increased over the past decade, the proportion of students obtaining degrees in STEM fields has fallen. In academic year 1994-1995, about 519,000 students (32 percent) obtained STEM degrees. About 578,000 students obtained STEM degrees in academic year 2003-2004, accounting for 27 percent of degrees awarded. Despite increases in enrollment and degree attainment by women and minorities at the graduate level, the number of graduate degrees conferred fell in several STEM-related fields from academic year 1994-1995 to academic year 2003-2004. College and university officials and students most often cited subpar teacher quality and poor high school preparation as factors that discouraged the pursuit of STEM degrees. Suggestions to encourage more enrollment in STEM fields include increased outreach and mentoring. (Contains 20 footnotes, 1 table, and 3 figures.)

The initiative was intended to significantly alter the ways in which the state's English learners (ELs) are taught. Proposition 227 requires that ELs be taught &quot;overwhelmingly in English&quot; through sheltered/structured English immersion (SEI) programs during &quot;a temporary transition period not normally intended to exceed one year,&quot; and then transferred to mainstream English-language classrooms. In 2000, the California Department of Education contracted with the American Institutes for Research (AIR), assisted by WestEd, for a five-year, legislatively mandated evaluation of the effects of the Implementation of Proposition 227 on the Education of English Learners. A combination of student achievement analyses, phone interviews, case study site visits, and written surveys was used to examine such questions as how the proposition was implemented, which EL services are most and least effective, and what unintended consequences resulted from Proposition 227's implementation. This is the culminating report, synthesizing findings from research performed across all five years of the study and submitted to the California Department of Education.

Implementation profiling identifies the conditions that participants perceive are most important when implementing an innovation. Information about the relative importance of the eight conditions is important because it could lead to the development of implementation plans tailored to specific demographic characteristics of an organization. The eight conditions, developed by Ely (1990, 1999), are: dissatisfaction with the status quo, skills and knowledge, time, resources, rewards and incentives, participation, commitment, and leadership. This study builds on Ely's research by determining the relative importance of each of the conditions by age, gender, ethnicity, educational degree, career field, and technology proficiency.

        "description":"Over the past decade, the standards-based reform movement in education has focused attention on the responsibility of schools and school systems to produce results in student learning. Nationally this focus is most evident with the implementation of accountability provisions of the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001. However, even prior to NCLB, many states and districts had instituted their own performance-based accountability programs. In 1999, the California legislature approved the Public Schools Accountability Act (PSAA), which incorporated three central components designed to hold schools accountable for improving student outcomes. In June 2003, AIR completed the first legislatively mandated study of the PSAA, with support from Policy Analysis for California Education (PACE) and EdSource. In November 2004, AIR was contracted by the California Department of Education to conduct a continuation study of the II/USP component of PSAA. Building on the findings from the 2003 PSAA evaluation, this study was designed to provide follow-up information on the overall impact of the II/USP program and on the factors and strategies that have contributed to growth in selected low-performing schools. In addition, since II/USP has evolved to incorporate the School Assistance and Intervention Team (SAIT) process, AIR examined this component of the policy specifically. This report provides the details of the study and an in-depth discussion of AIR's findings in four main areas: (1) the overall impact of II/USP on student achievement; (2) factors contributing to or hindering growth within II/USP schools; (3) the role of the district in school improvement efforts; and (4) the impact of NCLB implementation on the focus and implementation of the state accountability program.

The paper begins by describing a general overview of adoption, change, and implementation theories based on the work of E.M. Rogers, Donald P. Ely, and others. The authors then describe a generic, macro level model for implementing innovations in higher education. This generic implementation model includes seven components: Resources, infrastructure, people, policies, learning, evaluation, and support. The seven components of the generic model are then adapted for use as a framework for developing strategies to facilitate the use of web-based learning by higher education faculty. Specific recommendations for facilitating the use of WBL among higher education faculty are included in each part of the framework. For example, a recommendation related to Policies is \"Universities may also have to adapt existing policies related to student fees, prerequisite courses, faculty evaluations, testing, degree requirements, and residency requirements, among others, in order to successfully implement web-based learning.\"",

Results in the press and later summaries, such as that found in The Condition of Education (NCES, 2005b) reported U.S. rankings in relation to all participating countries on each assessment. Because of the variability in the composition of countries participating in each assessment, these discussions have given an inaccurate impression that U.S. students' performance on PISA experienced a precipitous decline compared with favorable U.S. rankings on TIMSS at grades 4 and 8. A total of 24 countries participated in TIMSS-4, 45 countries in TIMSS-8, and 40 countries in PISA. Notably, many higher-performing European countries that participated in PISA and contributed to the lower U.S. rankings were absent from the TIMSS results in which U.S. performance ranked above average. Reform proposals, such as those from the National Academy of Science and the Business Roundtable, have focused on improving mathematics at the secondary school level and may have been mislead by the differing country comparisons. The current study reexamines the TIMSS and PISA results to correct this comparison bias by analyzing U.S. mathematics performance relative to a common set of 12 countries that participated in all three assessments. Along with the United States, the comparison countries are Australia, Belgium, Hong Kong, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, and the Russian Federation. These countries span the four continents of Australia/Oceana, Asia, North America and Europe and constitute a broad range of primarily industrialized nations (i.e., above the world average per capita income). This study first examines the results for the United States compared with the results for the comparison countries. The country results are then used to explore various educational factors associated with international mathematics performance at different stages of students' mathematical development and through different country-specific characteristics.

As this literature review indicates there has been a lot of research on the benefits of reading aloud to children from their early years (pre-school) through high school. Research has been done to gather information on the effects of reading aloud on language development, social development, school readiness and administering assessments. Participants in this study were 15 first grade Spanish/Portuguese bilingual students, with the exception of one student. The experiment consisted of six sessions of students being read aloud to. The students alternated weekly by having a reading companion one week and not having it the following week. This continued for the duration of the experiment. This experiment was to add to the research that has been done on the effects of reading aloud to children. Appendix A provides a cloze paragraph administered to gather data on reading comprehension after students were read six different first grade level readers. Appendix B presents a vocabulary test administered to gather data on vocabulary acquisition and to determine reading fluency. (Contains 2 tables.) [Master's Thesis, Kean University.]",

This creates detrimental effects on the learner and his or her self-esteem.

The purpose of this study is to examine the failings of traditional methods and to review some important natural ways that remedy these failings, yet have their own shortcomings.

It identifies major differences between the mathematics frameworks, textbooks, assessments, and teachers in Singapore and the United States. It also presents initial results from four pilot sites that introduced the Singapore mathematics text book in place of their regular text books. Analysis of these evidentiary streams finds Singaporean students more successful in mathematics than their U.S. counterparts because &quot;Singapore has a world-class mathematics system with quality components aligned to produce students who learn mathematics to mastery.&quot; These components include Singapore's highly logical national mathematics framework, mathematically rich problem-based textbooks, challenging mathematics assessments, and highly qualified mathematics teachers whose pedagogy centers on teaching to mastery. Singapore also provides its mathematically slower students with an alternative framework and special assistance from an expert teacher. &quot;The U.S. mathematics system does not have similar features.&quot; It lacks a centrally identified core of mathematical content that provides a focus for the rest of the system. Its traditional textbooks emphasize definitions and formulas, not mathematical understanding; its assessments are not especially challenging; and too many U.S. teachers lack sound mathematics preparation. At-risk students often receive special assistance from a teacher's aide who lacks a college degree. As a result, the United States produces students who have learned only to mechanically apply mathematical procedures to solve routine problems and who are, therefore, not mathematically competitive with students in most other industrialized countries.

        "author":["Greene, Jay P.",
          "Winters, Marcus A."],
        "description":"This study uses a widely respected method to calculate public high school graduation rates for the nation, for each state, and for the 100 largest school districts in the United States. Graduation rates are calculated overall, by race, and by gender, using the most recent available data (the class of 2003). While this report builds upon a foundation of previous reports, there is much that is new. First, this report contains graduation rate estimates for the class of 2003, the most recent year for which data are available. Unfortunately, Common Core Data (CCD) enrollment and diploma counts are being released with greater time lags. However, since graduation rates tend not to change dramatically in short periods of time, this study provides a valuable snapshot of the performance of public schools today. Second, this report is able for the first time to break out graduation rates by gender. Observers have long suspected that the graduation rate for boys is significantly lower than that for girls. CCD now contains enough information to allow estimated graduation rates using the method for boys and girls separately. Third, this report contains graduation rates for each of the 100 largest school districts in the country. Previous rates for these districts were reported in a 2001 report, &quot;High School Graduation Rates in the United States,&quot; with results for the class of 1998. The last few national report results for districts were not released. The district results in the 2001 report were based on enrollment and diploma information gathered from districts and states. After releasing that report, there were concerns about the reliability and consistency of those counts, so district graduation rates in subsequent national reports were not produced. For this report, reliability and consistency concerns have been addressed by relying only on district information gathered from CCD. Because of the uniform standards and procedures enforced by CCD, district results can once again be reported with a high level of confidence. It is important to note that no comparisons ought to be made between the district results for the class of 2003 and the previously reported district results for the class of 1998. Because those earlier results may not be reliable and were not computed using the same method as the current report, no conclusions should be drawn about any change in graduation rates for the districts.

        "author":["Quint, Janet"],
        "description":"High school reform has moved to the top of the education policy agenda, commanding  the attention of the federal government, governors, urban school superintendents, philanthropists, and the general public. All are alarmed by stubbornly high dropout rates, by the low academic achievement of many high school students, and by the large numbers of high school graduates who are required to take remedial classes in college. These trends disproportionately affect urban and certain rural areas and minority groups: The most troubled high schools are concentrated in about 50 large cities and 15 primarily southern and southwestern states, and the majority of their students tend to be African-American or Hispanic. This is the first in a series of reports for policymakers, practitioners, and others who must make hard choices about how to change high schools. It discusses three comprehensive initiatives evaluated by MDRC -- Career Academies, First Things First, and Talent Development -- that have grappled with the challenges of improving low-performing urban and rural schools. Together, these three interventions are being implemented in more than 2,500 high schools across the country, and various components of these models are being used in thousands more schools. The overall message of this synthesis is that \"structural changes\" to improve personalization and \"instructional improvement\" are the twin pillars of high school reform. Whether districts and schools adopt a comprehensive reform initiative like the ones MDRC studied or put together the elements of a comprehensive intervention on their own, much has been learned about what is needed--and what seems to work. What remains is to make sure that practitioners have the support they need to put that learning into practice. (Contains 5 tables, 4 figures, and 45 endnotes.)",

The industrial sector is the first source of academic R&D funding to show a multiyear decline since the survey began, in FY 1953. Industry's FY 2004 percentage decline was more substantial than its percentage reductions in previous years (1.1 percent in 2003, 1.5 percent in 2002). Industrial support was $2.1 billion in FY 2004, down from a high of $2.2 billion in FY 2001. Industry's share of academic R&D support in FY 2004 equaled its share in FY 1983, at 4.9 percent. Overall, universities and colleges reported R&D expenditures of $42.9 billion in FY 2004, 7.2 percent more than the previous year ($40.1 billion). This increase represents a slowdown in the growth of academic R&D expenditures after 2 years of double-digit growth (10.9 percent in FY 2002, 10.2 percent in FY 2003). When adjusted for inflation, academic R&D rose 4.7 percent in FY 2004. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "author":["Colton, Tara"],
        "description":"This new report shows that while some of New York's college readiness programs have grown significantly in the last few years, there have also been some disappointing steps backward. For instance, the Bloomberg administration backed away from an initiative launched in 2000 by CUNY Chancellor Matthew Goldstein and then-New York City Schools Chancellor Harold Levy to improve collaboration between the two institutions and significantly expand college preparedness programs. The landmark initiative included the creation of a new deputy. Goldstein and Chancellor Klein now have a close working relationship, and with many of the Bloomberg administration's education reforms already set in motion, the next four years could be the ideal time for it to commit to programs that ensure students do not just graduate high school, but graduate ready to succeed in college and in careers. This report, based on more than eight months of research and informed by dozens of interviews with local and national education experts and policymakers, documents how large numbers of public school students in New York are finishing high school unprepared for college and examines what New York City and other local governments are doing to address the problem. The study, which is a follow-up to the Center's 2001 report &quot;Building a Highway to Higher Ed,&quot; provides a detailed assessment of the main dual enrollment programs being offered in New York, all of which are part of the P-16 (Preschool to &quot;16th grade,&quot; or the last year of college) educational movement. Articles in this issue include: (1) School Ties; (2) Head of the Class; (3) Double Trouble; and (4) Held Back.

        "description":"Between September 2005 and January 2006, Public Education Network (PEN) held a series of public hearings to give students, parents, and community members-audiences very much affected by the law, but usually left out of the policy debate-an opportunity to tell their side of the NCLB story. The hearings serve four purposes: (1) They provide venues through which a public record of the local capacity to implement NCLB can be compiled; (2) they serve as a means to inform and mobilize the public on issues pertaining to public education and what it takes to improve its quality; (3) they give PEN and its national partners the information needed to bring public voices and concerns into the debate about reshaping NCLB; and (4) they create a public &quot;resume&quot; for review by policymakers in the context of the law's reauthorization. After two rounds of NCLB hearings, the public debate about issues raised by the implementation of NCLB is more intense than ever. As greater numbers of schools are labeled &quot;in need of improvement,&quot; reliance on a single test to make this determination seems inappropriate and unfair to the public, especially when resources are scarce and not evenly distributed. With greater numbers of teachers being deemed unqualified, feelings about what counts as a highly qualified teacher have intensified, as has the public's belief in the community as a true partner in school success. As policymakers consider changes to the law at the federal level, or in implementation strategies at the local level, such partnerships can and should be part of a strategy to ensure that every child has a quality public education. This report includes: (1) Summary of Testimony &amp; Recommendations from the Public; and (2) National Report. Appended are: (1) PEN 2005 NCLB Online Survey; and (2) State Hearing Information.

        "description":"Community schools foster a learning environment that extends far beyond the classroom walls. Students learn and problem solve in the context of their lives and communities. Community schools nurture this natural engagement. Because of the deep and purposeful connections between schools and communities, the curriculum is influenced and enhanced, removing the artificial separation between the classroom and the real world. Coalition for Community Schools' vision for community schools is that they are places where &quot;all&quot; students engage in learning, achieve to the best of their ability, and become productive citizens and participants in the nation's democracy. This paper underscores the need for a concerted and intentional effort to engage all students in learning. Numerous approaches to community-based learning are already in use and it highlights six models with a particular emphasis on community problem solving: academically based community service, civic education, environment-based education, place-based learning, service learning, and work-based learning. If all students are to succeed, much more attention must be paid to community-based learning as a strategy for engaging and motivating students and for strengthening the relationship between schools and communities.

        "description":"Geographic cost differences present many complications when researchers attempt to make systematic comparisons of educational resources, and failure to address such differences can undermine the equity and adequacy goals of school finance formulas. Therefore, there is considerable interest in developing measures of the cost of education that can facilitate such comparisons and possibly may be used to adjust school finance formulas in some states. Geographic cost adjustment data for states, metropolitan areas, and school districts are frequently and widely requested by the public and school finance research community. In this report, NCES extends the analysis of comparable wages to the labor market level using a Comparable Wage Index (CWI). The basic premise of a CWI is that all types of workers--including teachers--demand higher wages in areas with a higher cost of living. This report develops a CWI by combining baseline estimates from the 2000 U.S. census with annual data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey is a BLS database that contains average annual earnings by occupation for states and metropolitan areas from about 400,000 nonfarm businesses, and is available for years 1997 to 2003. Combining the census with the OES makes it possible to have yearly CWI estimates for states and local labor markets for each year after 1997. OES data are available each May and permit the construction of an up-to-date, annual CWI. Appended are: (1) Extending the Baseline With the OES; and (2) Comparisons With Other Cost Adjustment Strategies. (Contains 8 tables, 4 figures, and 21 endnotes.)

In a knowledge-based global economy, the economic, social, and civic welfare of states depends on the capacity of their residents to think at an increasingly sophisticated level. Certificates and degrees are increasingly inadequate proxies for this kind of &quot;educational capital.&quot; It is the skills and knowledge behind the degrees that matters. A state-level approach to assessing college-level learning can give states that essential information. The states in the demonstration project were Illinois, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Nevada, and South Carolina. The results are briefly described in this Policy Alert.

        "description":"The main purpose of this study was to look at how we used specific writing assignments in our courses to encourage metacognitive reflection in order to increase the learning that takes place. The study also aimed to aid in the development of higher order processing skills through the development of student reflection. The students involved in the study come from a cross-cultural base: urban residential college with a diverse student population, suburban residential college with traditional age students, and state college graduate and undergraduate students. Students were enrolled in a mathematics, history and philosophy of education, or community health and research courses. In addition, the researchers represent both African American and white faculty and teach courses in mathematics, teacher education, and professional entry-level occupational therapy. The research methodology used in this study is educational action research and classroom research which provide a rationale for studying our own teaching and learning as well as the students' learning. Students were given writing prompts that encouraged self-system thinking, metacognition and made use of the cognitive system described by Marzano. The results indicate that students were able to reflect upon their work in the various courses. They developed a level of consciousness that they used to deepen their knowledge within the disciplines. The study shows that students are able to develop, through reflective thinking, higher order thinking skills. They showed the ability to analyze their own learning and start the metacognitive thinking that is necessary to be effective learners. The ability to think critically is an important trait of all members of society. With today's multinational, multicultural, complex issues, citizens must be able to sift through large amounts of various data to make intelligent decisions. Higher education must provide the intellectual training for its students to participate in this world.

        "author":["Gill, Wanda E."],
        "description":"Regional accreditation is an important and viable way for institutions to regulate themselves through standards development and their attainment as examined through peer review. Cycles of accreditation are useful in comparing and contrasting overall institutional effectiveness over time and against mutually agreed upon parameters. In the past 15 years, regional accrediting agencies have placed an increased emphasis on student outcomes as one of many measures of how well the institution is fulfilling its mission. This paper examines the status of outcomes assessments in the accreditation processes of the regional accrediting associations. The following questions were posed and answered as a result of this research: (1) What do research studies tell us about the use of outcomes assessment in the accreditation process? (2) What are the areas of agreement among regional accrediting agencies on outcomes assessments? (3) What resources do regional accrediting agencies use to support outcomes assessments in the accreditation process? and (4) What areas could benefit more from an analysis of outcomes assessments but are currently somewhat limited? Research studies tell us that the goal of using outcomes assessments to determine the institution's mission and goal fulfillment is still evolving for most institutions. The goal of capacity building as a result of outcomes assessments is far off. More planned intermittent research is needed at all levels of the academy, community colleges, 4 year institutions, and universities to differentiate the components of assessments that are useful at each level. Questions posed as a result of outcomes assessment in the accreditation process include those related to budget development and expenditures, academic program viability, and student focused institutional planning and development. Areas that could benefit more from an analysis of outcomes assessments but are currently somewhat limited include student affairs data analysis incling surveys on student participation in tutoring and campus activities, work study program participation, and outcomes assessments findings from federally funded student affairs programs. There is little evidence in the literature that outcomes assessments are being used to improve the curriculum, or change curricular direction to make it more in line with institutional mission. There is evidence that policy issues in accreditation are greatly affected by federal legislation.

        "description":"For well over a decade, the &quot;graying&quot; of the library profession has been the subject of much discussion. To examine this issue the Library Research Service (LRS) initiated the study, &quot;Retirement, Retention, and Recruitment: The Future of Librarianship in Colorado.&quot; During the last quarter of 2003, 1,241 librarians, paraprofessionals, information science (LIS) students, and independent information professionals from all over the state responded to a voluntary online survey asking them about their careers, their workplaces, and their attitudes about librarianship. Respondents included both library workers who plan to retire within the next five years and those who do not. The study showed that more than 20 percent of responding librarians expect to retire within the next five years and of all responding school librarians, almost half indicate plans to retire by 2008--more than three times the proportion for public librarians and almost five times the proportion for academic librarians. Retiring librarians will take with them substantial supervisory, administrative, and leadership skills. Of these prospective retirees, one out of five expects their job to be combined with another or eliminated. Almost one out of five expects to be succeeded by someone with less education. Librarians without immediate retirement plans, especially in non-metro areas and among school librarians, expect their successors to have less education. Responding librarians ages 30 to 44 are more likely than other age groups to choose to leave librarianship. Of responding LIS students, four out of five are ages 30 to 54, indicating that for many librarianship is a second career. Responding paraprofessionals say they would be encouraged to pursue an LIS degree or credential, if financial aid was available, class locations and schedules were convenient, online classes were available, and their work schedules were more flexible. Retirements in library profession over the next five years are numerous and will affect some parts of the profession more than others. As decision-makers for libraries seek to replace retiring librarians, they will face issues related both to recruiting new people into librarianship and to retaining librarians who are not retiring. Thus, the relationship between these three R's--retirement, recruitment, and retention--is one that calls for a comprehensive statewide strategy to ensure that users of libraries of all types in all parts of the state receive equitable, high-quality services from credentialed librarians. Appended are: (1) Questionnaire; (2) Individual Question Responses; and (3) Bibliography. (Contains 82 charts and 10 tables.) [This report was produced by Library Research Service.

        "author":["Stoneberg, Bert D."],
        "description":"This paper discusses a Standard &amp; Poor's analysis of state performance on the 2005 and 2003 NAEP reading and mathematics tests that took account of the demographic differences among the states. The study was presented at the NAEP State Service Center Winter Workshop in January, 2006. Standard &amp; Poor's is commended for recognizing that NAEP data cannot be understood sans a consideration of the students' demographic characteristics, and for venturing to use a more sophisticated statistical methodology than simply ranking the states. A linear regression analysis was implemented to predict a state's achievement from the percentage of the state's economically disadvantaged students. States falling outside of one standard error of estimate were labeled either over performers or under performers. However, the linear regression model is inappropriate because it cannot account for the uncertainty in the achievement data inherent in NAEP's sampling procedures. Standard &amp; Poor's determination of a state's percentage of disadvantaged students is also problematic. Instead of using a state's percentage of disadvantaged students that NAEP calculates on the same 2005 student sample from which the state's performance score was derived, Standard &amp; Poors used a state's K-12 percentage from 2003-04 as recorded in the Common Core of Data. Using a K-12 percentage of school lunch participation typically underestimates the actual grade 4 percentage and overestimates the actual grade 8 percentage. Thus, the study did not account for error in the student achievement data and it introduced unnecessary error in the economic disadvantaged student data. Standard &amp; Poor's should continue its study of public education, but using a statistical model more suited to the characteristics of NAEP data. The NAEP Data Explorer, an online tool launched by the National Center for Education Statistics, should be considered for use in future analyses. (Contains 9 figures.)",

Education has also been affected by this discourse. The following paper examines two countries affected by conflict (Pakistan and Yemen), asking what type of community participation is possible in areas with complex conflict situations, since &quot;community participation&quot; demands some form of &quot;democracy.&quot; The conflict scenario and the locus of control and power in these countries is examined in two rural areas. Finally, the paper questions what type and degree of community participation is possible in education and whether it can become a catalyst for peace, or an indirect mechanism for power elites to control decision-making.

It examines the implementation of a Student Support Outline as a vehicle for planning during regularly scheduled collaboration meetings by school teams. In addition, it discusses the application of the Interaction and Engagement Scale as a tool for observing and recording the interactions of students with their peers and teachers. This tool also records student engagement with tasks in the classroom setting. Each school team, consisting of special and general education personnel, developed a support plan for the inclusion of their students with severe disabilities. These support plans were reviewed at each meeting of the team and the results from the structured observations were applied during team planning for students' academic and social progress. The effectiveness of the planning was evaluated through observations and interviews of both the students and their teachers. Results of the study suggest that the use of a Student Support Outline can improve the process of planning and implementing supports for students. (Contains 5 figures and 1 table.)

        "title":"Coral Reefs as Sites for Experiential Environmental Education: Learning with Australian Students--A Foundational Study",
        "author":["Stepath, Carl Myron"],
        "description":"Marine education aims to educate a citizenry capable of making astute decisions about the impact of human activities, and encourage ecologically sensitive practices. Coral reefs are critically important, and are in serious decline. This research explores high school students' reef experiences with respect to specific learning outcomes. Queensland students were surveyed and interviewed after training in the classroom and at Great Barrier Reef sites. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed. I analyse changes in the Marine Education Society of Australasia's Three A's of Coastal and Marine Studies for senior high school students. This presupposes learning where a gain in knowledge (awareness) leads to a change in attitude, and thereby improves personal actions toward marine environments. This research analyses whether the links between the variables are linear and effects of reef experience. The student participants were divided into groups receiving different educational interventions. Some students received both interventions, while others received only one treatment and a contrast group received neither. Pre- and post-test survey questionnaires and interviews collected responses, and results were compared. This research contributes a Model of Ecological Intention to Act, which was developed and tested as part of the research process. Results show reef experiential education to have a positive effect on students' environmental knowledge (awareness), attitudes towards reef environments and stated intention to act. The reef experience alone caused the greatest change in environmental attitudes and ecological intention to act. This alludes to the fact that knowledge itself could be slowing down the improvement of attitudes and intention to act. In my study students' initial environmental scores were found to be low, and the relationship was not linear. An interdisciplinary methodology for addressing pedagogical questions in marine education was developed that provides baseline information for future research. Past research reveals more about environmental knowledge and attitudes than about students' educational experience and preferences. An attempt to advance the understanding of learning in marine experiential education was made by addressing the idea of moving away from linear learning models. This study identifies issues and challenges, and supplies a focus on adolescent learners, and their experiences. This work took an elemental step in addressing the question of proximal relations between humans and coral reefs. The analysis generated statistical findings, while student accounts confirmed the learning value of structured underwater activities. It is time for us to rethink curricular practice, issues of sustainability and education in the 21st century.

        "description":"This paper presents case studies of four students' experiences with writing in a fourth/fifth grade classroom. The paper focuses on the following questions: What is the relationship between children's social and intellectual identities and their successes or struggles in writing? How do writing instruction and assessments mediate that relationship? The theories and research literatures that frame our study include sociocultural theories, theory and research on identity and its relationship to learning, research on writing curriculum and children's classroom experiences in writing and theories of discourse and positioning. The data analyzed for this paper were gathered as part of a two-year, qualitative, classroom-based study of children's experiences across literacy and mathematics in a fourth/fifth grade urban classroom. Data for this paper was drawn from the study's first year and included fieldnotes of observations, audio and videotapes of lessons and discussions, audiotaped interviews with all students in the classroom, and written artifacts. The first year of the study focused on twenty-three children in a large northwestern city. Participating children included Native American, African American, white, and Asian American families who have lived in the U.S. for two or more generations, as well as children who had more recently emigrated from Africa (primarily Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia), Southeast Asia, Pakistan, and Mexico.  Students' families were primarily working class and lower middle class with a few students living in poverty. We employed grounded theory and discourse analysis to analyze data and constructed case studies by sorting all classroom data by each focus child and then examining transcripts and other documents that provide context for each child's learning and achievement. Our findings show how various elements of the writing curriculum worked to facilitate or hinder each child's success. Our findings emphasize tensions that are illustrated in each case study. These include tensions between: common elements of a 'progressive' writing curriculum and children's individual approaches to writing; children's perceptions of themselves as writers and their performance in writing; the continually shifting discourses about writing within the classroom and the fixed notions of writing in state assessments; the need to master certain elements of \"school writing\" and the children's own sense of what was engaging or appropriate writing. Our case studies point to the need to increase rather than decrease flexibility in the writing curriculum and point to the complexities inherent in attempting to construct writing assessments that provide a valid measure of children's writing achievement.",

        "description":"Different item response theory (IRT) models may be employed for item calibration. Change of testing vendors, for example, may result in the adoption of a different model than that previously used with a testing program. To provide scale continuity and preserve cut score integrity, item parameter estimates from the new model must be linked to the item parameter estimates obtained from the previous model. Given that the assumptions of different models vary, it is necessary to identify linking methods that best place item parameters scaled using the new model to item parameters scaled using the old model. In this study, we explore the results of equating 3PL parameter estimates to 1PL parameter estimates, using Moment, Characteristic Curve, and Theta Regression methods. The data set consists of 31,813 student responses to a 78 item, multiple choice, End-of-Instruction exam. The evaluation criteria include the impact of different linking methods on scale score means and standard deviations, scale score frequency distributions, Test Characteristic Curves and Standard Error Curves, test information, and the classification of students into the different proficiency levels. The Characteristic Curve linking methods best aligned the 3PL scale to the 1PL scale. From the results, if aligning the mean and SD of the scale score distribution is perceived to be most important, then the Stocking and Lord method is preferable. If the classification of students into different performance categories is deemed most important, then the Haebara method is recommended. In either case, the differences are trivial.

        "description":"Proper maintenance of a scale established in the baseline year would assure the accurate estimation of growth in subsequent years. Scale maintenance is especially important when the state performance standards must be preserved for future administrations. To ensure proper maintenance of a scale, the selection of anchor items and evaluation of their performance in the succeeding administrations are crucial. Under the common item equating design, anchor item selection is a critical process and is typically scrutinized against a set of guidelines for selection. Even if the guidelines for selecting anchor items are met for the anchor set, items may still perform differentially, for example, context effects, or changes in instructional emphasis, which might introduce additional dimensions, hence, differential examinee performance. In this study, four statistical methods of evaluating anchor items are explored. The evaluation process used data from statewide assessments in two content areas. The results indicate that the Delta-Plot method which uses proportion correct (p-value) as input, differs from the methods (Lord's Chi-Square, Stocking and Lord's TCC inverse, and Raju's area minimization methods) that use Item Response Theory (IRT) item parameters as input in flagging differentially performing items. The results further show that the decisions of excluding or including anchor items impacts on students' test scores at both the student and group levels.

        "description":"This paper presents a critical discourse analysis of a classroom event in which fourth and fifth grade students in a highly diverse urban school interpreted, discussed and responded to a district survey intended to illuminate the social climate of the city's schools, with a particular focus on race and racism. We drew on the three-dimensional critical discourse analysis methodology articulated by Fairclough (1989; 1995). Accordingly, we conducted three analyses of data related to this classroom event that were mapped on to one another. First, we analyzed the language of both the classroom discussions and the district survey. This analysis included examining turn-taking, use of metaphor in both spoken and written texts, terms/phrases used to articulate race, difference, fairness, and privacy, and generic structures in the survey. Second, we analyzed the content of the survey itself and the explanatory information from the district that accompanied it to examine its process of production and dissemination and the motivations of the district in engaging in that process.  This level of analysis also involved examining how the language of the survey led it to be consumed in a particular way by this group of children. Third, we analyzed the sociocultural context surrounding this event, particularly the discussions of race that had occurred prior to this event, the role of individual children in this event, and the role of this particular classroom context. This data was drawn from the second year of a two-year classroom-based study of children's experiences across literacy and mathematics in a fourth/fifth grade urban classroom. The 23 participants included Native American, African American, white, Latino and Asian American children, many of whom were first generation immigrants to the United States. Our paper explicates several findings, including: 1) the survey led students to question static racial categories and, thus, introduced new frameworks for considering the cssroom; 2) competing discourses in survey positioned children and teachers in complex ways and led to resistant and defensive stances and missed opportunities; 3) districts need to consider the process, form and language they employ when their intent is to learn from children about such sensitive, and crucially important, issues. This analysis has implications for how districts can more effectively gather important information about racial climate in schools and how teachers can support students to engage issues of race in elementary classrooms.

The author explores research questions related to how resources are acquired, who decides how best to use resources within schools, and accountability for school performance in Taiwan. During 2004-2005, the author interviewed principals of nine elementary, junior high, and senior high schools in three regions (large and small cities; rural communities). On-site interviews and reviews of such documents as school budgets and brochures describing goals and programs reveal similarities and differences in the following: sources of funds; budget development; the determination of priorities for curriculum, special programs, and hiring personnel; school-level control of resources; use of student outcomes in curricular and budget decisions; and external accountability systems. Following a qualitative case study method, the author discusses conclusions within three themes that emerged from the data: (1) dependence; (2) relationships; and (3) accountability.

Small schools, many claim, are able to somehow disrupt the seemingly axiomatic association between SES and student achievement. Using eighth-grade data for 215 public schools in Maine, I explored the hypothesis that this is part of a statistical artifact of the greater volatility (lower reliability) of school-aggregated  student achievement in smaller schools. This hypothesis was supported when the dependent variable was mathematics achievement. In contrast, this hypothesis received no support when reading achievement served as the dependent variable.

        "description":"In this examination, 194 K-12 school counselors completed the Self-Perceptions of Effectiveness as Educational Change Agent (SPECA) survey. Analyses uncovered that Primal Leadership and personal power or empowerment both play a significant role in counselors' potential effectiveness to effect change regardless of gender or building level. Personal power or empowerment proved to make the greatest contribution towards change agency effectiveness. Results showed that counselors perceive having high indicators of emotionally intelligent Primal Leadership and adequate levels of empowerment with some important limitations pertaining to involvement in program policy. The study revealed counselors' priorities pertaining to factors of unobtrusive leadership and empowerment. Scores further specified that female counselors tend to exhibit higher self-confidence than male counselors to undertake change. However, male scores yielded stronger correlations and coefficients of determination, signifying that males may merge ability and strategy more often than females do. Additionally, results corroborated that females may be inclined to build effectiveness to lead change on relationship management, while males may value self-management and personal power combined. Analyses of variance showed that, with minor exceptions, counselors' perceptions do not differ significantly by building level. The study concluded emphasizing training as a primary change medium. A Model of Competence for Change Agency Effectiveness was proposed and recommended, compatible with the National Model for School Guidance Counseling Programs, with implications for training and evaluation.

Nowhere is the inadequacy of current methods more visible than in classroom assessment. Reliability arguments would also permit additional methodologies for evidencing reliability in classrooms. It would liberalize methodology beyond reliability coefficients and agreement indices enabling and encouraging more creative yet disciplined approaches to supporting reliability. But how does a teacher actually make a reliability argument and, more specifically, support it with evidence? Where is reliability--stability and consistency--evident in the organic and all-too-human day-to-day operations of a classroom?

        "description":"The world of educational quality in 2006 is infused with conflicting ecopolitical agendas that constitute evidence of social strain and what Cherry Banks (2006) calls the tension between unity and diversity. That tension is increasingly prevalent among growing multicultural communities where centuries of inadequate educational funding have created class and race based poverty (Cochrane-Smith, 2004; Cochrane-Smith &amp; Zeichner, 2005). This poverty continues to reproduce annual patterns of under-achievement or achievement gaps. When these gaps are taken as a whole, we find ourselves faced with what Gloria Ladson-Billings (2006) so aptly refers to as a collective educational debt. This debt is not random or coincidental. It represents a systemic attempt to benefit from cheap or free labor provided by an underclass of largely non-White individuals in denial of their constitutional right to a quality education (Berliner, 2006). Stories of rats, broken plumbing, and frigid classrooms speak to the unacceptable physical conditions that many North American children and teachers are forced to endure in our nations' schools. Yet, these physical deficits are nothing in comparison to the moral disgrace of staffing these schools with unprepared teachers and failing to provision them with sufficient teaching and learning resources. Worst of all, and despite rich bodies of research on school climate, cognitive development, learning theory, and the debilitating effects of marginalization, very little is being done to recruit, train, and support teacher education candidates with life experiences and identities that mirror those of the children whom they are hired to teach. This paper introduces critical diversity theory (CDT) as a framework for understanding and operationalizing the diversification of our teaching work forces in Canada and the United States.",

        "description":"In the past fifteen years, the town of New Marshall has experienced major changes that have influenced the ways its residents view each other. Mexican immigration to New Marshall, a suburb of 30,000 located outside a large Eastern city, grew dramatically between 1990 and 2000. Where once Mexicans comprised less than 0.5% of the population, they now make up over 6%. But Mexican immigration has not been the only radical change the town has seen this century. Some fifty years ago, New Marshall was a prosperous middle-class suburb. It was a target for European immigrants, especially Italians, who came to work in local industry. Waves of African Americans, Puerto Ricans, and South Asians followed, and a sizable African American population remains. New Marshall also experienced an economic decline, and now faces pressing economic and social concerns including poverty, crime, and lower educational achievement than surrounding suburbs. New Marshall residents understand the transformation of their town by using various models to make sense of the characteristics and prospects of diverse groups of New Marshall residents. This paper explores the models of personhood applied to and used by Mexicans and other demographic groups in New Marshall, by examining narratives of the town's history. \"Models of personhood\" are characterizations of the dispositions, moral strengths and weaknesses, typical behaviors, and life prospects of a person or group. This study focuses on the models of personhood that circulate in this community, and the mechanisms, social domains, and timescales of their circulation. Narrative data are triangulated with observational data and analyses of documents such as media reports, minutes from town governance meetings, and community newsletters and bulletins. The data show that some residents identify Mexican immigrants as a strain on the already declining resources of the town, while others hail the immigrants as hard workers who will reverse the decline brought on by earlier groups. Our data reveal several contradictory models of personhood that are applied to Mexican immigrants in New Marshall. We claim that these models are important for young people, especially Mexican immigrant youth, because adolescents are attuned to questions of identity. An understanding of the models of personhood circulating in New Marshall brings us closer to an understanding of the ways in which these models may influence the experiences and aspirations of Mexican immigrant adolescents and come to bear upon their future paths.",

        "description":"Noting that there has been no national policy on child care, Canada has relied on non-profit organizations and privately owned businesses to provide most of its child care services. Historically, federal funding policies and provincial choices have produced wide differences across the country in the distribution of non-profit, for-profit and government-operated services. After many years of relative political inattention in Canada, the federal and provincial governments committed to developing a national early learning and child care program by agreeing to bilateral agreements. As Canadian child care was poised for growth in 2005, important policy decisions about how best to deliver child care services needed to be made. This paper presents new evidence as well as reviews existing evidence that supports reasons to look to the non-profit and public sectors as the optimum sites for the expected growth of Canadian child care services. It makes the case that if Canada is to avoid &quot;big-box&quot; child care (and more for-profit child care generally--both international and home--grown), then careful attention must be paid to the research and policy evidence about what happens when public funds and public policy support for-profit child care.

        "description":"The low performance of Chile in the TIMSS 1999 international study of mathematics and science achievement was a great disappointment. To investigate the likely causes for low performance in mathematics, this study 1) compared Chile to three countries and one large school system that had comparable economic conditions but superior mathematics performance, and 2) examined how important characteristics of the Chilean educational system could account for poor student achievement in mathematics. The results show that, compared to South Korea, Malaysia, the Slovak Republic, and Miami-Dade County Public Schools, Chilean 8th graders had parents with fewer years of schooling and with fewer educational resources at home. At school, Chilean students were taught by teachers who felt less prepared to teach, and who covered fewer advanced mathematics content in class than teachers in other countries. Analyses using a series of hierarchical linear models show that, in Chile, school assets were unequally distributed across social classes. Schools in socially advantaged areas had more instructional resources and better prepared teachers; these teachers, in turn, emphasized more advanced mathematics content. Schools with their own mathematics curriculum and whose teachers covered more advanced content had significantly higher student achievement in mathematics. This relationship held true even after controlling statistically for the socio-economic level and type of administration (public/private). Regardless of school characteristics, students who a) expected to graduate from university, b) thought that doing mathematics was not so difficult, and c) thought that their academic performance did not depend on good luck or innate talent, attained significantly higher mathematics achievement.

The evaluation uses the project objectives and components as the evaluation framework, and data collected through survey questionnaires, structured interviews and classroom observations. Results indicate that the local communities were actively involved in basic education planning and management via village education committees; where new schools were built, almost all communities contributed labor and/or collected money to pay for the land; most teachers and principals claimed that attending the teacher training workshops enabled them to become more &quot;professional&quot; in teaching; there was a shared concern over the sustainability of the capacity building activities in project management, monitoring and impact assessment. Results show that the ABEC project has undertaken the initial work of building community support for a small number of schools in Afghanistan, and has made a contribution to the improvement of many lives especially in remote rural areas. Future aid projects should be more outcome rather than output oriented; an integrated rather than a federalist consortium could be more effective; teacher training should be upgraded and more systematic; and a mechanism for documentation and dissemination of information is needed for knowledge building and sharing.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to review literature on the alternative certification policy so as to identify key features and issues as the basis for suggesting a more systematic approach to the study of the policy efforts. Alternative teacher certification has become a proliferating phenomenon in the United States in response to current and projected widespread teacher shortages. The growth of alternative certification, while rapid, has not been systematic and there is little agreement on how to define, structure and ensure quality control across a diverse array of programs. In the course of nearly 20 years of implementation of alternative certification, the policy landscape has been dominated by a myriad of definitions and programs, intense debate about the professional legitimacy of the solution, and mixed, inconclusive and even contradictory research in terms of the effectiveness of such programs. Although the projected severe nationwide teacher shortages have not materialized in general, such shortages do exist in specific localities and specialties, indicating that teacher distribution rather than production is the issue. Nevertheless, despite the endeavor to solve the generic teacher production problem at the macro level, alternative teacher certification has been criticized for having fallen short of addressing teacher distribution and retention at the micro level, that is, in most hard-to-staff schools in urban and rural areas and in high-need subject areas, such as mathematics and science, English as a second language, bilingual education, and special education, and for teachers of color and male teachers. Given the complexity of issues, the continued growth, and the on-going investment of public resources associated with alternative teacher certification, a comprehensive, in depth and systematic descriptive analysis is needed to help evaluate the effectiveness of the policy in addressing teacher supply and demand, teacher production and distribution.

The purpose of our project was to merge two distinct professional development models for teachers who educate ELLs without prior training or certification. The \"lesson study\" approach, which began in Japan as a professional development movement was adapted and combined with the SIOP (Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol) Model. Findings from a combination of quantitative and qualitative data sources indicated that the lesson study approach merged with the SIOP may warrant systematic implementation in in-service teacher education.",

The current national study profiles NCAA Division I women's golf team coaches and their attributes. The profile shows a highly educated, Caucasian group who are moderately compensated and have a wide range of coaching experience. The discussion concludes with several key recommendations for continuing to explore same-sex coaching in the NCAA. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Reluctance to invest in this area is due to cost and quality concerns. This study reports the findings of a survey of 700 professional and graduate education students regarding their comfort with technology, satisfaction with those experiences, and perceived quality, given their experience with online or hybrid courses. A structural equation model yielded strong fit to the data. For students with online course experience, comfort with technology was related to satisfaction with online course experience which was related to perceived quality; motivation to learn more about technology was also related to satisfaction of online learning experience. For students with hybrid online course experience (WebCT), comfort was related to satisfaction and motivation; motivation was also related to satisfaction; and satisfaction was ultimately related to perceived quality. In this group (WebCT), comfort was also directly related to perceived quality. Finally, among students with no online course-related experiences, comfort was related to motivation to learn about technology, but neither of these factors were related to perceived quality of online courses. For students with limited or no online course experience, perceptions of online course quality were more difficult to explain. (Contains 6 tables and 3 figures.)",

        "description":"The rate of obesity among school-age children has become a national concern, with the  number of overweight children aged 6 to 11 more than tripling over the past three decades (U.S. Government Accountability Office 2005). In 2001, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity, and in 2002, Congress charged the Institute of Medicine (IOM) with developing an action plan to target this health issue. Among the core recommendations of the IOM's 2004 report was a call for schools to create environments that support healthy eating and an active lifestyle. Federal, state, and local initiatives have also emphasized an &quot;energy balance&quot; approach--calories consumed versus calories expended--as critical to understanding and addressing the factors related to overweight and obesity (Institute of Medicine 2005). For example, the 2005 Dietary Guidelines report included a recommendation for at least 60 minutes of physical activity daily for children 6 to 11 years old, twice the minimum amount recommended for adults. While there is heightened attention on the role that schools can play in addressing concerns about nutrition and physical activity among young children and youth, the most recent national data on both school nutrition and physical activity opportunities for students come from the 2000 School Health Policies and Programs Study (SHPPS), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study findings concurred with ongoing findings from GAO reports about the availability of foods outside of school meals and the low nutritional value of some of those foods (Burgeson et al. 2001). The study also indicated that some schools may be cutting back on the time available for physical education and recess in order to fit as much classroom time as possible into the school day. Appended are: (1) Technical Notes; and (2) Questionnaire. (Contains 45 tables, 7 figures, and 18 endnotes.)",

Its aim is to provide information useful for interpreting and comparing the results from the three assessments, based on an in-depth look at the content of the respective frameworks and assessment items. The report draws upon information provided by the developers of the assessments, as well as data obtained from an expert panel convened to compare the frameworks and items from the three assessments on various dimensions. The results of this study indicate that although the NAEP, TIMSS, and PISA 2003 mathematics frameworks address many similar topics and require students to use a range of cognitive skills and processes, it cannot be assumed that they measure the same content in the same way.

Conducted previously in 1988, 1993, and 1999, it serves a continuing need for data on faculty and instructional staff. For the first time, NSOPF:04 is being conducted as a component study of the 2004 National Study of Faculty and Students (NSoFaS:04). The student component--the 2004 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04)--is a nationally representative study of students enrolled in all levels of postsecondary education. Historically, there has been considerable overlap in the institutions selected for participation in NSOPF and NPSAS; therefore, institution sampling and contacting activities for both studies were  coordinated to help minimize response burden on institutions and to improve data collection efficiency. This report describes the methodology and findings of NSOPF:04, which took place during the 2003-04 academic year. A field test, conducted in the  2002-03 academic year, was used to plan, implement, and evaluate methodological procedures, instruments, and systems proposed for use in the full-scale study. The 2004 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty Field Test Methodology Report (Heuer et al. 2004) is available from NCES. This methodology report is designed to report solely for NSOPF:04. NPSAS:04 procedures and results--provided in a separate report--are discussed here only as they impact or overlap with those outlined for NSOPF:04.

The Office of Indian Education has worked with the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) to identify issues for study and to design surveys that will inform these issues of concern to the community. This work has meant increasing the numbers of American Indian and Alaska Native children in study samples in some surveys to be able to report on the population. In the case of the National Indian Education Study (NIES), NCES has conducted a separate survey focusing on Indian education and the role of Indian culture in education. Other studies and reports make information on the educational status and progress of American Indians and Alaska Natives easily accessible from NCES and the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The Executive Order on American Indian and Alaska Native Education is designed to assist American Indian and Alaska Native students in meeting the challenging student academic standards of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) in a manner that is consistent with tribal traditions, languages, and cultures. This order builds on the innovations, reforms, and high standards of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, including the following: stronger accountability for results; greater flexibility in the use of federal funds; more choices for parents; and an emphasis on research-based instruction that works. Section 3 of the Order states that the Secretary of Education, in coordination with the Working Group, shall conduct a multiyear study of American Indian and Alaska Native education in relation to the challenging student academic standards of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. This publication introduces some of those studies that have data and that can be used to examine the education of American Indian and Alaska Native students.",

        "description":"Most children enter kindergarten when they are 5 years of age and move into first grade when they are 6. This time period is marked by great developmental change (Sameroff and Haith 1996), and children differ in what they can and cannot do socially, physically, and cognitively. Therefore, parents and educators are concerned whether certain children will have the knowledge and skills at age 5 to succeed in kindergarten. Over the years, policies and practices have emerged that are intended to improve children's early school experiences by giving them more time to develop and mature (e.g., changing age of entry requirements, transitional grades, readiness testing). Two such kindergarten enrollment strategies are retaining children for a second year of kindergarten and delaying the start of their first year of kindergarten. This report uses data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to examine the relationship between kindergarten enrollment status (e.g., repeating kindergarten or delaying entry into kindergarten) and children's spring first grade reading and mathematics achievement.

This brief  outlines common findings in the experiences of teachers, principals, and district administrators in implementing PSAA and recommendations across the three independent studies. Some of the key findings include: (1) Educators reported a renewed and unparalleled focus on improving student achievement and low-performing schools, also evidenced by rising test scores; (2) Effective use of data to inform practice was sporadic--Many educators lacked the skills, capacity, or time to analyze, understand, and respond to data on achievement gaps; and (3) District policy and context significantly influenced PSAA implementation, instructional improvement, and student achievement.

        "description":"Nationwide, public attention has increasingly focused on the need for a variety of early care and education arrangements to meet the changing needs of families. The demand for early care and education has grown for families from all socioeconomic sectors, intensifying as participants in welfare-to-work programs enter the workforce, and as work requirements for these programs become more stringent. In addition, research affirming the importance of children's initial years for their later social and cognitive development has heightened public awareness of and concern for the quality of care provided in centers and family child-care homes. However, while the demand for affordable, quality care for young children is on the rise, the realities of the early care and education (ECE) field present a different picture: understaffed centers, high rates of turnover among caregivers, and an educationally bifurcated workforce (with caregivers either on the low or high end of the educational spectrum). In light of research documenting the linkages among compensation, training, quality care, staff retention, and child development on the one hand, and public interest in the provision of ECE on the other, responses aimed at mitigating the staffing problem in the ECE field have focused strategies to improve retention among staff, and raise awareness regarding the role of compensation in enhancing quality. Programs launched in California  provide examples of such an approach, where, over the last 3 years, 42 counties have initiated child-care retention incentive (CRI) programs. This policy brief is based on the qualitative component of the evaluation, and is meant to report on and summarize the most salient findings regarding the implementation of the programs in Alameda and San Francisco counties in their second year of operation, as well as to offer a view across the counties and compare certain aspects of their programs. The purpose of this brief is to highlight themes particularly relevant to Year 2 of these CRI programs; it builds on the Year 1 report. Additionally, some demographic data are included to provide the context in which implementation occurred. (Contains 4 tables and 27 endnotes.) [This research was supported by First 5 California.]",

        "description":"As long as students with limited English language skills have attended California schools a debate has raged among educators and policy-makers regarding how best to educate these children. A major focal point of this debate is bilingual education. That is, the viability, advisability, and effectiveness of using students' primary language in instruction. However, everyone agrees that ELs must learn English, learn it well, and meet rigorous standards. No matter what the method or program of instruction, teachers of English language learners need special skills and training to effectively accomplish this task. While this debate continues outside the classroom, inside the classroom teachers are called on to meet the challenge of teaching English learner students every day. Teachers who speak their students' home language and those who do not, teachers with special training and those without, teachers who have years of experience and those who have taught for only weeks are in front of classrooms with EL students. Teachers are both on the front line and responsible  for the bottom line when it comes to providing these students with the skills and knowledge they will need to survive and thrive in U.S. society. Seldom are teachers  invited to share their experiences and their concerns with those who shape education policy. It is critical to ascertain the perspectives of teachers who have so central a role and such a large stake in these issues if instruction for EL students is to significantly improve. This study sets out  to ask teachers about their greatest challenges with regard to educating English learners, to analyze how these challenges vary according to factors such as teacher experience, training, and student need, and to discover the kinds of support they have--and need--for doing their jobs effectively. Appended are: (1) California Commission on Teacher Credentialing Authorizations for Working with English Language Learners; (2) Teacher Ethnicity; (3) OLS Regression Models Predicting Elementary and Secondary Teachers' Self-Rated Ability to Teach ELs; and (4) Percent of Elementary, Secondary and All Teachers Reporting Reasons Why They Found Particular Kinds of In-Service Most Helpful.

        "description":"The new call for a universal preschool system is prompting an important policy debate across California. How preschooling is expanded and improved with limited public resources depends on several key issues. The hopeful ideals of &quot;preschool for all&quot;--with children beginning school ready to learn--spark enthusiasm and broaden public will. But tough policy questions must be addressed by early educators, parents, and policy makers: (1) Should California build and run a &quot;universal system&quot; of preschool, or should public support be targeted on these children who reap the greatest benefits and families who face the highest barriers to access? In other words, who will benefit and who should pay? (2) Who should operate universal preschool--local &quot;schools&quot; or the current &quot;mixed market&quot; of providers, including nonprofit centers and licensed family child-care homes? (3) How can the quality of preschool be improved? Does raising the credential levels of teachers yield discernible gains for children? Would other policy options more cost-effectively boost quality and children's development? (4) How should preschool be structured for diverse families? Does clearer specification of learning standards and the formalization of instruction inside preschools benefit children? Does more regimented instruction imply a single language and with what effects on non-English speaking children? This review considers evidence on these pivotal questions from around the nation, applying these findings to current debates in California. An appendix delineates specific questions that county and state agencies might consider as they attempt to assess the effects of their preschool initiatives.

Much remains unknown, including how preschool programs of varying quality affect diverse groups of children. This is particularly important as several California counties embark on ambitious and costly efforts to widen children's access to preschool, and the state's demographic make-up becomes increasingly heterogeneous. This brief focuses on the following questions: (1) Which families gain access to center-based programs? (2) What levels of developmental progress--in cognitive, social-emotional, and school readiness skills--do California children display as they enter kindergarten? How do these developmental levels vary across social class and ethnic groups? (3) Does exposure to center-based programs help to explain developmental gains in school-readiness skills displayed by children after accounting for the attributes of their parents and home practices? This study examines a representative sample of 2,314 California children who began kindergarten in 1998. Their families reflect the ethnic and social class diversity of California and reside across 327 zip codes. Earlier estimates of center enrollment rates by social-class and ethnic groups have been based on smaller samples or limited census data. (Contains 4 boxes, 2 tables, 6 figures, and 14 endnotes.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to conduct a content analysis of educational psychology textbook vocabulary published during or after 2000. Seven textbooks have been published and are currently in print. Textbook keywords, key concepts, vocabulary words and/or glossaries were analyzed to create a descriptive account of all words defined in the texts.  Initial results found that, in sum, the seven texts introduce and define 1,763 different vocabulary- or key-words. 1,198 (67.9%) of the keywords appear in only one text meaning that almost 70% of the keywords are unique to individual texts. Further, only 30 (1.7%) of the 1,763 words are listed and defined in all seven texts; 199 (11.2%) are used in 4, 5, 6, or 7 texts; whereas, 1,564 (88.8%) are listed and defined in three or fewer texts. One implication is that 88.8% of the keywords introduced have less than a 50% consistent- use agreement from the current published texts (i.e., only 3, or less, of the 7 authors define the word).

Studies in this paradigm have typically compared minimalist materials against traditional \"system-centred\" materials. Additionally, some studies have investigated the effects of specific minimalist design heuristics. However, small samples in many original studies have meant effect size estimates are imprecise. Meta-analytic methods were applied to 13 experimental effect sizes comparing the minimalist and system-centred approaches, and 6 effects investigating the effects of specific minimalist heuristics (\"support error recognition and recovery\" and \"slash the verbiage\"). The overall mean effect on learning in favour of the minimalist approach was large (d = 1.12), broadly supporting the minimalist approach compared to system-centred designs. The mean effect for tests of the \"support error recognition and recovery\" principle was moderate (d = 0.59), and the mean effect for tests of the \"slash the verbiage\" principle was large (d = 0.89). These results indicate the application of minimalist design principles to self-study manuals for learning to use computer programmes is associated with more effective learning. By applying these principles, designers of such manuals can assist learners, as well as gaining a competitive edge. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Second Language (L2) and Foreign Language (FL) curricula have a cultural component intricately woven into the fabric of the language syllabus. To teach language, one must also teach the culture inherent in the language, including the verbal as well as the non-verbal aspects. A review of the literature will show that studying the target culture does not only impact language learners while the language is being acquired, but also has an impact on students after the language lessons have ceased. A careful analysis will demonstrate that teaching the target culture to language students will foster in these students what Savignon and Sysoyev (2002) term \"sociocultural competence\" or what Sellami (2000)calls \"intercultural competence\". In our dynamic, multicultural world, the ability of L2 or FL students to empathize, tolerate, and appreciate the cultures of other peoples is ideal. This ability or competence will be shown to extend beyond the four classroom walls after the acquisition of language has been accomplished. The role of the teacher in developing this new competence will be established. Strategies that teachers may use to better incorporate culture in their language teaching will be presented.",

        "description":"Community colleges, which tend to be more accessible and affordable than other postsecondary institutions, are a critical resource for low-income people striving to improve their prospects in the labor market and in life. Yet nearly half of students who begin at community colleges leave school before receiving a credential. Research by MDRC and others suggests that many community college students want to earn a degree but are overwhelmed by the competing demands of work, family, and school. Institutional barriers, such as poorly tailored instruction, insufficient financial aid, or inadequate advising, may also impede their academic progress. In 2003, MDRC launched the Opening Doors demonstration project to study the effects of innovative programs designed to help students stay in school and succeed. Six colleges in four states are taking part in the demonstration. This report presents early findings from Louisiana Opening Doors, an enhanced financial aid program targeting low-income parents at two community colleges in the New Orleans area: Delgado Community College and Louisiana Technical College-West Jefferson. This program was designed to help students with their expenses and provide an incentive to make good academic progress. Students randomly assigned to Opening Doors were offered a $1,000 scholarship for each of two semesters, in addition to the regular financial aid they qualified for, if they enrolled at least half time and earned at least a C average. They also received enhanced counseling. Students in a control group received only regular financial aid and the counseling available to all students. The early findings in Louisiana are compelling and suggest that a performance-based scholarship can indeed have a positive effect on persistence and academic achievement among a student population that faces multiple barriers to completing college. The students in Opening Doors were more likely to enroll in college full time, passed more courses, earned more course credits, and had higher rates of persistence.

There are many connotations of learning disabilities thus even today it creates confusion in the mind of the general public and the professionals. Learning disability is a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or using spoken or written language. These may be manifested in disorders of listening, thinking, talking, reading, writing, spelling or arithmetic. They include conditions which have been referred to as perceptual handicap, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, developmental aphasia, etc... they do not include learning problems which are due to primarily to visual, hearing, motor handicaps or mental retardation, emotional disturbances or to environmental disadvantage. The research study was based on finding the awareness level about the following: (1) Concept of learning disabilities; (2) Dyslexia; (3) Dysgraphia; and (4) Dyscalculia. The study was conducted in the following boards: SSC, CBSE, and ICSE. Objectives of the study: (1) To study the awareness among teachers of learning disabilities in students of different board levels; (2) To study the awareness among teachers of learning disabilities in students at primary level and secondary level of different board levels. Findings of the study: The study has revealed that there is a significant difference in the awareness level of learning disabilities in student's among teachers of different boards. Amongst the boards ICSE board teachers are more aware about learning disabilities as compared to the CBSE and SSC board. This was seen by a significant difference in their mean scores.",

        "author":["Arafeh, Sousan"],
        "description":"One salient factor of increasing interest in distance education is advancement in information and communications technologies (ICTs). In particular, digital and networked technologies have had a wide range of effects on the educational materials, practices, and institutions involved in education, notably by improving time-and cost-efficient delivery. Although correspondence, telephone, television, and teleconferencing have all been effective delivery methods for distance education, the Internet has been a particularly important development in making it possible for teachers and students to access a wealth of information and each other quickly, easily, and interactively in both face-to-face and remote education settings. Thus, it is crucial that interested stakeholders continue to track new technological, educational, and cultural developments in order to actively plan for their integrated use and management in distance education now and in the future. Such tracking requires that we keep our minds open and that we do not assume that the ICTs and distance education technologies of today are the ones that will sustain us in the future. As this report will argue, the future will be an increasingly complex space in which success will consist of embodying and addressing such complexity gracefully. As of now, we are still not sure what kinds of technical, conceptual, institutional, and organizational configurations will be needed as we move into the next generation. However, by exploring the implications of ICTs for distance education with an open mind, we can begin to learn. The purpose of this report is to identify and review current literature to explore the implications of information, communications, and computer technologies (ICCTs) for distance education. The review is not intended to be exhaustive but, rather, a point of departure for discussion. The information and implications outlined within are intended for all readers with interest in the topic including, but not limited to, researchers, analysts, and the public.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of environmental conditions of adult literacy and demographics prevalent during infancy and early childhood on mathematics and language arts literacy scores on eighth grade achievement tests. This study collected published scores for eighth grade math and language literacy from public schools in Arkansas using the 2003 administration of the Arkansas Comprehensive Testing, Assessment, and Accountability Program (ACTAAP) and the adult literacy estimates for Arkansas counties as determined by the National Institute for Literacy (NIFL) using indicators of population size, employment, education level, and race from the 1990 US Census. Data collected from NIFL reports, school enrollments, and grand means of scaled literacy and math scores were entered by county in SPSS (v. 12.0) software for analysis. Bivariate correlations were used to determine relationships between ACTAAP scores, adult literacy and demographic variables. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine relative influence of adult literacy, unemployment, dropout rates, and ethnicity on ACTAAP scores. Unemployment and underemployment among adults in 1990 were linked to low levels of education; dropout rates and unemployment were linked to racial minority status, reinforcing findings of the National Adult Literacy Study. Eighth grade test scores showed strong correlations to adult literacy especially at the lowest levels and moderate correlations to unemployment and dropout rates. The correlation between 2003 eighth grade scores and adult ethnicity in 1990 was stronger than for any other demographic or literacy variables, accounting for 57% of the influence on math scores and 42% of the influence on literacy scores. Early childhood experiences, as evidenced by the impact of conditions in 1990 have a significant impact on today's student achievement and programs should be developed to address literacy from a family or community perspective.

        "description":"This paper describes a theoretical framework for the investigation of some specific types of visual learning difficulties commonly experienced by biology undergraduates. The framework was developed based on the findings of three simple qualitative pilot studies. A variety of neurological, cognitive and cultural mechanisms can influence what humans visually perceive, however, when an observer's perception of what they see changes, some interesting mental processes must occur. The author suggests that these mental processes are in some respects similar to Posner et al's (1982) theory of conceptual change. The author further suggests that special inherent properties of biological material (such as its structural complexity and hierarchical organization) are confounding factors that make visual interpretation especially problematic within this discipline. The author will offer some speculative suggestions for new research that might eventually connect this model with studies of conceptual change and visual cognition in a variety of other fields.",

        "author":["Watt, Michael G."],
        "description":"The purpose of this study was to review national and state level initiatives in curriculum reform to identify whether the move towards greater national consistency in curriculum outcomes confirms the dominance of outcomes-based education or reflects a shift from outcomes-based to standards-based education. Policy documents were examined, and the content of curriculum documents developed at both the national and state levels in Australia was analysed to identify whether the philosophical and theoretical bases of curriculum reforms derived from outcomes-based or standards-based education. The results indicated that the principles underpinning the national statements and profiles, which were published in 1994, derived initially from the national curriculum being developed at that time for England and Wales, although outcomes-based education increased in its influence. However, outcomes-based education became the predominant educational philosophy underpinning the curriculum frameworks and syllabuses developed by the states and territories from the national statements and profiles. The development of the statements of learning, commenced in 2003, represented an attempt to circumscribe the increasing diversity among state and territory curriculums, but also gave greater acknowledgement and recognition to the principles of standards-based education. The results showed that whilst curriculum developers are giving greater attention to setting clear and measurable outcomes in curriculum documents, the lack of a strong tradition of independent evaluation of these documents makes it difficult to judge their quality. As well as recommending the need for independent evaluations of curriculum documents, policymakers and curriculum developers need to consider alternative approaches to curriculum planning to ameliorate divisive debates.

Overcrowded teacher education programs in traditional universities cannot guarantee the availability of necessary classes, however, and students desiring a teaching credential anticipate an extended time frame for credential completion and entrance into the classroom. There is growing interest in the benefits of accelerated programs to meet this critical need. Accelerated courses are taught sequentially (one at a time) rather than in traditional parallel fashion in which several classes are taken at once. Researchers contend  that such a sequential model seems to reduce the number of distractions in students' lives so that they can give more focused attention to one subject. While compression of classes is thought by some to lead to weaker learning outcomes and that the crammed curriculum does not allow adequate time for reflection, researchers have found that outcomes from compressed courses equal (and sometimes surpass) outcomes from traditional course formats (Scott &amp; Conrad, 1992). National University trains more teachers than any other university in California and employs such an accelerated format--a learning model that has been highly successful in training future teachers for California classrooms.",

        "description":"Over the past decade, a number of scholars have publicly criticized large research universities for failing to provide undergraduate students with the skills and abilities needed to succeed both in life and in the workforce. At the heart of this criticism is the concern that research institutions have de-emphasized teaching by increasing the size of undergraduate classes, expanding the role of teaching assistants, and structuring the faculty promotion process so that it provides greater rewards to those who conduct exceptional research at the expense of student learning (Boyer, 1990; Boyer Commission, 1998). Concerned, a number of institutions have examined their curriculum, looking for ways to improve the quality of the undergraduate experience. One strategy, taken at UCLA, is to use our strength as a research institution as the foundation of curricular reform; for example, by bringing research experience into science general education (Kerfeld, Levis, & Perry, 2001). We have developed a program (www.lsic.ucla.edu/ugri) in which large numbers of students (nearly 2,000 annually) participate in a research project in the context of their undergraduate coursework. The Undergraduate Genomics Research Initiative (UGRI), uses a common research goal, the sequencing of a microbial genome, to link several upper and lower division life sciences courses and science general education courses. In order to facilitate this multi-course collaboration, it was necessary to invent a new course based entirely on undergraduate research to serve as the hub of the UGRI.

        "description":"In this study I address the problem of the implementation and the foreseeable success of the July 2004 document from the Education and Manpower Bureau of Hong Kong, &quot;Empowering Learning and Teaching with Information Technology&quot; (EMB 2004). The statements in this policy will be compared to Sweden's ICT policy and a report completed by Peter Kearns for the Australian Government. All of the fore mentioned policies will be compared to the 3 phases of ICT development mentioned in Kearns report, &quot;Towards the Connected Learning Society: An International Overview of Trends in Policy for Information and Communication Technology in Education&quot; (2002). The policies will also be examined and compared to different criteria also observed in Kearns (2002) article where he discusses the criteria for leading practice in policy for ICT in education. This report then goes on to analyze the Hong Kong policies and their implications. This paper argues that the new Hong Kong policy statement, however ambitious, will have many difficulties reaching certain goals. Appendix A contains Figures.

        "author":["Akar, Hanife"],
        "description":"Foreign Language Teacher Training Colleges (TTC) were established in Poland as a need for drastic changes in education, and a need to introduce western languages at all levels of schooling in 1992 arose. By the year 2001 TTC managed to graduate the number of teachers the market demanded, yet the quality of education provided emerged as a need to be examined. The purpose of this paper is to present an in depth understanding of the impact of TTC on teacher candidates' development and learning, and the challenges that TTC face. A mixture of qualitative and quantitative research was done to collect data. Data reveals that teacher candidates mainly applied to TTC to learn a foreign language and use it as a springboard to obtain better-paying jobs. Although the teacher candidates have a positive perception with regard to their teaching skills, building true college-school partnerships emerges as a need for the development and learning of teacher candidates. Two dimensions are essential for the training of teacher candidates: educational policy concerns about foreign language teacher training as an undergraduate program, and economic and social concerns of teacher candidates as prospective professionals.",

        "description":"This small scale quantitative study looks into the relationship between shyness and internet addiction in middle school students. This study has been conducted on the belief that shyness is a possible predictor of Internet Addiction. To prove this hypothesis a questionnaire was created and distributed to 53 middle school students and 159 post secondary students. The results showed a relationship between shyness and Internet Addiction in middle school but not in post secondary students. It was found that time was the predictor for Internet Addiction with post secondary students. In summary, this study addresses the problem of Internet Addiction and the possibility of shyness as being one of its forecasters by using Young's (2002) Internet Addiction Scale and the Cheek and Buss (1981) Shyness Scale. A Pearson's Correlation was performed to determine if there is a relationship between the two. (Contains 7 tables.)",

        "author":["Winstead, Lisa"],
        "description":"This paper addresses an important topic--the isolation and or lack of inclusion of immigrant children in U.S. schools. Immigrant children constantly pour into U.S. schools and, especially as newcomers, their opportunities for authentic interaction with mainstream peers are limited. How can schools provide authentic language opportunities for linguistically different peers? What else can schools do to tap immigrant students as resources for language learning and cross-cultural education? It details the study of language practice between adolescent Spanish Learners and English Learners who participated in an alternative dual language program at a middle school. Three dyads of English Learners and Spanish Learners met once a week for two months to practice language. The participants practiced in Spanish for thirty minutes and then English for thirty minutes and rotated the languages weekly. Journal entries, interviews, audio- and videotapes of peer interaction were triangulated to explore emerging themes. The study revealed how the participants went through various stages of Language Apprehension, Language Initiation, and Language Acquisition during peer interaction as they built their confidence and language skills. Additionally, students preferred to play games than attempt conversations, conversations unfolded around personal, familial and social topics, dyads in proximity to one another influenced the activities they chose to do, regrouping of dyads caused disruptions, and students used a variety of strategies to negotiate meaning. Most importantly, the alternative dual language program empowered students as they became guides and teachers, exchanging ideas through language as well as developing friendships and pride in their native languages. Educators need to take a serious look at the alternative dual language model (ADLM) and how it may provide a venue for promoting not only language and cultural sharing but inclusion.

Specifically, he addresses: (1) sustainable business models--and intellectual property rights; (2) collaborations--more and more important all over the world; (3) new organizational models; and (4) the view from 36,000 feet. Dr. Bowen concludes his paper by encouraging the research library community to \"re-think the possibility for stronger collaborative actions--seeking ways to work together effectively, respecting legal concerns but not being terrified by overly conservative interpretations of what degree of collective action is permitted.\" ARL is publishing Dr. Bowen's remarks to encourage discussion of his ideas among all who, like ARL, advocate for the development of effective, extensible, sustainable, and economically viable models of scholarly communication that provide barrier-free access to quality information in support of teaching, learning, research, and service to the community.",

        "description":"Family, friend and neighbor care has frequently been characterized in the media, and even in the early care and education field, as &quot;substandard, unregulated care,&quot; a &quot;fall-back&quot; position when parents can not find or afford a regulated setting. However, up until quite recently, there was virtually no research to support any claims about this type of care. Family, friend and neighbor care (also known as kith and kin care, license exempt care, and informal care) became a &quot;hot&quot; topic in the child care field with the passage of the 1996 welfare reform act. In many localities, a large portion of public child care subsidy money was expended on these arrangements, but little was known about the caregivers or the kind of care they provided. This led to research efforts, program development, and new policies. This volume represents all three aspects of the work: research, programs, and policy. Essays in this volume include: (1) Family, Friend and Neighbor Care: Crib Notes on a Complex Issue (Toni Porter and Shannon Kearns); (2) Ways of Caring: How Relative Caregivers Support Children and Parents  (Juliet Bromer); (3) The Arizona Kith and Kin Project (Sarah Ocampo-Schlesinger and Vicki McCarty); (4) Licensing Family, Friend and Neighbor Caregivers: Paradoxes and Possibilities (Pamela Jakwerth Drake, Bayla Greenspoon, and Sarah Neville-Morgan); (5) Grandmothers as Child Caregivers: A Unique Child Care Arrangement (Kathy I. Reschke and Susan K.

        "description":"Teacher shortages, like the one schools face today, are not new. Periodically over the last 50 years there were fewer teachers available than were needed, and the response was primarily to step up recruitment efforts and issue temporary teaching credentials to those without qualifications. Three things are new however: (1) The requirement that teachers in all schools be &quot;highly qualified&quot; (P.L. 107-110, 2002); (2) the realization that it may not be teacher recruitment that is the problem in staffing the nation's schools, but teacher retention (Ingersoll, 2003); and (3) growing evidence that, like every other problem that plagues the nation's schools, the problem of teacher retention is most severe in high poverty and other hard-to-staff schools (Darling-Hammond, 2004; Darling-Hammond &amp; Sclan, 1996). In this lecture transcript, the author discusses the problem of teacher retention, then turns to focus upon the characteristics of the new generation of teachers and how this new generation is and is not like the previous generations. The author then examines why people stay in teaching, and explores what she thinks it will take to retain teachers over the long haul in today's labor market, and in the face of the extraordinarily complex and multiple demands today's teachers face. In presenting these ideas, she employs a variety of tools: (1) Recent research; (2) Classroom vignettes; and (3) Examples from grade levels, schools and subject areas in urban rural, and suburban schools. To illustrate points, the author uses statistics as well as individual teachers' writing and research, excerpts from interviews, and group discussions. She also draws on her own experiences as a teacher educator, working in urban areas, and as a part of urban teacher education programs for nearly 30 years. She uses this and a mixture of illustrative and supporting material because she believes teachers can and need to learn about other teachers and teaching from many different sources that cross contexts, time periods, research paradigms, and ways of knowing.",

In these essays, teachers find courage, resourcefulness, insight, and inspiration. They are reminded not to give up on themselves. Three vital aspects explored in these essays include: (1) teaching is about being present to what or who is before oneself--This requires the development of curiosity, an interest in the students' experience; (2) teaching is about bringing one's whole self--one's heart, mind, and  ethics--to the classroom--Teaching happens both through who one is and what one does; and (3) teaching is about generosity--Teachers demonstrate this in their willingness to share whatever they have learned from their own journeys, to tell their stories as a way of keeping everyone else afloat. Following an introduction by Judith Leipzig, essays in this \"Occasional Paper\" include: (1) When September Comes Again (Elizabeth Huffman); (2) Starting Over Again: Comparing the First and Second Years of Teaching (Scott Moran); (3) Wrong Place, Right Time (Rachel Mazor); (4) Learning to Keep My Heart Open (Marika Paez); and (5) Normalizing the Need for Help (Nancy Gropper).",

Successful educators know that the ability to welcome the stranger into the classroom, indeed an entire group of strangers each September, is essential to building a productive, caring community of learners. They know, too, that, from the point of view of students new to the school or society, the culture of the classroom may feel very strange. Welcoming teachers are willing to step outside of their own cultural frames to see the school from the student's perspective. Common purposes and goals emerge in classrooms only when there is a genuine sharing of the things that really matter to everyone present, not just when the rules and routines are posted. In classrooms where students can tell their stories, they come to feel safe, to know that they will be heard, and to recognize that they can legitimately hold on to parts of the past even as they move into the future. Students also learn that difficult emotions--uncertainty, ambiguity, loss--can be managed, contained, and shared rather than ignored or silenced. Beyond the school itself, greeting the stranger is at the heart of the democratic experience. Following an introduction by Jonathan G. Silin, the following essays are included in this &quot;Occasional Paper&quot;: (1) Building Bridges between Adult Education, Public Schools, and Health Care: A Strategy to Promote Social Inclusion (Jana Sladkova, Anahi Viladrich, and Nicholas Freudenberg); (2) Crossing Borders / Shaping Tales   (Erika Duncan); and (3) Attending to &quot;Hu'Huk&quot;: Lessons for a Teacher (Elizabeth Park).

        "description":"University professors teaching pre-service teachers base much of their philosophies on theories. Students often ask \"Why do we have theories?\" \"What is the purpose of theories?\" \"If we like a theory, do we have to use all of the theory?\" The most frequent controversial issue is how to use a particular theory in a practical way. In the quest for these answers, students begin to realize that there are no completely right theories. This realization is the exciting part about studying and analyzing theories. Students learn that a \"theory\" is an orderly, integrated set of statements that describes and predicts behavior. Theories are influenced directly by cultural values and belief systems of their times. Theories are vital: They guide and give meaning to what we see. When a researcher investigates and collects information through observation, the investigator needs a clear idea of what information is important to collect. Thus, valid theories are validated by research and are a sound basis for practical action. In this article, common theories are analyzed including theorists, John Locke, Jean-Jacque Rousseau, Piaget, and Vygotsky. The article concludes with several important points for discussion: (1) Many theories are extreme in nature; (2) Educators use a combination of theories in their classrooms; (3) Theories get issues and concerns on the table for discussion; (4) Theories serve an important purpose; and (5) Research, resulting in theories, should not govern everything we do in life; there is a time that common sense and gut instinct should override theories.

The subjects were parents and preschool children ages 3-5 that attended a private early childhood center in Irvington, New Jersey. Each family was given one home visit and a library visit. The literacy practices of the families were observed and recorded during each visit. The homes had many literacy practices and materials to support the practices. Parents taught their children alphabet knowledge and as a result the children recognized, wrote and stated the sound of many letters. The patterns of interaction, when the parent read to the child and when the child read to the parent, were high.

        "author":["Lee, Jaekyung"],
        "description":"This study offers systematic trend analyses of NAEP national and state-level public school fourth and eighth graders' reading and math achievement results during pre-NCLB (1990-2001) and post-NCLB (2002-2005) periods. It compares post-NCLB trends in reading and math achievement with pre-NCLB trends among different racial and socioeconomic groups of fourth and eighth graders from across the nation and states. National and state progress toward closing racial and socioeconomic achievement gaps are evaluated not only in terms of their success in reducing the test score gaps but also in terms of reducing each subgroup's chance of failing to meet desired performance standards. Further, it provides new evidence on the impact of state accountability policy on the achievement gap trends and the discrepancies between NAEP and state assessment results. Key findings include: (1) NCLB did not have a significant impact on improving reading and math achievement across the nation and states. Based on the NAEP results, the national average achievement remains flat in reading and grows at the same pace in math after NCLB than before. (2) NCLB has not helped the nation and states significantly narrow the achievement gap. The racial and socioeconomic achievement gap in the NAEP reading and math achievement persists after NCLB. (3)  NCLB's attempt to scale up the alleged success of states that adopted test-driven  accountability policy prior to NCLB, so-called first generation accountability states (e.g., Florida, North Carolina, Texas) did not work. (4) NCLB's reliance on state assessment as the basis of school accountability is misleading since state-administered tests tend to significantly inflate proficiency levels and proficiency gains as well as deflate racial and social achievement gaps in the states. Appended are: (1) Data and Statistical Methods; (2) Measures of State Accountability and the Discrepancies between NAEP and State Assessment in Reading and Math Proficiency; (3) Supporting Tables.

        "author":["Edwards, Brian"],
        "description":"When the concept of charter schools was first implemented in California in 1993, the goal was to allow the modification of existing public schools or the creation of wholly new ones that would be less rule-bound than traditional public schools but more accountable for student achievement. For some charter advocates, simply providing such alternatives that satisfy parents and students is enough to justify having charter schools. The large majority of supporters, however, see other potential benefits for education quality in general. Schools will compete for students and the funding that goes with them, the thinking goes, thereby motivating schools to improve and tailor their programs to meet students' needs just as competition in the marketplace can spur innovation, efficiency, and better service among private firms. Charter schools that cannot compete will close like unsuccessful business ventures do, they say. Or those that do not abide by the terms of their charter will have it revoked by their chartering agency. In contrast, they say, charters that succeed can serve as models for other public schools--charters and noncharters. This report not only compares charters to noncharters, but also breaks charters down into types to unmask variations within the overall pattern. (Contains 14 figures.)

The first question is: \"What are the guidelines and behaviors that define a Constructivist classroom?\" There have not been a great number of pedagogical tools that discuss and summarize concrete, observable Constructivist behaviors. The second question is: \"Is there a unique form of Benedictine pedagogy?\" Using curricular theorizing as a methodology, this dissertation analyzes the intersect of Constructivism and Benedictine values. It also attempts to define the Constructivist framework and provide examples of behaviors that describe Constructivist teaching. It then examines Benedictine values through the lens of Constructivist teaching behaviors. While aspects of Benedictine monasticism, as reflected in the Rule of St. Benedict, can be described as Constructivist, the blending of specific Benedictine values results in a framework representing a unique Benedictine pedagogy.

Known otherwise as reflection in action, such teachers are referred to as reflective practitioners (after Schon) and are deemed to be more effective in carrying out their professional responsibilities.

        "description":"Research has suggested that transfer students experience difficulty in many domains however limited research has examined the variables associated with transfer student success. The present study examined transfer student success using a sample of 163 first-year transfer students at a large mid-Atlantic university. The mean age of the participants was 20 years, ranging in age from 18 to 33 years old. More than half of the participants were women, approximately half of the participants identified as White, one fifth of the participants identified as African American, one fifth as Asian, approximately 4% as Hispanic, and the rest as International or Other. Half of the participants indicated they transferred from a two-year institution and half indicated they transferred from a four-year institution. Independent variables examined were academic self-efficacy, career self-efficacy, and sense of belonging/social integration. Transfer student success was assessed through academic performance, psychological functioning, and career functioning. All variables except academic performance were assessed using survey data. Academic performance variables were assessed from student records. Using canonical correlation, two patterns of associations were found to explain transfer student functioning in a new institution. The two canonical variates suggested that patterns of transfer student experiences could be categorized in career development terms. The achievement pattern differed from moratorium in that the pattern of experiences was associated with feeling connected to faculty and valuing their friendships in college. On the other hand, the moratorium pattern differed from the achievement pattern in that peer and faculty interactions were not as important and the pattern of experiences suggested need for information about career options and themselves. Moreover, the pattern related to moratorium showed no association with confidence in career decision-making tasks. This study is one of the first to examine the transfer student experience in-depth independent of native students. While this study begins to address the complex story of success in transfer students, additional research is still needed. Replication should occur at colleges and universities of different sizes and in different locations. These findings, if replicated, suggest that counselors should provide differing interventions with transfer students to influence different pattern of experiences.

        "author":["Zhang, Lawrence Jun"],
        "description":"This paper reports on two phases of a study of a group of advanced TEFL (teachers-of-English-as-a-foreign-language) students. To raise their awareness of the importance of discourse intonation while they were receiving teacher training, this study focuses on examining their sociocultural and psychological inclinations in the choice of phonological models. The first phase is an exploration of their attitudes toward or voices about a native-speaker variety (British English) and a nonnative (Chinese EFL-speaker) variety of English pronunciation and intonation. The second reports on a didactic intervention study of the impact of activities that engaged the students in the awareness-raising of the importance of suprasegmental features, especially discourse intonation, on self-perceptions of their efficacy and confidence in communication. The results showed a systematic pattern of participant endorsement for a native-speaker model and a clear improvement in their perceptions of the importance of suprasegmental features of standard English because of teacher-student co-construction of meaning through interactive awareness-raising activities. The findings are discussed with reference to the students' sociocultural and psychological needs in TEFL training, particularly with reference to recent academic discourse on the issue of \"linguistic imperialism\" (Canagarajah, 1999; Phillipson, 1992, 1996) and EIL [English as an international language] in pedagogy (Jenkins, 1998, 2002) and their wider implications in typical EFL contexts. Appended are: (1) Sentences Used in Awareness-Raising Activities; (2) Participant Judgments of the Models/Varieties of English Produced by Native and Nonnative Speakers; (3) Participant Perceptions of Various Factors Relating to Native and Nonnative Models/Varieties of English Prior to the Awareness-Raising Activities; and (4) Participant Feedback After Awareness-Raising.

        "description":"To gain some insight into test preparation, some testing experts were asked to share their thoughts from their own parenting experiences. A crucial performance factor for a substantial number of students is test anxiety. According to University of Southern California Professor Harold O'Neil, Jr., &quot;The relationship between high anxiety and poor performance is particularly strong for high stakes exams.&quot; These include the SAT, advanced placement exams, and the Graduate Record Exam. O'Neil estimates that between 10-20% of children and adults have high anxiety that contributes to lower performance. One of his current research projects is to develop an Internet--based program to help reduce student test anxiety. It is also interesting to consider that, just as in any dramatic or sports performance, a certain level of anxiety or tension helps a person achieve peak performance, but too high a level does not. Suggestions are offered to parents who want to help their children make good academic progress in the classroom &quot;and&quot; perform well on tests, especially in a high-stakes environment.

These issues are a major focus of both the testing experts who develop standardized tests and the researchers who endeavor to ensure a test's fairness, reliability, validity, and accuracy. But many issues remain both controversial and complex. The National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences issued a report in 1999 from its Board on Testing and Assessment. The report found that educational tests generally do provide dependable and valuable information about student achievement, but that they are definitely not perfect. The researchers pointed out &quot;... a test score is not an exact measure of a student's knowledge or skills...no single test score can be considered a definitive measure of a student's knowledge.&quot; The report added that large-scale tests often use different versions of the test form to prevent cheating and that an individual's score can be expected to vary somewhat across different forms of a test--even though test developers try to keep the forms at about the same level of difficulty. Scores can also vary due to &quot;transitory factors,&quot; such as the student's health on the day of the test, test anxiety, and other testing conditions. (Contains a list of 5 resources.)

        "description":"How early is too early? As testing has grown more widespread in recent decades, important issues have arisen concerning how to ensure that early childhood testing is used appropriately and with positive educational benefits. Actually, this kind of testing has been happening for a long time. Testing young children became a frequent practice when educational testing first became popular in the early 1900s. By the late 1980s, 19 states required mandatory kindergarten screening tests. However, while noting the usefulness of some types of early childhood testing, researchers have also pointed out that tests tend to be less reliable at very early ages. The cautions of testing researchers, combined with their own experiences, have resulted in most states delaying the testing of children in public schools until the 3rd grade. The 2001 &quot;No Child Left Behind Act&quot; requires state testing in mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, starting in third grade. Nonetheless, a number of private schools, including Catholic schools, do require entering kindergartners to pass a test as part of their admission requirements. Some public elementary schools also continue to test very young children and use the results for key decisions, such as entry into a gifted public school. (Contains a list of 6 resources.)

        "description":"A variety of testing methods can be extremely useful in finding out whether children who are experiencing learning difficulties may have one or more learning disabilities. This is an important and valuable role for testing. Another important issue concerns how best to ensure fairness for a learning disabled student when he or she must take a large-scale standardized test. Not all learning difficulties are learning disabilities. Children develop at different rates, and sometimes what seems to be a learning disability may resolve as the child matures. Importantly, children who are English language learners are sometimes misidentified as having a learning disability, as are children from impoverished backgrounds or with severe problems at home that impact their preparation for school or their behavior. This is a complex and changing field and each child needs to be recognized as a unique, creative individual. This summary focuses on tests that are used to help diagnose learning disabilities and on special accommodations for students with such disabilities as they face large-scale state and other testing.

        "description":"There have always been tests, but there have never before been so many! It is natural for parents and concerned citizens to wonder what is motivating this increase and to examine the many reasons why. Ever since there have been schools, teachers have used tests of various kinds to find out how well students are learning and if their instruction has been successful or not. But the reasons for testing do not stop there. Policymakers have passed federal and state legislation using tests to measure school performance and spur improved achievement. Tests are used to rank schools, place students at various levels, and decide who will graduate from high school. In schools where test scores fail to improve substantially, parents may transfer their child to a higher performing school. In some cases, federal law allows students to use their share of Title I funding for tutoring services. Such uses of test scores go far beyond finding out how well a child can read, write, or solve word problems. The shorthand answer to &quot;Why test students?&quot; is because tests serve an expanding number of significant educational purposes, bolstered by some financial and political considerations.

        "description":"The goal of &quot;closing the achievement gap&quot; in education is often proclaimed and is emphasized in the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act.&quot; What is meant by the achievement gap and how much progress has been made? A large body of literature examines the causes, conditions, and explanations for the achievement gap. Many educational organizations have focused on strategies to reduce the gap and encouraged the nation to learn from schools and districts that are succeeding. Researchers have worked to improve standardized tests and to lessen social and cultural bias, yet some commentators insist that many tests do not adequately measure the capabilities of all students, such as those for whom English is a second language. Research shows that strong parent involvement in high quality school and family partnerships can lead to substantial student achievement gains, regardless of family social and economic background. Research also shows that all students at a school benefit from parent involvement, not only those students whose parents volunteer at the school. Studies have found that parent participation appears pivotal: it is positively related to both parent satisfaction and student achievement. Substantial evidence exists to show that children whose parents are involved in their schooling have significantly increased academic achievement and cognitive development. In their review of existing research, the San Diego County Office of Education concluded that the most accurate predictor of a student's achievement in school is not income or social status, but the extent to which that student's family is able to: (1) Create a home environment that encourages learning; (2) Express high (but not unrealistic) expectations for their children's achievement and future careers; and (3) Become involved in their children's education at school and in the community.

        "description":"Teaching matters. Study after study confirms that students who have high quality teachers make significant and lasting achievement gains. Those with less effective teachers play a constant game of academic catch-up. Having high quality teachers consistently tops parents' list of critical elements of an effective school. As the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future stated, &quot;What teachers know and can do makes the crucial difference in what students learn.&quot; But what is a &quot;good&quot; teacher? And how is effective teaching measured? The real question is, &quot;What do teachers contribute to student learning and how do we know?&quot; In other words, is there a way to use student test scores to determine how much of student learning can be attributed to a particular teacher? In fact, there is a method that has been proposed. Pioneered in Tennessee, it is called &quot;value-added.&quot; It is called this because it is meant to be a measure of the value teachers add to students' learning. Using this method requires some complicated analysis of statistics, but the end result is considered to be useful information--based on test scores--about teachers' contribution to student learning. Also in this system, each student is compared to his or her own performance the previous year, so other issues (such as family income) are not involved in the analysis. Tennessee's results from this system are noteworthy. (Contains a list of 7 resources.) [This article was produced by the Center for Assessment and Evaluation of Student Learning (CAESL) at WestEd.]",

        "description":"It is challenging for parents and the general public to make sense of the reports on test scores that appear in the mass media. This article offers some things for readers to consider as they bring a critical eye to what is read in the papers. Usually reports on test scores in the media are quite short and focus on one or two aspects of test results. Often, they draw oversimplified conclusions--expressing surprise that students are making gains or (perhaps seen as more newsworthy) registering shock at low scores. Sometimes reports on test scores are sensationalized and exaggerated--especially when they claim to show how poorly students or schools are doing or how &quot;behind&quot; students in the United States are compared to other countries. These claims may or may not be true, but based on the limited information in many news reports, there is often not enough evidence presented to confirm the conclusions. A critical reader is almost always left with important unanswered questions. In the case of test scores, there is frequently a lack of basic information about the kind of test, its development and history, its reliability, fairness, accuracy, and validity. As with all learning, the first steps in achieving a higher level of understanding about assessment start with questions. What was the test designed to measure? What purpose(s) are the test results designed to serve? Was the test based on state standards? Such questions can help parents place their child's results in perspective.

        "author":["Lips, Dan"],
        "description":"In 2006, President Bush proposed the America's Opportunity Scholarships for Kids initiative in his budget request for the Department of Education. The plan would make $100 million available in competitive grant awards to provide scholarships to low income students in persistently failing public schools. Only low-income students attending public schools that are in the &quot;restructuring&quot; phase of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) would be eligible to participate.  Restructuring occurs when schools fail to meet adequate yearly progress (AYP) for six consecutive years. The America's Opportunity Scholarships for Kids initiative would provide better opportunities to an estimated 23,000 students and demonstrate the positive benefits of student-centered education reform. Millions of American children are not receiving a  quality education in their current public schools. If roughly 30 percent of the nation's 8th graders in public schools are scoring &quot;below basic&quot; in math and reading, the current public school system is leaving behind approximately 14 million students. Many of these students could benefit from the opportunity to attend schools of their parents' choice. The report asserts Congress should provide families with greater ability to choose their children's schools. The Bush Administration's America's Opportunity Scholarships for Kids initiative would provide real school choice to American parents. In addition to helping these children, the Opportunity Scholarship initiative would provide a model for how federal, state, and local policymakers can provide better educational opportunities for America's disadvantaged students through student-centered reforms. Sections in the report include: (1) The Need for Opportunity Scholarships; (2) The America's Opportunity Scholarships for Kids Initiative; (3) Millions of Children Trapped in Underperforming Public Schools; (4) Examples of School Districts That Could Benefit; (5) Strong Demand for School Choice among Low-Income Families; and (6) The Benefits for Students.

Regionalism is defined as a belief that one's region of origin is a primary determinant of the quality of one's standards of living, social forms, customary beliefs, levels of sophistication, intellect and aesthetic development and that regional differences produce an inherent superiority of persons from particular regions. In this investigation the origin of dialect and region-related stereotypes, the power of languages bias, strategies for coping in a region-biased culture, the tenacity of stereotypes and the inclination to stereotype are examined. Interns assess their own involvement in stereotype reinforcement and explore strategies for effective, appropriate response to region and dialect-related bias in the classroom. Interns also prepare to create region-related-bias free learning environments.

Volume 1, Unleashing the Power of the Community College, serves as the executive summary and includes key lessons learned from case studies of 30 colleges serving 10 labor market areas. The authors conclude the responsive colleges tend to share fundamental Characteristics: \"leadership committed to the goal of making the college responsive; internal response mechanisms that influence campus organizational structure and culture; conscious and deliberate efforts to nurture business and other partnerships; and thoughtful and strategic approaches to building stronger connections to the local economy.\" Volume 2, Promising Practices, and Lessons from the Field, is made up of modules exploring different facets of the college that contribute to market responsiveness: (1) leadership and governance; (2) organizational structure and staffing; (3) organizational culture; (4) resources and funding; (5) information and data; (6) relationship-building; and (7) partnerships. The volume contains a list of resources and advice for colleges seeking to improve their responsiveness.

The four schools are all large, comprehensive public high schools that serve large percentages of minority students. They were selected based on their four-year record of narrowing or closing the achievement gap in reading and/or mathematics. To understand how they were able to narrow or close the gap, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) held a series of focus groups with administrators and teachers in December 2004. The groups explored teaching and learning strategies in the content areas, culture and school climate issues, leadership for change, and the change process itself. Common themes included the following: high expectations for student achievement; curriculum alignment and standards-based instruction; and leadership for change. Panelists recommended schools use data to identify deficiencies and to drive instructional decisions; talent, creativity, and resources present in schools must be channeled in constructive ways to address the academic and social needs of minority students; working collaboratively in developing and aligning the curriculum should be paramount; and leadership can come directly from the departments charged with narrowing the gap, given appropriate resources, professional development, and administrative support.

The TIMSS results had no statistically significant correlation with the teachers' emphasis on mathematics homework or students' time for the homework. Students' achievement was significantly lower in countries, in which homework contributed marks, homework was frequently the basis for class discussion, students corrected homework in class, etc. The mentioned ways of class work may not be the most effective use of class time and students in many countries have the optimal amount of homework. Educational leaders can compare the practice of homework in their country with the international average and consider recommendations relaying on the correlation coefficients.

        "author":["Reisner, Elizabeth R."],
        "description":"As demand for after-school services has grown, the public has responded with support for growth in federal, state, and local funding for these services. As in other successful grassroots movements, this high level of support is evident across groups with diverse objectives. Some after-school advocates are mainly interested in increasing the supply of safe, dependable after-school environments for the children of working parents. Others care most about using after-school programming to give children and youth positive developmental experiences that extend beyond academic learning. A third group is most concerned about expanding the learning opportunities available to low-achieving students and, in some instances, in using the after-school hours for remediation that will improve students' measured levels of achievement. Although these diverse interests have joined forces around their common objective of increasing and improving after-school opportunities, they tend to hold different expectations for programming and for the results that after-school programs might achieve. The experiences of successful after-school initiatives prove that multiple interests can be successfully accommodated, however, and despite their diversity, can enrich program development and implementation. Even so, a multiplicity of stakeholder voices can present challenges to after-school program operators. One challenge arises in the evaluation of these programs. This paper describes a series of steps for designing and conducting such evaluations, based on the author's experience in evaluating after-school programs and other education and youth-development initiatives. The paper provides examples of these steps from a current evaluation of a large local after-school program, that of The After-School Corporation (TASC) in New York.",

        "description":"The New Century High Schools (NCHS) initiative so far has launched three rounds of new small high schools in New York City, working in collaboration with the Department of Education of the City of New York (DOE), the teachers' and principals' professional associations, and a consortium of funders led by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. New Visions for Public Schools is administering the transformation effort on behalf of its partners. This report presents evaluation findings based on data collected during the first two years of the initiative, which were school years 2002-03 and 2003-04. The findings address the operations and results of the 12 schools launched in the initiative's first year (known here as the Cohort 1 schools) and the 18 schools launched in the initiative's second year (the Cohort 2 schools). The second year of the NCHS initiative brought two major challenges. The most immediate of these was finding space and facilities for the new schools. Because the creation of the new schools coincided with a district-wide surge in high school enrollment, the NCHS schools found themselves competing for scarce space and facilities within the over-crowded older schools that the new schools were slated to replace. The second challenge was the change in the DOE regional administrative infrastructure, which disassembled the high school superintendencies that in the Bronx had housed the core technical support personnel for the Cohort 1 schools. Although that support arrangement had been planned for extension to Brooklyn and the Cohort 2 schools, these plans had to be changed when the high school superintendencies were eliminated in 2003. New Visions and its partners responded to both challenges with informal negotiations, interventions, and adjustments needed to keep the new schools on track toward on-time openings and acceptable levels of program operations. Appended are: (1) Data and Procedures Used to Analyze Student Characteristics and Performance; and (2) Observation Methodology. (Contains 7 endnotes and 45 exhibits.)

To assess TASC's effectiveness, four foundations including the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the William T. Grant Foundation, and the Atlantic Philanthropies supported an external evaluation that answered questions about: quality and scale in program implementation, program effects on participating students, and program practices linked to student success. The evaluation collected data over four school years from 96 TASC after-school projects and their host schools in New York City. Its student sample numbered 52,000 after-school participants and 91,000 students who were enrolled in TASC host schools but not participating in TASC projects.

Lack of affordable housing is a principal cause of homelessness. A housing agency and school district that collaborate to offer affordable housing choices along with family services may reduce the frequency of family moves. This, in turn, allows children the opportunity to enjoy school stability--possibly for the first time in their lives. Increasingly, housing authorities and school districts are partnering to serve homeless and highly mobile children and families to accomplish these worthwhile goals.

Early college is an accelerated program leading to a combined high school diploma and an Associates degree in five years. The educational goals of this initiative are to minimize the barriers between high school and college; to ease the transition from secondary to postsecondary school; to prepare the students for and attract them to higher education, and to increase the high school graduation rates. Not only does this initiative allow secondary school students to take classes on a college campus, it also offers them access to the entire campus and all of its facilities.

        "description":"This report presents data on participation in after-school activities and programs in the United States. The data are from the After-School Programs and Activities Survey (ASPA), a nationally representative survey of the 2005 National Household Education Surveys Program (NHES:2005). The data presented in the report are based on a sample of 11,684 students in kindergarten through grade 8 representing a weighted total of 36,185,760 students. The weighted unit response rate for the ASPA survey was 84 percent; the overall unit response rate for the survey was 56 percent. Additional details about the survey, response rates, and data reliability are provided in appendix A. The purpose of this E.D. TAB is to introduce new NCES survey data through the presentation of selected descriptive information. The E.D. TAB is purely descriptive in nature. Readers are cautioned not to draw causal inferences based solely on the results presented in this E.D. TAB. It is important to note that many of the variables examined in this report are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored here. The variables examined here are also just a few of the variables that can be examined in these data and were selected to demonstrate the range of information that helped shape the design and now is available from the study. The selected findings are examples of comparisons that can be made using the data and are not designed to emphasize any particular issue. Release of the E.D. TAB is intended to encourage more in-depth analysis of the data, using more sophisticated statistical methods. Appended are: (1) Technical Notes; and (2) Glossary. (Contains 28 tables.)",

        "description":"Along with its human resources, financial assets, and intellectual cache, space is a primary  resource of an educational institution. Indeed, the dollar value (initial cost, replacement cost, or market value) of a postsecondary education institution's buildings sometimes exceeds its annual operating budget and endowment. Without information on how much and what type of resources it has, an institution cannot assess whether sufficient resources are available to fulfill its mission. Answering some basic questions about space, including how much space is available, what kind of space it is, to whom is the space assigned, and how efficiently is the space is being used, requires gathering facilities' inventory data and developing and maintaining a facilities' inventory database. This manual describes standard practices for initiating, conducting, reporting, and maintaining an institutional facilities inventory. Once completed, a facilities inventory will enable an institution to measure the ability of its space to meet its current programs, assess the current operation costs of its facilities (maintenance, utilities, cleaning, etc.), and then begin to plan for future space needs. The appendixes provide more detail than was warranted in the main body of the manual. In particular, appendix A provides guidance in using the FICM for data reporting and interinstitutional data exchange; appendix B provides additional detail on the NACUBO and OMB functional categories; appendix C provides additional detail on the Classification of Instructional Program codes for academic disciplines; appendix D provides a suggested method for classifying infrastructure; appendix E provides a detailed method for describing the maintenance level of facilities; appendix F provides an integrated number coding structure that encompasses assignable and nonassignable space and infrastructure classifications; and appendix G contains a glossary.

        "description":"This report is the fifth in a series of reports that provide a statistical snapshot of the undergraduate population. The reports accompany the newly released data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), and each one includes a focused analysis on a particular topic. This report focuses on community college students, who represent about 4 in 10 undergraduates, or about 7.6 million students nationwide. With their open enrollment policies and relatively low cost, community colleges have long provided access to underserved populations, such as students from low-income families and those who are the first in their family to attend college (Cohen and Brawer 2003). This report focuses on the relationship between a measure of degree commitment and student persistence among community college students. Student persistence is of concern to educators and policymakers because large numbers of students who begin their college education in  community colleges never complete it. The findings from this study help explain why  community college students complete associate's degrees and occupational credentials at relatively low rates. It appears that a substantial proportion of students who enroll in formal degree programs do not necessarily want to complete a credential. Rather, greater proportions cited personal interest or obtaining job skills as reasons for enrolling. The results suggest that if community college graduation rates were based on students expressing a clear intention of transfer or degree completion rather than on simply being enrolled in  a formal degree program, they would be considerably higher. The list of tables preceding the introduction of this report provides a convenient way to navigate the compendium of tables. Immediately following the compendium of tables, appendix A provides a glossary of all the variables included in the tables and appendix B provides a detailed description of the NPSAS:04 survey and methods used in the analysis.",

To provide such data, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) each year submits to Congress the mandated report, The Condition of Education. This year's report presents indicators of important developments and trends in American education. Recurrent themes underscored by the indicators include participation and persistence in education, student performance and other outcomes, the environment for learning, and resources for education. In addition, this year's volume contains a special analysis that presents key findings of several recent international assessments that examine the achievement of U.S. students in reading, mathematics, and science and the literacy of adults relative to the performance of their peers in other countries. This analysis is particularly timely given the concern for the competitiveness of the United States. This report is organized into the following sections: (1) Participation in Education; (2) Learner Outcomes; (3) Student Effort and Educational Progress; (4) Contexts of Elementary and Secondary Education; and (5) Contexts of Postsecondary Education.

        "description":"These essays by former Governor James B. Hunt Jr. and business leader Thomas J. Tierney  lay out in succinct fashion the requirements of both our nation and our states for new  and higher levels of performance from America's colleges and universities. The authors of these essays are not theorists writing from an ivory tower. Quite the contrary, both are national leaders and draw from their extensive experience in civic life, politics, and business. Both serve on the Board of Directors of the National Center for Public Policy and Education, and each of their essays brings fresh insights to the National Center's seminal series of report cards evaluating and comparing state performance in higher education. The context for these report cards is the dramatically changed environment of higher education over the past two decades. Today, the knowledge-based, global economy and major demographic shifts demand substantially improved opportunities for education and training beyond high school. This demand must become a major goal of national and state public policy. To an unprecedented extent, more Americans must prepare for, enroll in, and successfully complete degree and certificate programs. As the baby boomers--the most highly educated Americans in history--retire, their replacements will come primarily from the expanding minority and low-income groups, populations that have traditionally been the least-educated groups in this country. If this nation and its states cannot improve the education of these groups, the share of the U.S. workforce that is college-educated will shrink, and much of our past advantage in the global marketplace will shrink with it. These essays by two of America's most perceptive and influential leaders are valuable maps for charting the course through the critical economic and educational challenges and opportunities of this new century.",

In an era that values small government, competition, and private enterprise,  this renegotiation seems to some a logical update to an outdated system; to others it represents an ominous sign of changes that are spreading throughout society now reaching the once-protected world of higher education. Onlookers are, of course, all the more fascinated because of the historical significance of tinkering with Thomas Jefferson's universities. The public colleges in Virginia gained more power to conduct certain operations, but their power is checked by new accountability targeted directly at the needs of the state. Many have speculated about what Thomas Jefferson would think of the changes at his university, his alma mater, and his home state's public education system. These changes are discussed in this document. The following are appended: (1) Methodology; (2) Useful Web Sites; (3) Evolution of the Legislation, Including URLs; (4) Timeline; and (5) The State Ask.

The four components that make up a program model are defined by principles. A principle describes a guiding assumption about how to design the program quality support component and three program components in ways that are sufficient for research. These principles are derived from empirical evidence and professional wisdom, and defined through a process that balances the advice from empirical evidence and professional wisdom with the constraints inherent in the field of adult education. This paper proposes a set of principles that describe programs in which researchers can conduct studies that compare different approaches to instructional and support services. Though this program model is based on the best available professional wisdom and empirical evidence, it is untested. This model should be tested to assess its impact on participation--in terms of gains in skills and knowledge--in programs that conform to it. Once the model has been tested, further research could evaluate the relative merits of different approaches to instruction and support, or evaluate different definitions of each principle.

        "description":"This study is about engagement in adult literacy education. Engagement is mental effort focused on learning. It is important to understand how and why adult learners engage in literacy instruction because engagement is a precondition to learning progress. Researchers who study engagement conceive of it in different ways. Some focus on engagement as a cognitive, or mental, process closely related to such factors as motivation and self-efficacy. They seek to understand how the engagement process works and how it is related to learning. Others are more interested in how learning context shapes engagement--how the educational environment affects how and whether learners engage. Although both traditions are important, this study focused on the second tradition--how learning context shapes engagement. This was done for a very practical reason; to a great extent adult educators control the educational context. Thus, if they understand how the educational context shapes engagement, they can influence engagement in positive ways. This study was conducted at the National Labsite for Adult Literacy Education, a partnership between the National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL) and the New Brunswick Public Schools Adult Learning Center. The Center serves about 3,800 learners a year with basic literacy and English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) classes, preparation for the tests of the General Educational Development (GED) credential, and an adult high school that issues a school district diploma. Over a period of five years (2000?2005), we studied six classes: three basic literacy, two adult high school, and one GED preparation. The methodology was qualitative, with multiple data-collection methods, including the use of video, traditional ethnographic observation, and learner interviews. The teachers of the classes studied participated in some of the data-analysis sessions, and when they did, the session was recorded and transcribed. The tracripts were then treated as an additional data source. Multiple data sources enabled researchers to triangulate in data analysis. The study found that there were three contextual factors that shaped engagement in the classes studied: the instructional system, teachers' roles, and classroom norms. (Contains 1 table.)",

I compared these credentialed dropouts to the men who attempted, but failed, the GED exam during the same period. Credentialed dropouts had a higher probability of being employed one year after the exam--a difference that persisted two years later. Among individuals who were unemployed in the quarter during which they took the tests, GED passers found jobs faster. I also found that passing the tests is linked with more stable work  histories for white dropouts.",

Many people who did not acquire these skills while growing up look to adult education programs for instruction in literacy, English language fluency, or other types of basic skills. Research shows, however, that adult students often do not participate in such programs long enough to reap substantial learning gains. Many quickly drop out or attend education activities only sporadically, making little learning progress. Research suggests that students in adult literacy programs participate an average of 70 hours in a 12-month period; yet 100 to 150 hours of participation are required to improve literacy by one grade level. In recent years, concerns about low levels of persistence in adult education have become a major policy and program issue as federal funding has been made increasingly contingent on  programs' abilities to demonstrate improvements in their students' achievement.",

The journey to make this vision a reality-- to ensure that every student graduates with the knowledge and skills he or she needs to succeed in college and the workplace and to be a good and productive citizen --will not be easy. But it is one Ohio  needs to take. How can Ohio's high schools improve so that every student meets the state's high academic standards, graduates and is prepared to succeed in life after high school? The document discusses four recommendations: (1) Improve Learning Conditions in Ohio's High Schools; (2) Provide All Students a Challenging Curriculum that Prepares Them for Success; (3) Prevent Dropouts and Reconnect with Students Who Have Left without Graduating; and (4) Bridge the Gap between High School and Postsecondary Education. Realizing this vision is not merely the job of the state government. Indeed, in Ohio, the state has relatively little  control over what happens in classrooms. The state can, however, shape policy in a manner that raises expectations; builds capacity; and focuses the energies of students, parents, educators and communities on obtaining desired results and using research-proven processes.",

Trying to implement all the pieces at once may not be a solid plan for accomplishing a vision of quality. Taking steps to determine what is most critical for students is the logical starting place. The administrators must gauge the present capacity of the staff for change, and must determine the best ways for putting the essential elements into place. Often a three- to five-year plan makes the most sense. Leaders know that focusing on a few things at a time increases the likelihood that true systemic change will occur. They also know that at the same time, they must carefully plan, and with input from staff, make decisions that will positively impact student achievement. Constantly reflecting on the needs and the growth of staff as standards-based instruction is implemented for all learners, not only results in professional development that is important, but staff that is empowered. Only when staff members work together to address the needs of all learners, can they call themselves master administrators. This document is organized into the following chapters: (1) Standards-Based Assessment Mapping; (2) Standards-Based Instructional Design System; (3) Standards-Based Scheduling and Delivery Systems; and (4) Standards-Based Intervention Assistance Teams (IATs).

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the benefits of on-line learning for adult learners and to further demystify three common misconceptions concerning on-line learning:  students certainly do receive support from their on-line professors, the professor is pro-active rather than passive, and students may be more motivated to learn than in a conventional classroom. The author registered in a one semester on-line Teaching Business English course for already practicing professors of English language sponsored by the University of South Carolina in association with the American Department of State. She details the experience through concrete examples from the course and stresses that adult learners may successfully complete such a course by becoming used to time-management techniques particular to off campus, modular type learning, familiarizing themselves with strategies used in on-line learning such as community building exercises and highly structured assignments. The author concludes that there are several similarities between high quality on-line learning and conventional classroom learning. Factors that encourage high quality on-line learning such as clearly structured, attractive, varied assignments that are given quick, detailed feedback are also found in a traditional classroom setting. The author encourages university professors who are not in close proximity to in-service training to register in on-line courses. (Contains 2 figures.)",

This study presents a self-evaluation form designed to highlight the needs that English teachers teaching across all levels (preschool-12) at a school in Lebanon had. It was divided into two parts: the first part dealt with the teachers' accomplishments throughout the academic year 2005-2006, while the second part listed needs that teachers believe they need to work on throughout the following academic year. Teachers were asked to specify 3-5 needs they intend to work on during the academic year 2006-2007 and point out whether they can achieve their objectives on their own or they need professional help. The results highlighted teachers' writing skills, competence, self-confidence, in-depth analysis to evaluate their own work in addition to their character, professional growth, and maturity. This self-evaluation form can be used to support the supervisors' assessment of teachers. A teachers' professional growth survey is appended.",

There were 188 students enrolled in the program ranging in ages from 11 to 17. Twenty percent of the students in the program have been retained at least once. The program included 53% Black students, 23% Hispanic students and 23% White students. A total of 156 students were surveyed as well as 100% of the balanced literacy teachers. Of the nine teachers surveyed, five were white and four were black. The years of experience for the teachers range from 2 to 9. Sixty-seven percent of the teachers have been trained in teaching reading in the content area. Results indicate that after being enrolled in the balance literacy program for one academic year, the teachers' and students' survey responses relate to three areas: the quality of instruction and curriculum, academic success, and perspective of school and students. Students felt successful in the balanced literacy program while teachers believed teaching in the program was not the most beneficial method for the student. Educators need to utilize different methods for different students; however, the inconsistency in attitudes exhibited by the students and teachers indicate that there further investigation is needed in this area.

However, there is no study using worked examples in a game-based environment. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of worked examples on problem solving in a game-based environment. In this study, 72 adults were randomly assigned into the treatment group (i.e., worked examples) or control group and asked to play a computer puzzle game. Participants were asked to complete a content understanding knowledge map and answer retention and transfer problem-solving strategy questions. Results show that the treatment group improved significantly more than the control group on all measures. In conclusion, this study indicates that worked examples had significant effects on problem solving in a game-based task. However, the improvement was small compared to experts' performance.

The assessments are administered in English. Student scores are used to rank schools in defined categories of performance ranging from Underperforming to Exemplary. A significant percentage of HISD's student population is English Language Learners (ELL). Due to informal, voluntary segregation, these students are not evenly distributed among HISD schools. Since these students have more difficulty hurdling standardized assessments because they are given in a language that they may lack academic proficiency in, schools that have more English Language Learners are handicapped from getting a favorable ranking. It is proposed that the ELL student population be considered in ranking school performance, and that more culturally neutral assessments be developed to avoid unintended variance in the measurement of school performance.",

For example, proponents of the complex, rhythmic vernacular of Black English known as Ebonics purport that it is a recognizable \"tongue\", and should be treated as such. This means that in the grand effort of teaching standard American English, educators must first recognize, and second, not strip from them a language that is useful among its many users.

The opponents state that bilingual education is not working; it is an expensive funding pursuit for school districts; and that school children who receive such services are not performing any better academically than their peers who receive their instruction in English. On the other hand, the proponents of bilingual education claim that non-English speaking children must receive their academic instruction in their dominant language as second language acquisition learners. They need to acquire the language first before learning can result. Opponents further report that bilingual education program effectiveness in our schools is greatly misunderstood, and the increase of anti-immigrant sentiment and resentment toward special treatment for minority groups in our country has impacted the support of the English Only movement.

        "author":["Crampton, Faith E."],
        "description":"This monograph presents the results of the seventh annual survey of state school finance legislation with an overview of legislation passed in 2000, abstracts of all bills passed, and a trend analysis dating back to 1994, including both established and emergent trends. Established trends in the funding areas of educational technology, school infrastructure, charter schools, and student achievement were analyzed. After several years of increasing legislative activity, the number of bills passed to fund educational technology and charter schools declined slightly while the number of bills passed for school infrastructure declined precipitously, by approximately one-third. At the same time, the number of bills to fund improvements in student achievement increased substantially. State budget woes due to a weak economy may explain, at least in part, the reduction in funding bills for technology and school infrastructure. In tight budget times, technology may be considered a luxury while school repairs, renovation, and construction are delayed to save money. With regard to charter schools, most bills passed in 2000 refined existing laws often imposing higher levels of fiscal and educational accountability. As such, these types of bills may indicate a maturation in the charter school movement. If this leveling off and decline in the charter school funding continues, it may indicate that interest in charter schools as a public education alternative has peaked. At the same time, legislative interest in targeting funding to improve student achievement has continued to grow. More recent trends have emerged in the funding of teacher quality and early childhood education. Funding bills for early childhood education have increased slowly but steadily over the last three years while legislative interest in providing funding to maintain and enhance teacher quality increased dramatically in 2000 with 28 bills passed in 17 states. These bills focused on professional development funding, often targeted to specific content areas; fiscal incentives for teachers to secure the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification; and grants and loans to encourage new entrants into the teaching profession.

Title IX regulations have loosened as a result of the No Child Left Behind Legislation; therefore, public school districts now have the legal right to create single-sex classes or single-sex schools if they deem it to be in the best interest of their students. In public school single-sex environments, student achievement improves, especially for minority students or students in poverty, as a result of improved behaviors and teacher focus on learning-style differences.

Formative and summative evaluation data were gathered through survey forms, telephone interviews, and focus groups involving parents, school administrators, teachers and students. Results show that Community-Wide Efforts were favorably regarded by participants but led to relatively few changes in parents' levels of involvement. School administrators and teachers viewed most aspects of School-Home Communication more positively and more effective than did parents. All stakeholders considered Home Involvement important, but discrepancies were evident among teachers, parents, and students' responses.

        "author":["Guskey, Thomas R."],
        "description":"Few educators receive any formal training in assigning marks to students' work or in grading students' performance and achievement. As a result, when required to do so, most simply reflect back on what was done to them and then, based on those experiences, try to develop policies and practices that they believe are fair, equitable, defensible, and educationally sound. Their personal experiences as students, therefore, may have significant influence on the policies and practices they choose to employ. This study explored educators' recollections of their experiences as students with grading. Data were gathered through questionnaires administered to 320 elementary, middle, and secondary school educators. Questionnaire items asked respondents to describe their most positive and most negative experiences with grading when they were students, and to explain the reasons for their feelings. Content analyses of questionnaire responses revealed that nearly 70% of educators at all levels indicated their most negative experiences occurred in college or university level classes. In the vast majority of those cases, the recalled experience related to perceptions of unfair treatment or personal bias on the part of their professors or instructors. No differences were identified based on respondents' experience, gender, or current assignment. Positive experiences were more evenly dispersed across elementary, secondary, and college level classes, showing that the high proportion of negative experiences in college or university classes was not be explained simply because they occurred most recently. Respondents' descriptions of positive experiences typically related to extremely challenging learning tasks assigned by the teacher that required exceptional effort. The teacher or professor then offered personalized guidance and assistance that resulted in a high level of performance or outstanding achievement. Although the specific influence of these experiences on educators' current grading and reporting practices remains unknown, these results offer clear insights into the factors that contribute to educators' personal perspectives on grading and reporting. In addition, they provide specific implications for reform efforts in grading policies and practices.",

        "description":"A major challenge to state and jurisdictional policy makers in implementing the Early Intervention Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities, Part C under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), continues to be determining definitions of developmental delay and criteria of eligibility for services to young children, birth through 2 years of age, and their families. Under Part C, participating states and jurisdictions must provide services to two groups of children: those who are experiencing developmental delays, and those who have a diagnosed mental or physical condition that has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay. In addition, states may choose to serve children who are at risk of having substantial developmental delays if early intervention services are not provided. Over the years, several states have revised their eligibility definitions: some have narrowed their eligibility criteria and others have expanded them. This paper updates earlier versions of the same title. It provides the most recent information on how the 50 states and 6 jurisdictions that participate in the Part C program define developmental delay and, as applicable, at risk in their definition of eligibility for services. This &quot;NECTAC Notes&quot; is an update of &quot;NECTAC Notes Issue No. 20&quot; dated February 2006. The current edition includes changes to two states' eligibility criteria. (Contains 2 tables.)

A good education offers a better quality of life, including access to good jobs and careers. Getting a good education is even more important today than in the past as more and more opportunities require strong reading and math skills. Ensuring that every child gets a solid education will go a long way toward fulfilling America's promise of equal opportunity for all. To make sure African-American children get the education they need and deserve, parents must get more involved. In this guide, the writers offer a number of suggestions to help parents better advocate for the education of their children. They also offer information that can be turned into powerful tools for parents to exercise their rights as an involved African-American parent. A glossary is included. (Contains 10 footnotes.)",

        "description":"This document compiles a series of three policy briefs focused on the subject of grade retention. The first brief, \"Grade Retention: A Flawed Education Strategy,\" suggests educators and policymakers caution the use of grade retention as a remedy for poor student performance. As concluded by the majority of past studies, grade retention is a failed and expensive strategy to increase academic achievement. This brief asserts alternative remediation strategies such as individualized student instruction, parental involvement, curriculum development, and school restructuring, should be explored and used to bring under-achieving students up to standard. The second policy brief in this document, \"Cost-Benefit Analysis of Grade Retention,\" provides a possible economic framework to quantitatively evaluate the costs and benefits to society of retaining one student in a grade level for an additional year. Using the standard criteria for looking at the costs and benefits of social programs, costs and savings are identified in three areas: education costs, costs associated with economic wellbeing, and costs associated with crime. \"Grade Retention: The Gap between Research and Practice\" represents the final policy brief in this series. It examines the apparent gap between research findings and retention practice and discusses reasons for its existence in four aspects: public belief, teachers' perspectives, research issues, and politics. (Individual briefs contain references.) [The policy briefs presented in this document were produced by the Center for Child and Family Policy.]",

Until recently, however, little was known about how such experiences affect victims' later socioeconomic status. Current research has examined the long-term impact of child abuse and neglect on adult employment, income, and reliance on public assistance, as well as the reasons for this impact. Abuse and neglect, often collectively referred to as maltreatment, place victims at significantly increased risk for problems across a range of socioeconomic areas, even after such factors as race, age, and childhood socioeconomic status have been taken into account.

The North Carolina State Legislature has mandated the evaluation of five key aspects of the Multiple Response System (MRS) as field-tested by 10 County Departments of Social Services (DSS) in North Carolina, specifically: Child Safety; Timeliness of Response; Timeliness of Service; Coordination of Local Human Services; and Cost-Effectiveness. Data for this evaluation were assembled from State data systems and through original data collection that included Child Protective Services (CPS) Reports, Services Information System (SIS) Data, surveys of family members, and focus groups. The methods used to complete the evaluation included tracking of changes in the 10 pilot MRS counties over time and contrasting the activities  and outcomes in the 10 MRS counties with matched counties that had not yet implemented  MRS.

The Initiative's Implementation Work Group focused on four key areas to enhance North Carolina's system of professional development for K-12 teachers. Those areas were: (1) Professional Development Online Resource Center--Design implementation plan for an online professional development resource center; (2) Statewide Professional Development Standards--Develop plan for implementation of NC's statewide standards for professional development, which the State Board of Education adopted in March 2003; (3) Funding for Professional Development--Produce an accounting of sources and uses of professional development funds to give decision makers a new, common base of information; and (4) Professional Development Data Collection--Develop an understanding of available district-level professional development data to determine how best to use data to inform teacher quality and student achievement efforts. Each focus area is spelled out further in the proposal-- which highlights the goals, rationale and proposal for action for each component--and the accompanying appendices. The North Carolina Department of Public Instruction is working with the Initiative to develop cost estimates for the components of the Proposal for Action. Appendices are divided into four parts. Part one, Standards, includes: (1) Summary of Standards for Professional Development; (2) Policy Guidance for State Board of Education; and (3) Summary of Subcommittee Activities. Part two, Online Resource Center, contains: (4) Description and Guidance; and (5) Summary of Subcommittee Activities. Part three, Funding, includes: (6) Sources and Uses of Funds for Professional Development; and (7) Summary of Subcommittee Activities. Part four, Data Collection, contains: (8) Survey of District Professional Development Contacts; and (9) Summary of Subcommittee Activities.

        "description":"The Center for Child and Family Policy was established at Duke University on July 1,  1999, following several years of planning by faculty members representing numerous disciplines and the full campus. The Center was approved as a university-wide Center for an initial five year period. The Center's mission was initially framed broadly to bring academic scholarship to bear on problems facing children and families in contemporary society, through its activities of research, teaching, service, and policy development. In reality, though, its initial tasks were to define its mission more specifically, to build a critical mass of support within the university, to establish partnerships with community and government agencies, and to obtain external funding for its activities. Four years later, the Center had grown three comprehensive programs of policy-relevant activity, in areas of adolescent problem behaviors, education reform, and early childhood adversity. The Center has clearly succeeded in its first tasks of forging a mission, building internal faculty support, and obtaining external funding. The next five-year period represents a new challenge of refining the Center's identity and maturing the Center into a stable force that contributes both to Duke University's mission and to society. With that challenge in mind, the Center undertook a strategic planning process that culminated in this report. The process included: (1) meetings with the Dean of Arts and Sciences and the Center's internal Advisory Board; (2) review of the missions and scope of 22 similar centers at other universities, including site visits to Columbia University and Yale University; (3) consultation with a planning expert; (4) group and individual meetings with Center faculty members, Research Scientists, and administrative staff members; and (5) written input by Center staff and faculty members. The Center's goal is to become a new model of how universities can exert an impact on society, one that will be readily apparent to policymakers. This goal is embraced by the overall Strategic Plan for Duke University. (Contains 2 footnotes.) [This document was prepared by the Center for Child and Family Policy.]",

Recruiting and retaining qualified teachers in math, science and special education is particularly difficult, especially for the schools serving disproportionate shares of disadvantaged or low-performing students. In 2001, North Carolina responded to these challenges by introducing a salary bonus program paying up to $1,800 to certified teachers of math, science and special education in eligible middle and high schools. To be eligible, schools had to meet one of the following criteria: more than 80 percent of its students had to receive free or reduced price lunches, or the failure rate on both Algebra 1 and Biology end-of-course tests had to exceed 50 percent. Funding for this initiative was discontinued in the recent session of the Legislature, so bonuses were not available for 2004-05. The goal of the bonus program was to use financial incentives to induce teachers  of subjects in short supply to teach in schools serving educationally disadvantaged  students. The program is described and evaluated in this brief report. (Contains 1 note.)",

Spirited conversation will intensify as the Congress discusses how to adjust and reauthorize this ambitious set of school reforms. Both state and federal gauges of student achievement will inform this debate. This paper first asks whether state testing systems provide an accurate and consistent indication of the share of fourth-grade students who are deemed &quot;proficient&quot; in reading and mathematics. It compares the states' own estimates against federal determinations, based on results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). It reports for the first time, on comparable state testing results and trends since 1992. The report details, looking across 12 diverse states, a small improvement in the percentage of children achieving proficiency in reading, based on NAEP results between 1992 and 2005. But states estimated much higher shares of students reaching proficiency, compared with the NAEP results. It then details how children made greater progress in math proficiency over this 13-year period. Yet again, it discovered that state test results exaggerate the annual rate of improvement, compared with the federal NAEP results. This historical disparity between state and federal estimates of proficiency levels has not previously been illuminated over this range of states. But the phenomenon is not new. The gap does not stem simply from NCLB's unintended incentive for states to set low cutoffs for defining which students are deemed proficient. Instead, it shows that states have long claimed that a much higher share of students are proficient relative to NAEP results, even before NCLB created the incentive for states to set a low bar. Appended are: (1) Fourth-Grade Test Score Patterns in 12 States; (2) Sources for Test Data and State Accountability Policies; and (3) State Policy Milestones.

        "description":"A growing body of research evidence indicates that implementing CREDE's Five Standards for Effective Pedagogy promotes positive learning outcomes for students. The Five Standards are: (1) Joint Productive Activity (JPA); (2) Language and Literacy Development (LLD); (3) Contextualization: Connecting School to Students' Lives (CTX); (4) Challenging Activities (CA); and (5) Instructional Conversation (IC). They are principles critical for improving the teaching and learning of culturally and linguistically diverse students. Each standard facilitates the construction of knowledge by teacher and students and promotes conceptual elaboration. Through multi-year partnerships with demonstration schools, CREDE researchers and coaches work with teachers on the Five Standards over a sustained period of time. At these sites, CREDE coaches and teachers collaborate to conduct and improve instruction: the Five Standards are integrated into classroom activities structured into multiple, simultaneous activity centers. Student learning outcomes at demonstration schools are reflective of exemplary instruction guided by the standards. The Standards Performance Continuum (SPC) is a 5-level rubric that measures implementation of the Five Standards and is used at demonstration schools to guide and assess professional development activities. Coaches, teachers, and researchers use SPC data to focus and refine instruction, guide and assess the effectiveness of professional development activities, and examine the relationship between teachers' use of the standards and student achievement. This brief discusses the development of the SPC, recent research in which the instrument was used, and areas of application. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"The focus of the current high school reform movement goes beyond qualifying students to enter college. It extends to raising the rigor of coursework so that students are prepared for college-level classes, rather than forced to enter remedial courses. This need is based on extensive study of the gap between college admissions criteria and the more rigorous requirements for entering credit courses, as determined by college placement tests. Reformers further assert that all students, not just the college bound, should reach that higher level of academic preparedness. The notion is that non-college-bound students require that level of preparation to enter the employment world, or as it is sometimes stated, to get \"good jobs.\" This report attempts to bring together available information on the work world, what employers say they want, what employment projections show, and the requirements and qualifications necessary to meet employer needs and standards. This analysis finds a strong case for advancing the academic skills of a high proportion of those high school graduates if they are to compete successfully for the higher-paying jobs available to those without a college degree, and advance in such jobs. Appended is: Best Matches of Occupational Categories between Jobs Listed in Table 4 and Jobs Listed in \"What Jobs Require\" Report. (Contains 4 tables, 7 figures, and 51 footnotes.)",

These graduates would have completed their undergraduate borrowing prior to the changes introduced by the 1992 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. At that time, only students with financial need could have participated in federal loan programs as undergraduates. The second part examines the repayment of undergraduate loans for bachelor's degree recipients who had no additional degree enrollment, providing details on how many had finished repaying their loans by 2003, who were still repaying and how much, what their debt burden was, and how they had managed their Stafford loan repayment over the 10-year period. As borrowing has increased, long-standing concerns about students' ability to repay their loans and the effect of the debt on their lives after college have intensified. Important ongoing policy questions related to keeping student debt manageable include how much student aid the federal government should provide in the form of loans versus grants, how much students should be allowed to borrow, who should qualify for subsidized loans, and what the repayment terms should be.

        "description":"Three years of assessment data have been collected since The No Child Left Behind Act took effect. The purpose of this paper was to determine what effect adequate yearly progress (AYP) requirements have had on student achievement as measured by achievement level categorization across years. In measuring how well students are achieving in the wake of the AYP regulations, a method similar to the one suggested by Linn, Baker, and Betebenner in 2002 was used on Kansas assessment data from the years 1999-2000 through 2004-2005. Effect sizes were calculated using the proportions of students within an achievement level categorization across years for three grades assessed in reading and three assessed in mathematics. The results showed mostly small effects for a time span of one year. Comparing data from one year prior to implementation of adequate yearly progress with 2004 and 2005, two and three years since implementation, effect sizes were typically medium or large. Regression toward the mean, indicated by not focusing on the instruction of high achieving students, did not seem to occur in this data set. In fact, the proportions of students in the two higher categories, &quot;Advanced&quot; and &quot;Exemplary,&quot; increased as proportions in &quot;Proficient&quot; remained relatively constant across the six years.

Each international assessment measures one or more dimensions of the performance or ability of U.S. students or adults. Combined with data from national assessments, these international assessment data provide educators and policymakers with a more complete picture of educational achievement in the United States. This special analysis will present major findings from each of these assessments. The purpose of this special analysis is three-fold: (1) to discuss the similarities and differences in the countries participating in the assessments; (2) to report the most recent findings of these assessments; and (3) to compare the overall performance of students and adults in the United States with their peers in other countries.

Phase I of the study included novice computer users' approaches to multimedia design. Phase II explored the correlations between their attitudes and cognitive styles; and Phase III focused on their attitudes and beliefs about the use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools. The current paper discusses and reports the findings from the last phase. A total of 53 students from the department of English Language Teaching (ELT) at Abant Izzet Baysal University (AIBU) voluntarily participated in the study. An integrated message board system was designed and adopted for an elective computer assisted language learning course (CALL) for students in the ELT program. 26 students were enrolled in this course. The data was collected through several sources. One source was an attitude questionnaire toward computer-mediated communication. Students' asynchronous correspondences constituted the other part of the data. Also, students' personal reflection journals were gathered as another source of data. The data was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings of the study indicated that students generally tended to develop positive attitudes toward using asynchronous communication tools in their language teaching program. Also, no attitudinal changes in their attitudes toward CMC were observed. Finally, students expressed positive reflections about the use of CMC tools and their integration into teaching.

Prior to the implementation the images depicted \"controlling\" or \"leading\" type of images of classroom management that indicated a disciplinary vision about classroom management. After the implementation, although the metaphorical concepts did not change much, the teacher candidates' images of classroom management depicted more leading type of images that entailed messages of cooperative aspects and awareness of individual differences.

These disturbingly common practices illustrate the serious problems in the care of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. The lack of professional guidance related to youths' sexual identities has left a vacuum that is often filled by harmful, discriminatory practices based on personal biases rather than informed, evidence-based policies. The best practice guidelines  in this book will improve outcomes for youth with accurate, up-to-date information about the best practices for providing competent services to youth who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT). The \"Best Practices Guidelines\" after opening with an acknowledgments and introduction section offers eight chapters as follows: (1) LGBT Youth in Out-of-Home Care; (2) Creating an Inclusive Organizational Culture; (3) A Family-Centered Approach to Serving LGBT Youth; (4) Promoting Positive Adolescent Development; (5) Collecting and Managing Confidential Information; (6) Ensuring Appropriate Homes for LGBT Youth; (7) LGBT Youth in Institutional Settings; and (8) Providing Appropriate Health, Mental Health, and Education Services to LGBT Youth.

        "description":"Between September 2003 and December 2004, the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund (Lambda) organized Regional Listening Forums in 13 different cities around the country. The objective of these events was to highlight the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth in care. The CWLA/Lambda Regional Listening Forums provided an opportunity for LGBTQ youth in care, and the adults who work with and care for them, to share their experiences and to work together to identify strategies for bringing about lasting change within the child welfare system. Out of the Margins consolidates the responses of the more than 500 youth and adult participants from 22 states who attended the Forums and offered personal stories of actual experiences and concrete solutions for building the capacity of the child welfare system to better meet the needs of LGBTQ young people in care. This report contains the following chapters: (1) Addressing Negative Attitudes About People Who Are LGBTO; (2) Safe and Supportive Placements; (3) Homeless LGBTQ Youth; (4) Community Resources and Services; (5) Issues Facing LGBTQ Youth in Schools; (6) Permanency Planning; (7) Transgender Youth; (8) Bridging the Rural -Urban Divide; (9) Faith-Based Child Welfare Service; (10) Adults Involved with the Child Welfare System; and (11) The Utility of the Regional Listening Forums for Policy, Practice, and Research: A Tripod (A.

        "author":["Gill, Wanda E."],
        "description":"Across the country, more Catholic schools are closing, as support for parochial schools in impoverished communities dwindles. Dr. Vernon C. Polite, Dean of the School of Education at the time he was selected to present at AERA (Dr. Polite joined the School of Education at Eastern Michigan University as its Dean during the summer of 2005.) published extensively on predominantly African American Catholic high schools. He invited the writer, who was serving as a Special Assistant to the Dean of the School of Education at Bowie State University, to develop and write a paper updating the status since his published work. The author accepted and expanded the paper to include its relative importance to her prior knowledge of the Washington Scholarship Program and the Archdiocese of Washington through her work with the Office of Non Public Education (ONPE) in the Office of Innovation &amp; Improvement at the U.S. Department of Education and formal and informal conversations with third world clergy from Catholic University, one of whom taught as an Adjunct Professor at Bowie State University during the Spring of 2005. The update uses Detroit, New York and Boston as examples of large urban areas that traditionally supported Catholic high schools in predominantly African American communities but were forced to close them. While closings occurred across the cities, the African American communities were particularly hard hit, despite the high achievement of students enrolled in these high schools relative to the high schools' counterparts. These losses will be particularly felt because the cultural identities of these schools will be lost. The closings are directly linked to budget deficits in all cases. In most case, the parishes in which these high schools are located do not have the resources to sustain them without help from the archdioceses in these cities. The writer relates the current closings to Vernon Clayton Polite's study of 31 schools, 26 of which are in cities or areas that emphasize the cultures of the schools and their importance in Catholicism, as seen through data from surveys, the eyes of the principals and controlled observations.

        "author":["Chen, Chi-Fen Emily",
          "Cheng, Wei-Yuan"],
        "description":"The invention of computer-based writing program has revolutionized the way of teaching second language writing. Embedded with artificial intelligence scoring engine, it can provide students with both immediate score and diagnostic feedback on their essays. In addition, some of such programs offer convenient writing and editing tools to facilitate students' writing process, such as MyAccess. However, the effectiveness of using such programs to improve students' writing skills in the L2 is not conclusive yet. To gain a deeper understanding of how such a computer-based writing program works in EFL writing classes, this study explored factors that may lead to facilitation or frustration when the program MyAccess is in use. The participants were three EFL writing classes consisting of 68 third-year English majors in a Taiwan's university. Data included students' responses to a questionnaire, writing samples, feedback given by MyAccess, and focus-group interviews with the students. The findings show that only 55% of the students felt this program either moderately or slightly helpful to them in improving their writing skills and that the students were much less satisfied with the grading function than the writing/editing functions. Their dissatisfaction was largely because this program failed to give specific feedback in the content and rhetorical aspects of their writings. Moreover, the study also found that the different ways the three writing classes used this program and the instructors' familiarity level with the program coupled with their technological skills greatly affected the students' attitudes toward this program. The study concludes that pedagogical approaches and contextual factors are more crucial than the functions of the program in determining its effectiveness. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "author":["Rossi, Stacey Elin"],
        "description":"The purpose of this thesis is to address disproportionate &quot;discipline&quot; of minorities, i.e. ethnic/racial minorities and children with disabilities,  discrimination against ethnic/racial minorities and children with disabilities in the form of verbal and physical abuse, and draconian zero tolerance policies with their one-size-fits-all punishment approach to discipline and classroom management. This paper focuses primarily on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, but also using wider cultural and legal contexts when appropriate. First, questionnaires were distributed among educators and disability rights advocates surveying the pre-thesis topic. Second, a survey was administered to all Massachusetts schools in the 33 districts with ten or more student exclusions students in 2003 and districts with four or more student exclusions per 1000 in 2003, with a 4% response rate. Because of the poor response rate, school codes of conduct were requested from these 33 identified school districts in an attempt to find at least some answers to the questions posed in the survey. Third, exclusion data collected from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Education was be added to and questioned. Fourth, the counterpart to the exclusion issue, inclusion, generally speaking, was explored by looking at the current research on best practices in positive disciplinary interventions that are safe, protective, and inclusive. The findings provide some evidence that the Commonwealth's highest rates of exclusion can be found in school districts where higher levels of low-income, absence, in-school and out-of-school suspension, retention. dropout, and &quot;Warning/Failing&quot; MCAS rates are prevalent.  These districts also have higher than average rates of special education, except for charter and regional vocational schools. The targeted districts did not significantly vary on average from the statewide rates for per pupil expenditure and limited English proficient rates. Further to examine this data with more rigorous statistical methods may be helpful for policy analysts. (Contains 10 tables, 4 figures, and 48 appendices.)

The audit focused on incident reporting outside New York City. Based on the results, it was concluded that there is significant risk that the level of violence at other high schools across the State is similarly understated, and therefore SED's annual reports on school violence do not convey the full seriousness of the situation to the Governor, Legislature and Board of Regents. In effect, school district students, teachers and other employees have a greater exposure to violent and disruptive behavior than may have been previously disclosed.

        "description":"Across the world, women in physics have much in common. In almost all countries, women are largely under represented in physics. In the majority of countries for which data was obtainable for this report from reliable statistical agencies, women earned no more than one-fifth of the PhDs in physics. Many women physicists across the world also experience problems related to balancing the demands of a career in physics with the responsibilities of raising a family. In addition to these problems, there are the difficulties of dealing with discrimination, negative attitudes about women in physics, and workplace environments that are less than welcoming. To obtain information about issues that are of concern to women physicists across the world, the Statistical Research Center of the American Institute of Physics (AIP) conducted a web-based survey between May 9, 2005 and June 29, 2005. The survey topics included factors that influenced decisions to choose physics, experiences during the educational process and while working, opinions about physics, and demographic information. This study is a follow-up to a survey conducted by the Statistical Research Center in 2002 in conjunction with the First IUPAP (International Union of Pure and  Applied Physics) International Conference of Women in Physics. This AIP Report presents the findings of this follow-up study. Tabular data on \"Percent of Physics Bachelor's and PhD Degrees Awarded to Women in Selected Countries: 2-Year Averages\" are appended.

        "description":"Problem behavior at school \"interferes with the educational process and places a burden on teachers\" (U.S. Department of Education 2002, p. III-17). Disciplinary problems have long been linked to negative outcomes for students with disabilities, such as course failure and dropping out of school (Wagner et al. 1991). Parents, administrators, teachers, and communities all are interested in keeping schools safe and maintaining positive environments conducive to learning (Finley 2003; Gallegos 1998; Sprague, Smith, and Stieber 2002). To accomplish these goals, schools employ a range of policies and approaches to managing student behavior, including classroom token economies, positive behavior supports, and suspensions and expulsions (Leone et al. 2000; NASP Center 2005; Peterson and Skiba, 2001; Sugai et al. 2000). Data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2) provide a national picture of disciplinary experiences at the secondary school level of youth with disabilities, offering a perspective on youth who exhibit problem behaviors at school and on schools' implementation of disciplinary actions.

        "description":"In 1998, Congress reauthorized and amended the &quot;Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA)&quot;, creating, under Title II, the Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants Program for States and Partnerships. One initiative under this amendment, the partnership grants program, funded partnerships among colleges of education, schools of arts and sciences, and local school districts. Congress designed the partnership initiative as one of several pre-&quot;No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)&quot; efforts to support accountability for teacher preparation and to improve the work of teacher-preparation programs. It was anticipated that the collaboration among the partners would result in the successful implementation of reforms holding teacher-training programs accountable for producing high-quality teachers and providing sustained and quality preservice field  experiences and professional development opportunities. This evaluation report focuses on the 25 grantees of the 1999 cohort of the Title II partnership grants program. A diverse cohort, these grantees, consisting of at least 66 colleges and universities, 28 community colleges, 179 school districts, and 821 elementary schools in more than 25 different states, received a total of more than $171 million over the 1999-?2004 period. A descriptive study conducted over four and a half years (2000?05), the partnership evaluation surveyed nearly 300 representatives from institutions of higher education (IHEs) and district project participants at two points during the grant period (2000-01; 2003-04). More than 500 principals were surveyed once, during the 2002-03 year. The study also included secondary data analyses using publicly available data on school characteristics, school level achievement data, and pass rates on teacher assessments reported as part of the Title II HEA reporting requirements. The evaluation's goal was to learn about the collaborative activities taking place in partnerships. The study was also  designed to examine approaches to preng new and veteran teachers and to assess the sustainability of project activities after the grant ends. Key findings related to each of the evaluation questions are described in this report. Appended are: (1) Aggregate Pass Rate Averages on Math Content Knowledge Test by Partnership, 1999--2000 and 2000--01 for States Requiring this Assessment in these Years; (2) IHE and Community College Partners in the 1999 Title II Cohort; (3) Partnership Main Goals, Strategies for Increasing Accountability, Planned Use of Incentives, and Content Area Emphases; and (4) Survey Response by Partnership.

The IG Act created independent inspectors general, who would: protect the integrity of government; improve program efficiency and effectiveness; prevent and detect fraud, waste and abuse in federal agencies; and keep agency heads, Congress, and the American people fully and currently informed of the findings of the IGs' work. Almost 30 years later, that bold concept is a proven success. The IGs continue to deliver significant benefits to our nation. Thanks to IG audits and inspections, billions of dollars have been returned to the federal government or have been better spent based on recommendations identified through those audits and inspections. IG investigations have also contributed to the prosecution of thousands of wrongdoers. In addition, the IG concept of good governance and accountability encourages foreign governments to seek our advice, with the goal of replicating the basic IG principles in their own governments.",

        "description":"The 21st century has brought new challenges and opportunities for higher education. In the wake of the transition from elitist to mass education, universities worldwide are under pressure to enhance access and equity, on the one hand, and to maintain high standards of quality and excellence, on the other. Today the notion of equity not only implies greater access to higher education, but also opportunities for progress. In recent debates on higher education, the notions of equity and access go beyond minority to diversity. Affirmative action, too, has become race-exclusive and gender-neutral. The following paper makes an attempt to understand the nuances of a caste-based reservation policy in higher education in light of recent controversies, court verdicts, a subsequent amendment to the constitution in India; and affirmative action policies, court verdicts, and alternatives to affirmative action in certain universities in the US. The objective is to bring out commonalities and contrasts between the two countries in terms of legal, political, socio-cultural, economic, and psychological perspectives.",

        "description":"Many Waldorf methods charter schools are opening up in California today. They are publicly funded schools bringing Waldorf methods into public education. In today's political climate all public schools must pass the state's bar of academic success measured by their Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). Because these scores are based largely on standardized tests there is a need to integrate California's academic content standards into Waldorf methods charter schools. The purpose of this review of the literature is to examine Waldorf methods within the charter school setting without compromising the Waldorf philosophy. The literature highlights a need to clearly define which Waldorf methods are being used in charter schools as well as a political debate regarding the appropriateness of Waldorf education in public schools. The outcome of this review is the development of a template that will guide teachers in a Waldorf methods school through the process of standards integration. (Contains 1 table.)

Current research will state that disparities in mathematics exist in American schools.

These disparities translate into real differences in the services we provide African American students in our American schools. Efforts to rectify these inequalities will close the achievement gap between the races.

        "description":"Our world today is full of challenges and opportunities. Religion is at the center of  attention by the world audience. Civilization will survive if, and only if, educational  leaders implement postmodern thinking in public education. Postmodernism was  originally a critique of modernism. My views support postmodernism as a current  state of mind that allows a way of seeing and working together differently. We have moved from the technology phase of society into a complex day-to-day global communication. All cultures and religions must discuss issues and make adjustments in the work-place to survive the postmodern thinking of the 21st century. This article will share my views of postmodern thinking and offer a solution to global communication. The communication belief will allow the cultures and religions of the world to survive and live a normal and peaceful lifestyle. Teachers are the main focus in the postmodern world of change. Teaching is a gift from God. Dedication is the primary strength of a teacher. Commitment is necessary to perform duties as a teacher. The author believes the teacher must first connect with the student; then care for the student; and be totally committed to teach the student. The author has spent long hours performing responsibilities as a teacher and emphasizes to do whatever is necessary to help the child to learn. Countless hours of extra work with students often separate the certified teachers from the qualified teachers. The postmodern era in technology will not improve without involving the students.",

My career as an educator for the past forty-one years lends credence to a desire to create a difference model in education for the next fifty years. The model is named \"Immigration and Student Success: Communication Journey High School as a Learning Organization.\" A learning organization is an Open System Model. This model addresses the Achievement Motivation Theory. Students in the 21st Century will have a high need for achievement. With the expanding cultures on every continent, a multi-lingual approach for students will be the norm for communication. Students will need to speak the language of their culture; speak the  language of their community; speak the language of their respective working environment in the 21st Century. My ideas will identify the framework and how it will function under my leadership. This model is a paradigm shift from the current Open System Model.

Curriculum can be developed that will continue to be relevant and vital for each successive generation as definitions of quality, integrity, and language are continuously revisited. The bottom line is that the conceptual framework can be a useful paradigm for curriculum selection and development that will continue to be fresh and useful.

Organizations, where HRD has been traditionally situated, have begun to realize the ominous workforce challenge that lies ahead--especially related to ensuring literate and skilled adults in the future. It is very important for HRD professionals to \"tune into\" these emerging trends because they will affect our roles and responsibilities. The purpose of this manuscript is twofold: 1) it presents a review of the relevant literature regarding the issues and future trends prevalent in the field of Adult Literacy; and 2) it presents the results of a survey conducted during Summer, 2001 which sought to elicit what 14 experts in the field of Adult Literacy thought would and will be the most significant challenges as the field moves forward in the 21st century. Thus, the research problem can be summarized in the following research question: what do experts in the field of Adult Literacy presume will be the most significant challenges as the field moves forward? This paper begins with a literature review of relevant sources concerning general trends in Adult Literacy. This literature review is intended to provide a backdrop given that many HRD professionals may be unfamiliar with the current ideas and debates in the diverse field of Adult Literacy. It is from this backdrop that the researchers began to inquire in an exploratory nature what several Literacy experts may suggest are the core challenges on the horizon for the field and its professionals.

Theoretically, the model is found wanting because it slights the full range of adult learning experiences, makes misleading distinctions between adult and child learners, minimizes individual differences between adult as learners, and does not adequately deal with the relationship between motivation and learning.

Informal learning is viewed as an integrated process consisting of an interaction process between learning workers and interaction partners and an internal psychological process, leading to an outcome. A sample of 279 police officers filled out a questionnaire. Preliminary analysis shows that external input, collegial availability, valuing informal learning, police tenure and hours spent on jobs besides police work predict informal learning.

Student behavior must be addressed appropriately to allow educators to fulfill their responsibility to America's students. Creative disciplinary methods motivate all students to develop behavior traits that will assist them with their academic and personal success. The purpose of this essay is to investigate alternative effective disciplinary consequences. Educating the 21st century students entails numerous and somewhat overwhelming challenges. An increasing number of students enter academia with deficits stemming from poverty to language barriers. Nevertheless, schools cannot shirk their responsibility. Schools must educate the ever-changing student with less resources and higher stakes due to state and nationally imposed accountability standards. Schools must be able to meet the challenge of educating all students in an environment that is safe and allows the student to feel secure (Hawkins, Catalono, Kosterman, Abbott, & Hill, 1999.). Historically schools have been viewed as the place to address the ills of society (Mayer, 1995; Walker et al., 1996.).",

        "description":"This White Paper examines the components that determine effective instruction and tutoring in English spelling, based on current scientific research and experience gained in field testing while developing an innovative educational technology. Basis for the findings were repeated field studies conducted in small groups with students grade 3 and higher (up to college level). The goal was to isolate the components that were a) effective and b) kept learning interesting and challenging. Students and teachers were completing evaluation forms that contained both the opportunity to rate certain program aspects on a scale from 1-5, and included a feedback box for ideas \"outside of the box.\" The evaluation was concluded by interviewing parents and teachers on their experience with the traditional learning approach (spelling word lists and spelling computer games). Their feedback was found to be coherent with accepted brain and pedagogic research, and is summarized in easily accessible format as seven aspects of successful spelling tutoring. The document reflects further on the current bias in society regarding spelling that originates from our pedagogic past and from teaching spelling in rote, authoritarian ways. It further lists evidence that an overall decline in spelling ability and word knowledge is affecting the literacy levels in the nation, alarming policy makers and employers. The paper introduces the Internet as a new way to provide targeted tutoring by replacing the common study-test approach with a much more individualized and effective test-study-test approach, where students are able to focus all of their attention on knowledge they do not yet have. Learning with such a tutoring concept is up to six times more efficient that traditional methods. The report contains a table comparing the new development with traditional methods of teaching, and an extensive bibliography on the research.",

African American students are significantly underrepresented in advanced mathematics courses. One of the most segregated places in American society is the mathematics classroom. African American students have less access to advanced study in mathematics than before the mid-1960s. Research by Powell (1990) does suggest that inadequate career guidance in high school contributes to the under-participation of African American students in science and mathematics.

Achievement of minority students lags behind that of Whites and non-minority students. This research will show facts as they exist today in America's schools relating to the achievement gap dilemma. It is well known and documented that children of color are underrepresented in gifted programs. On national assessments in mathematics, Black students' performance continues to lag behind that of White students, with uneven progress in closing the gap. Data collected on instructional practices indicate differences between how minority and White students are taught. The NAEP data suggest that many minority students are not experiencing instructional practices consistent with the recommendation suggested by the National Council Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). American schools must provide an adequate learning environment. The authors emphasize that we must accept the challenge in finding a solution to the most significant problems in America's schools in the 21st century.",

A brief overview of a selection of these conceptions appears in the first section of this article, and sets the analytical stage for the presentation of the conception of the educated person embodied in the Theory of Question Oriented Education (QOE). The Theory of Question Oriented Education is believed to introduce yet another definition of a genuinely educated person, positing that the ability to generate thoughtful questions is the most important characteristic of the educated person. The author submits that, by identifying the basic quality differentiating an educated from an uneducated person as the capacity to generate questions in any domain of knowledge, an additional and alternative conception of the educated person has been added to the educational field. Following the overview, the definition and rationale for the Theory of Question Oriented Education is elaborated upon. The next section introduces a summary of different views of the educated person and categorizes them under four genres. In this section the author also analyses and critiques these different views to further clarify the main features of his proposed conception. An image of the learning process commensurate with this theory (QOE) is presented and discussed in the next section. The learning process is captured in a model called \"Dynamic Learning Model\" (DLM), conceptualizing authentic learning as learning which is spiral and dialectic. Three practical implications of the theory addressed only to practicing teachers will appear in the concluding part of the article. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Maryland Archives, student publications, college catalogues, legislative and other records were searched to provide an overview of the campus culture and leadership at various points in history. Selective fiscal records are reviewed to demonstrate the disparities across campuses in Maryland based on segregated models of the times. Student publications from the 1930s through the 1950s provide a real time account of the notable dignitaries that visited the campus, including Arna Bontemps, Langston Hughes and others. Student publications demonstrate the culture of the day, including activities at a Demonstration School of elementary aged students, 4-H Club and Handicraft Club activities, and student and faculty travel to conventions and meetings. The history demonstrates the growth of major fields of study and advanced course offerings that now include the doctoral degree in educational leadership. The document includes original photos of some of the earlier leaders and current photos of existing chairpersons and the Founding and Acting Deans. This historical records includes many primary documents and is of interest to academicians interested in views of history from historically Black college personnel, fiscal records, and accounts of Bowie State University in legislative records.

Even as we develop the meta-university and other forms of digitally empowered educational globalization, we must maintain the openness of our campuses here in the United States. Our openness to international students, scholars, and faculty members, as well as the openness of scientific inquiry and communication, must be balanced against national security concerns in the face of terrorism. But the lessons of history confirm that openness is a great contributor to the security of our nation and world in the long run, and must be preserved. (Contains 7 footnotes.)",

After a century of leading the world in participation rates in higher education, however, there are strong indications that America's advantage is waning. The academic research enterprise remains relatively vibrant. However, participation and degree attainment rates have leveled off and are showing signs of actual decline in a number of major states with large populations--and this seems to be more than just a bump or short-term market correction. Other competitive nations, and in particular key members of the European Union, along with China, India and other developing economies, are aggressively nurturing their higher education systems, expanding access, and better positioning themselves in the global economy. They have been trying harder, while in the US public funding for higher education has declined. The nation's international and domestic concerns lie elsewhere. In addition to outlining these reasons that America's higher education advantage is waning, this article also discusses the possible consequences.  (Contains 53 notes.)",

In addition to the creation of new campuses, other approaches are capable of giving significant additional capacity as well. Some of these approaches are congruent with academic objectives; others are substantially neutral in that regard; and others probably do lessen the academic experience. A desirable approach is to have new campus sites continually identified, while retaining sufficient capability for alternate means of accommodating enrollment so as to enable continued capacity development in times of budgetary stringency.

This article traces the history of economists' views on the role of education, from Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Alfred Marshall, and Milton Friedman, to present-day debates about the relevance of market economies to higher education policy. Recent developments in higher education policy reflect both the rising strength of market mechanisms in higher education worldwide, and a certain ambivalence about these developments. The author argues that despite the peculiarities of the higher education sector, economic theory can be a very useful tool for the analysis of the current state of higher education systems and recent trends in higher education policy.",

This essay argues that research-intensive public and private universities increasingly have far more similarities than differences in missions, structures, and even financial support. For both, the federal government, despite numerous tensions, remains our indispensable partner. At the same time, the role of state governments toward their public universities has evolved from that of patron to that of partner-sometimes a minor partner financially. Yet at every level-federal, state, and local- governments and universities each consider themselves to be the protagonist having the central role, moral authority, and last word in setting the objective and the course. Despite its complexities and tensions, out of this stew (with philanthropists and the private sector thrown in for good measure), we have forged the greatest system of higher education in the world and we must work hard and effectively to sustain and continuously improve it. We must strive for innovation and excellence, but also nurture broad access to this system and stay true to our fundamental mission of creating opportunity. (Contains 7 notes.)",

Responses given by teachers at a school with a high rate of students who are pregnant and parenting in surveys were compared to the artwork of the students they teach. Art was created by both pregnant/parenting teens and non-pregnant/parenting teens to determine the difference in perception these two groups of teens have of themselves. The purpose of this investigation is to show that even with programs available to pregnant and parenting adolescents, the perceptions these students have of their opportunities neither coincide with the perceptions other students their age have of their own opportunities nor the perceptions the teachers have of these pregnant and parenting students. Adolescent pregnancy remains the number one cause for adolescent females to drop out of school, and an investigation of the perceptions they have of themselves and of their futures may help schools understand how to change this phenomenon and how to improve programs offered to this population.

Ethical educators would benefit from this text because it is a timeless work of art that speaks to past and current educational issues. With the federal 2001 No Child Left Behind mandate to schools across the nation, educators need to be particularly aware of how they plan educate all children under the auspices of the current law. If used as a decision making tool to improve student achievement, the ideas represented in the &quot;Realms of Meaning&quot; could change the future course of education. Philip Phenix writes, &quot;because people differ, no one curriculum suffices for everybody.&quot; (pg. 275) This statement especially speaks to those educators who are involved in curriculum planning and implementation process to find alternative approaches to differentiate special components of the curriculum to increase student achievement in a profound way.",

The document is intended for classroom teachers, resource personnel, administrators and parents. It is one of a series of documents developed to facilitate programming for students in grades 1 to 12 who have special education needs. Other topics in the Essential Components of Educational Programming series include programming for students who are deaf or hard of hearing, programming for students who are blind or visually impaired, and programming for students with behaviour disabilities. The eight essential components listed in this document are contained in the Standards for Special Education, Amended June 2004 (ED491438) and are therefore mandated by Alberta Education. Each component is considered essential to the provision of a comprehensive program. However, the manner in which the components are implemented may be affected by such practical considerations as availability of resources and needs of the particular student. The sample indicators are examples of effective practices that illustrate the implementation of the essential component. The indicators will vary because of the unique strengths and needs of individual students. It is not the intent to list all possible indicators or to require all listed indicators for every student. A glossary of key terms is included. [This document was produced by Alberta Education.]",

The geographical digital divide experienced especially by people on the continent of Africa was clearly expounded. The progress made in each of these areas was identified and well articulated. The paper concluded that this digital divide has raised both national and international concerns needing global collaborations among institutions of higher learning, national governments, and financial institutions in order to close the gap. Narrowing if not closing the gap would enable many people on the globe to be well informed to make prudent contributions to the development and improvement of global knowledge and economy.

        "description":"Institutionalizing organizational change has emerged as an issue among organization researchers and managers alike. Institutionalization of change is derived from change management theory in its emphasis on understanding the roots of organizational success and failure. The field of HRD appears particularly poised to help organizations institutionalize change. The purpose of this study was to identify what HRD interventions are being used to institutionalize organizational change in multinational corporations (MNCs). This paper presents empirical findings on the use of Cascade Training along with other methods, and the nature of significant differences found among companies from the four countries in their use of the HRD interventions.

        "description":"California's loss of capital gains and stock options revenue during the recent economic downturn was one of the worst in the nation, and the resulting fiscal crisis led to reductions in State appropriations to the University of 15% over the past four years, while enrollments grew by 19%. This article examines the effects of this reduction in State funding and outlines the actions taken by the University of California to minimize the impact of these reductions in State funding. Despite sharp increases, student tuition and fee increases offset less than one-third of the total cut. Those additional tuition and fee revenues were, however, targeted and offset much of the impact on instructional programs, though there were large cuts in other areas. The University took steps to streamline administrative processes and to make better use of limited State funds by utilizing technology and leveraging the power of a multi-campus system to minimize the impact on academic support budgets. Nevertheless, the quality of the educational program has been affected, graduate student support levels are below those of the University's competitors, and salaries for both faculty and staff are well below market. In the short run, the University of California seems to have avoided some of the more serious effects of the loss of State funds on the academic program; the long term prospects, however, are less clear.

The Commission was to be a national effort, unprecedented both in scope and in the freedom of its director, Kerr, to guide its research and productivity. Carnegie President Alan Pifer promised substantial funding for five years or more. Working with Pifer, and with Alden Dunham, David Robinson, and others, Kerr initiated a great array of studies and provided recommendations on the most vital issues facing American higher education in the latter part of the twentieth century. This essay reviews the origins of the Commission, its successor organization, the Carnegie Council, and the influence of a number of major reports. The essay also notes the need to revisit the work of the commission and council as a source of ideas relevant today, and suggests that there is a need for a greater national approach to supporting US higher education.",

        "author":["Burdman, Pamela"],
        "description":"Though the rise in college student debt often has been blamed on rising tuition, a radical shift in student financial aid--from a system relying primarily on need-based grants to one dominated by loans--has been equally important. Numerous reports have highlighted the burdens faced by students who borrow large sums, but less is known about students who are averse to borrowing. For these students, the increasing prominence of loans could actually narrow their options and decrease their chances of attending and completing college. Given the increasingly important role of student loans in financial aid packages, perceptions about debt influence the ability of loan programs to achieve their goal of equalizing opportunity for students at all income levels. Based on interviews with students, counselors, outreach professionals, and financial aid directors, as well as a review of relevant research, this discussion paper offers an initial gauge of the debt dilemma and recommends four broad strategies: (1) making more grant money available for low-income and first-generation students, (2) making loan programs more attractive and efficient through income-based repayment strategies, (3) better integrating financial aid awareness into high school counseling, and (4) providing more pathways for students who prefer to attend part-time. Loans are likely to remain a mainstay of federal financial aid programs, so as interest rates begin to rise for the first time in years, foreshadowing higher future payments, the problems faced by students who borrow as well as the barriers confronted by those who are averse to borrowing are only liable to increase.

This fixation tends to be aroused by the rituals of recruitment and retention that take place on all campuses. But when recruitment becomes an exercise in what some economists have called \"the-winner-take-all\" mentality of our culture, departments, and programs can become unhealthy environments. When faculty and administrations insist on the extremely volatile criteria of early promise or current fame in choosing new colleagues, their efforts to build a community of scholars can become an exercise in professional pathology. When they neglect excellent current members of their departments to recruit outsiders at higher pay and richer benefits, they risk alienating their own excellent faculties. The antidote is a wise consideration of the total identity and mission of institutional departments in all recruitment efforts. (Contains 22 notes.)",

        "description":"Digital collaborations are often stymied because institutions of higher education are increasingly divided between two cultures: the culture of knowledge and the culture of information. Campuses primarily remain institutions of knowledge, although practices of information acquisition can no longer be ignored, especially since the advent of networked computing and study with digital texts. Yet the traditional division of labor and the ownership of intellectual property within the academy are threatened by digital collaborations; and the claims of information theory, which is associated with epistemologies of uncertainty and probability, challenge conservative ideologies of university culture. As a result, policies for the development of hybrid instruction and digital archives are often dictated by &quot;Virtualpolitik,&quot; or the Realpolitik of virtual institutions, in lieu of a long-term vision for meaningful institutional change. This paper examines four Internet-based initiatives designed to improve cross-campus teaching and learning in California public universities--MERLOT, CPR, UCWRITE, and SPIDER--and argues that effective programs with lasting legacies take advantage of a &quot;bazaar&quot; rather than a &quot;cathedral&quot; development model and incorporate meaningful &quot;information literacy&quot; objectives that go beyond the mastery of particular terms and tools.

Stewardship of public resources, student achievement or the lack thereof, relationships and \"partnerships\" with business and industry in the area of research, substantial increases in tuition and fees, public perception of wrong-doing in the quality of programs, and allegations of wrongdoing in financial and programmatic areas have all led to calls for greater transparency, accountability, and impartiality. At root, these issues all concern trust. This paper discusses accountability in higher education as well as the need to promote increased public trust, and focuses on the need for a balance between autonomy and accountability. It identifies the drivers for accountability at the international, national, and state levels, and offers new ways of thinking about the relationship between accountability and accreditation processes. Policymakers and educational leaders must address the accountability process in addition to nurturing the public's trust while balancing the interactions among the responsibility of various educational actors, goals, resources, standards, and rewards/sanctions. In providing this emerging view of the issues of accountability and public trust in higher education, the paper is intended to serve as a catalyst for discussion as a means to advance the overall delivery of high quality higher education.

A spate of recent research has resulted in comprehensive and lengthy reviews of surveys of research on student learning; the current model for coping with this information explosion is ever-tighter syntheses and distillations. These \"principles\" could in turn be summarized as a grand meta-principle that might say something like this: \"What we know about student learning is that students who are actively engaged in learning for deeper understanding are likely to learn more than students not so engaged.\" However, what we already know from our own experience, as both learners and teachers, is that people have to find their own answers by working though the pathways to knowledge. Telling people what the \"experts\" know is not likely to result in the kind of deeper learning that we want to encourage. If we are to take learning seriously, we need to know what to look for (through research), to observe ourselves in the act of lifelong learning (self-reflection), and to be much more sensitively aware of the learning of the students that we see before us everyday. At present, I think we are prone to consider research findings as the \"conclusion\" of our investigations into learning. We might do better to think of them as the start of our investigations.",

Philosophers in education have enlightened the field with their expertise and knowledge in the area of their chosen discipline. Phenix (1986) states, that in the past decade educators have shown renewed appreciation for the place of the organized disciplines of knowledge in education. Philosophical reasoning in education is not new. Educational Philosophy is an ongoing and continuous process. Educators possess different philosophical views that cartels to their specific persona.

While the structures of participation vary according to the degree of state regulation and the locus of training, social partner involvement is extensive irrespective of the nature of the regulatory framework and is likely to increase.",

It begins with a review of various theoretical positions on learning including behaviorism, Gestalt theory, cognitive theory, schema theory, connectionist theory, social learning or behavior modeling, social perspective theory, and situated cognition theory. Implications are drawn from these various theories. A theoretical framework is then constructed incorporating these implications, along with suggestions for needed research.

        "description":"This is a long-standing problem in our \"age-graded\" school system. And, it continues to be one of the most contentious issues in public education. Neither grade retention nor social promotion are recipes for narrowing the achievement gap or reducing dropouts. It is time for policy that doesn't \"wait for failure;\" it's time for a policy that doesn't react in ways that end up being more punitive than corrective. This brief provides a quick overview of issues related to grade retention and then frames directions for policy and practice in ways that go beyond retention and social promotion. Appended are: (1) State Policies for Promotion/Prevention; (2) Guides for Practices to Counter the Need for Grade Retention. (Contains 2 exhibits.)

        "description":"After passage of Proposition 209, the University of California began searching for race-neutral admissions criteria that would allow it to minimize drops in enrollment of under represented minorities. Concern for under represented minorities led to several changes in admissions policies, most notably the introduction of comprehensive or holistic review for freshmen admission at all UC campuses. These efforts to identify criteria that would support UC's efforts to maintain a racially and ethnically diverse student body have led to another unexpected development. The Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS), UC's faculty committee charged with overseeing admissions policies, has begun to do more than try to find admissions criteria that can help maintain racial and ethnic diversity. The committee has begun to question all criteria, including criteria that have long been regarded as reflecting high academic achievement. The first criterion that BOARS has questioned is related to the National Merit Scholarship Program. On March 1, 2005, Professor Michael Brown, chair of BOARS, wrote to campus admissions committees asking them to reconsider any preferences they might be giving to National Merit Scholars because BOARS had questions and concerns about the &quot;merits of the National Merit Scholars Program.&quot; This paper describes the questions and concerns that prompted this inquiry.",

The general pattern of findings suggests that higher individual levels of cross-racial interaction have positive effects on students' openness to diversity, cognitive development, and self-confidence. The results also show that even though a student's own level of cross-racial interaction is a more direct and powerful way to realize developmental gains, simply being in an environment where other students are interacting frequently also contributes to students' self-reported development.

Much of the rhetoric of globalists has presented a simplistic analysis of a paradigm shift in higher education markets and the way nations and institutions deliver educational services. This essay provides an analytical framework for understanding global influences on national higher education systems. It then identifies and discusses the countervailing forces to globalization that help to illuminate the complexities of the effects of globalization (including the General Agreement on Trade and Services) and new instructional technologies on the delivery and market for teaching and learning services. Globalization does offer substantial and potentially sweeping changes to national systems of higher education, but there is no uniform influence on nation-states or institutions. All globalization is in fact subject to local (or national and regional) influences. (Contains 4 figures.) [An earlier version of this article was published in Tjeldvoll A. and Zhou F. (ed.)

These changes would build on three major paradigm shifts and experiments in system building in higher education in the United Kingdom since World War II: the creation and subsequent collapse of a binary system of higher education that included both universities and polytechnics; a decrease in governmental funding and an increase in regulations; and the introduction of student fees into the previously exclusively government-funded higher education sector. The Labour government's new White Paper proposes both to increase funding and to diversify the sources, and more controversially, to allow universities to set their own fees. At the same time, it continues to rely on an accountability and regulatory bureaucracy, and incentive funding, to encourage enrollment growth and to expand access to underserved populations.",

In the long term, the university seeks to work with individual students to improve their academic preparation and to expand partnerships with the K-12 public sector. The state's need to educate more of its minority citizens is urgent, however, so in the shorter term the University has focused on three strategies in its admissions process: comprehensive review, Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC), and the Dual Admissions Program (DAP). The paper also discusses the use of standardized tests in judging students' readiness for university-level work, and especially changes to the SAT tests that have come about partly in response to UC policies. The paper concludes by assessing the ongoing debates over racial preferences in college admissions. The University of California Admissions Policy is appended. (Contains 9 footnotes.)",

In the guaranteed loan program, banks lend students money and profit from the interest payments while the government guarantees the loans against default and makes subsidy payments to the banks. In the direct loan system, the government provides low-interest loans directly to students, using borrower interest payments to help cover the costs of the program. There have been numerous audits and investigations of both the direct and guaranteed student loan programs, and in every case the auditors have agreed: Direct lending is much more cost effective. Switching completely to direct lending would save billions of dollars a year. Congress should move all campuses to direct lending and turn the savings over to colleges and states for programs that ensure that all Americans have access to higher education. (Contains 7 notes.)",

Observations and interviews with Chris and his supervisors and mentors provided varied perspectives on his progress. Improvement came during the third year, when a newly-appointed supervisor finally identified and worked to remediate serious gaps in Chris' pedagogical knowledge. Teaching experience, Chris' confidence in his own ability to learn to teach, and an appropriate supervisor match were other important factors in his success. Findings suggest that mentoring a struggling novice may require development of a framework for pedagogical knowledge as well as specific teaching techniques, adherence to basic educational principles, and a substantial investment of time. Further research might provide greater understanding of novices' own voices, of the ways they interpret advice, and of combined factors that influence supervisory relationships.",

These teachers identified common elements of learning from the course, although they shaped and applied those principles in idiosyncratic ways. As Dewey's theory suggests, the course instructors could direct the preservice teachers' learning through structured experiences, but could not control what was learned; the teachers themselves gave meaning to their learning in the course, field experiences, and student teaching. Findings suggest that structured course experiences, along with opportunities for independent practice in authentic situations and easy access to mentors, facilitated reasonable correspondence between what the course instructors believed they taught and what the teachers learned.",

This qualitative study explored relationships between the student teachers' claims and the concepts the course instructors believed they presented.

There has been empirical evidence supporting academic gains related to the Boost-Up program, but there have not been any studies addressing the social/emotional outcomes of the program.

        "description":"Under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001, the administration of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) became mandatory for all states in mathematics and reading for grades four and eight. Under NCLB the stated role and purpose of collecting achievement data from states varies from being a &quot;discussion tool&quot; to a confirmatory examination of states assessment systems. Utilizing the 2003 NAEP results, it is possible to examine state achievement performance in the same prescribed way schools and districts are held accountable for Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) under the guidelines of NCLB. Results are provided in this paper that show states measures of overall AYP as well as AYP measures for state subgroup accountability. A brief illustration with NAEP achievement data is provided on state timelines toward the NCLB goal of 100 percent proficiency by 2014. An alternative approach in calculating AYP that has been suggested is the use of a lower performance level such as Basic rather than Proficient. This alternative methodology of calculating AYP is also examined in relation to state performance on NAEP. This paper does not take a position on the merits or liabilities of the federal law; it examines the use of the most recent NAEP achievement data within the AYP methodology set forth by NCLB.  With the wide variations among state assessment systems, state achievement standards, and state accountability systems the use of the common instrument of NAEP could bring clarity to the national struggle to understand state educational accountability. Appendices show statistical state data on grade 4 mathematics and reading, and grade 8 mathematics and reading. (Contains 9 figures and 9 tables.)",

A training program was evaluated through exploring trainees' perceptions of its influence on their skill development. The findings suggest that while professional training programs may be relevant to trainees' needs for career development and life-long learning, such programs fail to tackle problems specific to a trainee's organization. In particular, it is often hard to integrate generic training ideas into specific workplace settings. (Contains 1 table.) [For complete proceedings, see ED491481.]",

In response to this constraint, the UC has sought to pursue a number of other avenues for promoting the selection and retention of a diverse student body. In this paper we look at how officials and staff within the UC system have sought to develop an alternative rationale for managing the categorical problem of identifying types and classes of applicants along with strategies of action that stay within legally allowable frameworks. We argue that a new framework for organizational action has emerged (a cultural logic) which is made up of a dually ordered system of identity categories and institutional activity categories. We use Galois lattices as a way of unpacking the dynamic emergence of this new organizational logic. (Contains 4 tables, 4 figures, and 12 footnotes.)",

        "description":"As part of the University of California's recent reconsideration of the role of the SAT in admissions, the UC Office of the President published an extensive report, &quot;UC and the SAT&quot; (2001), which examined the value of SAT I Reasoning Test scores, SAT II Subject Test scores, and high school grades in predicting the grade-point averages of UC freshmen (UCGPA), as well as the role of economic factors in predicting UCGPA. The analyses in &quot;UC and the SAT&quot; were based primarily on data that had been aggregated across freshmen cohorts (1996 through 1999) and across UC campuses. In the current study, by contrast, data were analyzed within campuses and cohorts and then summarized. While some of our conclusions are similar to those in &quot;UC and the SAT,&quot; others are not. Like the earlier study, for example, our reanalyses showed that, considered collectively, the SAT II tests required by UC (Writing, Math, and a third test of the applicant's choice) are slightly superior to the SAT I as a predictor of UCGPA. But our reanalyses also revealed considerable variability across campuses and freshman cohorts in the predictive value of high school grades and test scores, which was masked in the earlier analyses. Also, our reanalyses did not support the conclusion in &quot;UC and the SAT&quot; that SAT II scores are &quot;less sensitive&quot; to socioeconomic factors than SAT I scores, an assertion that was often repeated during the SAT debate that took place in 2001 and 2002.

The discussion is illustrated by drawing on case studies of universities in Europe and the United States. It is concluded that the most striking characteristic of the e-learning strategies adopted by universities is their diversity, and inherent characteristic of adaptability in use and flexibility in application. The implicit compatibility with institutional aims suggests that the e-learning strategies universities adopt reflect, rather than influence, institutional ethos and that by virtue of the capacity to adapt to different contexts, e-learning may be more adaptable--and ultimately less threatening--to academic mores than some observers fear.

AP is increasingly emphasized as a factor in admissions, particularly at selective colleges and universities. But while student performance on AP examinations is strongly related to college performance, merely taking AP or other honors-level courses in high school is not a valid indicator of the likelihood that students will perform well in college. These findings suggest that institutions may need to reconsider the use of AP as a criterion in &quot;high stakes&quot; admissions, particularly given the marked disparity in access to AP and honors courses among disadvantaged and underrepresented minority students.

The framework provides an outline of what students should learn through competencies and objectives/benchmarks. Suggested teaching strategies and assessments for those strategies are correlated to the competencies. The &quot;2007 Mississippi Mathematics Framework&quot; replaces the &quot;2000 Mississippi Mathematics Framework.&quot; The content of the framework is centered on the areas of number and operations, algebra, geometry, measurement, and data analysis and probability. Instruction in these areas is designed to expose students to experiences, which reflect the value of mathematics, to enhance students' confidence in their ability to do mathematics, and to help students communicate and reason mathematically. The &quot;2007 Mississippi Mathematics Framework&quot; provides teachers with the systematic progression across grade levels and is written to ensure the development of essential mathematical concepts that students will utilize as they pursue a career or continue their education.",

        "description":"The purpose of this program evaluation was to identify the effects of Small Learning Community (SLC) reforms on school climate, student attitudes and student performance. Eight SLC programs in five Albuquerque high schools were studied for one to four years, depending on each program's date of inception. Data were collected from students, teachers, administrators, and parents using surveys, focus groups, interviews, activity logs and the district's student information system. SLC groups were compared to non-SLC groups within the same schools, controlling for prior academic achievement and demographic variables. Results indicate that SLCs produced statistically significant improvements in school climate, student dropout, attendance and grade completion. SLC students were more likely than non-SLC students to feel visible, safe, engaged and held to high academic standards. They were more likely to earn enough credits to pass to the next grade level, more likely to attend classes, and less likely to drop out of school. Results also showed that faithful implementation of the research-based SLC model yielded the strongest results, and that teacher collaboration and team exclusivity were two keys to success. In conclusion, SLCs can have a significant impact on school climate, student attitudes and students' academic persistence. Schools and districts can maximize success by allocating sufficient time, funding, space, administrative support and other resources that ensure fidelity to the SLC program model.

        "author":["Hsu, Jeng-yih Tim"],
        "description":"Unsuccessful college education often turns our students into book haters who will stop reading as soon as they graduate. The idea of literature circles embraces the concept of &quot;reading for fun&quot; and is intended to create more independent readers and book addicts who will continuously read for the rest of their lives. Pioneers in literacy theories have used several terms like &quot;literature study groups,&quot; &quot;literary peer-group discussions,&quot; and &quot;book club&quot; to capture the small group, student-centered literacy discussion idea. This paper draws mainly on Harvey Daniels' (1994) definition of literature circles and intends to vividly illustrate the major components of literature circles by carefully looking into different reading roles. The presenter discusses the twelve key ingredients of literature circles. Special emphasis is placed on visualizing the procedure for running a literature circle, the eight possible student roles (i.e., 4 required roles--discussion director, literary luminary, connector, and illustrator; 4 optional roles--summarizer, vocabulary enricher, travel tracer, and investigator), and the teacher roles. Next, theories supporting the literature circles are discussed, including Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, Rosenblatt's reader-response theory, reading as a process, reading-writing connection, and independent learning. In addition, the examples of several EFL/ESL teachers who have successfully implemented literature circles in their reading classes are introduced. In the last section, tips on how to smoothly and successfully run a literature-circle-based reading class will be provided. A Literature Circles Role Sheet is appended.

To address this gap in the literature, this Issue Brief provides a descriptive look at the prevalence of arts instruction received by first and third grade public school students in their schools. Using spring 2000 and spring 2002 data from the School Administrator and Teacher Questionnaires of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), this analysis examines public school students' receipt of arts instruction in first and third grade and the changes in weekly arts instruction between these grades. Four areas of the arts are considered in this Issue Brief: (1) music; (2) art; (3) dance or creative movement (hereafter referred to as dance); and (4) theater or creative dramatics (hereafter referred to as theater). For each area of the arts, the prevalence of instruction is measured by whether students worked on lessons or projects in that topic area at least once per week. Measures were also created to examine changes between grades for students who had arts instruction in at least one grade. (Contains 1 table and 1 endnote.)",

The analysis focuses on completions data from 1996-97 and 2001-02 and examines completions at institutions granting awards of associate's degrees and higher. In particular, it looks at the change in the total number of degrees completed in areas of national need between the two years, as well as degree completions in these areas by gender and race/ethnicity. The primary analysis in this E.D. Tab uses data available through the 2001-02 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and available publicly through the online Data Analysis System (DAS). It draws data from the Institutional Characteristics (IC) component as well as from the Completions (C) component and Student Financial Aid (SFA) component. A special qualifying variable for areas of national need was created for this E.D. Tab and is available on the IPEDS DAS. In addition, estimates reflecting student characteristics were drawn from the 1999-2000 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), also available as a DAS.

        "description":"Job satisfaction expresses the extent of match between teachers' expectation of the job, job requirements and the satisfaction derived from their jobs. There seems to be a growing discontentment towards teaching as a result of which standards of education are falling. Teachers are dissatisfied in spite of different plans and programmes which have been implemented to improve their job. Stress has been defined as &quot;the state manifested by the specific syndrome, which consists of all the non-specific induced changes in a biological system.&quot; The causes of stress are many. Stress falls into different groups--physical, environmental, cultural expectations and personal and social expectations. All these indicate stress is always present with the teacher. So a teacher has to cope with these stresses by adopting certain coping skills. The study was carried out on a representative sample of 500 teachers from the primary schools of Kerala state, India (165 male &amp; 335 female). Proportionate stratified sampling technique was employed. Two tools were used to collect the data. The first one was the Scale of Job Satisfaction by Kumar &amp; Kumar (2001) and the second one was Stress Coping Skills Inventory by Bindhu, Aneesh &amp; Gulabi (2005). Both the tools are standardized. The Stress Coping Skills Inventory consists of seven components reactivity to stress, ability to relax, self reliance, pro-active attitude, adaptability and flexibility, ability to assess situation, and resourcefulness. There are 42 items in the inventory. Subjects have to decide how far each statement in the inventory is true in their case. Response can be made in a three point scale as &quot;Always,&quot; &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;Never.&quot; For a positive statement the score given is 3, 2, and 1. Scoring scheme is reversed for a negative statement. Reliability of the test was 0.48 and established the content validity. Differential and correlational analysis were used in the analysis of data. The study revealed that job satisfaction differentiates male and female primary school teachers and  there is positive correlation between job satisfaction and stress coping skills. On the basis of the results obtained, practical suggestions were offered which will be helpful to improve job satisfaction and stress coping skills among primary school teachers.

Reflecting the reality of underachievement in this population, much of the existing research on Cambodian Americans has focused on their academic difficulties, high dropout rates, delinquency, and language barriers. The extant literature examining the relationship between traditional cultural values and academic success for Cambodian American students have yielded conflicting results. Through a Multiple Worlds lens, the present study explored how successful Cambodian American college students perceive traditional cultural values in relation to their past and present school experiences. In addition, this research investigated that support successful transition between Cambodian American students' incongruent family, school and peer cultures. Findings demonstrate that successful Cambodian American students regularly face a number of borders in moving through the different contexts of their daily lives. Family obligation emerged as a significant traditional value that acted as a paradoxical influence in these students' academic lives. Our data suggests that students' supportive school environments in high school and in college were significant for helping them resolve this contradiction and pursue academic success. Implications for practice are discussed. (Contains 3 footnotes.)",

        "description":"The number of learners of English as an international means of communication increases hand in hand with the number of nonnative English-speaking teachers (NNESTs) of English as a Second Language (ESL) and the number of Native English-Speaking ESL teachers (NESTs). At the same time, scholars (Kamhi-Stein, 1999; Liu, 1999; Llurda, 2005) have estimated non-native English speakers to account for 40% to 70% of the North-American student teacher population. However, few studies investigated the working conditions of NESTs and NNESTs at Intensive English Programs (IEP) and the different factors that affect their successes and challenges. This research project thus investigates 1040 ESL students' attitudes towards NESTs and NNESTs, the variables (students' first languages, gender, class subject, level, and expected grade, as well as teachers' native languages) that influenced students' responses, and the effects of time on students' attitudes, with questionnaires completed both at the beginning and at the end of the fall 2005 semester. Online questionnaires also solicited 18 NNESTs and 78 NESTs' self-perceptions about proficiency and teaching skills, as well as 21 IEP administrators' beliefs about, and experiences with NNESTs and NESTs. Results showed that overall, students' attitudes were more positive towards NESTs than towards NNESTs, although students taught by NNESTs held a significantly more positive attitude towards NNESTs in general than students taught by NESTs. Positive attitude towards NESTs and NNESTs increased significantly with time and exposure. Results also showed that students and teachers' first languages, among others, strongly influenced students' responses. Additionally, NNESTs were not necessarily seen as grammar experts but could be esteemed Listening/Speaking teachers. Teachers' responses revealed NNESTs' lack of confidence in their linguistic and teaching skills but also their beliefs that NNESTs' language learning experiences was an asset for ESL students. Finally, administrators also recognized NNESTs' strengths as well as their poor self-confidence. While they did not use nativeness as hiring criteria, they emphasized the importance of linguistics preparation and international awareness, as well as teaching experience.

NPSAS:04 also serves as the base year of data collection for the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS), which will follow a cohort of students from the start of their postsecondary education and collect further data from them in 2006 and 2009. For the first time, NPSAS:04 is being conducted as the student component study of the 2004 National Study of Faculty and Students (NSoFaS:04). The faculty component--the 2004 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:04)--is primarily a separate study, with the exception of institutional sampling and contacting. Historically, there has been considerable overlap in the institutions selected for participation in NPSAS and NSOPF; therefore, institutional sampling and contacting activities for both studies were coordinated in order to minimize response burden on institutions and to realize data collection efficiencies. This report only describes the methodology and findings of the NPSAS:04 field test, which took place during the 2002-03 school year. The NPSAS:04 field test was used to plan, implement, and evaluate methodological procedures, instruments, and systems proposed for use in the full-scale study scheduled for the 2003-04 school year. The methodology and findings of the NSOPF:04 field test are provided in a separate report. Appended are: (1) Technical Review Panel; (2)Data Collection Notification Materials; (3) Student Instrument Facsimile; (4) Computer-Assisted Data Entry (CADE) Facsimile; (5) Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) Training; and (6) CADE Verification Form.

NPSAS:04 is a comprehensive study of financial aid among postsecondary education students in the United States and Puerto Rico that provides information on trends in financial aid and on the ways in which families pay for postsecondary education. NPSAS:04 included important changes from previous NPSAS surveys (conducted in 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, and 2000) in its sample design and collection of data. For example, the current study is the first in the NPSAS series to utilize a web-based instrument for both self- and telephone-administration. Another important change is that NPSAS:04 was designed to provide state-level representative estimates for undergraduate students within three institutional strata--public 2-year institutions; public 4-year institutions; and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions for 12 states that were categorized into three groups based on population size--four large, four medium, and four small: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Nebraska, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, and Texas. These states were chosen for this &quot;demonstration&quot; study from a set of volunteering states that expressed interest and a willingness to support and encourage participation by their institutions. However, sufficient comparability in survey design and instrumentation was maintained to ensure that important comparisons with past NPSAS studies could be made. The following are appended: (1) Technical Review Panel; (2) Sampling Details; (3) Data Collection Notification Materials; (4) Endorsements; (5) Facsimiles; (6) Training Materials; (7) Data-CADE Specifications; (8) Imputations; (9) Analysis Variables; (10) GEM Adjustment Procedure; (11) Nonresponse Bias Analysis; (12) Details of the Bootstrap Variance Estimation; (13) Weighted Analysis Considerations; and (14) Design Effects.

        "description":"The primary aims of this report are to (1) identify the incidence of daily smoking at several time points during the adolescent and young adult years, including the prevalence of new daily smokers relative to repeat daily smokers; (2) identify several specific developmental patterns of smoking; and (3) examine the specific developmental patterns of smoking in relation to various descriptive characteristics. This analysis uses data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), where the smoking behavior of a nationally representative cohort of 1988 eighth-graders was assessed at various time points over a 12-year period (i.e., from about age 14 to age 26). Results show that 6 percent at 8th grade, 12 percent at 10th grade, 17 percent at 12th grade, and one-quarter at the age of about 26 years reported usually smoking one or more cigarettes a day. Using the information obtained about individuals' smoking behavior over the time period, 68 percent were identified as nondaily smokers, followed by teen/young adult smokers (15 percent), and then teen smokers (9 percent) and late-onset smokers (8 percent). Bivariate and multivariate analyses are used to examine these developmental patterns in relation to individual demographic characteristics, family demographic characteristics, and various education-related characteristics. It was found, for example, that adolescent smoking is associated with lower academic achievement, which is consistent with prior research. A technical appendix is included.

It can be used by researchers to adjust district-level finance data at different levels in order to make better comparisons across geographic areas. The CWI was developed by Dr. Lori L. Taylor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service, Texas A&amp;M University and William J. Fowler, Jr. at NCES. Dr. Taylor's research was supported by a contract with the National Center for Education Statistics. The complete description of the research is provided in the NCES Research and Development &quot;A Comparable Wage Approach to Geographic Cost Adjustment&quot; (NCES 2006-321). This documentation describes four geographic levels of the CWI, which are presented in four separate files. These files are the school district, labor market, state, and a combined regional and national file. The school district file provides a CWI for each local education agency (LEA) in the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) database. For each LEA there is a series of indexes for the years 1997-2004. The file can be merged with school district finance data, and this merged file can be used to produce finance data adjusted for geographic cost differences. This file also includes four agency typology variables. The additional files allow for similar geographic cost adjustments for larger geographic areas. NCES has sponsored the development of other geographic adjustment indexes in the past; the latest was for the 1993-94 school year. The following are appended: (1) Record Layout and Descriptions of Data Elements: NCES District CWI Data File; (2) Record Layout and Descriptions of Data Elements: NCES Labor Market CWI Data File; (3) Record Layout and Descriptions of Data Elements: NCES State CWI Data File; (4) Record Layout and Descriptions of Data Elements:  NCES Regional CWI Data File; (5) Glossary; and (6) Frequencies and Ranges.

        "description":"For about two years the Rochester City School District has eliminated much of the teachers' mandatory staff development time. In years past students would be released almost an hour early once a week to create time for staff development. Due to such issues as low test scores, numerous retirements, and many newly adopted reform programs the city school district felt it was necessary to create additional time for staff development. Unfortunately, much of the time set aside for in-services was monopolized by school reform programs such as America's Choice. With teacher expectations growing so is the need for professional development. This document offers numerous approaches to offering quality professional development to staff.

        "description":"This report examines the feasibility of implementing a student unit record system to replace the student-related components that currently are based on aggregate institution-level data collected as part of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The feasibility study was initiated by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), a part of the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) within the Department of Education (ED), in response to renewed interest within the postsecondary education community for more accurate measures of net price and graduation rates, especially measures that take into  account institutional mission and student mobility. This interest parallels a growing congressional desire to hold postsecondary institutions accountable for student outcomes. The feasibility study was conducted between October and December 2004. As this report has outlined, a central question for a UR system is &quot;Could it be done?&quot; Have the information technologies and infrastructures at the campus and state levels matured, could the current IPEDS web?based reporting system be adapted to a UR system, and would there be adequate technical and legal protections in place at IES/NCES? The report has addressed some of the technical and system problems associated with the design and development of a new IPEDS UR system. At the technical level, a UR system could be done at most institutions given time for implementation. The following are appended: (1) Technical Review Panels; and (2) Estimates of Burden.

The goal of the experiment was to test the effectiveness of various levels of incentives in gaining increased initial cooperation, refusal conversion, and overall unit response rates. Approximately 79,000 telephone numbers were included in the experiment. The results of the experiment indicate that small cash incentives, used during initial contact stages of the interview process (the Screener stage), can be effective in improving unit response, at least for NHES collections.

Participation rates are defined here as the proportion of 18- to 24-year-olds who are enrolled in or have completed postsecondary education. Over this time period, the participation rates of young women and of young Whites outpaced that of their male and minority counterparts, so that by 2003 young women had a higher participation rate than young men (reversing the pattern in 1974) and the 1974 gaps in participation rates favoring young Whites over Hispanics grew larger. In 2003, the gender gaps in participation were not significantly different across racial/ethnic groups, nor were racial/ethnic gaps different across gender groups. Moreover, the 10-percentage point gender gap in 2003 was smaller than the racial/ethnic gaps between Whites and Blacks (15 percentage points) and between Whites and Hispanics (23 percentage points).

The report shows that the majority of students (60 percent) were enrolled at the master's level. Seventy-three percent of all graduate and first-professional students received some type of aid (grants, loans, assistantships, or work-study), and the average amount received by aided students was $15,100. Aid patterns varied across programs, however. For example, doctoral students were more likely than others to receive grant aid (55 percent versus 38 percent of master's students and 41 percent of first-professional students), while first-professional students were the most likely to borrow (78 percent versus 40 percent of master's students and 30 percent of doctoral students).

        "description":"The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate teachers' perceptions of administrators' contribution to their teaching and learning by identifying those administrator attributes and behaviors that promote learning. The study incorporated individual studies by 10 doctoral students, in a doctoral research class project. Each researcher selected two teachers from a K-12 school. Six researchers chose elementary schools and six chose secondary schools. The 10 researchers designed the research and collected the data as described in the class assignment with interviews, self-anchoring scale, and a rank-order activity. The interviews followed a protocol of two sets of six open-ended questions; each participant's answers were audio taped during each session and the tapes were later transcribed and coded for themes. The study identified seven overarching themes: (1) positive support, personal regard--caring, (2) trust and respect--freedom, does not micromanage, (3) high work ethic, (4) leadership--provides direction, (5) integrity, (6) open mindedness, and (7) accessible and approachable. These themes emerged as attitudes and behaviors perceived by teachers as contributing to their teaching and learning. The study showed that good character promotes great leadership and administrators must constantly provide and support a positive environment to promote teaching and learning. In addition, the results indicate that teachers' performance in the classrooms is closely related to the administrators' support, trust, respect, high work ethic, and leadership. Generally, the participating teachers made more positive comments about administrators than negative and over 90% of the teachers viewed administrators positively; it is fair to say that administrators, in general, do promote learning. The following are appended: (1) Rank Order Activity; and (2) Self-Anchoring Scale. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"The Hong Kong Government first introduced school-based management (ABM) to the education profession in 1991, but little attention has been paid on the role of teachers in school reforms. Under SBM, teachers are key players in determining school policies and practices. It is believed that teachers' dedication and performance are the most important factors in determining the quality of school education. This research paper represents an exploratory investigation of school teachers' perceptions of teacher empowerment in the context of Hong Kong. The research questions that guided this study were: (1) how do the teachers perceive and understand the relationship between teacher empowerment and SBM, and (2) how do the teachers perceive the essential conditions necessary for teacher empowerment? A questionnaire survey was adopted to collect the required data. The teachers' perceptions were assessed through a written survey consisting of 37 statements of which 14 statements concerning SBM, the empowerment of teachers, and the relationships between SBM and empowerment. The other 23 statements were set to tape the respondents' opinion on their work and working environment with the hope that this would reveal their attitudes towards the essential conditions for empowerment. From the research findings, it is evident that the teacher respondents only had a rather superficial knowledge of SBM and the relationship between SBM and teacher empowerment. Moreover, they only had a weak understanding of teachers' role under SBM and rather resisted to accept the new roles as discussed in the SBM literature. However, it is quite encouraging that certain favorable conditions for empowerment at the teacher level did exist as reflected by the respondents' opinions towards their work and working environment. The following are appended: (1) Survey Statements; and (2) The Contents of Teacher Empowerment as Written on the Education an Manpower Bureau's Website. (Contains 9 tables.)",

        "description":"The Hong Kong Government first introduced school-based management (SBM) to the education profession in 1991. The principal is a pivotal factor in fostering an environment for change. SBM and teacher empowerment calls for new modes of leadership: teachers lend their expertise, and principals become facilitators rather than directors. The purpose of the study as reported on the research paper was to examine the principals' perceptions and understanding of teacher empowerment. Secondly, it was also aimed at looking for the essential conditions at the administrator level which are necessary for teacher empowerment.  A questionnaire survey was adopted to collect the required data. The principals' perceptions were assessed through a written survey consisting of 34 statements of which 14 statements concerning SBM, the empowerment of teachers, and the relationships between SBM and empowerment. The other 20 statements were set to tape the respondents' opinion on their work and working environment. As supported by the survey findings, the responding principals were characterized by their open-mindedness and acceptance towards SBM in a general sense. Though the respondents had a good knowledge of SBM, they held a less confident attitude towards teachers' role in decision making. With regard to the essential conditions for empowerment at the administrator level, the findings are also rather positive.  It is highly recommended that practitioners should make use of those favorable conditions when turning the concept of teacher empowerment into practice.

The study examined the differences among distance learning and traditional learning environments. Several factors were compared to determine the differences: student satisfaction, peer relationships, faculty motivation, faculty load, and resource support. The study applied a mixed-methods design, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, both descriptive and comparative in design. A questionnaire instrument was used to collect data concerning the differences among the three different learning environments from the students' perspectives. Qualitative interviews and observations were conducted to identify factors that contribute to the differences among the three different learning environments from the faculty members' perspectives. Findings from the study indicate that student satisfaction and peer relationships are significantly related to the learning environments. Faculty members have different motivations and workloads in different learning environments and feel that the tenure/promotion standard is not well defined and only universal standards apply for all faculty members. There is still no standard to evaluate the effectiveness of distance learning educators.",

A preference for seeking help from peers appears to be inversely related to their homework intrinsic interest. Preservice teacher with a positive attitude toward help seeking are those who prefer to delay gratification, have high self-esteem, and low tendency to engage in a self-handicap behavior. Educational implications are discussed. The following are appended: (1) Homework Intrinsic Interest, Homework Self-Efficacy Beliefs, and Homework Self-Regulation; and (2) Activity References.",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to depict a model of the ethical drivers of the implementation of instructional technology. The model is meant to be a starting point for institutions as they initiate, update or implement instructional technology. A major assumption underlying the paper is that a consideration of ethics is lacking in the planning process for instructional technology. Instructional technology is defined as the intentional use of hardware, software, and &quot;net-ware&quot; to communicate and foster discourse related to the content of a discipline. A brief case history is used as a basis for explicating a taxonomy of ethical drivers of the implementation of instructional technology. The taxonomy depicts three levels of ethical drivers: service to the individual good, service to the institutional good and the commitment to the universal good as interrelated in an organizing heuristic. Nested within these three levels are a series of dichotomies which represent  &quot;decision points&quot; for institutions and individuals: whether to base implementation on &quot;high&quot; ethics or &quot;low&quot; ethics. Specific questions are presented based on the taxonomy that institutions can utilize to assess the &quot;ethical environment&quot; and to foster improvement in that environment. It is concluded that without such a framework, the ethical environment is said to be more responsive to personal agendas, institutional image or superficial considerations in the implementation of instructional technology. &quot;A Taxonomy of Ethical Drivers of the Implementation of Instructional Technology[C]&quot; appears at the end of the paper.

What contributions were made to adult education theory and practice by three early Chautauquan leaders: John Vincent, Lewis Miller, and William Rainey Harper? How did they handle certain administrative tasks? This article briefly introduces the reader to the Chautauqua Institution that then became the Chautauqua Movement. It will also explore the movement's role and founders' contributions in defining what adult education is today. The early leaders of this popular education movement also called upon not only their instructional genius but also their administrative, managerial, and business acumen to ensure the success of the Chautauqua Institution in providing educational opportunity to an increasing number of adults. Three specific administrative duties of these early adult educators are examined and then likened to the responsibilities of today's educators: (1) overseeing finances; (2) handling rewards; and (3) responding to competition. The authors' intent is to (re)introduce today's educators to some of the Chautauqua contributions made to adult education theory and practice while also likening their relevant administrative practices to today's adult education programs.",

        "author":["Walker, Christopher J."],
        "description":"In light of the Supreme Court's decision this Term in &quot;Schaffer v. Weast,&quot; this Note analyzes the current state of special education law and argues that parents, attorneys, and advocates should look beyond the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to Section 504 in the post-&quot;Schaffer&quot; public school. This Note shows how these two standards operate in the context of state special schools for the blind and deaf. A state-by-state survey of thirty states' special school admission policies and practices reveals the IDEA's limitations and Section 504's potentially complementary role. Although other works have briefly compared the IDEA and Section 504, this Note is the first post-&quot;Schaffer&quot; comparison and also the first to use a specific policy context to demonstrate how the two statutes interact and complement each other; it is also the first published study on the exclusion of multi-disabled students from state special schools. As the state special school context illustrates, Section 504 is a powerful, yet oft-neglected, complement to the IDEA. Whereas the IDEA focuses on adequate access to a free appropriate public education (FAPE), Section 504 emphasizes equal treatment within federally funded programs. This Note advocates that policymakers and special education attorneys understand how to utilize both Section 504 and the IDEA in order to make sure that no child is left behind or otherwise excluded from educational opportunities solely on the basis of a disability. This understanding is particularly important in the post-&quot;Schaffer&quot; public school. Appended is: State-by-State Survey Results. (Contains 321 footnotes.)",

However, the research on gifted enrichment programs rarely leads to instructional interventions for culturally diverse students. The purposes of this study were: (a) to propose an ecology enrichment summer program for gifted students from mainstream and diverse cultural backgrounds, and (b) to investigate the learning effects of this enrichment program on the multicultural groups. The participants consisted of 31 elementary intellectually gifted students from Jungli city (urban), rural area, and aboriginal tribes in Taoyuan County, Taiwan. The 3-day enrichment program focused on role models, social interaction, brainstorming, multicultural atmosphere, and adding multi-sensory learning of ecology that could expand the regular curriculum in school. Data analysis used in this study included the repeated-measures t-tests and analysis of covariance. The results indicated that overall participants' knowledge on ecology improved significantly after the enrichment activities. Likewise, there were significant knowledge differences between pre- and posttest scores for the three groups. Nevertheless, no significant difference in knowledge performance was found regardless of the status of cultural background. In addition, interview data revealed that mainstream students gained more multicultural experiences while culturally diverse students increased awareness of their culture. (Contains 4 tables.)

        "description":"Presented here are guidelines and resources to aid in the use of arts and literature to enhance and enliven religious education. Eight guidelines are suggested: (1) the values of communion, that is, the right relationship between God, neighbor and self, unity in pluralism and the dignity of the human person as an adopted child of God should be seen as core values; (2) the social psychological developmental approach to faith and an emphasis on the spiritual and moral life of young people should guide our selection of resources; (3) the works of Jesuit theologian, Father Avery Dulles, should be considered as guidelines; (4) E. D. Hirsch, Jr.'s Core Knowledge Foundation can be a guide to attaining cultural and religious literacy in a multicultural society; (5) recognition should be  made of the contribution of women to arts and literature; (6) the catechetical approach to the use of arts and literature can enliven the message; (7) a story or parable has the potential to bring forth understanding and insights of which the child was unaware; (8) and emphasize positive and healthful ecumenical, interfaith, and science/faith relationships. A description of resources for grades K-8 that adhere to these guidelines concludes the paper. (MT)",

        "description":"A facet of the construction of children's theory of mind is examined in a study with a two-fold purpose: to investigate whether story scenarios of typical social interaction could facilitate young children's recognition of others' false beliefs, and to study how children's concepts of moral judgment might be influenced by the recognition of a character's false beliefs. Seventeen preschoolers, ages 3-5, at a midwestern university campus day-care center were read stories about children doing familiar things in familiar settings, wherein the protagonist did not know by whom the actions were performed or to what intent. Afterward, the preschoolers were asked to make moral judgments and explanations about the stories. The results corroborate previous research, indicating that  3-year-old children tend to have difficulty conceptualizing how others may have a false belief, while 4- and 5-year-olds were more accurate in recognizing that the protagonist would have a false belief. Other differences between the age groups were also noted. Results suggest that stories, especially moral stories, may be a useful tool in helping children think about other people's perspectives and how people can make judgments when they do not have all the information.

Needs assessment, financial support, licensing, staff hiring and training are all important factors that need to addressed in the start up and running of such a program. The establishment of an intergenerational program at a facility of this type is intended to draw elderly residents out of seclusion and isolation and to make it possible for the children to benefit from the residents' love and affection. Mutual activities and interaction promote a fresh and unique understanding between the two age groups in an atmosphere of happiness and compassion. An onsite child care center helps recruit and retain employees  with child care needs, while the nursing home atmosphere takes on a personal, friendlier, and more family-like tone. The program has a positive influence on children's perceptions of the elderly, of disabilities, and of nursing homes, as well as providing the elderly with an atmosphere of revitalized interest and social enrichment.

        "description":"Following a model suggesting that parental role construction fills specific functions in the parental involvement process (Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler, 1995; in press), this study examined parents' role construction as it relates to children's schooling. A sample of 74 parents of public elementary school children participated in focused interviews about their involvement ideas and activities. Interview transcripts were analyzed for three components of role construction: (1) parents' values, beliefs, goals, and expectations related to their children's development and education; (2) parents' ideas about their responsibilities and reported behaviors in day-to-day education; and (3) parents' ideas about their responsibilities and reported behaviors related to major decisions in the  course of the child's education. Data were also gathered on parents' sense of efficacy in helping their children succeed in school, teacher ratings of parent effectiveness in helping the child, and child achievement. Analyses of over 9,000 coded interview statements suggested systematic patterns of links between the values and behavioral components of role construction, between components of role construction and measures of parental efficacy, and teacher-rated parental effectiveness and child achievement. Cluster analyses revealed varied patterns of role construction associated with higher and lower child achievement.

Urie Bronfenbrenner's theories on the effects of physical environment on children provided a conceptual foundation during the observation of Christy, a student at Lawrence School in Brookline, Massachusetts. The focus of the observations was on adult and peer modeling, as well as the effects of structure and positive reinforcement. Christy's behavior and attitude improved when she acquired a friend, a positive effect of peer modeling. Differences in behavior between regular classes and &quot;specials&quot; (gym and music) were attributed to differences in structure, teacher/student relationship, and individual versus group goals. Christy was  regarded as a &quot;gray&quot; child, that is, one who would not demand attention due to behavior or attitude and therefore could be overlooked, underappreciated, or left on her own for advancement. The conclusion drawn from these observations is that &quot;gray&quot; children do better in a structured environment and that extra help in a classroom provides a nurturing atmosphere that is beneficial to such children.

        "description":"This paper examines the controversial problem of the availability of and access to computers, training, and technology, and the availability of and access to all types of learners. Technologies must be designed with diverse learners in mind in order to fully realize their capacity and contribution to the field of education. If the need for universal access is ignored, technology will further exclude some learners. The paper suggests four principles of universal design for digital media: (1) allow for multiple representations of information; (2) provide for multiple means of expression and control; (3) provide customizable support and challenge; and (4) allow customizable content. The paper also describes the activities of the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) program,  which is designed to ensure that computers do not create further barriers for the learners they are intended to assist, and that computer design and implementation address computers' potential for learners with disabilities and others who have been traditionally excluded. The CAST project assumes that adults who become successful learners will model the learning that fosters success in their children, and that use of early and pre-literacy software will support their children's emerging literacy. The project couples training of parents with the training of teachers. (Contains 30 references.) (SD)",

Advocates for alternative assessment believe that the new tasks should be redesigned to more closely resemble real learning tasks. Portfolio assessment encourages an integration between assessment and instruction and results in several positive educational outcomes. Portfolios represent students' learning in a variety of ways, including depth, breadth, and change over time. With portfolios, the assessment activities and classroom activities can occur throughout the school day. Portfolio assessment can provide educators with an assessment system that includes multiple measures taken over time to create a complete picture of student achievement. The paper describes a portfolio assessment program at a Maryland  elementary school, including requirements for implementation, staff training, involvement and support of parents, stages of portfolio assessment use, home-school connections, and a celebration of the year-long commitment to using portfolio assessment. The program placed particular emphasis on parent participation at early morning coffees and afternoon teas, parental commitment to the program, and parental involvement and training in the portfolio assessment process.

The Activities Participation Scale was devised, based on activities listed by college students that they remembered doing when they were 5 through 8 and 9 through 12 years old. All subjects indicated on the scale the frequency of  engagement in activities in the areas of sports, dance, camp, music, work, family activities, church related activities, other structured activities, and other unstructured activities. Findings indicated that: (1) participation in activities overall increased with age to a greater extent in the successful group than in the comparison group; (2) when required school activities were eliminated in the comparison groups, the total percentage of participants in sports was lower than in the successful group; (3) creative activities were indicated less by the comparison groups than by the successful group; (4) television viewing and video games were indicated by more male comparison group participants; and (5) females were more likely than males to participate in a greater variety of activities.

This Kids Count report explores critical issues about information technology and children's literacy, education, and intellectual development. The report explains some of the underlying issues involving information technology and children such as poverty, literacy, and equal access; examines the importance of basic phone service and how more low income children and families can achieve access to telephones; discusses recent changes in universal service (i.e., policies that ensure that everyone has access to affordable telecommunications technology) due to actions by the Federal Communications  Commission; and explores disparities in Internet access by income, and the role of schools, libraries and other public institutions in addressing those disparities. Suggestions and resources are offered to children's advocates about how to become involved in policy decisions about information technology. (JPB)",

This paper describes a program developed by North Shore Head Start in Beverly, Massachusetts and CAST (Center for Applied Special Technology) in Peabody, Massachusetts. The Salem Family Learning Center provides computer training and access for parents and teachers, training Head Start parents and teachers along with K-3 teachers. This training and access allows parents to use computers in ways that support their children's learning while increasing their own learning, and also forges connections between parents and teachers that ease the transition to  school. Along with computer training and drop-in access to computers, the Center offers a range of family support services that include STEP training and AA meetings. After describing the program's history, how it works, and who it serves, the paper discusses plans to expand such sites to form a national network of Family and Community Literacy Centers. Plans include the creation of an accessible computer network to link sites and resources, major program goals, and how the goals will be measured. (EV)",

Classrooms were grouped as grades K-1 and 2-3. This report includes all the formative evaluation data collected throughout the implementation of this project, Fall 1994 to Spring 1997, as well as summative data collected at the end of the project. The purpose of this evaluation was to document the extent to which the project accomplished its primary goals: to create a local learning community based on technology in order to acquire and apply knowledge about multiage grouping, and to moderate the electronic exchange of information about multiage grouping locally, nationally, and  internationally. Data from multiple sources were collected and analyzed, including classroom observations, teacher interviews, teacher surveys, and teacher reflection journals. It was determined that multiage grouping was successfully established with the assistance of technology, but that practical assistance and continuous support were needed to maintain multiage grouping patterns. While developmental appropriateness improved after the first year, the emphasis was found to be more on technology than curriculum, and a need for integrating technology into constructivist teaching practices was found. There was a continued need for implementing technology to help it facilitate teaching, learning, and professional development. (JPB)",

This paper discusses data collected from students enrolled in an early childhood Master's degree course on the topic of transcendence in teacher-learner relationships. Data consists of journal writings, class inquiry, and class discussions completed during a Teacher-Learner Relationships course. Characteristics of transcendent relationships are identified, including mutual benefits for both relators and how frequently such relationships have positive impact. The implications of such relationships are discussed, as is  their significance for learning scenarios that otherwise may be crippled by teacher-learner alienation, and learner non-engagement and non-ownership of the learning process. By exploring and analyzing the stories of those who have enjoyed transcendent relationships, the paper identifies: the qualities and characteristics indicative of transcendent atmospheres and interactions, how transcendence in teaching-learning relationships has been invited and facilitated, how learning has been broadened and enhanced within the context of transcendence, how transcendent relationships have facilitated the development of learning communities, and how transcendent phenomena affects relators.

The study involved low income English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic parents whose children were considered high-risk students. The primary goal of the program was to enhance the educational achievement of children and youth through encouragement of parental involvement in the education of high-risk student populations. A target group of seven parents participated in either an English-speaking or Spanish-speaking group, both of which met for six sessions. The theoretical foundation for the sessions' content was based on Joyce L. Epstein's model of six types of  involvement necessary to construct a bridge between school and the family. Conducting parent-involvement training in Spanish was a key element to the success of the program. Parents were able to gain empowerment, communication, and advocacy skills by being allowed to speak about their childrens' education in their native language and in a peer-group environment. Lack of Spanish-language translation in PTA meetings and other examples of interaction between family and school were identified as hindrances to parental involvement. A follow-up project was also implemented to enhance the previous training. (An appendix lists the program agendas for each of the six sessions. Contains 11 references.) (JM)",

To examine the unique effects of violence on children's cognition, this study compared the academic performance and conflict levels of two groups of children, ages 6 to 12, and their mothers: those living in battered women's shelters and those in homeless shelters. Seventy-three families (113 children) from battered women's shelters and 55 families (82 children) from homeless shelters completed a variety of tests including the Conflict Tactics Scale, the General Health Questionnaire and the Child Behavior checklist. The children completed the Wide Range Achievement Test, the Digit  Scan, and the Children's Locus of Control Scale. Few significant differences were found among the children's test results; in addition, the results were similar for homeless shelter children with no violence in their histories and for those with past exposure to violence (not within the past year). The prediction that extreme family violence would lead to extremely poor school performance also was not supported. Furthermore, when families were retested 10 months after leaving the battered women's shelter, no changes were found in children's cognitive performance. Although children in shelter situations do experience school difficulties, the data demonstrate that school performance is not uniquely affected by family violence. (Contains 12 references.) (CH)",

        "description":"The systemic reform exemplified by the Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1990 (KERA) requires the coupling of top-down state mandates with bottom-up advocacy and leadership. This research on an Eastern Kentucky school district details the dynamics at the district's main high school, as people struggle to build both a community of learners within the school and bridges for meaningful community participation in the school and district. A key focus of the work is the linkages between youth and adult disengagement, which are contextualized within local-local and local-state balances of power. Historically, Appalachia has been viewed as backward and in need of modernization, consequently, curricula are not relevant to Appalachian needs or world view. Alienation and disengagement arise  from the resultant pattern of past failure, the expectation of continued failure, and the feeling that schools are no longer a community institution since the demise of local schools. Endemic poverty results in the school system being used as a source of good jobs controlled by the local elite, rather than a source of education for children. Thus, concerns about education are viewed as personal attacks on the power elite which invite retaliation. Pervasive distrust of the State, and &quot;outsiders&quot; in general, reinforces disengagement. Site-based decision making, superintendent screening committees, and state-level legal recourse provided by KERA offer previously disengaged people new opportunities for public leadership, yet change is only acceptable to the extent that it does not define  eastern Kentucky cognitive frameworks and social-political relations as &quot;problems&quot; to be solved by &quot;flatlanders.&quot; (TD)",

In contrast, there were only 16 referrals for every 100 students in the rural schools. However, rural schools reported more problems with classroom disruption and fighting, while urban schools reported more problems with tardiness. In addition, rural schools initiated more calls to parents, set up more conferences with administrators and teachers, and contacted police and county authorities more frequently than urban schools.

In fall 1990, the University of North Dakota (UND) College of Nursing received funding to increase the number of nurses providing health care to Indian people. In 1992, Recruitment/Retention of American Indians into Nursing (RAIN) became one of three Quentin N. Burdick Indian Health Programs at UND. RAIN aims to recruit American Indians into UND baccalaureate and master's nursing programs and to provide services to American Indian students to foster self-confidence and success. To further these goals, the program recruited American Indian staff members, established support networks within the university, and planned activities to increase awareness of Indian culture among faculty and students. Indian community  support and involvement included an Indian advisory board, direct communication with tribes in the target area, recruitment activities on reservations, and other activities. The program's conceptual framework is based on Tinto's model of retention, which argues that retention is more a function of institutional experience than pre entry attributes and that students' academic and social integration are essential to retention. Since the inception of the RAIN program, American Indian admission and graduation rates for the UND College of Nursing have increased steadily.

        "author":["McCormack, Maureen"],
        "description":"This essay presents an ethnographer's thoughts on the failure of educational reform following a 4-month observation of a school superintendent and her staff. The educational reform involved implementation of Sizer's model--the Coalition for Essential Schools--in a small, progressive, wealthy school district. The district consisted of a K-12 school serving approximately 300 students with 27 staff. With very high per-pupil funding, the school had a principal and a superintendent, advanced technology in all classes, and a large budget for in-service activities. Commitment to the Coalition for Essential Schools model means commitment to democratic reform. However, the superintendent held to the traditional authoritarian structure, even though smallness offered a unique opportunity  for democratic community organization. Ethnographic analysis suggested that hubris was the tragic flaw preventing reform. Hubris prevents an individual from entertaining information that is unflattering or critical and lessens empathic involvement with others. A brief review of the early history of professional school administration reveals a defensive response to public criticism, foundations in industrial management that were antithetical to democratic ideals, and a belief in the expertise of administrators as superior to that of teachers. The administrator under observation lashed out at teachers that resisted her goals, dismissed a consultant that advised respect for teachers, and avoided or misinterpreted literature dealing with democratic reforms. Concluding thoughts reflect on the  role of moral authority in leadership and the future of educational leadership as a profession. (SV)",

The first section of the report overviews the history of the JOM program established through the Act of April 16, 1934. The goal of this legislation was to improve American Indian and Alaska Native education by increasing parental involvement. The act put JOM program funds into the general fund and local control of public school districts. However, in 1970 the Bureau of Indian Affairs phased out JOM from this funding source and converted the funding agreements to supplemental status. Since then JOM programs have experienced funding problems and lack of support from Congress. In 1994, the first JOM National Conference was held in Denver, Colorado, and the National  Johnson-O'Malley Association was established, comprising representatives from tribal governments, tribal elders, Indian education committees, parents, students, educators, and administrators. The 1995 JOM conference held in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was attended by over 400 people. The remainder of the report highlights conference proceedings, including workshops and work sessions, program cochairs' reports, resolution committee report, and a chronology of association activities during 1995.

        "description":"This thesis examines the ways in which rural schools support or undermine rural community viability in the United States. Beginning in the late 19th century, the diverse people of the United States came under the power of a single ideology of modernization and the superiority of urban culture. This ideology has resulted in the American transition from a rural people who labored on the land to an industrialized people compelled to wander from place to place in search of work in the industrial artifice. Such lack of connection to place has had negative impacts on the environment and on the viability of rural communities. As part of the story, schools have produced and reproduced human, cultural, and social capital; supported the ideology of &quot;progress&quot;; and promoted the departure of  rural youth to urban opportunities. The history and present circumstances of three rural groups--the Old Order Amish, the Menominee Nation, and rural Appalachians in West Virginia--illustrate how events of the national rural-to-urban transition played out locally and how schools continue to impact community viability in terms of cultural, social, human, ecological (or natural), and financial capital. Meaningful reform of rural schools requires greater understanding of the local context in which they are situated and increased attention to learning to live well in a rural place.

        "description":"Based on background research and information submitted at a public hearing in Bismarck, North Dakota, on December 13, 1991, this report addresses the extent to which Native American students are treated equally in North Dakota special education programs. It was found that in some schools and special education units, Native American students in special education far exceeded their proportion in the total student population. Statistics reinforce beliefs of special education personnel and others that the placement of some Native American students in special education programs results from questionable placement procedures and from the misunderstanding and misinterpretation of socioeconomic, linquistic, and cultural factors. Allegations were also made that racial prejudice was a  factor in some placement decisions. Corrective action is urged to assure that evaluation and placement procedures use valid criteria and consider only nondiscriminatory factors. Achieving this objective requires inplementation of a more comprehensive and detailed data collection system, more meaningful parent participation in placement procedures, and reassessment and revision of the training of teachers and program administrators. Reporters recommend selective review of North Dakota schools and school districts to determine compliance with the Education for All Handicapped Children Act and other statutes requiring nondiscrimination. Data tables present information for North Dakota and for Bismarck public schools on enrollments and special education placements, school personnel, and  expenditures and revenues. Appendices list North Dakota Special Education Administrative Units and detail Native American enrollment in North Dakota schools for 1991-92. (SV)",

        "description":"A study examined experiential education programs in terms of how they developed participants' personal agency, sense of belonging, and levels of competence. Personal agency empowers students to become change agents in their lives and communities; sense of belonging enables participants to see themselves as members of a community with rights and responsibilities; and developing competence involves learning new skills, acquiring knowledge, and applying what was learned. Research sites were selected that had institutional norms compatible with the principles of experiential education and offered multicultural populations of inner-city youth ample opportunity to gain exposure to the organization (usually several years). Sites included a professionally operated newspaper staffed  almost entirely by youth, a performing arts center located in the heart of an inner-city neighborhood, a local chapter of a national organization with the mission of empowering girls and young women, and an organization staffed mostly by teenagers and young adults serving youth infected or affected by the HIV virus. Data included observations of organizational activities over a 10-week period, informal and formal interviews with youth and staff, and products created at the sites. The remainder of the report summarizes normal everyday events at these organizations; documents how the organizations are effective in promoting agency, belonging, and competence among participants and staff; and includes information on sponsoring organization, student population, project goals, and program  components.

        "description":"A collaborative parent-community-school (PCS) model facilitates the involvement of disadvantaged and minority parents, community leaders, and community organizations in educational improvement activities, with a focus on at-risk children and youth in high-risk communities. PCS has a more comprehensive agenda than parent participation, and addresses problems and issues not directly related to school personnel and property. An important feature is the &quot;center of activity&quot;--an accessible community place that serves as a neutral zone and &quot;greenhouse&quot; to nurture parent confidence and trust; equalize power; and allow full expression of parent, community, and school concerns. Case studies describe the informal and formal implementation of the PCS model in three minority disadvantaged  neighborhoods in West Virginia and Virginia. Lessons learned from these projects relate to the implications of social and cultural differences, newfound leadership power and community conflicts, communication across barriers of difference, and lack of trust between school and community. The selection of Haywood County, Tennessee, as a demonstration site for the PCS model is described. A preliminary survey revealed that elementary teachers and parents differed significantly in attitudes about educational quality at the elementary school. To avoid the development of debilitating defense mechanisms between school staff and the community, the project was moved to an alternative high school--a &quot;safer&quot; environment for partnership formation. The survey also provided a tool for planning specific  interventions as next steps in establishing a workable school-community partnership. Contains 21 references and a list of suggested readings.

        "author":["Brunn, Michael"],
        "description":"This study examines the personal choices of two American Indian men who grew up on different reservations (Hopi and Navajo) in the Southwest. Specifically, the study explores the agendas, opportunities, and decisions involved in retaining or rejecting each man's traditional culture and language. The study was based on discussions with both men over a period of a year that focused on all aspects of their academic and life experiences. Both men were in their late twenties, were educated through high school on their reservations, and were English literate. Both were attending the same university in a nearby large metropolitan city where they were completing advanced degrees. Three primary factors influenced the men in their life choices: parents' level of cultural literacy and  participation in tradition, world views of extended families and cultural groups, and personal interests in traditional and nontraditional ways. This study suggests that the subjects' divided interests between traditional and Euro-American ways were a fundamental part of the cultural cohesion and cultural interference that existed within their societies. This study demonstrates that heritage language loss and the lack of cultural transmission do not necessarily come about through cultural discontinuity between the institutions of minority and majority cultures. Elders and relatives can provide support that enhances their traditions and further enculturates their children. This is especially relevant where children are caught between the need for English literacy and the necessity of  maintaining and transmitting the heritage language and culture. These two men were able to achieve in both realms without the wholesale replacement of one set of beliefs by another. They chose the best aspects from both traditions to situate their identities at the intersection of two disparate cultures. (LP)",

        "author":["Creighton, Theodore B."],
        "description":"This paper addresses educational reform centering on teacher participation and leadership. Although schools have developed new mission statements and implemented strategic planning and site-based management in recent years, most schools are not set up to accept teachers in leadership roles. The literature suggests that our &quot;new&quot; schools must be built on shared authority and responsibility, which requires that staff trade assignments and work in multiple groups to remain in touch with the school as a whole. In 1990, Woods Learning Center (WLC)--an elementary school in Casper, Wyoming--eliminated the position of school principal. Driving this decision was the desire to reallocate the money saved in a principal's salary to the children in the classroom. At WLC, principal duties and  responsibilities are shared across the whole staff in the form of administrative teams--pairs of teachers responsible for handling such matters as budget and finance, board and community relations, curriculum and instruction, staff evaluation, and staff hiring. In interviews, board members commented that a traditional principal would have inhibited or prevented this change. Although research regarding shared decision making and the role of teachers as leaders is not promising, this school has experienced success with the changes it has made. Most teachers have had little preparation in school governance. Until leadership skills and competencies are addressed in teacher education programs, attempts to improve schools through changes in governance structures will continue to have little  effect.

These projects provide migrant families with an integrated program of early childhood education, adult education, and parenting education. As part of the national evaluation of the Even Start Family Literacy Program, this report describes three Migrant Even Start projects, their evaluation activities and concerns, and the special challenges that they face. The projects are located in Yuma, Arizona; Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; and Berlin and Cambria, Wisconsin. Project descriptions cover program structure and administration, characteristics of the community served, family recruitment, content and delivery of Even Start services, staff, coordination of  service components, participation and followup strategies, evaluation and the Even Start Information System (ESIS), and conclusions. Major challenges confronting Migrant Even Start projects include hiring qualified staff who are bilingual, bicultural, and knowledgeable about the migrant lifestyle; adapting service delivery to family schedules; collaborating with other community migrant services; providing continuity of services between sites; providing support services; dealing with migrant families' isolation in the community; and finding quality materials written in Spanish. In comparison to Even Start projects nationally, Migrant Even Start projects are unique in participant characteristics, families' strong commitment to the project, strong staff commitment and responsiveness,  scheduling of services, and staffing patterns. Recommendations include increasing interproject collaboration and technical assistance. Contains 20 references and a topic guide for site visits. (SV)",

Project staff reported on inservice training received, barriers to program implementation, technical assistance needs, service delivery schedules for various educational activities, types of parenting education activities and parent-child activities offered, content of adult education services, integration of core MEES services, collaboration with other agencies, and family needs for support services. Participants were primarily Hispanic two-parent families with an average of four children under age 16. Other family characteristics reported include length of U.S. residence, parent educational background, parent employment status, family income, and English language proficiency. Data on participation outcomes include home visits made, extent of parent and child participation in  various services, support services received, prevalence of children with special needs, and retention and successful completion of MEES services.

This report analyzes and assesses the quality of the comprehensive plans submitted by Title IX grantees in 1995-96 (the first year of the requirement). A detailed review was conducted of 138 of the approximately 1,300 Title IX formula grant applications submitted in 1995-96. Information was also gathered through telephone interviews with representatives of local and state education agencies, state and national Indian education organizations, and former Indian Education Technical Assistance Centers. Almost half of the applications failed  to mention a comprehensive plan. Over half did not refer to content and performance standards; coordination among federal, state, and local programs; and plans to assess the performance of all American Indian students (not just project participants). About half did not relate Indian education goals to those of other state and local plans, and did not refer to professional development. Almost half did not mention plans to share student assessment results with the community. Findings are outlined on the LEAs' planned activities in the following areas: meeting the culturally related academic needs of Indian students; professional development; aligning goals with those of other improvement plans and with state and local standards; program coordination; performance goals and benchmarks;  student assessment; and communication to parents and community. Examples demonstrate how some projects are fulfilling Title IX expectations in each area. Suggestions for improving Title IX comprehensive plans focus on technical assistance, agency cooperation, and broadened participation in planning. (SV)",

However, most writing on interagency collaboration has been from the perspective of service providers, not schools, and has given little consideration to the special concerns of collaboration in rural communities. This paper examines rural issues in agency collaboration from the perspective of one principal in a rural school. A literature review describes three models of the relationship between service organizations (referral-based, cooperative, collaborative); discusses schools as service organizations; and emphasizes the central importance of the school principal in leading change  toward collaboration. Multiple in-depth interviews were conducted with a high school principal in a small midwestern town. The principal was regarded as innovative and caring by peers and was not currently involved in formal restructuring of services for at-risk families and children. The interviews discussed school support services to high-risk students and families, the school's contacts with other service organizations, interactions between the school and the area education agency, barriers to interagency communication, gaps in services available locally, confidentiality issues, the flexibility and informality of the school's current system, and problems of collaboration related to \"turf\" issues and lack of resources.

        "description":"This paper reports on a study of high school dropouts ages 16-24 in a rural county in Illinois. Specifically, the study reports on descriptive data pertaining to high school dropouts, focusing on those who chose to return to education; changes in student views and perceptions regarding education; and efforts by the school system to encourage dropouts to return to school. Surveys were completed by 115 dropouts who had either returned to high school or were enrolled in a GED program or vocational/training program. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with 52 dropouts, including 12 who failed to return to education altogether, and with principals, counselors, and teachers. The proportion of minority dropouts was slightly higher than their representation in the student  population. In addition, the proportion of special education students among the dropouts was twice their proportion in all secondary students in the county. Few dropouts interviewed reported success at work, starting a family, or having a good time. These experiences along with changes in personal views and attitudes regarding educational benefits prompted students to return to education. However, those who returned to high school returned to the same environment that they had left, in many cases with memories of failure and frustration. Therefore, it was not surprising that only 35 percent of dropouts returned to high school, while 60 percent returned to a GED program. Students who failed to return to education faced severe or complicated obstacles, such as age, substance abuse, or  extreme delinquency, that made returning almost impossible. Other reasons for not returning included childcare needs, viewing work and money as a priority, and perceiving school as unchallenging or boring. Interviews with principals, school counselors, and teachers revealed that the school system did not prevent dropouts from returning to school should they chose to do so, but had no policies about establishing contact with dropouts to encourage or attract them to return. Includes recommendations for addressing the needs of dropouts. (LP)",

Robust sharing of mathematics, which is a way of analyzing student mathematical sharing in a community of learners, is presented here. Robust sharing of mathematics is defined along with analyses of episodes of this type of sharing among eighth grade students within a standards-based community of learners. Sources of data include videotaped observations of the classroom and audio taped discussions among the researchers and the teacher researcher. Results indicate that the concept of robust sharing of mathematics is a useful way in which to analyze student talk about mathematics. Future research  questions are suggested by this work and pertain to: (1) the contributions the teacher makes to the robust learning of mathematics; (2) effective questioning strategies; (3) the range of roles that the students can take; (4) the role of curriculum in the robust learning of mathematics; and (5) the differences in the learning of active sharers and non-sharers.

The research questions were: (1) In what Cognitive Strategies for Modeling (analyzing, reasoning, synthesizing, testing/debugging, and explaining) do ninth-grade science students engage as they create dynamic models? and (2) What are characteristics and qualities of the Cognitive Strategies for Modeling in which they engaged? Sixteen representative ninth-grade students from a public school in a midwestern college town were paired to create models on the software. Most pairs of students engaged in an analysis of appropriate objects  and factors for their model and in relational reasoning about those factors. Most were able to synthesize a working model employing a range of strategies, and most attempted to articulate explanations for their relationships. Most tested their model but only a few persisted in debugging to fine-tune their model's behavior to match their expectations. These findings indicate that creating dynamic models has great potential for use in classrooms to engage students in thought about the science content they are supposed to learn. (PVD)",

The study also explores changes in students' opinions of mathematics, assesses the intentions of females to take higher mathematics classes in high school, and surveys the amount of parental assistance students receive on homework. Students (N=27) in two pre-algebra classes participated in the study by responding to a pre-test, then participating in various activities related to the curriculum. Their scores and information collected via a survey complete the data. Survey data provides insight into student attitudes and perceptions. Results indicate that: (1) student performance is enhanced by the use of manipulative  materials; (2) students' attitudes toward mathematics are significantly more positive than those in previous years; and (3) homework did not seem to positively affect student performance. The analyses suggest that the benefits of using manipulative materials in teaching algebraic concepts may not be evidenced by student grades. Contains 22 references. (DDR)",

The research group consisted of 48 secondary students enrolled in Algebra I at a rural school in West Virginia, with the experimental period lasting 12 weeks. The control group was instructed in the teacher's usual manner, whereas the experimental group received treatment on coping with math anxiety. Treatment involved positive teacher attitudes, as well as cooperative learning and hands-on group activities. Math anxiety levels were measured using the Math Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS). Math anxiety levels were determined before and after the treatment and compared statistically using the t-test. Academic grades were also compared  periodically. The MARS pretest and posttest comparison indicated that both the control and experimental groups began and ended the study with the same level of math anxiety. Likewise, both the experimental and control groups started the study on the same basic algebra skill level, progressed at nearly the same rate, and performed on the same level at the end of the study.

        "description":"The National Environmental Education Act became law on November 16, 1990. The major sections of this law establish a national environmental education office, an environmental education and training program, environmental education grants, environmental internships and fellowships, environmental education awards, and an environmental education advisory council and task force. In 1996, reauthorization of the Act died in committee in the House of Representatives. Proponents of the Act at the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation (NEETF) expect reintroduction in 1997. When reintroduced, the Act is expected to be handled by the House Education and Workforce Committee. Proponents of the Act believe many members of this committee should be better informed about the  positive role environmental education plays in improving education in general by promoting active learning. This paper describes accomplishments of the Act in its first 6 years and suggests ways to address deficiencies that provide greater focus for environmental education on the state level. These include: (1) emphasizing the central role of the United States in environmental education rather than the tacit use of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regional offices; and (2) encouraging state experts to characterize state-specific environmental knowledge levels in on-line digests.

        "description":"In May 1990, the Republic of Latvia declared the restoration of its independence from the Soviet Union. After that declaration, many Latvians began to reform their schools' curricula and teaching methods. They replaced Soviet-era citizenship courses with new teaching materials and methods appropriate for educating the young citizens of a constitutional democracy. The Democracy Advancement Center (DAC) in Riga, Latvia, founded by Rusins Albertins of the United States, is just one of many civic education projects to emerge in the rush to reform Latvian education. Since 1993, the DAC has designed and developed materials for a new course in civic education at the upper-primary levels of school--the eighth and ninth grades. The DAC staff has been active in promoting civic education in  the lower-primary grades as well. Course content stresses interaction between citizens and their constitutional government. Teaching methods emphasize active learning instead of passive reception of information. Teacher training for civic education is another critical component of the DAC's mission, and they have conducted numerous workshops and seminars for teachers in schools in Latvia since 1994. The DAC's relationships with colleagues in other countries--the United States, Poland, Estonia, the United Kingdom, Lithuania, The Netherlands, and Russia--have been crucial to its success. Present and future challenges for the DAC include further promotion and development throughout Latvian Society of knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for effective and responsible citizenship in the  constitutional democracy of the Republic of Latvia.

Currently, students lack a systematic and detailed knowledge of this turning point in U.S. history. The impact of the Vietnam War on U.S. foreign policy, domestic politics, and social history cannot be overestimated. The controversial nature of the War and its ensuing political opposition are reasons teachers shy away from this subject. They also are discouraged by the superficial and often distorted textbook coverage, time constraints, and a lack of worthwhile supplementary materials. Three aspects of the Vietnam conflict that should be covered in social studies  instruction are identified. These are the conflict itself, the geographic concepts of places/regions and physical systems, and the gamut of homefront issues ranging from the anti-war demonstrations to the political ramifications of the War. To these ends, the digest lists several educational resource kits and theme issues of social studies journals. It also provides an address list of Southeast Asian resource centers and veterans' organizations thats often publish resource packets and teaching materials. In addition, journal articles, annotated bibliographies, and teaching guides are noted. (MJP)",

        "description":"This booklet comes from a workshop, \"School Repetition: a Global Perspective,\" held in Geneva (Switzerland) in February 1995, and the subsequent dialogue. The document is the first state-of-the-art approximation on school repetition. This highly complex phenomenon assumes different characteristics in different contexts and is defined and measured in various ways. Analysis of available information reveals that repetition is a significant quantitative phenomenon throughout the developing world, that it is concentrated within the first grades of school and in schools attended by students from low-income sectors, that is has devastating social and psychological impact on students who repeat and their families, and that it has a high financial cost. This document provides a beginning  for analysis of repetition on a global scale. Sections include: (1) \"Introduction\"; (2) \"The Dimensions of the Repetition Phenomenon\"; (3) \"Repetition: A Problem or a Solution?\"; (4) \"Factors Associated with Repetition\"; (5) \"Social Attitudes and Repetition\"; and (6) \"Various Strategies to Overcome Repetition.\" Charts and graphs accompany the text.

        "description":"This paper describes a program designed to increase student awareness and appreciation of their own culture and the cultures of others. The study was conducted in a northern Illinois junior high among 30 eighth grade language arts students. Data were gathered through teacher observation, teacher-student interviews, student surveys and student attitudinal tests. The problems of discrimination, segregation, and institutional racism were well documented by a lawsuit against the targeted school district. The multicultural intervention addressed these issues by attempting to change student attitudes toward fellow classmates and their cultures. Lack of cultural diversity in the school curriculum and perceived societal silence on issues of race contributed to students' lack of  appreciation of culture. A review of the professional literature and a review of each problem setting resulted in the selection of a solution strategy. Students were exposed to a model for change which consisted of awareness, understanding, acceptance and tolerance of diversity. Post intervention data indicated only minor changes in student awareness and appreciation of their own culture and the cultures of others. Appendices offer examples of classroom activities used to assess student awareness. (EH)",

The study uses an estimation of the national primary school enrollment rates from 1949-1951 and that in the period of &quot;the Cultural Revolution,&quot; and uses the available official statistics of China in other years. The paper argues that currently available theories about expansion of education, mainly based on the observation of western countries, cannot be well applied to this general pattern. Factors influencing China's unique educational development include economics, politics, and public policy. The paper offers an exploratory view of the general pattern of educational development and its implications for  the future. (Contains 25 references.) (EH)",

The purpose of the study was to gain an in-depth understanding of how students in ADP reflect upon their transitions to become active members of the ADP community over time. The students were primarily seniors who joined ADP in their sophomore years. The ADP program was established in the site school in 1970. Observations and interviews were used to gather data. Two major themes to emerge were: the positive aspects of the program that influence student motivation and performance; and the students' perceptions of themselves and the program over time. The study found that students benefited tremendously from the small, personalized  community of ADP that helped them to develop trusting relationships with their teachers and fellow students and have a voice in their own education.

A model for stages of focused and creative thinking gives: problem encounter/setting, preparation, concentration/incubation, clarification/generation and evaluation/judgment. While a computer can easily generate a list of problems, it must be programmed to decide which problems are important. Preparation, which may be study and practice or the loading of a computer memory, concentration (focused attention), and incubation (unfocused or diverted attention) are essential stages for humans but unnecessary for computers. The remaining stages of creative thinking require decisions, opinions and relevance, which often rely on deviations  in logic or sequence, divergent relationships, or emotional reactions--all processes of which a computer is incapable. Suggestions are given for activities and projects that help students understand the \"thinking\" process by using computers as an analogy and art making machine. Examples are drawn from several popular, pre-technological, technological, and visual art works. An 8-item reference list is provided. (MM)",

The initiatives were implemented during one semester in various public school classrooms and sites. Most occurred with preschool and elementary students, with 10 of the student teachers in junior high or high school settings. The preservice teachers had a university requirement to do a daily journal entry. These journals were shared at seminars and a compilation of learned outcomes became part of this study. The teachers in this study reported that preservice teachers gained knowledge of citizenship and developed skills in teamwork, communication, and problem solving. Their academic skills were also sharpened as higher levels of thinking processes were generated as a result of  practicing cooperative efforts. Preservice teachers found that difficulties arose regarding implementation: some were related to the planning process, agencies had difficulty in organizing activities, and obtaining parental permission forms was problematic. Overall, participants agreed that implementing an effective initiative creates a kinship that permeates the community while helping individuals become better skilled. (Contains 24 references.)

The pre-Civil War pedagogical culture was somehow maintained in a few movements of &quot;Pedagogical Renovation.&quot; The guiding principle of these movements was that schooling is the responsibility of teachers and that change cannot come from the outside, although external support can facilitate school improvement. One project that took place in the first phase of the Teachers' Centres consisted of an inservice activity based on school evaluation, to promote teacher awareness and professional reflective attitudes through systematic analysis of the Educational School Project and the school organizational structure.  Five of the larger schools in a rural area participated. The main results were: participants recognized the possibility of learning from peers; the studies carried out by each school; the decisions made as a result of the studies; and the published cooperative article written by all the participants. Another pedagogical renovation movement carried out in a progressive public school in Barcelona and conferences organized in Catalonia are summarized. (Contains 14 references.) (JLS)",

By the end of the 1970s, as the first democratic local elections were held, psychologists, educators, and social workers began to work toward schools that would compensate for the social and individual disadvantages of many students. These efforts also included collaboration with the local teachers to work on improving the quality of schooling. Teachers' Centers were founded in 1984 with the aim of being places where teachers could decide and manage areas and topics of their own interest in inservice education. The Ministry of Education also began offering grants for research on topics related to school improvement, where teachers and researchers could work together collaboratively.  In 1986, further political change led the Ministry of Education to stop top-down reform and initiate a debate about a new law to regulate the educational system. This law, passed in 1990, required a national curriculum. Teachers were required to write lesson plans that specified a sequence of content, and many sought advice from researchers regarding these and other aspects of implementing the new law, resulting in more collaborative efforts. Finally, a journal was created that brings together researchers and practitioners in a joint publication effort. (JLS)",

        "description":"As head of the Department of Pedagogy at the University of Chicago, John Dewey established an elementary school where a new curriculum could be put into practice, evaluated, and refined. This paper discusses how the activities of the school put Dewey's theories into practice generally, and particularly how they were applied to music education. Dewey's published works and the contemporaneous notebooks of teachers at the Chicago Laboratory School are the main sources for this analysis. Following Dewey's theories, teachers used constructive activities as the medium for cultivation of the children's imagination; children were encouraged to express their ideas through various modes. Dewey found evidence for stages in mental development in young children beginning with an early  imaginative stage, later becoming experimental, reflective thinking. Children's musical intelligence was seen as developing through their ability to form and express mental images of musical wholes. Images then became the tool of instruction. Once simple melodies and words were grasped as thought expressed in musical form, then ideas could be expanded into their essential elements: melody, rhythm, and harmony, moving from simple to complex. Group composition was encouraged as it combined action and reflected the children as social individuals. Young children were encouraged to express their ideas in multiple ways, to question, and to try new learning experiences. (Contains 39 references.) (JLS)",

Subsequent results of instrument adaptation and further empirical analyses to confirm initial findings are presented for two studies in different organizational contexts: a sample of child welfare professionals in Louisiana and a sample of higher educational faculty from 56 research universities  across the United States. Review of factor analyses results indicated that the social worker sample results were more like those of an earlier study of teachers than the results for higher education faculty. It was concluded that the original teacher instrument can be used with other populations and that self, organizational, and collective efficacy motivations can be identified and measured in multiple organizational contexts.

        "description":"This paper presents the results of a study of relationships between elements of the school professional learning environment and dimensions of caring and efficacy motivation among teachers. The sample for the study consisted of 1009 elementary and secondary school teachers from 29 schools in two suburban/rural school districts in a southeastern state. The teachers completed questionnaires that measured: teachers' perceptions of a range of conditions in schools that stimulate and support professional learning and growth; teachers' personal and organizational levels of efficacy motivation; and four affective components of human caring. The results showed: that measures of the professional learning environments of schools, human caring, and efficacy motivation can be determined with  reasonable reliability; that positive relationships exist between elements of the professional learning environment of schools and teacher levels of efficacy motivation related to goal persistence and response to failure; and that a strong relationship exists between good teacher and administrator relationships and opportunities for professional development. These results are important as they relate to theory building, teacher development, and perhaps school improvement. Five data tables are attached. The appendix provides copies of the demographic information form, and copies of The Professional Learning Environment Inventory, The Teacher Self and Organizational Efficacy Assessment, and The Human Caring Inventory.

The relationship between an individual's epistemological sophistication and understanding of photosynthesis was also examined. The sample consisted of 255 biological sciences majors enrolled in a biology laboratory class at a large midwestern university. Subjects worked individually, and in high scoring, low scoring, and mixed pairs. Subjects' epistemological sophistication comprised one set of independent variables and was determined by a 21-item instrument. After completing the survey, students were given a 15-minute presentation and a written simulation guide and told to proceed. It was found that an individual's post-test score could  be significantly predicted by their partner's post-test score. It is assumed that markedly more active members of dyads played a more active role intellectually and conversationally than the more passive member and that this active member may have processed information about the simulation exercise more deeply than the passive member.

        "description":"A new interdisciplinary science and mathematics course for preservice elementary/special education teachers at LaSalle University (Pennsylvania) is examined. &quot;Explorations in Science and Mathematics&quot; was designed to develop core skills, critical thinking and communication, understanding of math and science as real-life activities, confidence in the subject matter, and metacognitive awareness of the learning processes involved. During the pilot semester, a constant comparison method was used to identify topics studied, engagement, beliefs and attitudes about mathematics and science throughout the course, comprehension of course content, and connections drawn to future teaching. Primary sources of data were interviews with faculty, notes and records from the course planning  process, course documents, comprehensive portfolios of all student course work, and focus group interviews with students conducted at the end of the semester. Categories of Silence (knowing in action), Received Knowing, Subjective Knowing, Procedural Knowing, and Constructed Knowing from &quot;Women's Ways of Knowing&quot; became important in the construction of rubrics. Students who did well tended toward Procedural (connected) and Subjective ways of knowing. Discrepancies between faculty and student expectations indicate that pre-existing negative student attitudes are more resistant to change than the literature on teaching reform initiatives indicates.

The first section introduces the methodology and terminology. Section 2 examines collaboration, including the problems and pitfalls (priorities, status of PDS activities, calendars, and uses of time) and rewards and coping strategies (research and teaching, changing roles, and time and compensation).  Section 3 explores teacher training, including mentoring, isolation and status, new teachers' contributions, diversity in selection and placement, and improving teacher training. Section 4 looks at funding; section 5 covers evaluation, including examples. Section 6 reports on upcoming publications. (Contains 100 references.) (ND)",

        "description":"In ethnographic research, silence can be probed as a filter through which to understand metaphors present and absent in conversations. The question posited in this study is how to account for silence as deliberate. From analysis of conversational interactions with classroom teachers, it became apparent that the silences also had meaning, that they were &quot;inhabited.&quot; Probing of the silences revealed that although the focus of the conversations was race, the teachers' awareness of themselves as raced (i.e., as having a racial identity) was absent from the conversations. When asked how they described themselves, the teachers included many non-racial descriptors; race was also absent from written biographies. Because whiteness continues to be construcd as the norm, it is rendered  invisible. Additionally, when asked how they saw themselves racially, the responses focused not on their race but rather on their identity as white women. Reversing the polarities of silence and talk, or treating talk as the ground and silence as the figure for analysis, results in making the familiar strange and the strange familiar. It is suggested that researchers can become more open to the possibility of multiple meanings in silences and thus find new areas for research. (Contains 26 references.) (JLS)",

A 3-member team worked on developing the design for this inquiry group. In preparation for each session, the members visited each others classrooms to gather data for later exploration. Some sessions included brainstorming about specific teaching activities, others were presentations, and others used vignettes. The vignettes proved to be the best trigger for focus group discussion. Participants seemed most able to connect with the vignettes which  were short accounts of student interactions. Other observations during the course of the inquiry discussions led to additional insights. Creating a space of inquiry required the leader to be aware and attentive to the situation, have a perspective of where the teachers were in their own learning, and be emotionally aware of connections to and within the group.

This study focuses on both of these seminars and is based on field notes from interviews with four participants in the program. Findings indicate that teachers' thinking is significantly affected in two ways: first, their actual thinking process has evolved into a more rigorous, more reflective way of  thinking; and second, their thinking has resulted in insights into and specific strategies for solving problems and a heightened sense of perspective.

Student responses from both quantitative and qualitative data supported the premise that completing the four major course assignments enhanced the students' comfort and confidence levels in working with parents.

The study examined the application of four components of a problem-solving model (problem identification, goal setting, intervention selection, and monitoring and evaluation), and compared the self-reports of teachers on their choice of intervention strategies for students and their reflections on the problem-solving techniques used to select intervention strategies. The systematic participants (n=25) were the only ones to use a rubric defining the problem-solving model to analyze their own self-reports of intervention selection. Their  ability to apply the problem-solving model was compared to two other groups of teachers: the focused group (n=17), who received the same professional development workshop but not the rubric; and the random group (n=20), who received neither the rubric nor the professional development workshop. Study results indicated that the systematic participants exhibited significantly higher levels of problem-solving model application in both their self-reports and their reflective journals. They were the only group to set goals for their students and then select interventions to match those goals. These participants also exhibited a deeper understanding of the problem-solving model in their reflective journals. The most striking finding was the emergence of a common language for problem-solving  among the systematic practitioners. (Contains 71 references.) (ND)",

It looks at how their life experiences or life stories affect classroom practices. Using collaborative methodology, the findings suggest the role of \"gate opener\" which represents the common as well as the diverse ways all the participants see themselves. All the teachers, including the researchers/teacher educators, can be seen as keeping watch at the \"gates\" of schooling and educational opportunities (in the traditional sense). As \"gate openers\" they look for ways to let students into success in school and access to middle class. They also see the need to change the perceived norm for acceptance. This has particular significance for teacher educators reminding  them of the opportunities to be informed by their students who have alternative perspectives. It points to the need to make room for culturally aware students perspectives in university classrooms and to take seriously the responsibility to work toward equity in universities as well as elementary and high school classrooms.

All students received instructional computer accounts and had access to a class bulletin board. One class session focused on learning the systems. Throughout the semester, students shared tips about computer networking. Their first assignment was to navigate Internet health and elementary education discussion groups, then e-mail the instructor about what they learned and how they perceived their experiences. The second assignment had students download health related lesson plans from the Internet. The third assignment had students post their own lesson plans on the Internet. The final assignment required posting  three times (reacting to an assignment, replying to another student's post, and whatever else the student chose). The instructors considered the project beneficial, as the predominantly female students mastered technology and gained skills to help them narrow the gender gap. The course helped students develop or enhance their computer literacy and view a model of classroom technology use. Students and instructors used computers to access one another outside the classroom. The greatest benefit was the increased sharing among class members. (SM)",

Six programs at four universities prepared self-studies, following Board of Regents (BOR) guidelines. BOR staff and consultants reviewed the self-studies and additional system-level data before making site visits at which they reviewed documents and conducted interviews with the president and/or provost, other central administrators, the college dean, department chairs, faculty, students, alumni, and others. This report includes field-wide observations  regarding the disciplines, a systemwide report, systemwide recommendations, and reports for each program at each university, noting institutional recommendations. Results indicate that the status of Florida's programs is appropriate. The programs are strong, and the curricula are solid, but the programs need additional financial support.

        "author":["Haywood, Kathleen M."],
        "description":"Educators have recognized the limitations of artificial assessments and called for more authentic assessments of student performance, i.e., assessment that is contextualized. In the field of movement education, teachers have typically tended to evaluate their students by administering skill tests, categorizing children for their developmental level on fundamental skills, and watching students play in games. However, skill tests are not very authentic, and game playing is only authentic if the context is specified. Motor development scholars increasingly use a new model of movement that can help teachers design authentic assessment. The model takes into consideration person, task, and environment. The paper presents examples of using a movement model based on Herkowitz' Task  Analysis to conduct authentic assessment of two tasks (kicking for accuracy and throwing for distance). The system was designed to analyze a movement task by specifying characteristics of the environment and their levels on an easy-to-hard or simple-to-complex continuum. (Contains 11 references.)

        "description":"This study examined the influence of female students' (N=90) self-monitoring and attribution on achievement when throwing darts. It was hypothesized: (1) that students who set strategic process goals and used self-evaluative recording would attribute outcomes to strategic causes; and (2) that students who set outcome goals and did not use self-evaluative recording would attribute outcomes to nonstrategic sources. Experimental conditions were based on types of self-regulatory treatments: strategy (analytic or imaginal), goal (process or outcome), and self-evaluation (present or absent). Students watched demonstrations of the skills individually then had 20 minutes of dart throwing practice. After practice, all students completed evaluations of their attributions (why they thought  they missed the bull's eye) and posttests of dart throwing proficiency, self- efficacy, self-reaction, and intrinsic interest. Results supported both hypotheses. Since self-regulated strategy process goals and self-evaluation influence the types of attributions students make, it is suggested that teachers help them set strategic process instead of outcome goals, keep performance records, and evaluate their progress.

        "description":"This paper examines the ineffectiveness of evaluation instruments for evaluating teacher instructional performance and compares evaluation with clinical supervision. Supervision identifies what occurs within classrooms, emphasizing teachers' instructional performance, while evaluation also includes other areas such as the teacher's appearance, parent and peer relationships, attendance, promptness, and adherence to school policies. Research indicates that most teachers prefer supportive supervision, agree with the principles of clinical supervision, and prefer it. Clinical supervision is an ongoing, formative process that emphasizes the relationship between classroom performance and the teacher's espoused goals. It includes four basic steps: the pre-observation conference, the  observation, analysis and strategy development, and the post-observation conference. Formative clinical supervision emphasizes coaching and feedback; collegiality is the key to its success. The results of an evaluation mandated by state level offices can be very ineffective, with the mandated evaluation tools undermining high quality education. Evaluation and supervision processes can complement and support each other when carried out in a supportive and collegial way. (Contains 19 references.) (SM)",

The participants were 6 graduate students and their professor, 10 teachers (grades 1-5), their students, and the librarian in a Professional Development School. Each week on &quot;Tech Days&quot; the students received training for one-half hour, with the graduate students and the professor providing training in computer applications. Second semester, in addition to &quot;Tech Day&quot; instruction, some students received extra intensive training to enable them to serve as &quot;experts&quot; in the classroom environment. University team members were responsible for planning activities with the teachers and librarian and providing  after-school sessions for teachers. Study findings revealed both benefits and limitations to this approach. Benefits included increased motivation for teachers to learn about and use technology in their classrooms, changes in the attitudes and motivation of the students, and more independence and confidence in using technology. Limitations focused on logistics (number of available computers, time problems, inadequate staffing and funding). As a result of this &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach, teachers became more for frequent users of technology, and they began to use their students' expertise to increase their own computer skills.

Perceived solutions included expelling disruptive students, inservice workshops, parent involvement, increased security, class size reduction, payment for student teaching, presence or absence of cooperating teacher from the classroom, reduction of interruptions from pull-out programs, reduction or increase in visits by college  supervisors, and having full control of the classroom from the beginning to the end of student teaching. Teachers in this survey appeared to prefer more input into the removal of students with disciplinary problems over more computers and supplies, merit pay, or better benefits.

        "author":["Mallonee, Richard L."],
        "description":"Howard Gardner's &quot;Theory of Multiple Intelligences&quot; suggests that everyone is capable of at least seven &quot;ways&quot; of knowing. According to this theory, human beings know the world and solve problems through: (1) language; (2) logical-mathematical analysis; (3) visual-spatial representations; (4) musical thinking; (5) the use of the body; (6) an interpersonal understanding of others; and (7) an intrapersonal understanding of self. Individual differences occur in the relative strengths of each intelligence within a person and in the ways the intelligences are activated and combined to carry out various tasks and to solve problems. Multiple intelligence theory encourages teachers to expand their repertoire of techniques, tools, and strategies beyond the typical linguistic and logical  ones predominantly used in classrooms. The choral rehearsal is, by nature, an experience that actively develops musical intelligence. However, each of the other intelligences can be activated, explored, and developed within the context of the general singing or choral rehearsal. The effective music educator is one who uses a variety of approaches to reach students. Each &quot;way of knowing&quot; is described, along with suggested activities for the choral director to use to reinforce specific intelligences. (Contains 14 references.) (ND)",

As a result, researchers have been modeling schools and classrooms to calculate productivity indicators that will withstand not only statistical review but political criticisms. There are two main approaches to this problem; one uses pretest and posttest scores of students and the other uses student gain scores. In this paper, a model is developed for each approach, and their results are discussed. The outcomes of each model are School Effective Indices (SEI) and Classroom Effective Indices. A set of criteria is established and the SEIs these models produce are tested against these criteria  using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to determine the &quot;better&quot; approach. It is suggested that both models produce very similar results. If HLM software from SSI Inc. is used, then the pretest-posttest two-level model is more convenient and efficient to use than the three-level Gain model. (Contains four tables and six references.)

        "description":"Two studies investigated upper elementary school students' informal understanding of sampling issues in the context of interpreting and evaluating survey results. The specific focus was on the children's evaluation of sampling methods and means of drawing conclusions from multiple surveys. In Study 1, 17 children were individually interviewed to categorize children's conceptions. In Study 2, 110 children completed paper-and-pencil tasks to confirm the response categories identified in Study 1 and to determine the prevalence of the response categories in a larger sample. Children evaluated sampling methods focusing on potential for bias, fairness, practical issues, or results. All children used multiple types of evaluation rationales, and the focus of their evaluations varied  somewhat by context and type of sampling method (restricted, self-selected, or random). Children used affective (fairness) rationales more often in school contexts and rationales focused on results more often in out-of-school contexts. Children had more difficulty detecting bias with self-selected sampling methods than with restricted sampling methods because self-selection was initially the most fair (i.e., everyone had a chance to participate). Children preferred stratified random sampling to simple random sampling because they wanted to ensure that all types of individuals were included. When drawing conclusions from multiple surveys, children: (1) considered survey quality; (2) aggregated all surveys regardless of quality; (3) used their own opinions and ignored all survey data; or  (4) refused to draw conclusions. Even when children were able to identify potential bias, they often ignored survey quality when drawing conclusions from multiple surveys. (Contains 5 tables and 45 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"In response to input from the employment and training community, the Department of Labor's Assessment and Research Development Program (ARDP) and its state partners have developed two self-assessment work value instruments to be incorporated into career exploration and counseling programs. Computerized multiple rank-order and paper-and-pencil card-sorting instruments based on the Theory of Work Adjustment (R. V. Dawis and L. H. Lofquist, 1984) were developed. Ninety-six employment service clients completed one of the work value instruments during a pilot study. Four subsequent studies, involving 1,605 employment service customers and students from vocational/technical and junior colleges, were conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the instruments. Relationships  between scores and the new work value instruments and scores on the Minnesota Importance Questionnaire (J. B. Rounds, G. A. Henly, R. V. Dawis, L. H. Lofquist, and D. J. Weiss, 1981) will be examined to determine construct validity. Respondent reaction data and administration times for the pilot test and the main studies are reported here.

The researcher's personal experience dealing with a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder became a factor in her reaction to the suggestion that she herself was dyslexic.

The subject, a preservice science teacher, was studied from her last year of an undergraduate teacher education program through her student teaching experience in an investigation of the role of experience in professional development. The researcher, a science teacher educator, saw the research as a way to learn more about designing teacher education experiences. In the course of the study, the researcher began to examine her own learning about the process of research as a parallel to the subject's learning about being a teacher. A number of parallels were found. Both entered the collaboration with  experiences that influenced beliefs about their professions. Both saw themselves as professionals, and both encountered tension in thinking about their respective professions. Both felt a mismatch between their abstract thinking about the experience and the reality of their practices. As a result, both began to see their practices in a new way and to understand the complexities of their professions. Examining researcher and subject roles resulted in deeper understanding of the relationships among procedure, context, and human action. (Contains 11 references.) (SLD)",

Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis supported the invariance of SEEQ factor structure across three discipline groups and across ratings of good and poor teachers. In the best model, factor loadings were invariant across all six  groups, while factor variances and covariances were invariant across the three discipline groups.

        "description":"When investigating the impact of predictor variables on an outcome variable or measuring the effectiveness of an educational program, educational researchers and program evaluators cannot ignore the possible influences of interaction effects. The purpose of this paper is to present a procedure that educational researchers can follow in order to increase their understanding of the nature of the interaction effect between a treatment variable and a continuous independent variable. This technique involves the use of three separate analytical techniques implemented in three steps. First, the interaction effect is statistically tested using a multiple regression model. Second, the interaction effect is plotted, and if the interaction effect is disordinal, the intersection point of the  regression lines is calculated. Third, the Johnson-Neyman confidence limits are calculated. A list of the computer commands that can be used in conjunction with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) PC+ computer software to calculate the Johnson-Neyman confidence limits is provided. In addition, this three-step analytical procedure is applied to a set of efficacy data that was collected in a study of the FOCUS instruction model developed by G. Russell (1992) to illustrate how it can be used by researchers and program evaluators. An appendix presents the computer program for the calculation of the confidence limits.

The evaluation was the Collaborative Assessment Procedure (CAP) implemented in a large midwestern urban school district. Beginning teachers were assigned a teacher consultant who observed the teacher and shared the observations in conferences. The research attempted to determine if a link existed between the new teacher performance evaluation process and the beginning teachers' sense of efficacy with respect to students and other teachers. Twenty-one teachers who had participated in this process were interviewed. Thirteen experienced affirmation in the process and thought that the CAP process nurtured their professional  development. Other participants experienced the CAP process as surveillance, and were much less positive about its effects. Twenty of these teachers were convinced that they could affect the lives of their students significantly. Fifteen spoke of a strong link between their CAP experiences and their growing sense of personal efficacy. Two gave CAP only slight credit for their increased sense of efficacy, and only one did not report an enhanced sense of efficacy at the end of the CAP year. The process was acknowledged to recognize the varying levels of professional development of these beginning teachers. While the construct of teachers' sense of efficacy remains difficult to assess, the CAP approach appears to enhance it for beginning teachers. (Contains 14 references.) (SLD)",

Students' self-efficacy perceptions clearly generalized beyond boundaries of specific tasks and also of specific school subjects, albeit to a lesser degree. There was greater generalizability of academic self-efficacy among math and science subjects than among verbal ones. The degree of academic self-efficacy generalization partly depended upon the degree of perceived similarity among tasks. Students reported more comparable levels of self-efficacy as they perceived greater similarity in the set of problems presented. Subject-specific and more global measures of academic self-efficacy (i.e., verbal  and quantitative) preserved the strong predictive utility for students' effort expenditure and academic achievement.

        "description":"The internal/external (I/E) frames of reference model proposed by H. Marsh (1986, 1990) points to the relativistic nature of academic self-concept formation. It argues that students compare their own academic ability to that of their peers in an external comparison, and they compare their own verbal skills to their mathematics skills in an internal comparison. The relative superiority of one set of skills over the other becomes salient in this comparison, yielding a negative correlation between verbal and mathematics self-concept. This study tested the I/E model with typical measures of academic self-efficacy with 588 students from 4 Los Angeles (California) high schools. Students rated their confidence in their ability to solve problems and their perceptions of ability in each  school subject. Overall, results do not provide clear support for the I/E model. Even when students were explicitly told to compare their capability in one domain to that in the others, their verbal and mathematics self-perception failed to exhibit a negative relationship. It is difficult to accept the I/E model's contention that students spontaneously, if not voluntarily, undergo two separate comparison processes when asked to report their own perceived competence. It appears that their perceptions of capability are constructed without the internal comparison process. (Contains three figures and nine references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The relative contribution of students' capability to perceive structural versus surface similarity on their motivation transfer was studied. It was hypothesized that surface similarity would lead to greater transfer of self-efficacy among tasks due to its readily perceptible nature. More specifically, it was hypothesized that the perception of structural and surface similarity would affect the degree of similarity perceived in the problem pairs, which, in turn, would directly influence the degree of self-efficacy transfer. Participants were 588 students from 4 Los Angeles (California) high schools. Eight pairs were constructed for comparison from four problems in arithmetic-progression, algebra and four constant-acceleration problems in physics. Students were asked to relate  their self-efficacy for solving each of the problems and to rate the similarity of the problems and report the reasons similarity existed. Results support the idea that surface similarity among tasks exercises greater influence on students' perceptions and on their transfer of motivation, at least in the initial stage. Perception of similarity among tasks rooted in surface-level characteristics might not help students solve problems, but it can help produce confident learners who persist in the face of difficulties.

        "description":"Students are often evaluated on the basis of their aggregate or average performance on diverse tasks in each school subject. When the target of prediction is such global measures as course grades, academic self-efficacy, too, should be able to reflect equivalent scope and generality to maximize its predictive utility. Academic self-efficacy in the present study was assessed as either confidence ratings toward samples of problems typically performed in each school subject or responses on the self-efficacy scale of the Motivated Learning Strategies Questionnaire (MSLQ), which asks for students' overall academic confidence in a given domain without making any explicit reference to individual tasks. Participants (588 high school students) reported both types of efficacy in English,  Spanish, American history, algebra, geometry, and chemistry. Results show that, in general, relations of the MSLQ self-efficacy results to effort and grades are stronger than those of the problem-referenced efficacy. It is interesting to note that predictive superiority of the MSLQ scale is more predominant in verbal subjects than in quantitative domains. It is concluded that relationships between academic self-efficacy and outcome measures would be less influenced by the specificity mismatch in subject matters that are clearly definable in terms of the skills and tasks performed.

        "description":"In this study, the reliability of the American College Testing (ACT) Program's &quot;Survey of Academic Advising&quot; (SAA) was examined using both univariate and multivariate generalizability theory approaches. The primary purpose of the study was to compare the results of three generalizability theory models (a random univariate model, a mixed univariate model, and a multivariate model) and examine their utility for assessing the reliability of the data. Data were from SAA history files for 10 postsecondary institutions, with 10 advisors from each institution, and 10 students for each advisor. Results of the study demonstrate empirically that, when there is only one item for each level of the fixed facet in the multivariate model, the multivariate G coefficients are identical to the G  coefficients produced by the mixed univariate model in which the item is a fixed facet. Although the multivariate and mixed univariate models produced higher G coefficients than did the random univariate model, the choice of using a univariate or multivariate approach should depend on the nature of the items and scales in the instrument and the assumptions underlying the universe of generalization. However, since the multivariate model (with one item per level of the fixed facet) yields the same G coefficient as the mixed univariate model (with item facet fixed) and since statistical procedures for the univariate model are simpler and more available, the mixed univariate model could be used to determine the desired level of generalizability/ reliability of the measurement data.

        "description":"Is it possible to translate an existing test from the source language to a target language and then to empirically link the translated test to the source language standard? Some tests are amenable to translation of their content and some are not. Within tests, some items may be translatable and others may not. Some items may measure meaningful content when translated, and others may not. Within items, some options may be translatable, and others may not. This paper focuses on the rigorous method used to translate and adapt from English to Spanish three equated forms of the Tests of General Educational Development (GED tests) to ensure that all items are valid and that the translated instrument measures a comparable construct. Most specifically, the paper addresses issues related  to translating items on the language subtest. The Spanish-language GED tests were normed using only graduated high school seniors in Puerto Rico. In addition, the paper outlines a linking design that introduces a procedure for screening biliterate students for linguistic equivalency across languages before including them in the linking sample. This design will be tested in May 1997 when the test is administered to a large sample of biliterate Hispanic high school seniors. (Contains 2 tables and 12 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"Score comparability is important to those who take tests and those who use them. One important concept related to test score comparability is that of &quot;equity,&quot; which is defined as existing when examinees are indifferent as to which of two alternate forms of a test they would prefer to take. By their nature, computerized adaptive tests (CAT) add extra complexity for score comparability issues. At a minimum, comparability between a CAT and a paper-and-pencil (P&amp;P) form means that the score each examinee gets on the CAT and P&amp;P forms should be as interchangeable as possible in terms of the construct being measured and the measurement precision of that construct. The importance of the content issue, termed &quot;content balancing,&quot; has been expressed by several researchers. The relative  importance or appropriateness of content areas to different regions of the ability scale should guide development of both CAT and P&amp;P forms. Among the approaches suggested for content balancing is a conditional balancing approach advocated by T. C. Davey and L. Thomassen (1995). The simulation study described in this paper extends Davey's approach by including realistic item exposure controls. An artificial 25-item P&amp;P math test was used as a reference and target test for the CAT conditions. Results from this preliminary study seem to confirm the assertion that it is possible to employ item content controls appropriately during item administration of a CAT, following targets based on natural distribution of item content as a function of ability so that total measurement precision is not  severely negatively impacted.

        "description":"The Houston Independent School District (HISD) (Texas) was one of 16 districts nationwide to receive a Department of Education Safe Schools Discretionary Grant for the 1995-96 school year. This federally funded violence prevention program was called the HISD Safe Schools Initiative. The grant established a model for integrating existing and new programs into an effective system of operation that can be replicated in other schools and large urban school districts. The initiative established a pilot program to promote safe, drug-free, and violence-free schools through 18 components addressing safety from the standpoint of education, social services, law enforcement, and community organizations. All 17 schools in a section of the school district implemented at least one component.  The degree of program implementation varied from school to school. In that part of the school district, serious police incidents, less serious incidents, total incidents, and incidents leading to arrest decreased, while total incidents increased overall in the HISD. Student attitudes and behaviors tended to be less violent as a result of the program, although differences were small, and no differences in attitudes toward drugs were found. Teachers and students responded favorably to the program, although teachers continued to be concerned with issues of drugs and violence in the schools. Communication and coordination difficulties caused problems in program implementation, and recommendations for continued violence prevention programs after the grant period note the importance of  communication and resource allocation. Eleven appendixes provide supplementary materials about the program and its participants. (Contains 3 figures, 85 tables, and 23 appendix tables.) (SLD)",

This paper discusses issues in the audit process, drawing on data from interviews with three faculty members (teacher educators) and eight students whose dissertations were audited. The purpose of an audit is to examine the process and the product of the research inquiry. It examines the audit trail materials used by the researcher, such as raw data, data reduction and analysis products, reconstruction and synthesis products, notes, materials related to intentions and dispositions, and instrument  development information. Validity and verification documentation and materials specifically prepared for the audit process are also examined. The process used to conduct an audit is described, from the initial consultation with the researchers through the review of the dissertation. The object is to determine whether the research process is documented clearly and whether the conclusions and interpretations are supported by the data and warranted based on the documentation provided. The confirmation students receive from the audit can provide greater confidence in the qualitative research process. One appendix presents an attestation prepared as the result of an audit, and the other discusses types of materials submitted for an external audit. (Contains 20 references.) (SLD)",

Unidimensional data sets were generated according to sample sizes of 2,500 and 5,000 and test lengths of 10 and 20 items. Two-dimensional item response vectors were generated for the same sample sizes and test lengths. Findings with unidimensional data sets suggest that the correction in PRELIS2 resulted in higher Type I error rates with the chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic. Rejection rates obtained using the LISREL8 chi-square fit statistic were  high across all simulated two dimensional conditions. Results suggest that the LISREL7 chi-square fit statistic should be recommended to the researcher interested in determining whether the assumption of unidimensionality has been violated.

The results indicate that the use of the standard analysis of covariance model when a quadratic term is present has little effect on Type I error rates but produces a substantial power loss compared to theoretically expected values, often in excess of 20%. The extent of the power loss depends on the magnitude of the regression parameter associated with the nonlinear term. This finding appears consistently for varying numbers of groups and sample sizes and for various distributions. These results highlight the importance of plotting data and checking for nonlinearity prior to employing the  standard analysis of covariance F test. (Contains 2 tables and 22 references.)

The rest of the data points are then taken into the subsample, one after another, and a weighted least squares procedure is performed each time a new data point is brought in, until all data points are included. The weighted average and standard errors of the regression coefficients from all iterations are calculated and compared with those from ordinary least squares and two other robust techniques. It is shown that the technique developed in this paper performs better than the least absolute deviation approach and at  the same level with the least median of squares (LMS) approach.

What responsibilities and actions publishers can reasonably be expected to take, with respect to the consequences of test use, is explored. The uses of tests vary by teacher, school, district, state, and over time, especially the time between norming and test use, and no direct mechanism exists for obtaining evidence of the many consequences of test use. Publishers should undertake to study the matter for each of their tests to the extent possible and they should try to persuade academic researchers to study  the matter objectively. Because there are so many tests and so many uses, it will take a large-scale cooperative effort to produce any generalizable evidence about the consequences of using nationally normed tests whatever their formats. This leadership cannot come from test publishers alone, but they should play a substantial role in the undertaking as they work with professional organizations to bring about many studies of test use.

Inside the rubric the criteria for each level of achievement are explained in detail, along with the weight to be given to each skill. Students involved in developing a rubric are more clear about the skills they need to master a lesson and how well they are progressing. As added reinforcement of the lesson, students  work cooperatively in small groups to try out their ideas. The rankings used in a rubric should be neutral words that avoid the implication of failure inherent in a generalized A-F or numerical grade. The rubric should also have an even number of ratings to eliminate the temptation to award a middle ranking. Along with the rubrics developed for individual lessons, each student's assessment should encompass a look at the progress the student has made during the year. Examples of work should be collected into a portfolio for an end-of-the-year assessment.

The teacher serves as a facilitator of discussion of the assessment process. Students and the teachers work together to define what they think is quality work. The rubric is an important part of using negotiable contracting for formal assessment. A rubric is a carefully designed ratings chart that is drawn up jointly by the teacher and students. Along one side of the rubric are the criteria that both parties decide are the most important ideas to be mastered in the lesson, and across the top are the rankings that are used to decide how  well the students understand each criterion. Within each ranking there may be numerical gradations. Rubrics can be especially effective in assessing student work in mathematics or in any area that requires problem solving. An example is given of the use of negotiable contracting in a poetry unit. Rubrics offer an important way for educators to motivate students through assessment. Giving students a voice in their grading provides them with a clear understanding of what is expected of them and the assurance that their accomplishments will be recognized.

This critical account of a relationship between a research supervisor and a postgraduate research student was prompted by a sense of disquiet and lack of harmony that developed during a year-long action research study. In the role of a teacher-researcher with a critical constructivist perspective, the student had attempted to transform radically the epistemology of her Year 10 Bioethics class. Despite the supervisor's emancipatory intentions, the student felt that she was being disempowered as a result of his demands to conform to normative expectations and standards. Drawing on the student's dissertation and reflective journal, and on their subsequent separate writings, the student and  supervisor jointly conducted a critical inquiry into the problematic aspects of their relationship.

Habermas and feminist scholars assisted with their new understandings of the need for a rich communicative student-supervisor relationship, especially in situations where the student is undertaking emancipatory action research and the supervisor wishes to adopt a collaborative research role.

This Battery, developed from the theory and research base represented in the &quot;Learner-Centered Psychological Principles&quot; (American Psychological Association and the Mid-continent Regional Educational Laboratory, 1993) assesses: (1) teachers' beliefs about learners, learning, and teaching; (2) teachers' perceptions of their classroom practices in domains of practice identified in the &quot;Principles&quot;; and (3) students' perceptions of teacher classroom practices in these same domains. Major findings were that effective teachers demonstrate more implementation of learner-centered domains of practice than less effective  teachers, and that student perceptions of teachers' implementation of learner-centered practices and student self-efficacy ratings predicted student achievement. The Learner-Centered Battery can be used to predict high quality teaching in that it reliably differentiates effective from less effective teachers. (Contains 4 tables and 20 references.)

        "description":"As part of a discussion of the complexities of evaluating bilingual education, this paper discusses critical questions related to equitable education. A first concern is the development of standards. Children must be given equal opportunities to learn, but the development of standards and new assessments alone will not ensure that inequities will disappear. Performance assessments are not an answer either, since the implementation of performance assessments will show that test bias does not simply go away. Potential causes of bias in performance assessments will be language-dependent skills and the problem of situational or cultural contexts in the assessments that are unfamiliar to students from certain cultures. Practical approaches to ensuring accuracy in assessments for  students with diverse learning needs begin with providing reasonable access to manipulatives and resources when possible and making sure the language of the directions is clear. Educators should request special administration conditions for students when needed. An example of mediated administration that is more equitable for students is presented in the Arizona Student Assessment Program (ASAP) (no longer the state assessment) and its accommodations for Spanish speaking students. Strategies are included for administering the ASAP in English to limited English proficient students. (Contains two tables.) (SLD)",

Some Connecticut elementary schools end at grade 5 (Type I) and some continue to grade 6 or 8 (Type II). Grade 6 results are reported for Type II schools but not Type I. The relationship between this school-level accountability and the sixth-grade performance of students was examined using multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Two different models were used to compare the sixth-grade achievement of students who attended Type I and Type II schools in grade 5, removing the effect of fourth-grade performance. Consistent results showed that schools that expected to be accountable for  sixth-grade results (Type II) produced better performing sixth graders. Implications for designing and developing accountability systems are discussed.

In the first of these studies, reported here, 89 undergraduates studied 1 of 3 sets of study materials, reviewed them immediately or 2 days later, and then were tested. Materials were the text, the text with graphic organizers, or the text plus a set of outlines. Results indicate that although graphic organizers facilitated learning text structure across both review occasions, they facilitated transfer of text knowledge only when review was delayed. The study also found evidence that students who delayed their review of  graphic organizers used more effective study strategies.

Job profiling, the job analysis component of the Work Keys system, was used to study all 3 jobs and establish content-related validity and skill standards, using 1,614 social workers. The assessment component of the system was used to examine the extent to which a sample of incumbents (189 social workers) met the skill levels set by subject matter  experts. In the final stage of this project, performance data provided a basis to calculate statistical indices to address the criterion-related validity of the Work Keys system relative to the social worker jobs. Recommendations are given regarding how the Work Keys system can be used to address the human resources needs of the three social worker classifications studied. An appendix describes the job skills.

In this report, the Panel considers philosophical, technical, and policy issues concerning the NAEP in the immediate future and in the long term. The high technical quality of the NAEP assessment and its independence from unwarranted influences and political pressures have enabled the NAEP to monitor trends in educational achievement reliably since its inception in 1969. In recent years, the NAEP has expanded the number of students it assesses and has undergone substantial changes in content, design, and administration. Taken together, these changes have produced complexities that threaten the entire program. This  report suggests ways in which the NAEP should broaden its conceptualization, assessment, and reporting. It asserts that educational achievement must be redefined in terms of what students need to know and be able to do for the 21st century and that education conditions must be created to support this vision of achievement. The fundamental purposes of the NAEP should be to inform the public and policy makers about student achievement trends in the nation and the states and to stimulate democratic debate about how to improve education. It is important that NAEP standards be set in defensible ways. Details are provided for a program of innovation and research that will require substantial planning before the reauthorization of the NAEP in 1998. These chapters are included: (1) &quot;The Central  Purpose of the National Assessment of Educational Progress&quot;; (2) &quot;What Should NAEP Measure?&quot;; (3) &quot;Measuring Achievement&quot;; (4) &quot;Informing the Nation&quot;; (5) &quot;Connecting to the Larger Network of Education Information&quot;; and (6) &quot;Planning for the Long Term.&quot; (Contains 7 figures and 43 references.)

Whether gender and ethnic groups would be disadvantaged by allowing calculator use was also studied. In addition, new nationally representative norms were obtained for PLAN, ACT, and the EXPLORE assessments. Results indicate that calculators may be used on the PLAN and ACT assessments without changing the  meaning of the test scores.

The CBE focus is on locally established curriculum goals. The achievement and ability testing requirement was established in 1987. It mandated that districts give commercially published norm-referenced achievement and ability tests to  students in grades 4 and 6 and a grade level to be designated by the State Board of Education in reading, language, and mathematics. Revisions in 1989 specified grade 8, and added grade 10. Proficiency tests were also initiated in 1987 to provide for statewide tests in reading, writing, mathematics, and citizenship. These tests are designed to see how students perform on specific learning outcomes identified by the state as important for all students. In contrast to the norm-referenced achievement and ability tests, these are criterion-referenced. Schools can use either type of test to meet the requirement for CBE instruction.

        "description":"This report provides background on statewide student testing and testing alternatives in Ohio. The status of achievement testing in other states is also discussed. Educational testing historically has included the two strands of intelligence testing and achievement testing. This report focuses on achievement testing. The two basic forms are criterion-referenced tests, which compare student achievement to a set of desired outcomes or standards, and norm-referenced tests, which compare achievement to that of other students who took the same test. Three common methods of statewide testing include written multiple-choice tests, performance-based tests, and portfolio assessment. To be successful at performance-based tests, students must be able to demonstrate their understanding of a  subject through complex or multistage problems that require the application of several skills at once. Portfolio assessment requires that samples of student work be collected over a period of time. To prepare for portfolio assessments, teachers provide feedback on how work can be improved and help students understand the criteria for selecting their best work for inclusion in a portfolio. How best to test students on a statewide basis depends on how the tests are to be used. Testing requirements differ among states, but 47 states require districts to test public school students at some time between grades 1 and 12. There is a national trend toward the use of performance-based tests or portfolio assessments. In Ohio, the ninth-grade proficiency test consists of three criterion-referenced  multiple-choice tests (mathematics, reading, and citizenship) and one criterion-referenced performance-based test (writing). An appendix discusses the early history of testing and the use of intelligence tests. (Contains seven exhibits.) (SLD)",

It is the first update of a new series designed to reduce the number of printed reports by updating Current Population Survey tables annually while issuing the full report only every other year. The tables in this compilation provide information on the 70 million people enrolled in nursery school through college. About 8.3 million children were enrolled in nursery school or kindergarten during the period, while elementary school enrollment stood at 31.8 million students. High school enrollment totaled 15.0 million people, and the annual high school dropout rate was 5.4%. The number  of people enrolled in college was 14.7 million, and about 6.0 million college students were 25 years of age or older. Data are estimates based on a sample survey and are subject to sampling variability since they are not based on a complete enumeration of the population.

        "description":"An electronic survey of a listserv discussion group, the Interdisciplinary Teamed Instruction (ITI) group, was conducted to learn more about the group and to explore surveying electronically. A 10-question survey was posted electronically, as were respondents' replies. Three reminders were posted over the 3-week reply period. The number of subscribers was estimated at 250 in the United States and 6 foreign countries. Twenty-three completed surveys were returned in the first 24 hours, and only 26 more were completed in the next 3 weeks, for a final response rate of 23.6%. Results suggest that the listserv is an active community of learners. They also demonstrate that defining the real population becomes a technological problem. If one were to hypothesize that an active electronic  community would respond better than other groups to a survey, these results would not support the hypothesis, although respondents to the initial effort provided very rapid responses. The major implications of the research approach are: (1) to calculate an accurate response rate, it is crucial to determine the exact number of listserv subscribers before first posting the survey; and (2) more efforts should be put into an electronic survey before its first posting, such as announcements. The survey text is attached. (Contains 11 references.) (Author/SLD)",

The first thing is to make achievement matter by taking the applicant's high school record into account. Employers can also work with the schools to enhance the achievement of young people they employ on a part-time basis as they go through school. Employers can promote experience-based education and strengthen the relationship between work and education. Teachers need to understand the needs of business and the skills their students need, and employers can educate teachers in these areas.  Teachers need to see and experience the workings of business first hand. Businesses can also support programs that help students choose and plan for careers.

        "description":"This article examines the implications of the shift, in England and Wales, from the previous National Curriculum assessment model based on the assessment of performance in relation to statements of attainment, to a model based on level descriptions founded on the recommendations of R. Dearing (1994). Both models reflect a common sense view that learning is marked by the stepwise acquisition of curricular objectives, but two key shifts in conceptualization have taken place. One is the move from a focus on actual performance on individual objectives to idealized performance on complexes of objectives, and the other is from a concept of hierarchical progression to one of cumulative progression. This article highlights some of the central weaknesses of the common sense view, in both  its original and reviewed versions, by reference to the findings of research on mathematics. Neither model takes sufficient account of the extent to which development and learning in mathematics involve progressive, but uneven, consolidation, coordination, and reorganization of knowledge, with stability of performance achieved only at the end of this process. A more fruitful, but controversial, way to move forward would be to conceptualize a pupil's learning as taking place in a development band, in which concepts are still being refined. The creation of such a system would demand the improved definition of attainment targets and scaling within them and the development of complementary regular and standard assessments. Reliance on politically expedient short tests is unlikely to prove  either trustworthy or informative. (Contains 10 tables and 47 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"One challenge associated with computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is the maintenance of test and item security while allowing for daily testing. An alternative to continually creating new pools containing an independent set of items would be to consider each CAT pool as a sample of items from a larger collection (referred to as a VAT) rather than as a permanent collection of items. This research investigated the viability of creating overlapping CAT pools from a static VAT by sampling items with replacement. The VAT used in this simulation consisted of approximately 5,000 precalibrated verbal multiple-choice items. Item pools were created, and simulations were performed to configure each of these item collections into CAT pools and to estimate the proportion of examinees at each  of 13 ability levels that were expected to see each item. Probabilities of administration were computed for each item and different numbers of examinees and item pools were simulated. As the number of pools increased, their quality decreased, and the proportion of items reaching the retirement threshold for test items decreased. As more pools were created, the potential for control increased. Results support the use of a VAT system as a way of drawing a compromise between test quality and test security.

In contrast, goal orientation research has focused primarily on two approach goals: demonstrating ability (performance-approach) and developing ability (task). A scale to assess the goal of avoiding the demonstration of lack of ability (performance-avoid) was included with scales assessing approach goals in a survey given to 703 sixth graders. Factor analysis supported the differentiation among the three scales. The performance scales were moderately positively correlated and exhibited low correlations with the task scale. With all three goals in regression equations, task goals predicted academic efficacy, self-regulated learning, and lower levels of avoiding seeking academic help in  the classroom. Performance-avoid goals negatively predicted academic efficacy and positively predicted avoiding seeking help and test anxiety. Performance-approach goals did not emerge as the most significant predictor of any of these educationally relevant outcomes. An appendix presents the test items.

Treatment-only designs (TODs) with self-recording by students can provide that measurement for educational practices in public school classrooms, and they may be a useful way for educators and educational researchers to share useful information. Such designs may be considered as an elementary or case study level of single-case research. Examples are given of inferences from TODs and how they may lead to more sophisticated designs. The development of this approach allows for a two-way  interaction between technology and science that promises some of the benefits that occur when technology and science are in close collaboration. Examples are given in the following areas in which TODs support: (1) self-recording; (2) self-recording with graphs rather than tables; (3) improving writing by increasing the rate of writing; (4) introducing more advanced single-case designs; (5) questioning a hypothesis; and (6) establishing the usefulness of types of instruction.

Piaget and his colleagues and training programs that have been designed to support the development of measurement skills. This literature is used as a background to argue that new investigations might include accounting for students' development in terms of social and cultural influences, coordinating research analyses with instructional development, and using psychological analyses to develop the instructional intent of further investigations. A teaching experiment that was conducted with 16 first graders is described to highlight a way to support mathematical development in the classroom context. It was clear that in this  classroom students' participation in the mathematical processes involved the use of many measurement tools. It is suggested that students' activities with these tools profoundly influenced their development of mathematical reasoning as interviews with the students demonstrated. Students developed ways of acting with the measurement strip and stick they were given that had numerical significance for them, and they were able to be relatively effective with these tools. They demonstrated intellectual capabilities they had developed during the experiment. (Contains 12 figures and 68 references.) (SLD)",

This report reviews the challenges encountered, how they are being addressed, and what the NBPTS effort has learned over the past 3 years. Scoring a performance assessment is the overarching consideration in developing an assessment. In current development work for the NBPTS, scoring is the framework for the design of tasks and the entire assessment. The following challenges have been faced in developing assessment and scoring: (1) defining scoring against task-independent standards; (2) handling a broad range of content and contexts; (3) resolving  pedogogical, cultural, and contextual bias; (4) interpreting unfamiliar representational forms and content; and (5) defining &quot;The Standard&quot; in setting the cut score. The NBPTS scoring system has evolved dramatically over the last 3 years into a process that makes certification decisions much fairer and more defensible. Without a coherent design process that begins with a clear sense of the desired claims to be made about a candidate, scoring will be found lacking. (Contains four figures.) (SLD)",

For English-as-a-Second-Language students, the World Wide Web provides a learning environment in which language skills can be developed through communication with native speakers of English. A framework, the Online American Culture Learning Center, was created to study cross cultural distance education through the Web. This experiment between Kent State University (Ohio) and the National Taiwan Normal University will create an English learning environment through the discussion of six major topics on the Internet: Thanksgiving,  Yellowstone National Park, American Football, Rock 'n Roll, Shopping Malls, and Garage Sales. Training materials for these topics are being used in a pilot study to assess their efficiency. Preservice teachers from Kent State University will serve as tutors and monitor student progress. Each tutor will have one student, who will correspond via e-mail. The project will explore whether online distance education can enhance learning in a foreign language and whether such exchanges promote multicultural understanding. Evaluation questions will be administered online, and surveys from students and tutors will be used to assess the feasibility of the approach. (SLD)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to investigate the stability of rater severity over an extended rating period. Multifaceted Rasch analysis was applied to ratings of writing performances of 8,285 primary school (elementary) students. Each performance was rated on two performance dimensions by two trained raters over a period of 7 rating days. Performances rated on the first day were rerated at the end of the rating period. Statistically significant differences between raters were found within each day and in all days combined. Daily measures of the relative severity of individual rates were found not to be invariant when compared to single, on-average measures for the whole rating period. For more than half of the raters, severity measures on the last day were significantly different from  measures on the first day. These findings must cast doubt on the practice of using a single calibration of rater severity as the basis for adjustment of person measures. (Contains 8 figures, 12 tables, and 31 references.)

        "description":"Passing scores for licensure and certification tests are justified by showing that decisions based on the passing score achieve the purposes of the credentialing program while avoiding any serious negative consequences. The passing score is justified to the extent decisions based on it have positive consequences. More specifically, the standard should be high enough to provide adequate protection for the public, and not so high as to restrict the supply of qualified practitioners unnecessarily or to exclude competent candidates from practicing. This paper begins by examining the intended outcomes of licensure and certification programs and by outlining the interpretive argument that is typically used for written credentialing examinations. Some criteria are developed for  evaluating standard-setting methods in terms of how well they serve the goals of protecting the public, maintaining an adequate supply of practitioners, and protecting the rights of candidates. Finally, these criteria are applied to the Angoff procedure and to a generalized examinee-centered method. The Angoff procedure appears to suffer from inadequate controls on the judges' natural tendency to set high standards. The use of feedback on candidate performance would probably be a more effective control on this tendency to set high standards if it were given before or during the first round of ratings.

The school agreed to work with the Washington Research Institute to examine reform efforts in the developing school. The focus was on ensuring that the needs of special education students were being met as the school unfolded its reforms. The research project has demonstrated how a continuous cycle of focus group interviewing can be used to evaluate school improvement efforts and set the stage for introducing research-based practices. Four percent of the student body at its opening (31 students) were in special education, and 3 special education teachers were included in the school's staff of 37. A team of educators has been meeting every 2 weeks to examine the  school's inclusion policies and practices, and summaries of the findings of a number of focus groups have been instrumental in the team's evaluations. The focus group methodology was less expensive than individual interviews, but it allowed students, parents, and educators to interact and express opinions about reform efforts. Over the 4 years, the team has completed 11 focus group interviews. These interviews have provided both external constituents and school personnel with insight into effective inclusion-based practices and have provided a process for understanding unified school development.

Input from leaders of the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) was used to develop a questionnaire that was refined and distributed to 102 participants at the ASCA annual meeting. Responses of 1,127 ASCA members provided the data. Results clearly establish that school counselors strongly and broadly wish to have national standards. They generally believe that national standards will identify a focal point for practice, articulate a professional mission, provide a center for  aspiration, and drive momentum for the future of the profession. These findings can be a foundation for the development of national standards for school counseling programs, but considerable thought, exploration, and conversation will be needed to ensure that the voice of the practitioner is not lost as standards are developed.

        "description":"This paper reports on the development and implementation of the quality audit, a methodology designed to help school systems examine their capacity for change using the principles of total quality management as a framework for analysis. Total quality management stresses the importance of continuous improvement of organizational processes, resulting in the delivery of high quality educational services. Quality is defined by the organization's \"customer,\" the end user of the product, and it requires attention to the entire system. The quality audit uses the features of total quality management as a framework for analyzing the efficacy of school district administrative structures and processes. In operation, a small team of researchers works with a district steering committee to  structure the audit and provide ongoing feedback on the way to the final report. The quality audit is not a job analysis. Instead, it takes a more systemic approach. Specific barriers to performance or customer service issues related to particular areas might be identified, but the overall focus is on the delineation of themes across functions. Over the past 7 years, the quality audit has been used in a dozen school systems. Data from one suburban district are used to illustrate the process. A consistent theme is the extent to which central office and school administrative functions need to be delivered with a focus on customer service. Findings in the district highlighted reflect breakdowns in the delivery of quality support services that over time produced anxiety, antipathy, and low  morale. As a result of the quality audit, the district experienced a remarkable degree of change. Areas in need of attention were identified and organizational members collaborated in dialogue about change. An appendix contains the school climate survey used in the audit. (Contains 21 references.) (SLD)",

The state's Higher Education Coordinating Board is required by law to establish minimum requirements for admission to Washington's public baccalaureate institutes. The current policy, adopted in 1987 and fully implemented in 1992, sets certain course requirements for students to define the minimum standards for college entrance. In 1993, a new approach was enacted into law that requires the state to develop a new approach centered on mastery of certain skills, demonstrated through a Certificate of Mastery. The Commission on Student Learning founded through the same legislation has established standards for what students know  and should be able to do at certain points in their academic learning experience. Assessments that incorporate these learning requirements have been developed and piloted for grade 4 and are under development for grade 10. The competency-based admissions project has so far been a model of school-college cooperation. The competencies have been established for English, mathematics, world language, science, social studies, and art. Assessments will be developed that support these competencies, and reporting standards will be devised to reflect achievement. Once the standards, assessments, and reporting form are complete, they will be pilot tested in three restructured high schools. (SLD)",

The focus is on the cognitive task methodology used in the development of three intelligent tutoring systems to inform their instructional content and approach, and how task analysis results are reflected in particular features of one of these tutors. A well-conducted cognitive task analysis (CTA) can give a system developer information about the knowledge and skills students find difficult. In the three developed systems, a CTA methodology called PARI (Precursor (goal), Action, Result, and Interpretation) (3) informed the design of coaching and postproblem reflection. These systems,  Sherlock, Hydrive, and Eaglekeeper, are designed to give those who maintain F-15 aircraft feedback about their reasoning errors and violations of good troubleshooting practice. Examples show how the PARI methodology informed the development of these systems, and results with 18 tutored novices, 23 untutored novices, and 13 master technicians are presented to show the efficacy of the training. The two fully developed systems are proving efficient and practical in improving student performance. The third, Eaglekeeper, remains in an earlier stage of development. Work with these systems illustrates the importance of early CTA to save time and effort in system development. (Contains 10 figures.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The need for effective ways of monitoring the quality of scoring of portfolios resulted in the development of a software package that provides scoring leaders with updated information on their assessors' scoring quality. Assessors with computers enter data as they score, and this information is analyzed and reported to scoring leaders. The developed structural scoring approach, PerformAce, was tested with responses of teachers to the portfolio component of a teacher certification assessment developed by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS). Assessors used the PerformAce software as an electronic scoring form with screens that display the description of an attribute at different levels of performance attached to a scale. When all attributes are scored,  the program asks assessors for a holistic score for the examinee's performance. Both attribute and holistic scores are stored in the assessor's computer and then transferred to a central computer to allow scoring leaders to identify patterns of ineffective or inefficient scoring. The approach was used with the field test of an NBPTS art teacher examination with eight portfolio entries and four assessment center exercises. Assessors were 127 art teachers who rated 928 portfolio responses. The best possible estimate of the reliability of the assessment was 0.81, and using computers did not affect this reliability. Almost all of the assessors (94%) agreed that the approach helped them make informed decisions and 73% of the scoring leaders thought the software helped them preserve the quality  of scoring. Results suggest that the computer-assisted scoring approach does not have an adverse impact on interrater reliability and that computers can be useful tools to manage scoring sessions.

However, this assumption has not been subjected to rigorous economic analysis. This paper briefly examines the evidence that does exist that links existing and projected educational standards and economic productivity. By educational standards, the discussion refers to specific knowledge or analytical requirements expected of students at each level of the educational system. In this spirit, the paper addresses what is known about the predictive validity of test score performance for worker productivity. It also asks about the impact of the \"new standards\" on economic outcomes. It is concluded  that present evidence on the link between educational standards and worker productivity is extremely weak relative to the assertions made on the connection. In addition, given the low predictive validities of available measures, there is a potential for reducing national economic efficiency and fairness in employment selection, the very opposite of what reformers intended.

It was hypothesized that students' perceptions of control would show no effect on their scores on an objective test of knowledge but that they would produce unique variance beyond the knowledge test in the scores on a performance assessment. Seventy-seven 9th graders taking Spanish participated in the study. Perceived control was measured by a scale constructed by J. P. Connell (1985). Students took an objective test and a performance assessment that involved a brief composition in Spanish. Results of a correlation analysis show that the Internal Control  scale is significantly though weakly correlated to the performance assessment score. The objective test score is also significantly related to the performance assessment score, although not at the expected level. All study results coincide with the theoretical relationships hypothesized. In this example, the objective test tapped the verb forms and vocabulary students knew, while the performance assessment evaluated what they could use. The question is what the assessor really wants to find out. An appendix presents the performance assessment task. (Contains 1 table and 12 references.) (SLD)",

A decision was made to explore the use of a professional portfolio for each certified employee of the school system of Livingston Parish. The portfolio process was implemented in all the district's schools, but this report focuses on a qualitative 2-year examination of its implementation in one rural elementary school (grades 3-5) with 23 teachers. It was evident that these teachers' portfolios could be classified along a continuum of meaningful experiences ranging from a scrapbook product to a more reflective process piece. It was apparent that it was the quality of the activity and not the quantity of activities that enhanced the process of instructional  supervision. For the portfolio to be a useful tool, the focus needed to be on selection rather than collection. Assessment of the items included in the portfolio promoted discussion and professional growth rather than simply credentialism. The more process-oriented the portfolios, the greater the collaboration and collegiality among individuals. In addition, the more involved the faculty became in developing individual portfolios, the more value was placed on the collaborative culture of the school. Two appendixes contain the teacher self-evaluation form and the professional growth evaluation form from the teacher assessment. (Contains 11 references.) (SLD)",

They have noted that assessments belonging to the same type of task can be scored for the same performance properties. This paper reports on the relationship between the characteristics of the task and the characteristics of the scoring system for assessments involving classification and observation. The development of two such tasks, a classification task called \"Sink and Float\" and an observation task called \"Daytime Astronomy,\" is described. Scoring systems are also described. Sink and Float asks students to identify weight and size as dimensions critical to sinking and floating,  while Daytime Astronomy asks students to project shadows in a box with a flashlight and solve location problems through the \"sun\" shadows. Sink and Float was tested with 2 5th-grade classes (32 students) who were rated by 2 raters. Daytime Astronomy was piloted with 3 5th-grade classes (58 students). There were reasonably high interrater reliabilities for both assessments, and the problems presented in each assessment distinguished different types of knowledge with the domain addressed by the assessment. Results suggest that observation assessments in particular address a very elusive kind of knowledge. Additional study is needed before these assessments are ready for general use.

These latter studies can be understood as providing construct-related evidence of validity. The four test batteries studied were: (1) the enhanced ACT Assessment; (2) the Collegiate Assessment of Academic Skills; (3) the Pre-Professional Skills Test; and (4) the state's locally developed comprehensive basic skills instruments. Three groups of participants provided data for the different types of studies conducted: 1,190 undergraduates, higher education faculty and administrators, and  educators for kindergarten through grade 12. Content-related validity reviews were conducted by higher education faculty, and empirical studies involved test results from undergraduate students. Using both types of studies provided the opportunity of evaluating the appropriateness of sole reliance on the single, almost commonplace, content validation approach. These findings indicate that reliance on the content validation studies would have resulted in different recommendations than those that emerged from the broad-based empirical studies.

        "description":"Most human gradings of essays are holistic, or &quot;overall.&quot; Therefore, Project Essay Grade (PEG), an attempt to develop computerized grading of essays, has concentrated most of its research on overall grading. It has successfully simulated human judges. However, since computer grading is less expensive than human grading, PEG has also explored the grading of traits within the essay (content, organization, style, mechanics, and creativity). PEG has found it possible to simulate multiple judges in grading such traits, but to make practical use of trait scores, it is important to discover how the traits vary within the students. In this study, 8 judges rated 495 essays on the 5 focal traits and the overall quality. Taking the holistic score as the overall essay value, researchers then  studied the residuals of each trait from the holistic. These residuals turned out to be strikingly predictable. Using these traits and multiple judges, PEG programs may apparently supply diagnostic ratings together with the holistic scores. These may serve for the information of individual students and for use by teachers, school leaders, and test researchers. (Contains 4 tables and 18 references.) (Author/SLD)",

They were among the many studies presented at the General Assembly of the INES Project in Lugano (Switzerland), September 16-18, 1991. Taken together, these papers present what is currently known about the organization, development, measurement, and uses of international education indicators. Attention is given to the political contexts within which education indicators are used for informing policy-makers. The 18 chapters deal mainly with conceptual and analytical issues in the organization of education indicators. They are grouped thematically into four parts.  Part I, &quot;History and Definition of Indicators,&quot; presents a framework for the other contributions. Part II, &quot;Development of Indicators,&quot; discusses issues in the development and implementation of different types of indicators. Part III, &quot;Indicators of Outcomes of Education,&quot; is concerned with indicators of learning, student achievement, and other educational outcomes, such as labor market destinations. The five chapters in Part IV, &quot;Interpreting Indicators for Policy,&quot; focus on the uses and abuses of reporting and interpreting international education indicators.

Another research objective was to compare course-taking patterns to results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), an assessment of educational achievement nationwide. In 1994, transcripts were collected for more than 25,000 students who graduated from high school that year. These students were from 340 schools that participated in the NAEP.

This report presents the major results of the NAEP 1996 science, mathematics, reading, and writing long-term assessments. These results chart trends going back to the first year in which each NAEP assessment was given: 1969-1970 in science, 1973 in mathematics, 1971 in reading, and 1984 in writing. Trends in average performance over these periods are discussed for students at ages 9, 13, and 17 for science, mathematics, and reading, and for grades 4, 8, and 11 for the writing assessment. Trends in average performance differences between White and Black Students, White and Hispanic  students, and male and female students are also discussed. In general, the trends in science and mathematics show early declines or relative stability followed by improved performance. In reading and writing the results are somewhat mixed; although some modest improvement is evident in the trend for reading assessments, few indications of positive trends were evident in the writing results. More in-depth understanding is achieved by examining the types of abilities associated with different levels on the NAEP scale and the percentages of students who have gained these levels across the trend assessment.

The NHES is a data collection system of the National Center for Education Statistics that provides descriptive data on the educational activities of the U.S. population and offers policymakers, researchers, and educators a variety of statistics on the condition of education in the United States. The primary purpose of the NHES is to collect repeated measurements of the same phenomena at  different points in time, but one-time surveys of topics of interest may be fielded. The NHES is a telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of the United States, and households are selected using random digit dialing methods. The NHES has been conducted in 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1996. This guide contains the following sections: (1) introduction and overview; (2) brief descriptions of the separate NHES data files; (3) comparisons with other data sets; (4) familiarization with the data and descriptions of data collection and processing; (5) selecting variables for working data sets; (6) NHES design; (7) working with missing data; and (8) weights and estimation procedures.

Forty state governors have indicated  their support for school choice, and at least 41 states have significant policy groups or grassroots coalitions working for school choice. Ten states have implemented charter school legislation, and many other states are deliberating about charter schools. Several thousand students attended the school of their choice under 1 of 16 privately sponsored voucher programs in 1994. Each state summary includes a statement about the position of the governor.

        "description":"How one public school used its diversity to foster community, while protecting itself from exclusivity, was studied. This study challenges the assumption that a community-like ethos is impossible in an urban neighborhood public school that has no special admissions requirements. Case study methodology, with almost 250 hours of observation of classes, school activities, faculty meetings, governance council meetings and parent meetings, and semistructured interviews provided a portrait of Jackson Elementary School, part of the Los Angeles (California) Unified School District. In the fall of 1995, at the time of the study, the population of the school was 92.6% Hispanic, and over 95% of the students qualified for free or reduced-price meals. The school operated on a year-round  schedule, as it had for more than 15 years. The 1,170 students and 42 teachers were divided into 3 tracks, each of which attended school for 2 months and was off for 1 month. Experiences at Jackson School provide evidence that community and diversity need not be in conflict. At Jackson, the individual was valued and divergent opinions were protected so that people felt less need to defend entrenched positions and more willingness to share. Through the celebration of cultures and the recognition of a plurality of voices, the school used its diversity to help strengthen community. School members were protected from losing their individual identities because of their strong commitment to care for one another and their mutual respect and trust. The freedom that teachers had to teach in the  ways they felt best was grounded in the trust that faculty, staff, and parents had for each other. The negative characteristics of community, such as exclusivity or intolerance, were counteracted by trust and respect and the celebration of diversity. (Contains 42 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"A historical and qualitative analysis of a northern urban de facto segregated school is presented that explains the unique factors of the school's history that led to the maintenance of the school today. The focus is on the school's context, its historical and present-day leadership, and its past and present teachers. In considering the school's urban context, the most important factor is the political process. The Champion Avenue School, Columbus, Ohio, was built and made into an all-black school because it was in the heart of a growing African American community, and not because it was legally defined as an all-black school. The racial segregation at Champion was de facto, but it accomplished the purposes of placing black students and black teachers together. Leadership, in the  persons of the school's early principals, made it a significant force in its impoverished community. Profiles of the school's principals from its founding in 1910 through desegregation show the essential role they played. Without the support of an exemplary teaching staff, however, Champion Avenue School could never have been the community force it has been. While its founding faculty was all black, the school presently has a white majority teaching staff. The school's teaching legacy is preserved by some dedicated and caring faculty members who focus on the needs of the urban child, and who recognize the role of the school in the black community.

        "author":["Vojnovich, Christine M."],
        "description":"This report describes a program to use various instructional strategies to increase student motivation in the learning process. The targeted population was high school students in a multicultural, middle-class community in a suburb of Chicago (Illinois) with 1,926 students. The problems of low participation, off-task behavior, and inadequate processing skills were noted through teacher observation, checklists, and conduct reports. Faculty reported that lack of student motivation came from content-oriented classes that provided little opportunity for students to create individual expressions and to find relevance in the materials presented. Further analyses revealed that students were unprepared to apply critical thinking skills to problem solving tasks. A review of solution  strategies suggested by research and an analysis of the problem setting resulted in selection of three major intervention strategies: (1) the introduction of a variety of critical thinking tasks; (2) the use of cooperative learning techniques; and (3) the practice of writing reflective journal entries to enhance metacognition. Generally positive results were apparent from each of the interventions. Participation increased, reflection and metacognition were enhanced through journaling, behavioral problems decreased, and a higher level of critical thinking was apparent in problem solving. In addition, the practice of cooperative learning activities resulted in a comfortable peer environment where students experimented with new and creative responses to the challenges of daily assignment.  Fifteen appendixes present lesson plans and supplemental materials. (Contains 1 table and 17 references.) (Author/SLD)",

Teachers in everyday long block schedules are significantly more satisfied with student achievement as reflected in their grades than are teachers in alternating long block and everyday short block schools. Teachers in everyday semester block schools report more than teachers in alternating and everyday short block schedules that attendance is significantly better than three years earlier. Teachers in everyday semester block schools and the alternating day with a study block schedule rated their schedules higher than other alternating block schedules, but the everyday semester block schedules received the most favorable rating by its teachers.

Students in everyday long  block schedules also reported that their teachers used significantly more group instruction than students in the other block schedules, and observation suggested that use of group instruction increases as the number of minutes in class increase. Students in everyday semester long block schedules also reported that their teachers were more likely to use portfolios. No significant findings were associated with schedule type for homework, student-teacher relationships, curriculum, and student satisfaction.

Two traditional-day schedules and four variations of block scheduling were compared. Teachers and students in alternating and semester block schools reported that learning is not watered down, but that it is different, with more focus on concepts than facts, more depth, and more problem solving. Students in semester block schedules experienced  greater increases in overall grade point average than those in alternating block schedules. In general, verbal scores rose more in schools that switched to an alternating or semester block schedule than mathematics. Increases in Scholastic Aptitude Test scores were greater for students in alternating block schedules than for students in semester block schools, but after the first year, students in four of the seven schools that switched to either type of block scheduling experienced increases in verbal scores. In two of four alternating block schools, student performance on advanced placement tests declined, as it did in the two semester block schools. Overall, attendance was not positively affected by the change, but in both alternating and semester block schools, students reported that  school was &quot;calmer&quot; and teachers made fewer disciplinary referrals.

        "description":"The instructional strategies teachers and other school personnel have used in the successful remediation of students who have failed reading and writing portions of the Virginia Literacy Passport Test (LPT) or the LPT Predictor Test were studied. The intent was to determine if specific approaches seem to work best for different types of students and whether particular materials, teaching strategies, scheduling, or other factors are associated with successful remediation. A qualitative research design was used that relied on focus group interviews of 16 elementary school teachers (2 groups) and 18 middle school teachers (3 groups). Findings suggest that the key to successful remediation is student engagement in learning and applying needed skills. Some general principles were  identified that appear to foster student engagement. On a schoolwide level, these include organizational commitment to successful remediation, cohesiveness of effort, and a systematic plan that includes identification of students, diagnosis, and feedback to teachers. On an individual level, teachers need training, commitment, and a sense of shared responsibility to help students succeed. Specific strategies that appear to be helpful include teaming, teaching test-taking skills, practice, small groups, individualized attention, modeling, close supervision, peer instruction, and activities and materials that hold student interest and motivate them to succeed. Four appendixes contain the principal nomination form for focus group participation, the topic outline, and codes for responses.  (SLD)",

The R.F.P. Team for which the report was prepared requested that the problem be studied in the contexts of: (1) school organization issues; (2) counseling issues; (3) factors related to minority participation in the sciences; (4) increasing the pools of minority students and teachers; (5) learning styles of at-risk students; (6) issues related to dropout; and (7) financial aid. Part One of the report reviews the current status of minority students, particularly blacks, in the United States, with a discussion of educational policies and  related factors that have an impact on the college preparation of minority students. Part Two highlights model programs to increase the number of minority students prepared for college. Many of these programs are collaborative efforts between public schools and business and industry. It was found that many school organization policies and practices, including tracking, retention in grade, and special education placements have a long-term and detrimental impact on black and other minority students. In addition, no plan to increase participation of minority students should ignore the impact of the school guidance counselor. Excellence, in terms of school resources or community programs, requires real dollar commitments, and it does not come cheaply.

        "description":"Issues related to educational technology are examined from the equity viewpoint, and suggestions are made to address equity issues. Equity in school computer use must involve not only equal access but also equal consideration of the learning needs of poor, minority, and female students. Unfortunately, equity has become a quantitative idea, measured by counting computers and computing averages and ratios. This leads to ignoring the inequities found between rich and poor, urban and rural, and minority and nonminority students. Equity issues related to educational technology have been defined as: (1) access to computer literacy and computer-assisted learning; (2) tracking through differential users of computer technology; and (3) exposure to gender bias and stereotyping in  educational software. The evidence seems to be clear on the relationship of socioeconomic status and equitable distribution and use of computers in schools. Other factors may be related to equity, such as the design or content of software and amounts of keyboard time. Standards could be developed to address potential inequities in computer use, and school policies should incorporate ideas into their technology policies that include all faculty in training and expose all students to computers in at least one learning situation. Equitable software, parent training sessions, and the infusion of computers into the curriculum are among the approaches educators should take to ensure equity in educational technology use. (SLD)",

        "description":"The purpose of this research brief is to summarize the literature on research conducted with at-risk students. Emerging from the research are three central groups of factors that are characteristic of at-risk students: (1) social and family background; (2) personal problems; and (3) school factors. In spite of the presence of several risk factors, there are some students who have developed characteristics and coping skills that help them succeed. These students can be termed \"resilient\" because they are able to recover from or adapt to life's stressors or problems. Resilient characteristics appear to fall into the same general categories as risk factors. Bearing these factors in mind, educators and policy makers need to foster protective mechanisms that encourage resilience, and  they should design programs that address early educational experiences and issues related to adolescent childbearing and other problems that can cause an end to schooling. Attributes of successful programs are: (1) early intervention; (2) positive school climate; (3) effective school personnel; (4) small class size; (5) parent involvement; (6) self-esteem and support building; (7) guidance and mental health counseling; (8) social and life skills/vocational education; (9) peer involvement and extracurricular activities; and (10) easing grade level transitions. Successful programs must also allow for the ages and grade levels of participants, with appropriate activities and lessons. (SLD)",

        "description":"A study of resilient at-risk students was commissioned by the Metropolitan Educational Research Consortium to identify factors that students believed contributed to their academic success. Sixty-two resilient and academically successful at-risk students from six school divisions took part in in-depth interviews. Factors identified by students were classified into thematic categories. Positive use of time and meaningful involvement in school or other activities were frequently mentioned by students as success factors. In addition, the majority articulated clear and specific long-term goals. Students' personal responses indicated that they had an internal locus of control and accepted personal responsibility for their successes and failures. The perceived influence of school and  teachers was inversely related to grade level. Younger students thought that teachers and counselors played a more important role in their successes, while older students had more neutral attitudes toward school. Almost all of these students had come from dysfunctional homes, but most could name one or more persons who had been significant in helping them. These findings indicate that there are important environmental factors that influence the development of strong, resilient personalities and beliefs. Results of this study, taken with other research findings, suggest several general recommendations that will help translate the findings into help for at-risk students. Sharing information, planning and evaluating programs, selecting and evaluating personnel carefully, providing preservice  and inservice education, and targeting programs carefully are important aspects of programs for developing resilience.

        "description":"Recent research by the Metropolitan Educational Research Consortium has led to the development of a resiliency model that helps explain why some at-risk students actually do well in school. The recent investigations have determined that some students develop traits that enable them to be successful in school. The model suggests that four environmental factors come together to form a psychological support system that reinforces the personal traits that lead to resilience. This support system is composed of: (1) significant relationships with adults; (2) positive use of time; (3) motivation through encouragement and high expectations; and (4) acknowledgment through recognition and accomplishment. The support system enhances the development of personal traits such as self-efficacy,  goal orientation, personal responsibility, optimism, internal expectations, and coping ability. The resiliency model can be operationalized in schools, beginning with awareness of the model and dissemination of its concepts. A school that decides to implement the four factors of the model must analyze its own performance and then identify the strategies that will bring about these objectives. There are no quick and easy answers to solving the problems of at-risk students, but putting the factors of the resiliency model into place provides a process schools can use to develop a favorable climate.

        "author":["Sheridan, Jennifer T."],
        "description":"Although occupational sex segregation has decreased over the last 25 years, it is still a major social concern primarily because of the role it plays in perpetuating the gender wage gap. This paper uses data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, a study that followed a random sample of 10,317 high school graduates, to assess the determinants of women's movement into and out of male-dominated occupations. In this study, the gender type of occupations changes with time; that is, the shifting gender compositions of occupation categories from 1960 to 1990 is taken into account. Event history analysis is used to ascertain the relative risk of a woman's entering and leaving a male-dominated occupation. The hazard rates are then used to project the change expected in the overall  distribution of women in male-dominated and nonmale-dominated occupations, and periods out of the labor force, over time. The analysis evaluated gender role socialization and neoclassical economic theories of occupational sex segregation by including a number of covariates that measure background characteristics and the timing of life course events of the woman, characteristics of jobs the woman enters over her career, and indicators of opportunity in the local labor market. The results show support for sex role socialization as an explanation for women's movement into sex-atypical occupations, and show that having aspirations for a male occupation, in particular, is associated with increases in the percentage of women employed in male-dominated occupations over time. Neither neoclassical  economic theories nor demand-side theories are well-supported. These results are compared with those of J. A. Jacobs (1989), and it is concluded that sex role socialization is important in perpetuating occupational sex segregation. (Contains 7 tables, 6 figures, and 45 references.) (Author/SLD)",

        "description":"Congress justified the recent reform of federal welfare policy in part by citing the increase in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) caseload since the late 1960s. The caseload, i.e., the number of families using AFDC, is determined by the number of families eligible to participate and by the proportion of these families who use the program. Yet the debate over reforming welfare rarely paid attention to the latter, ignoring the participation rates among female heads of families. While the number of cases changed little during the early to mid-1980s, the percentage of families with single female heads who used AFDC declined. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, both caseloads and participation rates increased. This paper documents the changes in participation  rates since the mid-1980s, racial and ethnic differences in participation rates, and factors that might be associated with these changes. Several sources of data, including the Current Population Reports from the Bureau of the Census, are used. The only major trend that consistently parallels the changes in participation rates is the trend in unemployment. Existing data do not permit the conclusion that unemployment is the major determinant of participation rates. If unemployment were to drive participation rates, however, the recent changes in welfare legislation may create serious problems for many female heads of families in periods of high unemployment.

The answer to the first question is that the likelihood of permanently leaving AFDC decreases with the length of time that individuals receive benefits, after adjustments for other measured and unmeasured attributes of individuals and their families. The answer to the second question is that not having a high school diploma, never having married, having more than two children, and having little work experience are  associated with long-term receipt. Many of the recipients who will reach the 5-year limit imposed by the new federal legislation are in situations that make it difficult for them to support themselves and their families without public assistance.

        "description":"One in 10 Americans is of Hispanic origin, and Census projections show that in about 10 years, Hispanics will constitute the largest minority group in the United States and, by 2035, 1 in 5 Americans will be Hispanic. This survey of leading and lagging indicators of economic well-being shows that on several measures, Hispanics have demonstrated economic stability and even some upward mobility. Latino men are more likely than any other group to be working or looking for work, and Hispanic women have increased their participation in the work force over the last decade. In the past 5 years, both the number of Hispanic-owned businesses and the total dollars spent by Latinos in the economy have increased significantly. At the other end of the economic spectrum, a substantial  proportion of Latino families face serious economic challenges. Hispanics have the lowest levels of educational attainment of all Americans, and in 1995, Latinos were the only group to experience a 5.1% drop in median income. Household income among Hispanics is currently only about two-thirds that of White household income. Hispanics are the poorest of all the racial and ethnic population groups in the United States, and the largest share of the increase in poverty among Hispanics has been for two-parent households. Another concern is that the proportion of Hispanics who have no health insurance is substantial. This is, in part, explained by the fact that Hispanic workers tend to be in low-wage, low-growth jobs, and consequently are especially likely to spend a large share of their income  on rent. The typically low socioeconomic status of Latino immigrants affects the overall profile of Hispanics, but it does not fully account for these striking disparities, since the majority of Hispanics are not immigrants.

The sample included 51 8- and 9-year-old African American girls of various socioeconomic levels from the Girls' Health and Development Project--a longitudinal investigation of girls; social, emotional, and physical development during middle childhood. Findings suggested that poorer mothers engaged in socialization practices less often than mothers with higher incomes. Mothers' temperament and social support were also highly predictive of mothers' engagement in racial socialization. Findings also reveal that maternal socialization is highly predictive  of girls' developmental outcomes. Engaging in racial socialization may be a way African American mothers can promote healthy development in their children. (Contains two tables, three figures, and nine references.) (SLD)",

It defines and describes elements of self-esteem, and links self-esteem to self-worth, learners' social environmental cues, teacher attitudes, and other variables. At-risk youth carry the additional burden of internalizing disapproval based on behavior associated with race and poverty. Stressing the importance of self-esteem of minorities to academic achievement, this work suggests specific classroom strategies for building positive self-esteem in at-risk students. To improve the self-esteem of students, teachers must first consider their own self-esteem, because teachers with high self-esteem are more effective teachers. The teacher who is committed to enhancing  self-esteem must develop a classroom environment that promotes self-esteem in an atmosphere of positive social values. Strategies that enhance cooperation and social responsibility also build the self-esteem of urban minority students. Research supports the contention that the academic achievement of minority students can be increased significantly if educators focus on positive self-esteem. (Contains 60 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"This testimony by the Director of Education and Employment Issues of the Health, Education, and Human Services Division of the General Accounting Office (GAO) is based on a number of GAO studies of substance abuse and violence prevention programs for youth. The testimony focuses on: (1) the information available about substance-abuse and violence-prevention programs and the federal government's investment in them; (2) what is known about the effectiveness of federally funded programs reducing youth substance abuse and violence; and (3) improving the federal effort by focusing more on accountability and results. Overall, GAO reviews have raised questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of the federal effort in these areas. The system that has developed, one of multiple  federal programs dispersed among several agencies, has created the potential for inefficient service and difficulty for those who are trying to access the most appropriate services and funding sources. For example, the GAO identified 70 federal programs used in 1995 to provide substance-abuse or violence-prevention services. These programs were located in 13 federal departments. In addition, state, county, and local governments provided billions of dollars for substance-abuse prevention and treatment efforts for adults and youths. Although the GAO has identified some promising approaches for preventing substance abuse and violence, the agency's research suggests that additional research is needed to test the effectiveness of these approaches and their applicability to different  populations. An appendix presents a chart of federal substance-abuse and violence-prevention programs. (SLD)",

Dana Foundation, convened a 2-day meeting in Austin (Texas) to focus on urban school district reform and restructuring. Participants, who included state policymakers, superintendents of several urban school systems, and a number of education researchers and scholars, assessed the progress of efforts to redesign urban school systems and worked to develop new approaches to the this complex task. To date, not a single large urban school system has proved capable of transforming itself fully. Even the most highly publicized and well-regarded reforms have yielded only minimal results. However, meeting participants identified a number of encouraging developments. These signs of positive  change included: (1) recognition by policymakers, elected officials, educators, and the public of the importance and urgency of improving urban schools' performance; (2) increased receptivity to bolder and more comprehensive approaches to redesigning urban districts; (3) a growing array of innovative programs, models, and strategies that are beginning to show results in terms of school quality and student achievement; and (4) external pressure for change that is coming from the charter school and voucher movements and state-level interventions such as privatization, district takeovers, and decentralization. After a brief look at some of these promising approaches, the report concludes with an in-depth look at three urban school districts--Baltimore (Maryland), Chicago (Illinois), and  Minneapolis (Minnesota)--where restructuring efforts are among the most creative in the nation.

Data came from student journals and grades for the interdisciplinary class and a comparison group of government and English students at another high school. Many differences were apparent for the two teachers, whose classroom styles were quite different. Instead of concentrating on traditional learning mode and teacher/student interaction, they  concentrated on student success as defined by the teacher and teacher success as defined by the student. Cooperative learning was a necessary tool in the interdisciplinary environment. Students who were given a more global education through the interdisciplinary class appeared more confident in accepting leadership roles and personal responsibility. Student grades were also higher than those from comparison students in traditional classes, and student attitudes became more positive as the year went on.

Most of these children had not been identified as having any learning difficulties, and most were not being given any type of medication to control behavior. Periods of time when children were allowed to interact socially were catalysts for runaway emotions. Children did not appear to be reacting to academic stressors, and there appeared to be as many different reasons for the anger as there  were children. Twenty of the 37 did not believe that the teacher disliked them. The role of diet was not clear, but most students reported having eaten a fast-food type breakfast high in fat and sugar. The relationship between males and aggressiveness was readily apparent, as all but one of the referred students were male. Implications for elementary school counselors and teachers are discussed. Since most students referred had not been identified as having problems in spite of a history of chronic anger, schools should consider ways to meet the needs of these students. (SLD)",

Initially they targeted four students, but later expanded their focus to the entire class. Use of a classroom observation sheet provided the instructors with information about the students and made the students aware that their behavior was being monitored. A behavior modification plan called Home Court was implemented, which helped students make the  connection between behavior and learning. Students designed the basic rules of Home Court and the \"technicals\" awarded when they did not demonstrate adequate responsibility. Student work began to reflect greater responsibility and to demonstrate greater grasp of the concepts taught. A similar approach to mathematics was implemented using a mathematics portfolio. As students began to take ownership for their tasks, they showed overall academic improvement. The project will be implemented in grades three through five in the next school year. (SLD)",

Technology alone cannot affect the ways in which teachers and students interact, but it can affect teacher roles in several ways. Teachers may feel that computers will replace them, or they may regard technology as just another tool. Some teachers believe that technology can transform curriculum, the teacher's role, and even school structure. In fact, technology can support traditional or learner-centered instructional philosophies, but teacher use of technology is generally influenced by their knowledge of the technology, access to instruction and support, and incentives that favor teacher use or disuse in the classroom. Teachers who do adopt a technology-based approach normally progress from being a presenter of knowledge to  being a coordinator of learning resources, being freed to work individually with students. Technology can be a medium of instruction or it can be a tool in support of the goal of teaching for understanding. Teacher-centered teachers tend to use traditional instructional methods and to regard learning technologies as basic skill reinforcers, motivators, or special treats. Learner-centered teachers usually choose individualized or collaborative approaches to engage students. Learner-centered teachers may be high technology users, or they may be reluctant to use technology because of personal fears and inhibitors. For successful technology use, teachers must be flexible in the roles they play. (SLD)",

In exemplary classrooms, student use of learning technologies is woven integrally into the patterns of teaching even though technology-using teachers can use resources in different ways, such as drill and practice, simulations, problem-solving activities, and productivity tools. For the majority of teachers, integrating use of computers into the curriculum remains a practice at the cutting edge, since several studies indicate that exemplary technology users are but 5% of the teaching population. Integrating technology into the learning process takes a great deal of  effort by the teacher, but teachers can be encouraged to adopt innovations in light of their own goals, the culture of the school community, and their own interpretations of the information they receive about new approaches. Most teachers cannot integrate computers into their classes without support. They need examples of computer use and training in computer techniques. As a result, exemplary computer-using teachers are likely to be found in districts that provide support for teacher learning and where leadership is concerned about equity of access. (SLD)",

        "description":"This research brief examines the potential of technology to further the goals of restructuring U.S. schools. Strategies are presented for restructuring schools with technology. Although restructuring means different things to different people, the restructuring movement has generally focused on reorganizing school processes, taking a constructivist and cognitive view of learning, and moving toward a well-integrated use of technology in the schools. Technology by itself cannot restructure schools, but it has an essential role to play in boosting educational productivity. A strategy for introducing technology in the schools could be based on principles of: (1) planning; (2) curriculum; (3) instruction; (4) access to computers; (5) teacher support; (6) effectiveness; (7)  connectivity; and (8) phasing in the activities. Two specific models for the use of educational technology are the Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow program and the Integrated Technology Classroom of the Bellevue School District (Washington). Several other applications, including some in urban schools, are described, using data from the Metropolitan Educational Research Consortium files. (SLD)",

        "description":"The challenge today in implementing educational technology is no longer one of acquiring equipment, but rather one of improved adoption, diffusion, and use of computers. Effective implementation requires effective planning and action to ensure equity of access to resources, coordination of resources, and developing infrastructures for information sharing. One approach, the adoption model, is to spread technology thinly, introducing technology a little at a time. Another approach, the political market model, stresses the role of the school division in spurring innovation. This model often includes pilot projects to drive implementation. The concerns-based planning model assumes that technology should be implemented in an area where it provides a direct benefit based on a defined  need. Planning assumptions should involve the uses of the technology, and planning guidelines defined by the National Task Force on Educational Technology specify that implementation should include a parent education component. Policy options should be spelled out in the plan, from curriculum through hardware and home and school links. Three examples of school district technology plans are provided. (SLD)",

The four schools selected were a rural high school, a suburban middle school, an urban elementary school, and an urban high school. Cross case analysis shows certain characteristics these schools shared. All were characterized by adaptability and the ability to change to suit the circumstances. Each of these schools had a vision of how the technology would be used. In all cases the principal and the media center coordinator were important to maintaining the momentum of the implementation. Planning efforts were diverse, and ranged from the top-down strategy of one school to the bottom-up planning of another. In one school, the small size of  the school allowed technology implementation to proceed informally. Several barriers to innovation had to be overcome in these schools, but planning made it possible to overcome staff and community resistance. Implementation of educational technology must be seen as a journey and not an event. (SLD)",

        "description":"This literature review focuses on the application of technology (primarily the computer) to education. No single vision drives the infusion of technology into the schools, although social, vocational, pedagogic, and catalytic rationales have been proposed. Technology has a role in school restructuring by standardizing and automating procedures. When the goal of restructuring is to bring about a learning environment that emphasizes complex problem solving and decision making, technology has much to offer the restructuring movement. It can help create a richer learning environment and can support either traditional or learner-centered instructional philosophies. Computers can have a significant impact on teaching style as they empower the teacher to serve as a facilitator of  learning rather than a transmitter of information. There seems to be a sequence from teaching without technology to becoming an accomplished integrator of technology into the classroom. Although instructional use and technology applications and resource applications differ according to grade level, teacher use seems to be quite similar across instructional levels. Any plan to implement computer use in the schools must feature teacher training and work to solve issues of student access to hardware and software. Although it has been demonstrated that educational technology can do the things it promises, there is still a lack of systematic implementation models. Appendixes present tables and figures illustrating the review and the focus questions that guided the review. (Contains numerous  references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"The National Center for Education Statistics reported that in 1992 approximately 4.5% of all high school students dropped out of grades 10 through 12, and 11% of all persons in the age group 16 through 24 had not completed high school and were not currently enrolled. The Communities in Schools (CIS) network is a web of local, state, and national partnerships that work together to fight the dropout problem and to bring the basics every child needs to at-risk youth. Most CIS programs take place inside traditional schools, but some are delivered through a CIS academy, a free-standing facility that is sponsored largely by an individual organization. The CIS classroom model allows students to sign up for the program as an elective class, while the academy model is organized as an  alternative school. The Urban Institute conducted an evaluation of CIS from 1991 through early 1994, tracking 594 CIS enrollees and evaluating the CIS programs as they existed 5 years earlier. The evaluation found that CIS had effectively promoted its model of social service delivery and had provided leadership that led to the expansion of CIS from 26 programs in 128 school sites to 93 programs with 612 schools by the end of 1993. High proportions of CIS students remained in school or graduated. The majority of students interviewed believed that participation has helped them. Five other programs that work with high-risk students are profiled, and the National Dropout Prevention Center/Network is described. Local, state, and federal agencies, through programs like these, are making strides  to keep youth in school and support them through graduation and beyond. (Contains eight references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"One suggestion for educational improvement is the implementation of specialized schools that offer specific training with a focus. New York and a number of other cities have turned to this choice to offer specialized schools of mathematics and technology. The movement is coordinated on a national level by the National Consortium of Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science, and Technology (NCMSSST). This paper describes the NCMSSST as an organization, and the considers Stuyvesant High School, New York City, as a case study of this type of school. The NCMSSST consists of 15 schools at present. Stuyvesant, established in 1904 as a manual training school for boys, is a founding member of this group. It grew into a highly regarded academic institution and became  coeducational in 1969. Admission is very competitive. Of the 11,000 students who indicated in 1996 that Stuyvesant was the specialized school they would like to attend, only 700 were admitted. About half the students are Asian, with 40% White, and only 10% either African American or Hispanic. However, 15% of each incoming class is admitted on the basis of diversity rather than test scores. Those who are admitted have a proven record of academic success and lifetime achievement, as both curriculum and teacher expectations support high achievement. The school adds much to New York City, offering an option for excellent students of all socioeconomic backgrounds. While there are some disadvantages, as discussed, and the school is open to some charges of privilege, it can serve as a model of  excellence in public education and an example to other urban schools. Eight interviews and two Web sites are cited. Contains an annotated bibliography of 40 entries. (SLD)",

        "description":"Across the United States, innovative school-linked health and human service programs are being implemented to provide assistance to children and youth in high-risk contexts. The programs have sometimes been hampered by limited resources and isolation from other service providers. The development of collaborative programs promises to overcome some of these problems. This paper is a first attempt to establish an empirical database that documents the relative effects of collaborative school-linked services for children and their families. Three features that have been identified for collaborative programs are: joint development of an agreement on common goals and objectives; shared responsibility for the attainment of goals; and shared work to attain goals using the collaborators'  expertise. There is no single model for collaborative school-linked services; programs should emerge from the needs of the populations they serve. The report summarizes evidence from 44 sources that describes collaborative school-linked programs. These studies are grouped into the six program areas of: (1) parent education and school readiness; (2) pregnancy prevention and parenting; (3) dropout prevention; (4) chemical dependency abuse and prevention; (5) integrated services; and (6) parent involvement. A review of these programs indicates that the complexities of the problems of at-risk children defy simple solutions, and that resources must be gathered from the community to address them. Empirical results from collaborative school programs are positive, but must be regarded cautiously  until further evaluations are completed. (Contains 1 table and 31 references.) (SLD)",

        "description":"Children are among the poorest of Maine's residents. Nearly 1 in 5 children under the age of 18, 19.3%, lived in families below the federal poverty line in the early 1990s. Most of these poor children lived in working families. The working poor are often missing from policy debates, but their numbers are likely to increase with welfare reform efforts. In Maine, working poor families represent a broad cross-section of the state's population. Job growth in Maine has been concentrated in industries with low average pay, and federal and state policies have contributed to working poverty. Because most poor children are in families with a worker, the high child poverty rate in Maine is unlikely to decline significantly without efforts to assist low-wage working families. Steps the  state could take to help the working poor include: (1) enacting a state earned income credit; (2) raising the minimum wage; (3) modifying the rules for aid to families with dependent children to allow families to earn more without a loss of benefits; (4) strengthening the unemployment insurance system; and (5) responding to the child care and health care needs of the working poor. As these policies helped alleviate child poverty, they would promote the broad goals of welfare reform by helping parents support their families. (Contains nine figures and seven tables.) (SLD)",

Direct and indirect impacts are considered. It is concluded that the number of welfare recipients in Los Angeles likely to slide deeper into poverty as a result of welfare reform is large. Planned reforms will mean a loss of jobs for Los Angeles County, and those expected to change from welfare to work will have grave difficulty securing employment. As some find work, others will lose opportunities. The County will face rising demands on its general relief program, health care services, and children's services, and it will lose Medi-Cal revenues. The extent  of social problems related to poverty, such as poor health, child abuse, hunger, and homelessness, may rise significantly. Many communities in the area will be affected, as the impact spreads beyond the immediate city. Neither the voluntary nonprofit sector nor the county of Los Angeles has the economic or political capacity to replace the social safety net or protect the health and welfare of the area's residents.

In examining the power of the gang to amplify violent conduct, there are at least three sets of causes that must be explored beyond the personal motivations of the perpetrators. These are the functions that violence serves for a gang, the impact organized crime can have on street violence, and the synergistic dynamics of certain cultural norms within gangs. Gang violence is a means to achieve desired ends, even though it is not good for society. One key to combating gangs is found in the power of the bonding process. Healthy groups should  be fostered by educators and community-based youth leaders. Most gang members are still connected to the community in some healthy ways, and their lives can be reclaimed if threats to their safety are removed, if they are helped to develop skills and attitudes that promote nonviolence, and if they are given the opportunity to bond as members of healthy groups.

Drugs, the availability of guns, and the emergence of gang problems in all regions of the country are among the causes of youth violence. Prevention of violence involves a continuum of care that starts at the beginning of a child's life, and continues through late adolescence. Delinquency is least likely to progress to adult criminality when the juvenile forms long-term relationships and the juvenile is able to obtain gainful employment. A section on \"Federal Programs of Note\" profiles Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT), Safe Futures Partnerships To Reduce Youth Violence and  Delinquency, and Youth Violence Prevention Projects. The regular section, \"The CIS (Communities in Schools) Connection\" describes a survey of violence prevention programs, 91 of which were part of the CIS network. Also included in this issue is a discussion of vital statistics in state education, which notes the enrollment, school system size, finances, and student characteristics of state school systems. The \"Recent Research Reports\" section highlights some trends that are important to the educational community, such as a decline in teenage births and a decline in reading achievement scores.

        "description":"The Conference on Improving Minority and At-Risk Student Achievement was convened to help educators, parents, community, and business leaders in North Carolina focus in strategies and ideas that work to raise student achievement levels for low-performing students. This report summarizes the remarks of Michael Garrett, the keynote address of Asa Hilliard, III, and comments from the youth forum that was part of the conference. Michael Garrett spoke about the traditional education and values of Native American children, drawing on experiences of Native Americans in North Carolina, and reminded his audience of the need for teachers to be knowledgeable about the beliefs and traditions of Native Americans. Youth presenters shared their experiences as members of minority groups, and  reflected on what is needed to ensure the academic achievement of minority students. Dr. Hilliard spoke of the necessity for high expectations for all students, and gave some examples of programs that have worked in raising the achievement of disadvantaged youth in urban and rural areas. Children will achieve regardless of the method used or the philosophy of the educator if the instruction is delivered properly. Also included is the &quot;Blueprint for Excellence&quot; document participants received as a stimulant to discussion. (SLD)",

        "author":["Mare, Robert D."],
        "description":"Recent commentary has suggested that the relatively high fertility of poorly educated women tends to dampen the average intellectual qualifications of the population. To evaluate this claim requires a model of population growth that takes account of fertility differences among women with varying levels of educational attainment and patterns of intergenerational educational mobility. This paper describes such a model and applies it to census, vital statistics, and survey data on fertility, mortality, and intergenerational mobility data for African-American and White women in the United States from 1925 to 1995. Although fertility rates are generally higher for women at the lower end of the educational distribution, this has had a negligible effect on the trend in average  educational attainment. These fertility differences are neither large enough nor consistent enough to lower educational attainment. More important, high rates of intergenerational educational mobility almost completely offset the effects of differential fertility. Although black women have historically had more children than white women, fertility differences within and between the races have not had much effect on educational inequality between the races. Indeed, in the most recent period, only white women continue to exhibit a negative correlation between education and fertility. Thus, if recent fertility patterns persist, they will accelerate a convergence of educational attainment between blacks and whites. (Contains 5 tables, 1 figure, and 33 references.) (Author/SLD)",

TU teachers are trained to be 'talent scouts' and to discard  stereotypes to see a new repertoire of behaviors that exemplify varied intelligences. The quality of student products from a TU classroom is elevated, often demonstrating outstanding potential. Examples are given of the use of TU training in several school districts, including Fort Worth (Texas), Nash-Rocky Mount (North Carolina), and Owensboro (Kentucky).

Research is showing that students possess potential for many kinds of thinking abilities that are important for success in the world of work as well as in school. These talents include, in addition to academic talent: (1) productive thinking, which enables a child to look at a problem creatively; (2) communication, which involves six related skills that help students describe and communicate; (3) planning; (4) forecasting talent, which is the ability to look into the past to see causes or into the future to make predictions; and (5) decision making. Academic talent is the foundation for a quality education. The other talent areas  require that students go beyond the recall level and think about the academic content in more challenging ways. In fact, the TU teacher always has an academic purpose for each talents activity in the classroom. Examples are given of the ways teachers might have students use the various talents, and the skills that make up the talents are described. (SLD)",

Based on Calvin Taylor's theory of multiple talents and intellectual abilities, this program develops improved thinking in specific talent processes, including Productive Thinking, Communication, Forecasting, Decision Making, and Planning, with the Academic talent as a frame of reference for all activities. Through Talents-trained teachers, students learn that there are many ways to express their intelligence and that different types of thinking can be enhanced through training and practice. Through Talents training, classroom teachers internalize a schema of creative and critical thinking skills and learn to integrate them  into the regular classroom curriculum. They learn to develop instructional activities that challenge students to manipulate factual information through the deliberate use of the Talents structure. Thinking skills taught in TU are neither grade level nor content specific, but may address any academic objectives to produce student response. However, the TU program was designed for implementation with heterogeneously grouped students in grades one through six. This report on the TU program relies on its implementation over 16 years in many sites. In 1989-90, TU was adopted at 2,033 schools across the country. Data for seven adoption sites are included to support the effectiveness of the TU approach. Seven appendixes contain sample teacher training and student activities, sample assessment  items, and a newsletter for the program.

The Forum for Public and Private Collaboration is committed to publicizing successful collaborative efforts while providing an outlet for educators involved in collaboration to share ideas and receive help. The 1996-97 research team for the Forum has concentrated on these goals. Goals of the Forum were promoted through the establishment of a Web site as a step toward developing and disseminating a theoretical basis for discussions of collaboration. A survey of collaborative programs resulted in preparation of case studies. Case studies are presented of collaborative efforts at Peninsula Bridge (California), ASCENT (a summer outreach program in  Tennessee), and Summit School and South Park High School, Winston Salem (North Carolina), and of two discontinued collaborative efforts. A review of these studies leads to the conclusion that six characteristics are crucial to successful collaboration: (1) mission; (2) real activity; (3) funding and resources; (4) open boundaries; (5) assessment; and (6) leadership. While these do not seem to occur in any particular order of importance, they all need to be present at some level for collaboration to be effective.

Data on the JOBS assignments and earnings and employment of a random sample of 12,556 members of the JOBS evaluation's treatment group were obtained from Ohio's automated JOBS tracking and unemployment insurance systems. A comparison of the employment and earnings patterns of treatment group members who did and did not ever receive E&amp;T assignments failed to uncover any statistically significant impacts of JOBS program participation for either the ever-assigned or never-assigned client groups. A  comparison of outcomes of different types of E&amp;T activity established that assignments to job clubs, postsecondary education, and job readiness training activities were generally associated with positive impacts, whereas assignments to basic education were associated with lower-than-expected earnings. Assignments to community work experience had no statistically significant effects on earnings. (Fourteen exhibits are included.

A sample of 760 midwestern college students reported their present college major on a demographic questionnaire and completed either the research version of the 1994 Strong Interest Inventory (SII) or the actual 1994 SII and the 1996 Skills Confidence Inventory (SCI). The students were divided into six groups based on categories of college majors that were formulated by using Holland's six general occupational themes (GOTs): realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional. Twelve univariate analyses of variance were used to determine the extent to which the GOTs and the six general confidence themes (GCTs) included on the SCI contributed to the separation of  students into six groups. F ratios were calculated to determine significance, and Wilks' lambdas were calculated at the univariate level to determine effect sizes for each GOT and GCT. Results suggest that self-efficacy and interests are related to college major in accordance with Holland's typology. The six SII GOTs and the six SCI GCTs predicted Holland majors. Combined, the GOT and GCT have even greater discriminant power. (Contains 12 references) (MN)",

The first installment of a 5-year study of the STWOA found little evidence that STW partnerships, as they are currently constituted, will be a viable collaborative infrastructure for a comprehensive STW system over the long term.

That literature clearly  demonstrates two things: the ineffectiveness of local work-education councils and the effectiveness of the Industry-Education Council model, which has been used extensively in planning and implementing career education during the past 3 decades. Individuals and groups involved in state and local STW initiatives must move beyond STW partnerships. They must do more to involve employers in STW, and they should begin accessing information and training from practitioners who have actually been involved in successful industry-education collaboration.

        "description":"A study examined the marketing research information required by those executives of Lakeshore Technical College (Wisconsin) whose decisions affect the college's direction. Data were gathered from the following sources: literature review; development of a data dictionary framework; analysis of the college's current information system through interviews with the four executive committee members; identification of ideal information requirements; and comparison of those requirements and the college's existing information requirements. Forty-four information requirements related to information use, system expectations, success criteria, and information needs were identified. Because only two of the college's current market research reports satisfied approximately 50% of the identified  information requirements, it was concluded that the college's currently available market research information does not meet the information needs of the college's executives. It was recommended that the college continue developing a data dictionary and integrating market research information and adopt a new process for determining information needs. Appended are the following: diagram of the Lakeshore Technical College System of Education's components; data dictionary component definitions; agenda for current analysis interviews; current analysis data capture form; agenda for requirements planning meeting; abbreviations made to prioritized statements; and responsibilities to information needs matrix.

Chapter 1 emphasizes the importance of safeguarding children and outlines the objectives and activities of the M/CAP and NSSC. Discussed in chapter 2 are the following considerations in hiring: rationale for and limitations of background checks; costs of failure to screen potential employees thoroughly; development of effective personnel policies; aggressive screening; criminal background checks; creation of a spirit of cooperation; and obstacles  impeding use of comprehensive record screening and background checks in schools and youth service agencies. Also included in chapter 2 are a screening policy statement, guidelines for screening and selecting employees and/or volunteers, and sample authorization and disclosure forms. Chapter 3 explains the tort of negligent hiring and considers the issues of conducting reasonable investigations and sovereign immunity. The good and bad news concerning record screening is summarized in chapter 4. Chapter 5 covers the policy intent of sex offender registration laws as well as their content and effectiveness. (MN)",

The program consisted of onsite training for home care providers and a support system to promote their professional development. The onsite training was delivered through 2-hour visits during which trainers and home care providers toured the home care area and discussed provider-identified training needs. A support system consisting of a resource library, family home care newsletter, and network support group was created. Provider response to the onsite training has been extremely positive and the network support group has continued to meet. The plan has proved to be an excellent vehicle for training home care providers and fostering their  continued professional growth and quality improvement. (The bibliography lists 13 references. Appended are the following: calendar plan for implementation activities; grant allocation; flyer for soliciting provider participants; provider profile and training needs self-assessment; home visit response; 2-hour training visit format; network directory of home care providers; postvisit questionnaire; newsletter; weekly written log; documentation of support group meeting; resource list of educational suppliers; and resource directory of local training and continuing education.)

Its vision statement and plan are designed to prepare all 1,500 students for life beyond high school into the world of work in the 21st century. The ECP plan addresses the need for students to attain high levels of technological skills and related academic competencies. It provides connections between the classroom and the real world and prepares students for at least 2 years of college training or apprenticeship beyond high school. The ECP plan consists of three components: school-based learning, work-based learning, and connecting activities. The plan is implemented through the following methods: freshman  participation in career-oriented field trips, extensive career counseling, and development of an individual career pathway; sophomore job shadowing; junior mentoring opportunities; and senior mentoring and/or internships/apprenticeships. Students choose among six career pathways: health, human service, business/communications, fine arts, agriculture/natural resources, and engineering/manufacturing. Career pathways emphasize focus on a career goal yet allow flexibility so students can change pathways. After successful completion of an ECP pathway, students receive a certificate of achievement. An additional component of the ECP plan is a coordinator housed with the Champaign-Urbana Chamber of Commerce who sets up all student work experiences. (YLB)",

Eleven tables reflect composite reporting of operations and outcomes for schools and libraries during the fiscal year and compared to the prior year. According to the report, service during the year was disrupted because of a state legislative debate over funding and subsequent unfilled staff positions. This situation had a negative impact on operations, although the final outcome in the legislature was positive. operations were negatively impacted by these events. The  final statistics reflect &quot;mixed&quot; results. High school diplomas issued fell by approximately 9 percent from fiscal 1995--from 895 graduates to 817. Literacy completions and occupational completions increased, whereas enrollment levels fell slightly from the year earlier, primarily because of vacant positions. Postsecondary education was practically eliminated from the program. On the other hand, the institutional libraries were enhanced and their technology upgraded, and services were increased. With the continuation of funding from the legislature, better results are expected in the next year. Two appendixes include minutes of a meeting of the council and state funding legislation. (KC)",

        "description":"The gap between Generation X and earlier generations represents much more than age and technological differences. It reflects the effects of a changing society on a generation. Social changes such as the increase in single-parent households and households with both parents working, corporate downsizing and layoffs, limited opportunities for career positions, and economic troubles at the society level have combined to create a generation characterized as follows: independent problem solvers and self-starters; technologically literate; responsive; focused; lifelong learners; ambitious; and fearless. Effective instruction requires that teachers target their teaching toward the unique characteristics of today's learners. The following are some suggestions for targeting instruction  toward the characteristics identified with Generation X: focus on outcomes rather than techniques; engage students in role playing and cooperative learning experiences; give students control over their own learning; respect learner's ability to engage in parallel thinking; give attention to the format of instructional materials; and engage students in creating their own learning environments and in completing projects that demand new skills and application of existing skills to new situations.

        "author":["Kerka, Sandra"],
        "description":"Popular education is a form of adult education that encourages learners to examine their lives critically and take action to change social conditions. Popular education's goal is to develop people's capacity for social change. Although it may assume diverse forms, popular education usually involves a cycle described as action/reflection/action or practice/theory/practice. Adult educators can facilitate the process by serving as democratic collaborators who ensure that learning, leadership, and self-direction occur in the group. Popular education often draws on popular culture (such as song, theater, dance, puppetry) to enhance communication among audiences, demonstrate respect for community values, enhance group spirit, and demystify the information conveyed. Because popular  education is often seen as threatening to dominant institutions, popular educators face numerous challenges, including the following: demands or constraints of funding sources; perceptions of the role of facilitators; disconnection between program goals and participant objectives; and the perception that it is too radical or revolutionary. The literature includes several examples of how adult educators have overcome these challenges and helped facilitate social transformation. The examples demonstrate that, although individual popular education programs may appear to have failed in their immediate goals, they may represent steps in the slow, complex and cumulative process of social change.

        "description":"Work-based learning may occur in the following forms: contracted instruction; cooperative education; school-to-apprenticeship; registered apprenticeship; career exploration; service learning; career internships; career academies; school-based enterprises; and clinical experience programs. The following are key components of work-based learning programs: planned program of job training and experiences; paid work experience; workplace mentoring; instruction in general workplace competencies; and broad instruction in all aspects of industry. Recruiting sufficient numbers of employers willing to commit to the high level of employer involvement implicit in work-based learning and ensuring that worksite learning is of high quality are the most important challenges in developing  programs linking school- and work-based learning. Employer involvement in work-based learning may be encouraged through a multifaceted approach that considers employers' capabilities and short-term interests and offers employers several possible paths of involvement and degrees of commitment. After a work-based learning program has been designed, its school and worksite components will require continuous coordination and management. At the secondary level, those tasks are best handled by school-to-work coordinators. At the postsecondary level, work-based learning programs may be based on a mix of work-based learning models and pedagogical approaches and a combination of personalized documentation and standardized performance-based competency profiles.

        "description":"Modern Apprenticeships, which were introduced in 1994, allow young people in the United Kingdom who do not want to commit to full-time further education the chance to achieve a National Vocational Qualification in their field while continuing in employment. The different models for delivery of Modern Apprenticeships that have been developed in further education were examined in a study of 12 further and higher education colleges delivering one or more Modern Apprenticeships. The sample, which was selected to reflect a cross-section of program sizes, occupational areas, geographic locations, and college settings, represented more than 25 different Modern Apprenticeships. Data on models of delivery, funding matters, partnerships and competition, and progression were collected  through two site visits of each college and a questionnaire administered to college representatives. Each college supported more than one delivery scheme. Modern apprentices were employed predominately by small- to medium-sized enterprises. It was concluded that delivery of Modern Apprenticeships could be facilitated by General National Vocational Qualifications. In 75% of colleges, funding was allocated on an outcome basis. (Appended are the numbers of current registrations of modern apprentices on schemes offered by colleges in the project and the study questionnaire.) (MN)",
