        "description":"This study is a compilation of some of the published material on the social readjustment of widows and widowers plus a sampling (26) of personal interviews which the researcher conducted. The loss of a spouse is a traumatic experience. The emotional turmoil that follows, caused by the personal mode of living, circumstances of the death, treatment by friends, job situation, and other factors influence the recovery from grief. The completeness of recovery bears directly on the remaining partner's entry or re-entry into the social world, dating, and remarriage. Anticipated grief during a spouse's long illness, continuing friendships, and the remaining partner's own determination to gain self-confidence in the new \"singles\" world, were found to be important factors in the remaining  partner's re-entry into the social world.

        "author":["Kegley, John F."],
        "description":"A counselor's values are inherent in all that he does with a client, ranging from selection of the counseling modality to the decision to terminate facilitative intervention. Value-free counseling is a myth, and recognition of this fact is the first step in arriving at a clear conception of what counseling can, or should, be. A counselor can be considered an advocate for what one can become. In this sense, counseling is a political, value-laden process to create tolerant personalities and safeguard human rights. Whatever means and modalities are employed in counseling to facilitate the development of the tolerant personality, the process must be a liberating one that releases the mind and emotions from ignorance, prejudice, partisanship or superstition, that emancipates the will,  stimulates the imagination, broadens the sympathies, generates empathy and makes the client a citizen of the world.

        "description":"Current literature reveals little with regard to the delivery of programs and services to the visually handicapped by university and college counseling centers. Philosophically and logistically counseling centers are in the position to not only sensitize the academic community to the needs of the visually handicapped, but also to support the personal, social, and educational development of each visually handicapped student on campus. This paper describes the development of the relationship between the Counseling Bureau of the University of South Carolina and the South Carolina Commission for the Blind. This relationship has resulted in cooperative precollege summer programming for visually handicapped students, ongoing support systems responding to the specific needs of a  visually handicapped university population during the academic year as well as during the summer, and the development of a resource center which programmatically and technically facilitates the social, personal, and educational development of visually handicapped students on campus.

This document describes the method of implementing the POM in a seminar on the college student. In seeking to implement the model, the authors make the following assumptions: (1) didactic and experiential knowledge are necessary components for preparation; (2) learning experiences must approximate the \"real world\" experiences of the student development specialist; and (3) to be an effective student/human development specialist requires knowledge in the areas of human development, person and environment interaction, higher education, and developmental intervention strategies. POM, like most program models, has three basic components (input, process, output), and the authors  detail each component part as it applies to the overall goal of the seminar.

Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court during 1973 was accomplished in a series of four short meetings conducted by various professionals. In December 1973, the author received a Title I grant to conduct an intensive training workshop for volunteer counselors during the summer of 1974. The training program, consisting of eight three-hour meetings, used an experiential-didactic model in which participants worked in skill-building sessions focusing on listening-attending behaviors, empathic responding behaviors, questioning or probing behaviors, and initiative and problem-solving behaviors. In addition, participants were encouraged to practice their skills between sessions and to keep a diary  of their experiences. These diaries served as a basis for discussions and for increasing participant self-awareness. Pre- and post-measures of communication skills showed significant participant improvement. A post-workshop subjective evaluation by participants was highly positive. (Author/PC)",

Subjects were administered the paired-associate task under one of three variations: at a comfortable rate with standard instructions; at a comfortable rate with a potentially effective learning strategy (visual imagery); and at a speeded rate with standard instructions. As anticipated on the basis of earlier research with children of this age, the relationship between reasoning (as reflected by Raven's Progressive Matrices) and learning was augmented when subjects were supplied with the imagery strategy and diminished when the task was speeded. Negligible correlations between rote memory (as reflected by digit span) and learning were obtained under all task  variations.

The external conditions were instruction on the major concepts related in the principle and the number of teaching examples and teaching nonexamples of the principle presented with a statement of the principle. Subjects were 159 fifth-grade students of average ability and socioeconomic status. The principles were presented in self-instructional lesson booklets, where the instructional variables of interest were systematically varied. Variations in the type of lessons read by the subjects constituted the experimental conditions. Mastery of the principles was determined by tests designed to assess subjects' knowledge of, and ability to apply, the principles. Results indicated  that a rationally selected set of examples and nonexamples was more facilitative than one example, although it was concluded that, for easy principles, providing one example was equally effective as a rationally selected set when instruction on concepts related in the principle was also provided. Main effects for instruction on concepts related in the principles were not found to be significant. The conditions associated with this unanticipated result were discussed.

Consequently, research and evaluation must be understood to threaten, inherently, personal need gratification of therapists. The author discusses several reality-based therapist objections to research and evaluation: (1) evaluation (and the observation it entails) constitutes an affront to professional status; (2) therapists are sometimes ignorant of psychotherapy process and outcome research, and frequently believe that it has contributed little to advances in treatment processes; and (3) participation in research has no immediate or long-term payoff for many psychotherapists. The author concludes that for research or  systematic evaluation to be actively supported by practicing therapists, it must arise from, yet bear upon, their work. (Author/PC)",

This article is an attempt to present some of the advances made in recent years in the state of Florida.

Two major topics discussed are the 1971 Florida Articulation Agreement and the establishment and functioning of the Junior College Relations Office. These two basic events have led to a number of  other university and state-wide programs which have promoted better articulation between community colleges and universities. (Author)",

Specifically, the focus was to investigate self-concept and LOA as covariates and to describe the nature of the relationship if, in fact, one existed. A sample of 80 third and fourth grade students was selected from three rural midwestern elementary schools. The measures of self-concept included a non-verbal self-concept test (Pictorial Self Concept Scale), a frequency count of the self-rewarding statements selected following each performance trial, and the positive-negative value of the self-evaluations made following each performance trial. Results of the data concluded that: (1) low-positive discrepancy-LOA behavior appears to be related to the Middle  range of reported self-concept scores, in the male sample; (2) high self-concept in males may in fact indicate a high self-concept or it may indicate ego-defensiveness; and (3) size and direction of goal discrepancy plus direction of goal shift following success and failure need to be considered together in studying LOA behavior.

The report also examines the following issues: lack of a time limit within which lenders must file claims for defaulted loans, questionable estimates of losses, the inclusion of many uncollectible loans in the asset accounts, and differences between the official financial statements of the fund and the statements included in the appendix to the Federal budget. The recent establishment of the Student Loan Marketing Association is also  discussed. Recommendations addressing these problems are included. (Author)",

Thirteen pairs of twins, eight monozygotic (MZ), five dyzygotic (DZ), were administered the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, MMPI, and Revised Beta Examination. The F ratio for testing significance of within-set variances of MZ and DZ twins did not reveal heredity to be a significant factor in creative output. Significant correlations are reported between verbal fluency and hysteria and between depression and figural fluency and figural originality. Numerous significant correlations occurred between measures of intelligence and creativity and among constructs of creativity. Conclusions were: (a) measures of creative thinking do provide data on  students in addition to that furnished by tests of intelligence, (b) factors other than heredity influence creativity, and (c) creative ability is diffuse as well as specific and is related to certain measures of intelligence.

The authors discuss the growing hope that nursing will become a vital part of the nation's established system of higher education. In addition, they discuss the changes in duties to which nurses were being assigned during the past several decades. The manner in which junior colleges and schools of nursing have responded to these changes is explained along with a discussion of enrollment trends and sources of financial support. This paper contains three graphs illustrating the growth patterns of associate degree programs in nursing during three different time periods. The authors conclude by expressing optimism about  the future growth, change and improvement of the nursing field. (Author/BW)",

This model for training teacher-advisors is based on the assumption that tentative commitment to making school a more rewarding experience for all is the first step in starting an effective program. The approach is to help teachers learn specific skills and methods which have a high success probability, thereby resulting in positive reinforcement. The proposed teacher-advisor training program involves 40 to 50 hours of instruction. The skill learning involved in the program is broken down into three components: (1) relationship building, (2) assertion, and (3) group facilitation. The authors believe that additional benefits from such a program are: (1) transfer of the learning to the classroom, (2)  closer relationships and cooperation among staff members in helping students and (3) student imitation of the teacher's positive ways of relating to each other.

Subjects were 785 students drawn from large urban and small city schools. The Soares and Soares Self Concept Scales was used to obtain five measures of self perception. The results showed that those students with the highest self-concepts were most likely to be male, white, having parents with a high SES, and having a high level of vocational aspiration. It was concluded that these results agree with the many studies which have found a positive relationship between SES, race, and ego concepts. However, these results do not support the findings of  some of the more recent studies which report higher ego concepts among disadvantaged children. (Author/BW)",

Instrumental learning related to shaping in behavior modification, schedules of reinforcement--with an emphasis on variable ratio schedules, extinction, negative reinforcement, positive reinforcement, modeling and prompting, satiation, negative practice and group reinforcement--are discussed as behavior modification techniques. Creating environments conducive to change considers the control of behavior by modifying stimuli likely to influence specific behaviors. Stimulus  generalization, discrimination learning, stimulus control (in which dieting and sleeping are offered as examples), reciprocal inhibition, forced exposure desensitization, and rehearsal are discussed from a practical point of view. The final chapter outlines a method of organized approach to difficult problems, and involves (1) the identification of component problems, (2) their ordering in terms of levels of severity, and (3) solution of component problems starting with the easiest and progressing to the most difficult.

The four programs tested for effectiveness were Programmed Reading for Adults, Building Reading Power, Reading Series, and Building Your Language Power. An attempt was made to assess the effectiveness of each program as a function of such student characteristics as intelligence, degree of motivation to study, ethnic group, and whether English was the student's first language. Additionally, students and proctors were asked to evaluate the program each used. The general impression gained from examining the learning data--the primary criterion used--is that none of the programs was  positively evaluated on all measures. However, the use of Building Reading Power and Programmed Reading for Adults leads to a satisfactory amount of learning. On the criteria of student evaluations, proctor evaluations, and error rates, only Programmed Reading for Adults may be judged to be a successful program. Complete testing data and detailed descriptions of the study design, results, and conclusions are included in the document. (TO)",

The first- and second-year college students, primarily white, are from families earning between $6,000 and $15,000 annually. The program began in 1964 and offers two elective college reading courses that are open to college students and community adults. Minicourses in reading are also available for special-interest groups such as practical nursing majors, accelerated high school students, and local teachers. The beginning course includes an initial diagnosis of the student's skills using standardized and informal tests. With the help of the teacher, each student develops a plan for improvement using the instructional materials and machines in the reading lab. The  courses are organized to meet formally twice a week for a combination of lectures, discussions, and individual work. Discussions and lectures cover such topics as the structure and functions of sentences, how to deal effectively with the reading in a specific type of course, and useful techniques in taking exams. A third hour per week is devoted exclusively to individual lab work. (RB/AIR)",

Twenty kindergarten and 20 second-grade children served as subjects. The subjects were middle-class, Anglo children who had not begun their reading programs. An equal number of boys and girls were included. The students were tested individually, the total testing time per child being approximately 15 minutes. The subjects were tested for accuracy and latency of response in 36 trials containing examples of six sentence types. From the data collected, it was concluded that second-grade children gave significantly more correct responses than kindergarten children, but  they did not make their decisions any more quickly. All subjects responded more accurately to right-embedded than to center-embedded relative clauses, and they responded more quickly in making their right-embedded choice. Children from both groups responded more slowly and less accurately when the subject-verb-object search was disrupted by the relative clause. (TS)",

Also of interest was the short- and long-term retention of two types of information, verbatim and substance. Verbatim information covered words and word sequences identical to those in the test passage. Substance information covered the main ideas or essential points. The subjects were 120 fifth graders from predominantly middle-class communities. Three 172-word passages were prepared which were identical except for the embedded associative pairs. The three passages had the same stimulus words, but the response words were different. Groups of subjects were assigned to one of the following four conditions: one reading,  immediate testing; two readings, immediate testing; one reading, delayed testing; or two readings, delayed testing, according to a predetermined random sequence. The subjects were instructed to silently read the passage and remember as much of it as possible. A cued recall test was given immediately or 24 hours later. From the results it was concluded that no significant high-associative facilitation occurred. Furthermore, greater recall was noted across the four verbatim measures and one substance measure in the low-associative condition. (TS)",

This study investigated possible factors contributing to the facilitating effect of interest of boys. Two experiments were performed to learn whether high-interest topics are associated with traditionally masculine themes for boys and feminine themes for girls. Another experiment examined whether the effect of interest could be due to greater familiarity with vocabulary on high-interest material. Finally, the long-term instructional benefits of a high-interest reading program were investigated. Results of the first two experiments indicated that boys' interests in topics were strongly correlated with independent ratings of masculinity,  while girls' interests were only moderately correlated with femininity. Furthermore, sex-typing accounted for much of the stability of boys' interests across grade level and none of the stability of girls' interests. The third experiment tended to suggest that interest level had no facilitating effect when vocabulary content was controlled across interest level. The data suggest potential benefits of high-interest classroom instruction. (Author/TS)",

The subjects were 198 kindergarten, first-grade, and second-grade black children who attend four Title I schools in the New York City metropolitan area. Responses on two oral language tasks (sentence repetition and sentence comprehension) and two reading tasks (oral reading and reading comprehension) were used to study relations between children's receptive and productive control of oral and written SE forms. It was found that children's level of control of SE is grade related and is a function of the particular verb forms. The order of acquisition of receptive and productive control of SE  structures differs, and this difference was demonstrated in both oral language and reading behavior. There was little evidence that aural comprehension of specific structures is systematically related to oral production, but reading comprehension is systematically related to oral reading in SE. The results indicated that reading comprehension is more a function of children's receptive control than it is of their productive control of SE. (Author/TS)",

In six of the experiments stress was placed on having the subjects process in a known order. In five of the experiments retinal location was varied independently of processing order. The results of the experiments led to the following conclusions: (1) retinal locus is an important variable; (2) processing order is an important  variable; (3) stimuli inhibit other stimuli at the sensory level and the inhibition appears to be directed from the stimuli toward the fovea; (4) letters are processed at the feature level and some features are more important than others; and (5) no acoustic confusions are made in the full report procedure.

While previous mathemagenic research has established that adjunct questions interspersed with written prose facilitates learning, it has been criticized as educationally nonsignificant because the research has focused on verbatim learning. To test basic mathemagenic concepts under educationally relevent conditions, a 2 x 2 ANOVA (analysis of variance) was used to assess the effects of type of adjunct questions (comprehension vs. verbatim) and placement of questions (before or after prose segments) on problem solving, with problem solving defined as the ability to apply concepts and principles to problem situations. College undergraduates read prose segments dealing with learning  theory and answered related adjunct questions before completing five problem situations on the criterion test. Comprehension questions resulted in significantly higher problem solving scores, but no significant differences due to question placement were found. Subjects receiving comprehension postquestions did significantly better than all other groups. The results were consistent with previous mathemagenic hypothesis research findings. (Author/TS)",

Parents and school administrators want more individualization, however, so a comparatively effective, but quicker, test is needed. A combination of \"cloze\" sentences and a basic sight vocabulary list was used to construct just such a test. Exact readability levels were established for each grade level, and the sentence length and number of higher grade level words were also carefully controlled for each selection. Correlation with a graded informal reading inventory was quite high, while comparison with several well-known oral reading placement tests points up the test's usefulness in effecting a  more careful placement of the pupils at a level where they can function in independent comprehension work; and the testing of 20 to 25 students consumes about one and one-half hours, compared with 10 to 20 hours normally required in testing a class.

Transfer was measured by having the subjects sight learn a list of words contrasting in position and order. Subsequently, new function and content words were learned in a sentence format, and all previously learned words were given additional practice in sentences. There was little indication that item-sequence training improved sight-word learning. Grammatical context failed to assist function word learning and showed some impairment of content word learning. While additional sentence practice showed significant improvement in word learning, substantial  word recall errors following practice suggested that sentence practice was an efficient way to learn words. It was suggested that subsequent studies consider whether acoustic recognition accompanying the letter differences would improve word learning and that the list format be used for learning sight words prior to sentence reading.

Most importantly, further data analysis revealed  that frequency of a phoneme in the conversational speech of kindergartners and in the lexicon of the Southwest Regional Laboratory (SWRL) First Year Communication Skills program did not predict articulation difficulty of a phoneme either in words or isolation.

Subjects were grouped into high, middle, and low ability decoders, and the relationship between these groups and task performance was assessed. The results showed that while high ability decoders can perform all tasks, middle and low ability decoders exhibit poorer performance as task complexity increases. Production tasks (producing sound correspondents for letters in words and blending isolated sounds into words) were found to be most closely related to decoding ability, whereas tasks  requiring the subjects to recognize the letter correspondents and sound components of spoken words were found to be less closely related. While the former tasks were considered to reflect necessary component skills of novel word decoding, the latter tasks were considered to reflect skills which serve to develop the component skills.

The subjects were 32 volunteers from two undergraduate psychology courses at the University of Georgia. Stimulus materials consisted of four meaningful (M) complex embedded English sentences and four meaningless (M-) sentences. The procedure was similar to that used by Bransford and Franks (1971). Subjects were randomly assigned to either the M or the M- condition. The two conditions were identical except for the type of sentence used. The experimental session was carried out in two phases, acquisition and recognition. Acquisition involved a test of short-term memory for each sentence. Recognition involved rating sentences on the basis of whether  the subject had or had not experienced it during acquisition. Results showed a significant linear effect for the meaningless sentences. Furthermore, although the slope of the effect for meaningless sentences was flatter than that of the control, other data rules out a semantic integration explanation based on the availability of semantic information contained in sentence structure. The evidence would thus appear to support the view that structure and content are closely interrelated in language comprehension. (TS)",

A national survey of the reading activities of adults was administered to 5,096 individuals. Some conclusions drawn from the survey data are as follows: the average person reads for almost two hours in a typical day; most of the time is spent reading newspapers, magazines, books, and job-related matter; 5 percent of all adults cannot read in the English language; and an individual's style of life, as represented by socioeconomic status, is related to his or her reading habits. Data are given on the percentage of readers performing a specific reading activity, the socioeconomic status of  those readers, the average time spent performing the task, and the importance placed on the task. A national reading performance survey, consisting of 170 reading tasks, was constructed, and portions were administered to 7,866 adults. Items were intended to correspond to the ordinary reading tasks identified in the survey of reading habits. Data on specific task performance are presented. (MKM)",

The subjects were 64 prekindergarten children attending six private preschools in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The subjects were all Caucasian and spoke a standard English dialect. A learning set design encompassing 192 trials over eight days was employed. The following relevant factors were investigated: the presence of a redundant visual cue, the type of phoneme (stop vs. continuant), the phoneme position, and the phonemic contrast between the positive and negative exemplars. It was concluded from the results that the redundant visual cue improved performance considerably; when the cue was removed, however,  performance fell to control group levels in the second week. Generally, continuants were superior to stops. The position and contrast factors interacted with phoneme type. Groups transferred within phoneme class were superior to those transferred between phoneme class. The results suggest that the vowel following the initial stop may be an important factor in recognition, but allophonic differences which occur in free variation in English with terminal stops are not important.

The screening measures were administered by a trained clinician to 28 children referred to a university reading clinic for diagnosis of reading problems. The findings indicated that the Peabody, the Slosson, and the Raven scores all correlated substantially with the WISC scores and were measuring essentially the same thing as the WISC. However, the multiple correlations were not significantly higher than the single correlations. One instrument, the Slosson,  appeared to be most comparable with the WISC and was suggested for general use in screening the intelligence of many disabled readers. (Author/LL)",

That step is to develop a procedure whereby the profession might identify the components of reading maturity at various levels. The paper discusses and explores the following three assumptions which underlie the first step and on which the viability of the model depends: (1) agreement among groups of reading educators is possible; (2) pupil outcomes can be identified which are acceptable to reading educators; (3) once identified, these outcomes can be ordered as to their saliency at various reading levels. In the first study, 13 reading professors at a midwestern university were polled. Twelve pupil outcomes were generally  accepted and ranked with the broad areas of attitude and comprehension considered most important to reading maturity as pupils exit from elementary school. When primary and intermediate reading teachers were polled, they too accepted the 12 pupil outcomes, were able to rank these outcomes, and were in general agreement within their subgroup. However, elementary teachers ranked decoding skills as most important. (MKM)",

Sight word and phonics-based or rule-based learning were investigated in 112 kindergarteners who were identified as nonreaders. Groups were trained on mixed word lists containing sight words and rule words varying the list structure, amount and order of practice, and the distinctiveness of list contents. The effects of training were assessed by having subjects read and learn sentences containing the sight words, rule words, and new rule words containing the previously trained phonics components. Means and standard deviations for each group on mixed sentence list practice and the  retention-transfer tasks are listed. The use of a light blue background cue to distinguish sight words had little influence on transfer performance. The sequence of rule word/sight word/mixed list in learning sight word and rule word contents tends to play an important role in the word identification process during reading and influences further practice of these contents.

Values strategies function as affective mobilizers to bring a child's attitudes and emotions into interaction with learning materials, thus strengthening memory for the learning experience. The child's own language is also directly tied to experience. Some educators have urged that the child's reading experiences be made an extension of natural language learning. If materials are chosen that broaden or coincide with the needs and interests of the child, then the child is likely to accept reading as a worthwhile venture. A teacher of reading can select a values  strategy to engage a child in a theme, then use the technique of language experience to expand further meaningfulness of this theme with reading growth.

        "description":"This document describes a pilot study of a corrective reading procedure using audio-taped echoic responses and reading material; polysyllabic words were spatially segmented to provide positional and marker grapheme clues to variant spelling-to-sound correspondences. Three groups of tenth graders four or more years below grade level in oral reading and comprehension were compared for gains according to the Gilmore Oral Reading Test and the Metropolitan Reading Test. Subjects receiving a combination of taped echoic responses and segmented print made a mean gain of 8.7 months in oral reading; those receiving only the taped echoic treatment gained 6 months; and a control group in a remedial program using neither treatment gained 1.6 months in a semester. Differences among group gains  were significant, although mean gain differences for reading comprehension were not significant. From the data it was concluded that a remedial reading program combining a taped echoic response method using segmented print material can be effective in improving oral reading. (Author/TS)",

Prereading skills are defined by logical analysis of the reading task and by instructional conventions. From an analysis of initial reading tasks, prerequisite skills are identified. Those skills which are found lacking in a high percentage of children at the time they would encounter prereading instruction are selected for inclusion in a prereading program. Through this procedure at least three specific visual skills and two sound skills have been identified in a number of studies. Direct instruction in the specific skills seems to be required to ensure mastery, as children who are deficient in them generally will not acquire the skills  through maturation or general readiness instruction, or discovering them on their own. Furthermore, since skill deficit patterns are not predictable, individualized programs are required for efficient instruction. Further research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the prereading skills approach to reading readiness. (Author/LL)",

This expectation was confirmed in three experiments in which subjects were presented with one of two types of visual or verbal stimuli, categorized or uncategorized, with varying frequencies. Subjects for the first experiment were sixth and seventh graders. Subjects for the second and third experiment were students in a college  psychology class. (Author/MKM)",

Word lists were developed to test the subjects' ability to decode synthetic words which tested specific phonic and structural subskills of word attack, phonically and structurally regular words, and phonically and structurally irregular words. The results of the study showed  that the subjects were able to decode the synthetic words at the suggested 80 percent mastery level. Not all of the subjects were able to decode all of the phonically and structurally regular words at an 80 percent mastery level.

Pronunciation by either the subject or the examiner was found to increase the accuracy of frequency judgment for Lo-F/Hi-M words substantially more than it did for the other groups of words.

The content of the Southwest Regional Laboratory (SWRL) Mod 2 Kindergarten Storybooks was analyzed by surface linguistic form class and compared to an analysis of 5.5- to 6.5-year-old children's speech production. Distributions of the frequency and variety of the use of the form classes are presented. Similarities and differences between the Mod 2 storybooks and oral production distributions are examined to identify areas in which effects on comprehension might be profitably investigated. The results indicated that four areas of form class usage present questions for investigation relevant to the design of Mod  3 reading materials. Those areas are the use of nouns, the use of the future and the unmarked present tense in preference to the progressive and the perfect tense, the use of adjectives, and the use of a word in more than one form class or with more than one conceptual meaning in the text.

Since transformations are in some sense unconscious, a mental leap must occur for the transformation to be made. Furthermore, it is suggested that the transformational process is at the heart of the creative process. Toward further investigating the creative process, the seminar attempted a psychological portrait of William Carlos Williams.

        "description":"Mastery Learning, a learning strategy which denies the inevitability of the normal grading curve, holds promise in skill-building courses. For a composition course using this strategy, course objectives must first be established and stated behaviorally, after which the course may be broken into learning units, each lasting perhaps two weeks. At the end of a two-week instruction period, students take a formative or diagnostic test--one of the defining features of Mastery Learning. Students not passing the test are directed to another defining feature, corrective learning experiences. Unit subjects may be divided into such units as manuscript matters, content, and the mechanics of writing. This strategy recognizes the potential of students as being unlimited and introduces system,  measurement, and self-evaluation into education. (JM)",

The data were analyzed to see if these preferences ordered themselves into a hierarchy. With only half of a full paired-comparisons matrix available for study, the data suggest that a hierarchical ordering of preferences for relations exists, with the cause-effect relation educed most readily and the order-time relation least readily. The results also suggest a need for developmental research into the origins of these preferences and investigation of the role of both individual differences and cultural  differences. (Author/LL)",

        "description":"Spearman's formulation of analogical reasoning as a three-stage process (apprehension of elements, education of relations, and education of correlates) appears to be useful in the study of analogical reasoning. In this project, minimizing the role of element apprehension and manipulating relation-education levels resulted in the unexpected finding of minimal effects due to social class. It was concluded that the effects of social class differences on analogical reasoning are to be found primarily in the stage of apprehending the elements. Results also led to the hypothesis that the most important stage in analogical reasoning is the education of correlates. An advantage in educing relations that is given to a group exerts only minimal influence on the test performance outcome.  The finding of a hierarchical ordering of preference for relations in the solution of analogy problems further clarifies the locus of the effects of social class, specifically, and culture, generally, on analogy test performance. These effects are contingent on the elements and the relations embodied in the analogy test. (Author/LL)",

Categories of effort  are described and illustrated, using communication skills exemplars where possible. Preliminary views on the educational R&D program are presented in flowchart form.

This study compares two of the indexes that have recently been devised for measuring language growth. Its specific purposes are (1) to examine the correlation between mean T-unit length and syntactic density scores and (2) to compare mean T-unit length and syntactic density scores as indicators of the grade level of writers. Thirty-two ninth graders were asked to write a composition about the best or worst hour of their day. These compositions were then analyzed for mean T-unit length, mean clause length, and mean number of clauses per T-unit, and were also analyzed for the items needed to compute the syntactic density score. It was  concluded that, in spite of its lack of precision, T-unit length is a more useful and usable index of syntactic development than the syntactic density score; and it appears that mean T-unit length is a better indicator of grade level than is the syntactic density score.

The Model 3 entry lexicon (Rhode, 1972)--based on a predominately white sample--was compared with the Thomas (1962) and Legum, Pfaff, Tinnie, and Nicholas (1971) lexicons--both based on black samples. Words unique to any lexicon were categorized and checked to see if any of them were important enough to require supplemental teaching. Most words present in one lexicon but lacking in the others could be easily accounted for by sampling error. Thus, it was concluded that the entry lexicon is probably adequate for use with black  kindergarten children from low socioeconomic backgrounds. (Author/RB)",

Both a biological explanation of language learning and a cognitive explanation of language development are crucial in understanding the critical age model. Once it is recognized that the critical age model is limited by the learner's own biological and psychological development, a different approach to teaching the mother language and its uses may be realized. Since many questions concerning this model remain to  be answered, neither the rote-memory model nor the abilities model should be discarded. (JM)",

More than 90 percent of the teachers in both countries perceived the language of children from working-class homes in England and lower socioeconomic groups in the United States as being deficient in some way for six main reasons. The attribution of linguistic deprivation to children and the reasons revealed by the teachers to explain such deprivation seem to be of sufficient dimensionality and persistence to constitute consistent stereotypic behavior in evaluating  the language of children. Conclusions and recommendations of this study relate to the teaching of language and to the preparation of teachers in relation to the effect teachers' attitudes have on their evaluations of children's learning potentials, their intellectual capacities, and their communicative competence.

It is primarily a descriptive theory that interrelates theoretical propositions with measurement techniques and thereby allows for the generation of precise predictions that can be falsified. Emphasis on description and prediction is the necessary and crucial first step in the formulation of an explanatory social theory; these have been consistently disregarded by previous theories of attitude change. The highly inferential and empirically unjustified assumption that attitudes cause behavior (or that behavior causes attitudes) across all situations is redefined in LFAT so that each is a function of the amount of information received  about a particular topic. Redefining the attitude-behavior and/or behavior-attitude causality issue in this manner makes their approach a communication perspective on the development and change of attitudes. Thirdly, Woelfel and Haller take as axiomatic that significant others effect an individual's attitudinal structure and must be included in an adequate theory of attitude change. (Author/LL)",

This validation and error analysis of CPIR data was undertaken to examine the existence of both systematic and random errors in data reported on the CPIR forms; to suggest changes in procedures, forms, concepts, and instructions; and to identify the needs for further research in validity study areas. In the beginning sections of the study the methodology is described, and the analysis of the case study materials that were collected during site visits is presented, including a  discussion of commonalities and trends across local education agencies (LEAs) and states. Chapter 4 presents an analysis of the discrepancies found between the data collected in the study and those originally submitted by the LEA. Chapter 5 contains a series of recommendations for changes in the CPIR instruments, procedures, and instructions. The reasons for the recommendations are documented and the impact on the CPIR data-collection effort is discussed both in terms of ease of collection and data accuracy. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"In 1974, approval of public school bond issues, averaging 56.2 percent of the dollar value and 53.0 percent of the number of issues voted on, reflected a decrease of 2.8 percent in dollar value and an increase of 8.3 percent in number of issues over the year before. These changes are the more significant in light of the downward trend of recent years. Since 1968 (when 67.6 percent of proposed bond issues were approved), approvals have declined, falling to lows of 46.7 and 47.0 percent during 1971 and 1972. In 1974 only seven states accounted for approximately $1.3 billion of the $2.2 billion approved value. Although approvals remained down, the $3.0 billion in reported bond sales was an increase of $50 million over the $2.9 billion of fiscal year 1973. The 1974 average net  interest cost for all bonds of 5.35 percent was up 44 basis points from the 1973 average of 4.91 percent, indicating an increase in public school borrowing costs. The 6.49 percent monthly average net interest cost recorded for June 1974 was the highest since the 6.68 percent reported for June 1970. The number of bond sales has decreased over the past decade.

From every standpoint, whether that of human rights, economic efficiency, educational effectiveness, or social desirability, the national interest is to serve handicapped children equally with all others. Putting this concept into practice means turning away from the traditional segregation of the handicapped. Mainstreaming--progressively including and maintaining handicapped pupils in regular classes while providing top quality special education for them--has emerged as a key concept in the treatment of the handicapped. Under mainstreaming, the handicapped pupils are the responsibility of regular class teachers who are  provided with the support and consultation of special educators. Mainstreaming has emerged for a number of reasons--the labeling of children has been rejected, technical and scientific progress has improved instructional apparatus, educators have become aware of the cost of transporting special education students to their own schools, and the courts have ordered changes in the treatment of the handicapped.

These basic statements are enlarged upon in connection with chemistry, shop, and manual or vocational training classes where the supervisory duty of school personnel is generally described as that of a reasonable or prudent person. Therefore, the level of caution or alertness required of the teacher or the employee is commensurate with the degree of danger inherent in the particular situation. The standard of  care requires that the school district and its employees anticipate a wide range of dangerous acts and conditions that could expose the student to an unreasonable risk of harm. As a result, the \"ordinary care\" employed by a school district and its employees when supervising students must be \"extreme care.\" (Author)",

For ten years, the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has pursued a policy of open enrollment. Transfer figures for the 1974-75 school year at the city's 15 high schools are analyzed according to schoolwide racial data, street mile distances, percent of black students in each school, average class size, percent of teachers having M.A. degrees, and tenth-grade math scores. A separate regression was run for each school, with the percentage of students transferring as the dependent variable and the five selected characteristics of the other schools as independent variables. The following tentative conclusions emerge: (1) it is appropriate to conceive of a school system as a market; (2) families do take distance costs into account in making educational purchases, but less than they do benefits from such school attributes as student test scores; and (3) no strong support for racial prejudice controlling educational purchases of either race could be found.

Although their problems are similar, there is little cooperation between urban and suburban districts. The critical areas blocking working relationships can be identified in three groupings: social equity problems, governance and local control, and lack of problem identification. The steps being taken to meet these problems are mostly informal and voluntary. There are, however, mutual grounds on which to cooperate: most superintendents agree that social equity is a common responsibility; both urban and suburban leaders want a good quality of life for their community; and, most urban and suburban superintendents  can agree on the finances necessary to achieve these goals, although they often don't agree on who should receive them. Metropolitanwide planning in which there is compulsory participation by all education units would be a giant step toward creating an understanding of common problems, better anticipating the effects or impacts of mutual problems, and developing alternatives for achieving desired goals.

        "description":"A review of the literature reveals that the knowledge professors of educational administration disseminate is not used in administrator preparation programs. This holds true both in the design of programs and in the use of specific methodologies in the management of the programs. The implementation of a range of management technologies, preferably by students within the programs, is one means of increasing the use of research knowledge in training programs. This would also increase program efficiency, enhance professor sensitivity, and enrich student experience. Empirical studies could provide the foundation for research about program effectiveness. Both school systems and departments of educational administration, as human systems, are appropriate subjects for the application of  behavioral science approaches, and, to the extent that similar variables are inherent in both school systems and departments of educational administration, the discovery of similar variables by means of behavioral science approaches may ultimately facilitate the transfer of learning across system boundaries. It seems likely that the programs that make optimal use of knowledge will be the most successful. (Author/IRT)",

        "author":["Teeples, Ronald K."],
        "description":"The Serrano decision has caused policy makers in California to search for departures from the current system of public school finance. Citizen and legislative evaluation of alternative finance systems is being confused by the employment of diverse interpretations of Serrano. Although the Court's decision may appear to indicate clear-cut methods of repair, a careful analysis of criteria implied by reform proposals and the logic of Serrano reveal substantial divergences. The Serrano criteria prohibit most proposals currently being promoted--expanded supplemental aid schemes and system neutrality alternatives are clearly misguided reform attempts; full state funding, coordinated tax base sharing, and proportional power equalizing seem to be acceptable, with coordinated tax base  sharing being the best alternative. There is, however, an internal conflict in the Serrano logic. Insofar as local district control is maintained over choice of property tax rates, and property assessed evaluation is retained as a major source of revenue, the portion of Serrano calling for a family's cost of education to be independent of the wealth located in the district in which the family resides cannot be met.

        "description":"Because there appears to be a need for the facilitation of planning in elementary schools, the Center for the Study of Evaluation has established programs to provide for people in schools the knowledge and skills they need to do local program planning and evaluation. One of these programs is the self-instructional, self-contained Program Planning Kit. The kit does not contain program or evaluation plans, rather it provides step-by-step procedures for school staffs to use when planning educational programs and their evaluation. The kit contains materials for people filling the roles of planning coordinator, planning team member, and evaluation planner. Two major sources of difficulty in using the kit arose during its field testing: one was concerned with the field test situation;  one had to do with the difficulties of doing program planning in the schools as they are currently organized. The former problem is readily solved, the latter is not. Only by rethinking how teachers' and principals' time can be most profitably spent and by making planning time available to them can the idea of program planning on the local level be given an adequate trial.

The first step should be to determine student needs. Instructional goals for each student should then be clearly defined and behaviorally stated. Effectiveness of instruction should be determined by measuring student achievement of specified goals. The guide focuses on major goals and subgoals that comprise hierarchies of skills concentrated in six major curriculum areas: (1) basic skills, (2) personal and social awareness, (3) living in the environment, (4) career education, (5) human ecology, and (6) leisure time activities. Within each of the six curriculum areas, the subject matter is organized  into sections by topics. These curriculum sections comprise an educational framework designed to carry the instruction of the student from first grade through high school. The guide does not list resource units, methods of instruction, or materials. It is assumed the teacher will develop units of instruction that include methods and materials appropriate for the attainment of selected subgoals. A criterion measurement statement specifies the performance requirements to be met before a subgoal can be considered learned. (Author)",

The staff first sought a comprehensive description of the society of the 1980s and beyond, with emphasis on how education might be impacted by various facets of that future society. From this description of society, a graphic model of future schooling evolved. This SWEP model was then applied to the creation of a hypothetical secondary school serving the needs of special students within the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. This application provided a test of the model's logic, of its planning specifications, and of its possible utility as a guide for future planners within the metroplex as well as across  the nation. This application of the model to an imaginary schooling site was assigned the acronym SWEP-H and was envisioned as having characteristics related to such areas as learning environments, instructional techniques and programs, student choices, scheduling systems, societal changes, staff participation, staffing arrangements, and continuous learning.

        "description":"This publication is the fourth in a series of reports on educational innovation in Asia. In describing the educational situation in Korea, the author has organized his discussion into two broad subject areas. Section 1 is concerned with innovations in national educational policies, while section 2 focuses on educational innovations at the institutional level. Throughout the study, the author's emphasis is on the origin and diffusion of educational innovation, rather than on the novelty of particular innovations. Several statistical tables are included which summarize the growth in the number of schools, students, and teachers in Korea from 1963-1972. In addition, there is a bibliography of publications relevant to the study of educational innovation in general and Korean  education in particular. (JG)",

        "description":"Evidence suggests that educational organizations lack internal coordination. This is especially true of the content and methods of what is presumably their central activity--instruction. Instruction tends to be removed from the control of the organizational structure, both in its bureaucratic aspects and in its professional or collegial aspects. Such organizations are \"loosely coupled,\" which means that structure is disconnected from activity, and activity is disconnected from its effects. For instance, there is no technology or program of instruction that is of established or consensual efficacity. Thus, it is difficult even to establish standards of content and procedure in instruction. Despite this lack of coordination, the educational system and its organizations appear to  have considerable stability. That is the problem of this paper--to explain how organizations with few controls over their central activity persist so stably, and to explain how implicit coordination is achieved. The explanation takes two forms--a general explanation of how substantive educational activity is coordinated outside of organizational (or professional) forms, and a discussion of the implications of this explanation for the understanding of educational organizations, decision-making, change in educational organizations, and theory of organizations. Areas of needed research are pointed out. (Author/IRT)",

Phase 1 was a wide-ranging survey of 251 Massachusetts public high schools. Phase 2 was a more intensive study of 33 representative schools, in which consultants gathered information on the attitudes and perceptions of school personnel, students, and parents. Phase 3 consisted of a series of regional conferences, which were held to present and discuss 10 position papers on current ideas and practices for school improvements. Phase 4 involved the preparation of tentative recommendations and the dissemination of the recommendations to professional groups and individuals concerned with secondary education in Massachusetts. This report  presents the study recommendations, as well as the significant findings of the study, and the opinions expressed by staff members, students, and parents about their high schools. In addition, the report also contains the various questionnaires used in the study, the 10 position papers presented at the regional conferences, and other pertinent information about the study and its methodology.

It attempts to clarify what one should keep in mind and to describe what courses of action are open when one confronts a particular situation. It is stated that teachers and principals encounter discipline problems not because they are deficient in skill or in virtue, but because they have inherited misleading definitions of their respective roles. What schools must do, may do, and may not do about disciplining is a matter of the governing of children. Individual chapters deal with the legal bases for student governance; fundamentals of governance--definitions, norms, and influence measures; the application of norms and compliance devices to different situations; the principal's leadership role in the governance program; governance tasks that  trouble teachers and how principals can help; the ways to talk with students when there has been trouble; major offenses; and some considerations in building a governance program. The appendixes provide a list of students' rights, a suggested list of important elemental norms for public elementary schools, and a list of basic influence procedures. (Author/IRT)",

Conclusions are based on intensive study of three parent coops using both participant observation and interviewing. Parent coops must deal with a form of conflict between professional and bureaucratic-employer authority. Parents lack the means to control teacher activity; but where selection is successful, the mechanisms of accommodation are similar to those found in public schools. (Author)",

        "description":"While the impact of schools in colonial America was soft before the mid-eighteenth century, devotion to education was strong and self-evident. By the early nineteenth century, schooling was well on its way to becoming universal for most children. As the nineteenth century wore on, the state became more and more involved in schooling. As taxation directed funds to state-supported Common Schools, the influence of privately financed schools began to wane. Educational choices became fewer and more costly after the mid-nineteenth century, partly due to a tax structure that left few options. Once the public tax-supported school achieved dominance compulsory school attendance laws followed in short order. Since most people were literate, and most children already attended school, why  were compulsory attendance laws needed? Attendance laws were directed most specifically at deviant minorities who often did not attend public schools. If the public school was to instill the proper mores in those who might disrupt the social fabric, then that group had to be compelled to attend. However, this compulsion effectively usurped most alternatives, options, and variability in education. (Author/JG)",

Although the report describes research relating almost solely to public school finance in California, it can also serve as a model for the analysis of school finance in other states. A basic question/answer format is used throughout the report, and extensive use is made of illustrative graphs and data tables.

        "description":"This paper examines the decline in Illinois public school enrollment that began in 1971-72 and attempts to predict the likely duration and severity of the decline. Much of the paper discusses the use of two different models for calculating enrollment projections from 1974 through 1985. The grade-by-grade model formulates enrollment projections separately for each grade level and then combines those results to project total elementary, total secondary, and total enrollment figures. The aggregate model projects total K-12 enrollment directly from the number of live births for the previous 5 to 17 years. The grade-by-grade projection was calculated assuming a birthrate of 2.1, while the aggregate projection was carried out twice, assuming birthrates of 2.1 and 1.8 respectively.  Although results of the three projections differ slightly, they all agree that the enrollment decline in Illinois public schools will continue uninterrupted at least through the fall of 1983, and that enrollment in the fall of 1983 will be at least 16 percent lower than the record high enrollment of 1971.

Some observers have said that students act like adult board members, but that their interests at the beginning of each year make everyone keenly aware that they are students. In California, student representation is developing in many different ways. There is a bill before the legislature that would require each school district with one or more high schools to include one student as a nonvoting member of the school board. The bill would also allow the district's high school pupils to choose the student member. A student is now selected annually to sit in a nonvoting capacity with the ten-member California State Board of Education.  And the Board of Regents of the University of California has recently established one seat for a student regent, who will have a full vote and be selected by his peers. In almost every case, school boards that have student representatives sing the praises of student representation. No other learning experience can provide the know-how that comes with involvement. Both boards and students benefit when school boards provide for such involvement. (Author/JG)",

The people in greatest need of recertification information are those who have been in the school system ten years or less. There is also a need for more opportunity for professional development. Only 30 percent of the respondents felt  there was ample opportunity to meet all professional development needs. The most frequently named needs were human relations training and college coursework. Two-thirds of all respondents had specific suggestions or requests for kinds of training or experience they would like, regardless of recertification requirements.

It proposes to radically change the present secondary educational program in the direction of the learner-oriented curriculum. The objective of the program is to integrate academic training, occupational training, and personal development in grades nine through twelve. Two Chicago Catholic high schools participated in the nationwide network entitled Educational Systems for the 1970s. The local coordinator's main objective was to assist the two schools in becoming more learner-responsive institutions through interaction with the faculty, administration, and students of the schools. As a result of the program, teachers have begun to revise  the curriculum and their teaching methods and to write individualized courses of instruction, and the staffs of the schools are aware of the need to implement performance objectives. The major recommendation is that the program be continued because it has made a significant impact on the schools. Appendixes provide examples of materials used in and generated by the two schools.

One explanation of these findings has to do with modeling; the child learns by example that aggressiveness toward those of lesser power is permissible. Many educators maintain that judicious occasional use of corporal punishment is beneficial to the child. While resulting in immediate decrements in the undesired behavior, however, occasional punishment actually strengthens the behavior by allowing it to be intermittently reinforced. Unfortunately, many educators are apparently unaware that effective and more humane alternatives exist. A list of techniques  for maintaining discipline without physical punishment was prepared by the National Education Association Task Force on Corporal Punishment. From the limited amount of research on the popularity of physical punishment, it appears that approximately 55-65 percent of school officials, but only one-third of parents, feel that it is an effective technique.

The future evaluation of SEE should deal with at least the following three questions: Does SEE provide an alternative environment for education? Is SEE developing a workable process for evaluating and modifying its own day-to-day operations? Are students, parents, and teachers satisfied with the program at SEE? This initial examination of the school's  activities, problems, and personnel provides some evidence that SEE is offering an environment students view as an alternative and that the school as an organization is developing a facility for self-examination and change.

Relevant statutes were identified and analyzed for this study. Proposed federal legislation that would affect these state statutes, and hence educational productivity, was also analyzed. The major conclusions and recommendations are as follows: (1) legislated terms and conditions of educational employment are responsible for significant inefficiencies that vary considerably from state to state; (2) the state legislation on educational employment is largely  inconsistent with a bargaining approach to educational employment; (3) the emergence of state public employee collective bargaining legislation provides a feasible rationale for repeal or modification of statutory terms and conditions of employment that generate major inefficiencies; and (4) both state and federal public employee bargaining laws, if enacted, should resolve potential conflicts between contractual agreements and state statutes and, insofar as feasible, eliminate state restrictions on educational productivity.

In the first study, raw scores from the 10 ITPA subtests together with Benet IQ scores were analyzed; in the second study, the 10 ITPA subtests plus the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Verbal and Performance IQ's), the Los Angeles Test of Perceptual-Motor Attributes and the Draw-A-Person Test were factor analyzed. Without loss of generality, both studies supported the channel separation in the theoretical model. (Author/CL)",

The scaling and \"yes-no\" discrimination procedures were successfully performed. The auditory discrimination revealed difficulty in the task analysis, resulting in the elimination of correct unprompted responses.

Cluster analysis indicated a clear distinction between low and normal IQ Ss with no other distinguishable variables (such as sex or score patterns).

The user of this packet is to collect information on what materials are available, who uses them (and how effectively), and what materials are not being utilized. This information is to be correlated with a materials evaluation measure. The supervisor observes teachers and students using the materials and interviews them to gain a more complete picture of the materials' effectiveness. He should also find out from them what  assistance they need to improve their utilization of learning resources. These resources include not only textbooks and other district-provided materials, but also those from area learning resource centers and instructional radio and television. These resources may not be fully utilized for many reasons, including unavailability of necessary equipment, inflexible work space, and lack of duplicate copies.

        "description":"Four conferences involving key special education personnel were held on research needs related to: 1) career education for the handicapped, 2) education for the severely handicapped, 3) early childhood education for the handicapped, and 4) development of personnel to serve the handicapped. Major concerns of the career education conference were development of skills for leisure time activities as well as work and the need to find and use existing knowledge to develop methodologies and programs. Themes of the conference on education of the severely handicapped included the need for an adequate system of information exchange among researchers and practitioners, the need for research to be directed to the most critical problems and to be nationally coordinated, and the importance of  continuous surveillance and longitudinal data collection. Stressed in the conference on early childhood education for the handicapped were the need for improved early diagnosis, appropriate intervention, research on programs and agencies to develop total service models, and the identification of personnel competencies. Focused on in the conference on the development of personnel to serve the handicapped was the importance of pupil achievement as the basis for judging personnel and program success. Areas of common concern across conferences included the need for information systems and the impact of affirmative action mandates. Primary outcomes of each conference were an annotated bibliography and proceedings of the conference. The major portion of the document consists of appendixes such  as the conference schedules and participants and conference recommendations. (DB)",

For five braille and five Optacon (optical to tactile converter) sequences, Ss were asked to identify the different stimulus from the four presented. Scalogram analysis was used to examine the results using a variety of criteria of mastery for all tasks. Results validated the hypothesized sequence of tasks and indicated that many first grade and most second grade Ss completed at least half of the simple discriminations given on the Optacon.

Twenty-nine children (final results included data on only 22 of this group) identified by Project staff as having the most severe learning disabilities were selected as the target population. Identification instruments and supplementary activities were developed or adapted using a pre-posttest research design which compared results from the target group with results from non-handicapped classmates and handicapped children who had not received supplementary assistance. The following  products resulted: Spanish/English Language Preference Screening, Observational Checklists for Referral, Criterion Referenced Test, Supplementary Activities, the Instructional materials manual &quot;How to Fill Your Toy Shelves Without Emptying Your Pocketbook--70 Inexpensive Things to Do or Make&quot;, and a manual on working with parents of handicapped children. Findings included that project children made significant gains on criterion-referenced and norm-referenced tests; and target children who had received Supplementary Activities made greater gains than target children who had not, and in some areas made gains comparable with those of their non-handicapped peers.

        "description":"Romanes is the collective name for dialects spoken by over six million Rom throughout the world. It is felt that a standard language is an essential factor for the attainment of a united future and the possible creation of the Gypsy state of Romanestan. This paper deals with some of the problems involved in creating such a unified and standardized language, particularly problems of orthographic standardization. The central issues include: (1) prevailing non-Gypsy attitudes towards the Rom and Romanes, with the consequent effects upon the attitudes of the speakers toward themselves and their language; (2) the diversity of dialects, which raises the question of whether a composite variety should be created rather than standardizing one existing dialect; (3) the problem of  individuals who no longer speak Romanes per se, but rather creolized forms of the language; and (4) the question of literacy, and attitudes towards it and formal education in general. Accompanying the discussion of these issues are a historical sketch of Romanes and a description of its modern dialects, a phonological description and a discussion of specific linguistic problems, specifically those encountered in devising an orthography.

Further, the intonation contours connected with her linguistically diverse open-open constructions were highly similar, suggesting the inadequacy of semantic relations and syntactic constructs in explaining the developmental stage. Finally, a comparative study of the intonation of the same child at two years of age and an abnormal speaker, a fifteen-year-old boy, pointed to differences in their syntactic capabilities that were not obvious from a syntactic analysis.

The studies are divided into contrastive and experimental work. A study by John Lotz (1943) demonstrated the non-congruence of the number category in Hungarian noun declension with English. Later Lotz studies (1966 and 1969) compared the morphophonemics and semi-vowels of the two languages. A Nemser and Juhasz study (1964) is a two-way analysis for teaching either language to speakers of the other. Balint (1966) demonstrated that in English and Hungarian \"many sentences occur in which time is indicated by other means than verbs and time expressions.\" A recent work by Orosz is an extensive contrastive study of the two grammars for pedagogical purposes.  The earliest experimental contrastive research on Hungarian and English (1960) reported on perception of English stops by speakers of English, Hungarian and other languages. A 1961 study by Nemser assessed the validity of contrastive principles relating to the prediction and explication of interference. The 1964 Nemser and Juhasz volume presented a general theoretical discussion of language contact. A 1968 study by Madarasz concerned contrastive and error analysis in learning English and, particularly, Hungarian. (CHK)",

The main differences concerning the relation of demonstratives and possessive determiners to articles are discussed. In noun classification, the system of English countable and uncountable nouns is contrasted with Hungarian. The distinction between English quantifiers \"much\" and \"little\" and numericals\"many\" and \"few\" is analyzed. Individual and non-individual features of Hungarian countable common nouns are observed. Part Two gives a contrastive analysis of English and Hungarian articles showing usage rules and examples. Predictions of errors are made for learners of each language. Difficult cases are presented, as English \"there is/are\" and uses of \"most.\" Use of \"some\" is contrasted with the Hungarian zero article.

Research results for the third year of the program (1973-74) are summarized, and research in progress during the 1974-75 year is discussed. The article closes with a discussion of a series of research issues for investigation, issues in many ways prompted by already completed research. Appended to this brief article is a transcript of a symposium on the Culver City program held at the 1975 TESOL convention in Los Angeles. The transcript contains an historical overview, a statement of theoretical assumptions about second language learning by young children, and statements by the three teachers involved, the principal, and a parent, as well as three researchers.

Works on topics related or peripheral to Sign, such as kinesics and gestural system, where Sign is not mentioned, are not included, but are referenced in the bibliographies of the items listed and in  Hayes (no. 11). The orientation of the listed works is toward consideration of what criteria a language must satisfy, and whether these are met by Sign. The annotations summarize the contents and often include an evaluation of the possible significance of the works. (Author/RM)",

        "author":["Celce-Murcia, Marianne"],
        "description":"This paper points out the irrelevance of the sentence-based grammatical explanations found in most grammar reference books and ESL textbooks with regard to answering questions such as: (1) when and why do native speakers of English use the passive rather than the active voice, and (2) when and why does the native speaker of English use the present perfect tense rather than the simple past or the simple present? These questions represent exactly the type of information the ESL teacher must transmit in grammar lessons. A strategy for answering such questions is suggested and demonstrated with examples from relevant studies. The strategy includes researching the literature, analyzing appropriate data, constructing hypotheses and testing them out. Language learners should get grammar  and usage rules based on fact and statistical consensus, and not on outdated prescriptions, native speaker intuition or hypothetical analysis. The paper argues the need to get linguistically talented ESL students to carry out ESL-centered investigations of English structure in context and describes some of the recently completed and forthcoming studies undertaken by TESL students at UCLA at the Master's level.

More recently error analysis has assumed a developmental purpose, namely as a clue to the process of acquiring a second language. Causes of learner errors, such as interference from the first language, confusing aspects of the second language, or learners fostering their own errors, are discussed; and teacher responses appropriate for the error type are suggested. Factors influencing the teacher's decision as to whether and when to correct are examined, i.e., the available information about the error, the importance of correction, the ease of correction, and the characteristics of the students. Then the teacher's options as to specific treatment for correcting errors are considered. Finally, some  reservations about error analysis are entertained. (Author)",

In the past two years, however, the Ilyin Oral Interview (Newbury House, 1972,76) has been successfully adapted from its one-to-one format to a mass listening test. It is being used in San Francisco Bay Area adult programs for achievement testing, and has been used in a summer program for placement purposes. Although the aural test format is soon to be published, it is possible for interested persons to adapt it for themselves from the published Ilyin Oral Interview.

One project examined the comprehension of affirmative and negative sentences that are read and verified with respect to a picture. A model developed to account for the sequence and duration of operations in this task also accounted for the processing of negatives in various situations, such as negatives in instructions and in test items. Another project explored how the information structure of a sentence affects comprehension. Each sentence in a paragraph generally contains some information previously given, and some new information. This project demonstrated that readers treat the two kinds of  information differently. This research led to an analysis of what makes good writing: it uses the linguistic devices that minimize comprehension difficulties. A final project explored the use of eye fixations to track the processes that occur during comprehension, examining how subjects fixate a sentence and picture during various comprehension tasks. It was shown that the sequence and duration of the eye fixations can be explained in terms of the mental processes that occur during comprehension. Other papers resulting from the original research are not included here. (Author/CLK)",

In the development of the methodology, applicable techniques from first language acquisition research were incorporated and new techniques appropriate specifically to second language acquisition were devised. The research examined the acquisition of English by six Spanish-speaking subjects over a ten-month period. Two subjects were at each of three target ages: 4-6, 11-14 and over 18. Each subject was visited approximately every two weeks and speech samples were recorded in three situations: spontaneous speech recordings, elicitations and  pre-planned sociolinguistic interactions. The subjects were &quot;free&quot; second language learners with very little or no prior or current instruction in English. Thus they acquired their second language mainly by exposure to the English-speaking environment. The analysis focused on the acquisition of the English auxiliary and its related structures, the negative and interrogative. A clear developmental pattern was found for both the negative and interrogative. A highly variable order of acquisition was found for the appearance of auxiliaries. (Author)",

The six programs for which data were requested are: (1) Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program (BEOG); (2) Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program (SEOG); (3) State Student Incentive Grant Program (SSIG); (4) College Work-Study Program (CWS); (5) National Direct Student Loan Program (NDSL); and (6) Guaranteed Student Loan Program (GSL). The survey questionnaire was sent to all 644 members  of the Higher Education Panel of the American Council on Education. Suggestions for improvement fell into two main headings: administration and program design. (Author/KE)",

The report deals primarily with: academic experiences and activities and to a lesser extent with student-faculty relationships, friends and acquaintances, extracurricular activities, and satisfaction with educational experience. The data were collected from the Experience of Colleges Questionnaires (ECQ), and several items from the College and University Environment Scales (CUES). The ECQ was first administered to U.S.C. undergraduates in the fall of 1972 and again in the spring of 1974. Comparisons are made between: (1) the two ECQ administrations, and (2) the ECQ and the Institutional Functioning Inventory  (IFI). The IFI gains information about faculty perceptions in many of the same areas as the ECQ. Data indicate that the problem of undergraduate academic apathy is especially apparent at the university. Student responses to the scholarship scale items from CUES emphasize a lack of student vigor and faculty challenge, although the potential ability certainly exists as judged from the positive items from CUES.

A followup study of transferees who entered Florida A &amp; M University in September 1973 found that there were more female than male transferees. There was no evidence of the usual transfer shock on their record, but Florida A &amp; M University received far fewer than its share of all transfer students when based on the total enrollment for the state university system. Few blacks are in and graduating from the junior colleges in Florida. Therefore, until current standards of admission and achievement are changed, blacks should recognize that career education for them requires the same kind of long-range  preparation. More specifically and probably for the first time they will have to be served by much more relevant and broader guidance systems of (1) early identification, (2) mastering developmental tasks, (3) motivation, (4) information, and (5) financial aid.

        "description":"Statewide review of new academic programs in now a fairly common phenomenon, but serious review of existing programs is a much rarer practice. Now that economic conditions threaten to leave many programs stranded, we face the uncomfortable fact that institutions are very sensitive to questions raised about the legitimacy of existing programs. Even with heavier institutional or multicampus system involvement in the review of existing programs, there will still remain several important roles for the statewide agency. They must not yet undertake self-evaluation; they must monitor the quality of the self-evaluation processes that are underway; and they must ensure that even high quality self-evaluation is placed in the broader context of state, regional, and national needs.  Twenty-eight coordinating boards are engaged in some form of review of existing programs, with two other boards having such procedures under development. Issues important to address are: (1) which programs to review; (2) the criteria for review of existing programs; (3) strategies and procedures for existing programs; (4) board start-up strategies; and (5) costs and benefits of review of existing programs.

Relevant literature is reviewed, and the institutionally descriptive data available for analysis and their manipulation into researchable formats are described. In order to relate the present data and methods to previous studies, variables similar to those used by the RAND Corporation were chosen. The data are factor analyzed, and the factor scores then used in two empirical cluster analysis procedures, and the results compared to those generated by RAND. Lack of replication is noted. The 10 clusters of medical institutions found by RAND were not found in this study. A variety of  factors may have contributed to this conclusion, including a substantial number of both methodological and data differences between the studies. It is concluded that, at least for the present, categorization of medical schools by procedures accounting for multiple measures simultaneously does not yield clear and unambiguous results. This finding indicates that the picture presented by data institutionally descriptive of the schools is a highly complex one, not easily structured into a reasonably small number of groups of institutions.

Variables were organized into categorical subsets to describe four conceptual components of medical education: faculty, curriculum, student, institution. Factor analysis was performed on each of the four sets and used to select descriptive variables that are representative of the dimensions of institutional variation in each educational component. The relationships of variables within components were discussed. The representative variables from the four  educational components were merged and analyzed as one set. Apparent relationships among variables from separate components were described. Questions of potential interest were presented which address substantive issues, the quality of the data and possible effects of the method on the results.

Projects range from the redesign of entire courses to the curriculum of an entire program such as music education.

An additional role in providing a campus climate in which radical innovation can occur is illustrated by the way the registrar's office has responded to the need for more flexible recordkeeping. The Center's services  are provided at no charge to individual departments and schools of the university to encourage maximum efforts to improve instruction.

These groups were then used to analyze differences between schools of differing class-size change patterns for 307 varibales drawn from the Institutional Profile System of the Association of American Medical Colleges. The results indicated significant differences for 36 of the 307 variables analyzed. Schools that increased class size the most and least had much in common. They tended to be newer, smaller schools, employing more volunteer faculty. However, the schools that changed the least were slightly older than the schools increasing rapidly and the differences between the two seemed to be financial. The schools that changed the least  tended to provide less student aid and have relatively fewer research funds. (Author/KE)",

It is noted that academic institutions are under substantial pressure to expand their existing facilities to meet current and anticipated health research needs. Such expansion is viewed by the survey respondents as necessary to (1) improve quality and opportunity for research, (2) attract and retain faculty, and (3) further develop graduate programs in the health  sciences. Immediate problems noted include inflationary costs; obsolete apparatus; dependence on large amounts of leased, rented, or temporary space; need to upgrade facilities to meet new federal standards; and lack of funds for planning. Despite these and other constraints, many institutions anticipated fairly significant capital improvement programs, specifically in cancer and environmental research, biomedical engineering, and in research demanding animal care facilities, as well as in broader health science areas.

The main goal was to determine the major effect of mass media on political knowledge and its influence on political attitudes and participation. It was found that although the experimental students were not overly excited about the television coverage, they had more positive attitudes about the legislature and the manner in which the sessions were conducted. Only 12% found the program interesting while twice as many felt they were dull. Among the other major findings were: interest in the political system increased after viewing, particularly among  the younger and black viewers: interpersonal discussion about politics with parents and peers increased; reading about state legislature in the newspapers increased; and greater political knowledge was gained, particularly among younger, white viewers. The impact of the programs was uniform among students differing in scholastic ability, political interest, and communication behavior. The research findings are summarized in 11 tables. (Author/DS)",

The framework of the actual game conisted of introducing the factor of &quot;vested interest&quot; by relating grade assignments to goal achievement in the game and by the use of various handouts containing historical background material and mock contracts, balance sheets, and income statements. The role of the instructor in the game consisted of  three functions: control, judicial, and approval.

        "description":"Several studies have suggested that students working in groups with computer-assisted instruction (CAI) learn equally as well as students who work alone. Since one advantage of CAI is its ability to individualize and thereby improve instruction, some explanation is needed as to how equivalent learning can be effected in groups. A model of differential interpretation of feedback is offered which explains how individualized learning can take place within a group setting. The model asserts the importance of careful design of feedback statements for optimum individual learning within group settings. (Author/JY)",

The entire test construction procedure is briefly reviewed; this procedure includes numerous quality checks to insure the production of both high caliber instructional materials and domain-referenced tests. The criteria used at various editing and review stages are mentioned. An initial evaluation of the items is made, and  problems inherent in the item generation procedure are offered. (Author/JY)",

However, the cost of searching abstracts is high, and adequate retrieval can be made using titles and keyboards. The second program was undertaken to improve computer-search quality and efficiency for large bibliographic files. An algorithm was generated whereby citations are clustered for presentation to the user.

Their selection emphasizes the convenience of indexing methods or access to information available and the amount of training and time required to use each service to advantage.

To this they add their own judgements of reputation, consistent  standards of quality, and flexibility to meet the changing needs of specific users concerned.

Unless the relationship of benefit to cost for these services is quantitatively understood, there are dangers of enormous waste in some areas or of the passing up of enormous net benefits in others. Very little has been done toward the assignment of a monetary value to these benefits. It should be possible to develop rough but useful quantitative measures for the benefits delivered by many kinds of information services by combining theoretical analysis with suitably gathered empirical data on the response of the user community to these or related services. The two most useful sources of information on quantified  judgements of value by users are market response--what users, as individuals or through their organizations, are willing to pay for an information product or service--and investment of time by individual users. To obtain these value measures, extensive data on the markets for information services and on the habits of their users will be needed, as well as sophisticated theoretical analysis of markets and of the interaction of different modes of information transfer.

Instructional packages that can be used as supplementary material to teaching seems the most appropriate approach to develop for higher education. Video modules enlarge the audience for special material, make available inaccessible material, and perform self analysis and evaluation. Computer based modules offer interactive testing of accumulated knowledge, self-paced analysis and investigation, and gaming. The primary obstacles to the use of these technologies are the absence of a viable system for distribution and access, the limited technological resources of the schools, and the lack of  adequate incentives for authors of such modules. One force acting to overcome these obstacles is EDUCOM. Since it was established in 1964, EDUCOM has attempted to help create a national computer network, provide information to improve computing services within individual universities and colleges, and provided a forum for higher education institutions to speak to the Federal Government on the subject of educational computing.

        "description":"In order to determine whether the characteristics and perceptions of adults over 21 years old differ significantly from those of college age students, a study was made of 1,178 (about 20 percent) of the 5,532 full-time day students enrolled at Diablo Valley College during fall 1971. Subjects were selected by stratified random sampling methods, with the stratification based on six age-sex groups: ages under 22, 22-30, and over 30, for each sex. Data for the study were gathered from the students' academic records, responses to a mailed questionnaire, and followup interviews. The older students, particularly older females, proved to be more traditional in their attitudes toward the educational process. At the same time, their academic records demonstrated greater seriousness of  purpose, persistence, and higher academic achievement. These findings indicate that some currently popular educational practices may no longer be appropriate as larger proportions of students beyond the usual college-going age enroll in regular programs. Questionable practices might include: unstructured, student-centered teaching styles; minimization of course requirements; emphasis on personal counseling; dropping of traditional grading systems, and custodial administrative attitudes. The survey instrument is appended. (Author/NHM)",

        "description":"In order to assess the educational needs of residents in the Chemeketa Community College (Oregon) service area, a random sample of 1,322 residents in McMinnville, Woodburn, Stayton, and Dallas were interviewed by telephone. This sample represented 2.5 percent of the 1975 estimated population 16 years of age and older, or 10 percent of the households having telephones. Telephoning was conducted by trained volunteers. It was determined that residents would like to see a wide variety of special interest, vocational-technical classes made available rather than lower division transfer courses only. Residents would like to have college staff available to provide information about classes. Residents prefer to have classes available in the evening, feel the offerings should be increased,  and feel that classes should be conducted in existing facilities. Residents prefer to have the option of completing courses at home, especially by way of correspondence. This document presents demographic information on the populations of the four communities, and tabulates responses to the seven planned survey questions. (Author/NHM)",

        "description":"Based on a review of the literature, procedures worked out at the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, and on insights gained working with personnel at several institutions in the formulation of goals and objectives, this report delineates procedures for goal-setting, and describes how the needs of community colleges differ from those of other types of postsecondary institutions. Specific definitions and examples are given for each of the following terms: &quot;mission,&quot;&quot;goals,&quot;&quot;objectives,&quot;&quot;priorities,&quot;&quot;role,&quot; and &quot;scope.&quot; Basically, this document emphasizes the need for concrete guidelines and alternative strategies for deciding about goals and especially for translating these general goals into specific objectives. A necessary first step is the  identification of a limited number of goals that serve to define the broad mission statement of the institution. For the goal-setting process, this document recommends a modified Delphi-technique which involves discussion of the institution's mission statement and of the results of a needs assessment survey. Personnel on all levels of the institutional hierarchy participate in this discussion, and suggest priorities for the goals. After the list of prioritized goals has been resubmitted to the same population, the Delphi procedure is repeated to prioritize objectives. (NHM)",

HJC has adopted a modularized, audio-tutorial, contractual (MATC) system of instruction. This system uses diagnostic pretesting, a variety of learning experiences and instructional media, and a formal system for setting behavioral objectives. Preliminary examinations of student achievement on the basis of contract completion rates, grade distribution patterns, attrition, and student satisfaction indicate that the MATC system is an effective strategy for meeting the diversity of the &quot;new&quot; student population. In order to meet the needs of the community, HJC  has instituted a program for prison inmates, has cooperated to provide general education courses for students of a local proprietary business college, has provided programs for the military personnel stationed at nearby Fort Ritchie, and has granted credits to students enrolled in courses offered through the Maryland College of the Air television network. Aspects of HJC's staff development program include a series of annual workshops, an instructional clinic, and a system of college funded instructional research and development. (NHM)",

        "description":"This report, the fourth part of a long-range study of persistence and performance in California's community colleges, deals with the performance of the 82 percent of the 35,000 student sample who entered the California community college system in fall 1972 and completed at least one term. Sixty percent of the total sample continued beyond one term, and 22 percent completed the first term, but did not continue. The various performance measures that are analyzed in this report include course grades and other final actions (withdrawals), semester grade point averages, unit loads attempted in relation to grade point averages, and incidences of withdrawal from classes. Sources of variance in performance are examined, including first-time freshmen versus transfer students, day versus  evening students, men versus women, and persisters versus students who enrolled for only the first term. Data are organized into five tables, and generally show that the records of students who discontinued after one term were not as good as those of persisters. It is possible, however, that many students who were classified as completing one term and not continuing were not attending classes at the end or failed to take final examinations, but were not recorded by the college as total withdrawals.

        "description":"From a goal of academic excellence for the few in the 1950's, higher education moved to a goal of educational opportunity for all in the 1960's. Although the open access philosophy led to the influx of many poorly prepared students, the teaching methods of the 1950's persisted. Only in the 1970's have college teachers begun to deal with the problems presented by diverse students with varying learning rates and styles. Higher education is now in the midst of an instructional revolution in which individualized, self-paced methods have come to the fore. Although traditionally selective colleges are not yet involved in this movement, as they continue to admit students who have attended community colleges utilizing individualized instruction, they may soon be faced with a student  rebellion aimed at self-pacing and other new instructional strategies. As the movement spreads, the concomitant shift in emphasis from \"teaching\" to \"learning\" will require major role changes for college teachers; in the 1980's they will be as skilled in the diagnosis and treatment of student learning problems as they are in their disciplines. A final implication of the movement is that the concepts of credits, grades, and semesters will soon be replaced by self-paced competency-based education. (DC)",

This document describes the establishment of an evaluation and management control system for LSC, and presents the results of the first evaluation. Basically, the evaluation involved a comparison of dropout rates between those LSC students who were enrolled in basic English or mathematics classes, and Los Angeles City College students who had been involved in a baseline dropout study. The baseline persistence study showed  a dropout rate of 42.8 percent for students in basic English. The dropout rates for the LSC program participants enrolled in basic English, on the other hand, were 16 percent for the fall semester and 6.6 percent for the spring semester of 1974-75. The baseline study showed a 45 percent dropout rate for basic mathematics, as compared to 22.1 percent for the LSC participants during the fall semester and 10 percent for the spring semester.

The results of an experiment with 96 kindergartners clearly suggest not: in conditions where subjects simply planned and activity (without executing it) learning was enhanced. Further, the temporal proximity of the planning to the potential motor activity did not prove to be important. These results, combined with those from subsequent experiments, give rise to the speculation--among others--that young children can be &quot;tricked&quot; into imagery generation through appropriately worded instructions.

(In 1940, approximately 58 infants for every 1,000 live births died in North Carolina before their first birthday.) This reduction in infant deaths is comparable to that experienced in the United States as a whole between 1940 and 1970; however, the North Carolina rate has remained consistently higher than the U.S. rate over the 30-year period. The North Carolina data showed considerable county-to-county variability in infant deaths. Thirty-four counties had rates of infant mortality in excess of the North Carolina rate. This finding was interpreted as an indication of inadequate health delivery systems in  those counties. Regional analysis of data showed that many of the multicounty regions with the highest levels of infant mortality contain most of the rural counties of the state. Recommendations for further research into background factors involved in infant mortality are included. (Author/BRT)",

Teachers were responsible for curriculum development and revision and communication with parents. Children participated in activities from two curriculum sections: the general curriculum (including perceptual development activities, conceptual-language development activities, art education, and physical education) and the academic curriculum (reading, mathematics,  science, social studies, and health and safety activities). Extensive descriptions of these curriculum areas, as implemented in the program, are provided. A comparison of the 1974-75 year of program operation to the two previous years of operation is included.

        "description":"A process-oriented research strategy was employed to examine relations among various aspects of the early home environment and children's language development. The home environments of 65 infants were assessed when the infants were 12 and/or 24 months old with the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME). HOME includes six subscales: Emotional and Verbal Responsivity of the Motor, Avoidance of Restriction and Punishment, Organization of the Environment, Provision of Appropriate Play Materials, Maternal Involvement with the Child, and Opportunities for Variety in the Daily Routine. At 3 years of age each infant was administered the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities. Results demonstrated that it is possible to specify some of the parameters of early  experience which are related to language development. HOME subscales &quot;Emotional and Verbal Responsivity of Mother&quot; and &quot;Provision of Appropriate Play Materials&quot; appear particulary important for language growth throughout the first two years of life, where as other environmental factors vary in their degree of relation to language development. Among the 10 psycholinguistic abilities measured, Auditory Reception, Auditory Association, and Grammatical Closure showed the strongest associations with the quality of stimulation found in the early environment.

Speakers during the second conference day focused on child abuse: the need for and form of a model child abuse reporting law and various methods of detecting and dealing with child  abuse problems. Day care issues were considered on the third conference day, including: inadequacies in existing licensing practices; practical requirements of good day care licensing systems; distinctions between minimum and quality licensing standards; and variations in the delivery of child care services.

A total of 476 male and female students (including 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th graders) were tested on semantic differential scales to gauge their reactions to the success or failure of a woman or a man. It was expected that the woman would not be rated negatively for failure. It was also expected that younger children would be more dogmatic than older children in applying cultural stereotypes to these situations. The children respond on semantic differential scales to the cue of Anne (John) succeeding (failing) in medical school. The children rated a successful person as much happier than one who failed, but the sex of the person succeeding  or failing was entirely irrelevant. However, the results were as predicted for niceness: a woman was somewhat less nice than a man when they both succeeded, but a man was much less nice when they both failed. There were no interactions with age of sex of the respondents. The results were interpreted to suggest that sex-role expectations are relevant to some attributes of individuals but not to others, and that these expectations are well-established as early as third grade.

The story schema, a theoretical model which formally defines the types of strategies, operations, and structures inherent in the processor of story information, is defined and its assumptions and rules are discussed in detail. The study of 48 first and fifth graders examined: (1) the effect of age and time on the production of stories; and (2) the usefulness of making distinctions between different types of story information. Each of the children listened while the experimenter read two of the four stories selected for the study. The children were then asked to recall the stories after 20  seconds of counting exercises, and again after one week. Although there were significant differences in total accurate recall due to age and time conditions, the organization of recall in terms of saliency of informational units was found to be extremely stable. The types of frequency of category information recalled were consistent across stories, grade level, and within time conditions, which suggests that certain types of information are more important than others in producing stories and that story recall is somewhat independent of simple primacy and recency effects.

The Chinese educational system incorporates heterogeneous classrooms and opportunities to &quot;serve the people&quot; through meaningful, productive work in order to foster a perception of group membership among students. The students in China were observed to be healthy, happy, confident, outgoing, and considerate. Children in China under 7 years of age are usually cared for by grandparents or in nurseries, and the warmth and affection of caregivers are valued. After age 7, children are included in a community support system which incorporates units of neighbors to provide direct care for children when necessary. Children are therfore socialized by the school, family,  and the community. The Chinese system of all-inclusive health care, the value placed on a stimulating environment in both the school and the home, the nonpunitive attitude maintained by teachers, and the consistency found between parent and teacher attitudes are other facets of the culture which optimize child development in China.

This study considered such social status attributes which seemingly serve as discrete indicators of group heterogeneity as sex, socioeconomic status, stability of household head's employment, parents' origins, and migrant farm-labor participation. Data were collected from questionnaires administered to 379 Mexican American high school sophomores residing in the Texas towns of Asherton, Rio Grande City, Roma, San Isidro, and Zapata in the spring of 1973. Determination of positive and negative ethnic identification was obtained through open-ended questions. Some findings were:&quot;Chicanos&quot; was the second most favored term, being preferred by 25 percent; 70 percent of those preferring &quot;Mexican American&quot; responded negatively to &quot;Chicano&quot;; a particularly high rate of negative identification was revealed among females; pro-Chicano identification was more than twice as great as negative identification among low SES males; SES appeared to have little bearing on Chicano identity among females; and for migrant males, pro-Chicano identification was twice as great as negative identification.

        "description":"In an attempt to obtain a measure of rural-farm poverty conceptually more meaningful than those currently available, a measure based on &quot;full income&quot; (defined as &quot;the purchasing power available for consumption in a normal year while keeping wealth intact&quot;) was proposed. The main task was estimation of the full income, rather than the money income, of rural-farm families in the United States in 1969 and the size distribution of that full income. Estimates were based on data on human and nonhuman wealth and market rates of return. The inequality of the distribution of full income was estimated by means of data on the distribution of human and non-human wealth. A full income poverty threshold was then applied to the constructed size distribution of full income, and full income  poverty was measured as the percentage of rural-farm families and unrelated individuals which fell below this threshold. Results produced an estimation that 5 to 14 percent of the U.S. rural-farm population was poor in terms of full income in 1969. By comparison, the corresponding figure as published in the U.S. Census of Population (using annual money income) was 19.9 percent. (Author/JC)",

        "description":"The study assessed the stability or change in the residential orientations of rural Mexican American youth living near the Texas-Mexico border, examined changes in the local social and economic environment, and made some predictions as to their effects on the students' dispositions. In the springs of 1967 and 1973, questionnaires were administered to all sophomores in 5 South Texas high schools located in Dimmit, Zapata, and Starr Counties. There were 341 respondents in 1967 and 379 in 1973. Although the questionnaire used in 1973 asked for additional information on labeling, migrant status, and value orientations, the variables used in the analysis were identical in wording and occurred in the same order on both instruments. Variables used were: residence aspiration and  expectation, anticipatory goal deflection, aspiration intensity, and expectation certainty. Due to the large increase in &quot;no information&quot; on the questionnaires, two sets of Chi Square computations were done. The first set included the &quot;no information&quot; cells; and the second set had the &quot;no information&quot; frequencies deleted. Some findings were: both males and females decreased in urban expectations over the six year span; males showed a slight increase in farm aspirations from 1967 to 1973; both sexes increased in certainty of their residential expectations; and females expected urban residence more than males in both years.

In order to derive a sample proportional to the State's population and one of sufficient size for county comparisons, 2 sets of data were developed (a statewide proportional sample which yielded a 68 percent response rate and a county sample which yielded a 66 percent response rate). Results indicated the North Carolina public: (1) was positively inclined toward county land use planning; (2) was only moderately inclined toward  statewide land use planning; (3) was more positively inclined toward land use planning when there had been previous involvement, either via education or prior experience in land use planning; (4) was generally less supportive of the environmental movement in 1975 than was the case in 1973; (5) was more supportive of economic and agricultural growth in 1975 than was the case in 1973; (6) demonstrated little change between 1973 and 1975 in the support of land use; (7) demonstrated some variations according to education, income, and rural-urban locations.

However, the personal, structural, and professional behaviors of the classroom teacher can positively affect the development of the rurally deprived child via: (1) positive teacher attitudes and modeling which create a climate of trust and respect conducive to learning (personal); (2) a classroom setting that is attractive, comfortable, functional, and complete with learning materials (structural); (3) continuous teacher self-renewal (in-service education and/or university course participation (professional). Four components of instruction which provide the key  to developing effective instructional practices for the rurally deprived child are: (1) development of objectives; (2) preassessment procedures; (3) methods of implemention; and (4) evaluation procedures. However, in each of these phases of instruction, it is important to relate what is being developed to the specific needs, interests, and ability level of the rurally deprived child. It should be clear, then, that deprivation in and of itself does not negate learning but that it does demand special attention to the development of teacher behaviors and instructional practices.

Considered to be indicators of structural situations which are associated with long-run variations in occupational placement, the four variables examined were: (1) father's education; (2) father's occupation; (3) race (black and white); and (4) residence (rural vs urban). Coleman's multi-variate attribute techniques and the &quot;Backward Elimination Procedure&quot;  developed in regression analysis were utilized in a secondary explanatory analysis of the data. Examination of the four models constructed revealed that: (1) social class indicators accounted for the largest effect estimates; (2) residence was associated with a smaller, yet statistically significant portion of the variation; and (3) the effect of race was negligible when controls were applied. Application of the &quot;most efficient&quot; model to black and white subsamples separately revealed race differences in both composite effect estimates and the rank order of effect estimates.

        "description":"Extending application of Svalastoga's (1965) concept of system permeability to the intrasystem analysis of sex-race differentials in educational permeability in the rural South, an operational procedure was developed to quantify permeability as the percent variation in filial attainment of a status not associated with variations in parental status. Reviewing parental-filial correlations for educational status reported from: (1) The Occupational Change in a Generation Survey; (2) The Project Talent Panel; (3) The follow-up to the Explorations in Equality of Opportunity; (4) The Wisconsin Panel; and (5) The Southern Youth Study (S-81); data were analyzed and produced some tentative conclusions. Among these were: (1) comparison of black and white rates of permeability revealed that  blacks' intergenerational competition for educational status was of a more egalitarian nature than similar white processes; (2) white males' educational permeability was greater than that for females; (3) based on Southern Youth data (354 white and 234 black males; 231 white and 207 black females), blacks were less likely to have aspirations for education corresponding to those of their parents' statuses and were less likely to translate their educational aspirations to actual attainment; (4) social origins influence achievement attitudes and attitudes influence attainment.

        "description":"The University of California at Davis's (UC) Agricultural Experiment Station (AES) was used as a case study for purposes of examining how one Land Grant Institution responded to charges that its research had not followed the mandate of the Hatch Act of 1887. Focusing on &quot;rural, noncommercial&quot; research, data were analyzed for fiscal years 1970-71 through 1973-74 relative to: the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Goal VIII: Assist Rural Americans to Improve Their Level of Living; and UC's Category Three--People Oriented Research (Consumer, Family, and Community). Although in 1971 UC appointed a nine-man reappraisal committee, the research clarification and classification established at that time did not, when viewed in terms of scientist manyears and dollar support allocation,  achieve the desired impact. It was concluded that the small increase in rural noncommercial research was due to: (1) size and composition of the AES personnel; (2) lack of department focal point for addressing rural, noncommercial concerns; (3) lack of an identifiable rural, noncommercial public; (4) dissemination problems with rural noncommercial research findings. Suggestions for improvement were development of: manpower versed in public policy considerations; increased dollar support; a refined focal point; and non-traditional research dissemination techniques.

It was estimated that the 1,275 acres of crop and pasture land which were transformed into a second-home recreation community could produce the following effects: (1) the development would generate $14 million in business activity before 1970, with less than 40 percent of that total accruing to local business; (2) financing of development activities would have a significant impact on the local area; (3) variable use and special use expenditures of  homesite buyers and their guests would generate $2.6 to $6.7 million in economic activity during 1965-70, with half of this total accruing to local business; (4) after 1970, use expenditures would generate $0.5 to $1 million annually; (5) maintenance expenditures would produce $0.3 to $0.6 million of gross business activity annually by 1975; (6) existing school facilities would be sufficient through 1975, but by 1975 or 1980 could pose a problem for adjacent communities if Latonka failed to provide for its own needs; (7) the development probably would have little or no effect on the value of agricultural output.

        "description":"Migrant farmworkers suffer from low wages, seasonal work, unemployment, limited coverage under labor legislation, health and housing needs, low skill levels, and undereducation. These are further complicated by their high mobility and, in many instances, by language and cultural differences. Prior to 1962, no significant legislation or programs existed for improving the conditions of migrant farmworkers or for providing opportunities to them and their families. Since 1962, migrant education programs have achieved significant development toward resolving these problems (i.e., Migrant Student Record Transfer System; coordination and cooperation between states in the three major migrant streams; interagency efforts to deal cooperatively with migrant education programs; and  development of such programs as Florida's Learn and Earn and the High School Equivalency Program). However, migrant programs, like their clientele, have always had to fight for survival. Therefore, rather than allow program deterioration by indifference or elimination of programs by administrative fiat, Congress must re-examine policies and procedures which may unintentionally be impeding progress toward improving the migrant's conditions. The National Education Association is willing to work with Congress and other interested groups to determine the necessary adjustments required in legislation and policy that will insure full participation of migrant farmworkers in our system.

A solution is provided for dealing with real-world considerations in which errors of measurement cannot be neglected. A worked example presents an instance wherein a blocking strategy is clearly advantageous assuming infallible measuring instruments, but not when the same instruments are granted fallibility.

The conference was organized for the purpose of discussing competencies of elementary teachers of mathematics. The conferees took the position that they could not define necessary and sufficient criteria for the competent teaching of mathematics, but that they could outline a set of goals and expectancies. Expectancies were developed in three major areas: problem solving, pedagogy, and mathematical content. In the discussion of problem solving, the works of several writers are considered, and several aspects of the process of problem solving are identified; 30 specific competencies related to problem solving are listed. In the area of pedagogy expectancies are listed  in four major areas (psychology of learning, diagnosis, resources and materials, and teaching strategies); sample behaviors are listed for each expectancy. Expectancies and related sample behaviors are listed for six mathematical content areas (sets, operations, number sentences, number theory, logical thinking, and geometry). (SD)",

Preliminary analysis supported the contention that the experimental group performed significantly better than either control group on the posttest measure of logical ability.

Verbal behaviors of nine mathematics teachers and four social studies teachers were coded and correlated with the gain scores of their eighth-grade students on the Cornell Conditional Reasoning Test. A Positive correlation (.39) was found between mathematics teachers' use of conditional language and students' score changes; no such correlation was observed for social studies teachers. Correlations between the frequency of conditional moves by the teacher and other classroom verbal factors were computed as were correlations between average class gain and classroom verbal factors.

Standardization is necessary so that whatever categories the different agencies use can be aggregated, disaggregated, or other wise combined so that the data developed by one agency can be used in conjunction with data developing by another agency. A brief introduction provides background information and describes the task of the Federal Interagency Committee on Education (FICE). Recommended categories of race and ethnicity are listed and factors considered in arriving at each heading and definition are discussed. The five basic, recommended racial categories include American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific  Islander, Black/Negro, Caucasian/White, and Hispanic. The second part of the report established guidelines on how the proposed categories are to be applied in specific situations, presents two alternative ways to collect data using the suggested categories, and discusses subdividing the five basic categories into particular ethnic subgroups. Lastly, the document makes final recommendations that are endorsed by FICE. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"This paper delineates some basic characteristics of ethnic groups in contemporary American society and develops a typology for defining and classifying ethnic groups which is more consistent with the current characteristics of ethnic groups than many existing definitions and typologies. Several social forces have changed the characteristics and relationships of ethnic groups in the United States since the major concepts and theories related to ethnic groups and ethnicity were formulated. As a result, new concepts and generalizations are needed to adequately describe the characteristics of the \"new\" ethnicity. The functions served by ethnic group affiliation suggest that there are several ways of classifying ethnic groups and determining the degrees to which various racial and  ethnic groups manifest these identified characteristics. Several types of ethnic groups are identified, including cultural, economic, political, eco-political, and holistic. While every American is a member of an ethnic group, the authors conclude that ethnicity manifest itself in diverse forms in modern American life, and that Americans belong to many different kinds of ethnic groups. The degree to which a particular cultural, nationality, or racial group is ethnic varies with a number of social, economic, and political conditions within the society. (Author/JR)",

Over the years, since the signing of the Constitution, Americans have believed that their political system was one in which they had a voice and that the system could be made to work. Recently, however, the opinion of the American people changed. The notion of self-government was replaced by the concept of federal government because the nation had become too big and too complex, resulting in less understanding and desire by individuals to participate in the process of government. To restore confidence and trust in governmental institutions, it is necessary to build a political and governmental  process that is open, accountable, and unbought--a political and governmental process in which citizens can believe and place their trust. The overall goal is to preserve the constitutional system and constitutional liberty. Before that happens, however, some basic problems need to be overcome. It is necessary to build both a strong presidency and executive branch and, at the same time, strengthen the instruments which hold them accountable. The most important problem is providing protection against abuse of governmental power. A strengthened role for organizations such as Common Cause can be used as a check against abuses of power. Common Cause can reestablish the link of accountability between citizens and their elected representatives. (Author/JR)",

Examination of recent political events, especially in areas of foreign policy, reveals that the government has assumed the right to decide what truths are to be told and when they are to be told. To return to the principles developed by the members of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the government must become one of laws and not of men. Today it is possible for men in government to become greater than the laws they have sworn to uphold. The problems of secrecy in government will not be solved until increased attention is given to refurbishing and bolstering the basic principles of society. United States foreign policy can no longer be involved in the political games of other countries. Only by rallying around  principles that command widespread response--principles concerned with basic human decencies and human rights and not with shadowy balance-of-power and balance-of-power strategies--can the United States succeed in the world political arena. If the United States works first toward truth in government, then world law can become the single objective of its foreign policy. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"This study is designed to determine the social and cultural factors influencing an individual and the ways which these factors mold achievement patterns. The book is intended for those who have a broad and general interest in education--teacher candidates, administrators, teachers, and certain lay persons. An objective is to make educators aware of cultural differences, particularly of those differences that affect teaching, learning, and achievement. The six chapters in this brief volume deal with topics such as culture, class, group, and person; culture and capacity to achieve; culture and will to achieve; and person, situation, and achievement. Chapter one, the introduction, discusses and defines the nature of achievement. Chapter two focuses on the nature of social contexts,  discussing how they might be characterized or how they vary. Chapter three is concerned with the intellectual capacity to achieve: language, perception, and cognition. Chapters four and five deal with the motivation to achieve. The author draws heavily on cross-cultural studies in language, perception, and cognition which have implications for teachers who work in cross-cultural settings. The concluding chapter suggests that a little learning in the field of the sociocultural origins of achievement can be a dangerous thing due to the delicate balance among all factors which interact to produce this achievement.

        "description":"The changing role of women worldwide and its impact on politics, economic development, and social structures is examined. Inadequate education, lack of access to channels of influence, and prejudice generally hamper women in exercising the political rights they are now given by most countries in the world. Priority should be given to those political areas which constitute meaningful exercise of political power, rather than simple, formal political equality, which is already by law extended to all but one-half of one percent of the world's female population. The implication of these findings is that future political development should focus on 1) appointment of women to high-level offices such as cabinet ministries, governorships, and subcabinet posts in not only the \"sofe-issue\"  areas of health, welfare, and social services, but also in the fields of agriculture, planning, commerce, finance, and foreign affairs; 2) consideration of women's qualifications for high political leadership, other than close association with a prominent male politician; 3) a breaking down of the pyramid structure of Civil Service which exists in many countries and is exhibited by an underrepresentation of women in the higher executive and middle-ranking levels; 4) a greater commitment by state and local political units to encourage active participation by women; and 5) more representation by women in all realms of political parties, not just in women's divisions or clubs. It can be concluded that, in spite of prejudice and ignorance, the political status of women is in the process of  major and lasting change. (Author/DB)",

Chapter two reviews research on the effectiveness of simulations and games as a teaching method. Chapter three discusses educational objectives and goals of simulations. Emphasis is placed on such objectives as decision making, negotiation and bargaining, legislative structure  and process, and systemic models. Chapter four concentrates on how to design and build your own simulation. Chapter five focuses on helpful hints for the implementation and use of simulations in the classroom. The appendices describe four sample simulations that may be useful for potential designeers. An annotated bibliography of simulation references is also included. (DE)",

Facing an environmental crisis, overpopulation, and an ever-increasing reduction of natural resources, education in the future must concentrate on teaching about the futility of growth, planned and unplanned. This emphasis on a nongrowth economy will, in turn, affect how teachers must approach values issues and traditional subjects now taught in schools. The gross materialism and status achievement of Western culture will have to be downplayed for a more egalitarian commitment to global sharing. Suggestions for how teaching will change on such issues and subjects as achievement, world studies, social-class status, ethics, progress, the social  ethos of the school, philosophy, economics, civics, sex education, population, energy, death, and higher education are outlined.

        "description":"This study on self-confrontation in teacher training presents the students' repeated assessments of subject-object relations both during the experiment and six weeks and two years after the experiment. For the experiment the student teachers were confronted with their own video-recorded micro-lessons; identification experiences and self-evaluation were examined for differences in level. The assessments made by the student teachers with an assessment and evaluation schedule were examined both for differences in level and for structural relations and similarities. One part of the self-confrontation experiment consisted of assessment of the video-recorded material by education experts. The experts' assessments were used in studying whether and to what extent the teacher training had  firstly, influenced the student teachers assessments in relation to those made by the experts, and secondly, led to larger structural relations or similarities between the student teachers' and the experts' assessments of the video-recorded material. Finally, a study was also made of the student teachers' repeated rankings of a number of alternative tutors. (Author)",

This paper includes the results from a small survey of physical educators representing five groups: (1) curriculum theorists, (2) researchers, (3) directors, (4) supervisors, and (5) teachers. Three questionnaires were administered, each requiring the respondent to evaluate a list of purposes to determine their validity in providing guidance for program development for both the present and the future. Respondents were asked to rate their importance on a zero to seven scale for both present and future physical education curriculum development, and to rank the list of purposes in  order of importance. A summary of ratings and rankings indicate changes in the concept of purpose in physical education. Neuro-muscular efficiency, mechanical efficiency, and competition are no longer perceived as primary purposes in future physical education programs. Instead, there is an increasing emphasis on physical education for the joy of movement, and for self-knowledge. (DMT)",

        "description":"Contary to the impression one can derive from the large amount of mass media discussion, sex education is generally still not an integral part of the school curriculum. One of several important reasons for this state of affairs is that adolescents are usually not represented in discussions of the need for sex education. Even when sex education programs do manage to become operational, the lack of teen input often results in such flaws as (1) having sexual physiology taught without being related to the psychosocial aspects of human sexuality, (2) avoiding controversial topics adults are uncomfortable discussing, and (3) conducting separate classes for males and females. The consequences of limited sex education are unwanted pregnancies and an epidemic level of venereal disease,  along with ignorance and misinformation about sex which worries teenagers themselves. Teen input can help overcome such deficiencies. Adolescent representation in the planning and operation of a teen contraception clinic is also useful. Teen input insures that users of the service will not feel alienated by the program and contributes to teenagers' maturity by teaching them how to handle responsibility. (Author/CD)",

The instrument designed for this investigation contained thirty items with two response scales (importance and effectiveness) associated with each item. In addition, demographic items and four open-ended questions were included on the instrument in  such fashion to permit the respondent to fold a single sheet, affix the edges, and remit by mail. Two mailouts and a telephone contact resulted in a total return of 62.8 percent of the graduates surveyed. Procedures determined to facilitate a follow-up study of this nature include (1) a systematic plan for compiling addresses of graduates, (2) the utilization of a durable single sheet mailout instrument, and (3) telephoning non-respondents.

Data collected from the implementation of this four-phase model can be used to make decisions for developing and changing performance objectives and program components. This model provides two classes of information: data on program operations and data on student achievement. The initial component (phase one) of the evaluation model serves two assessment functions: student achievement and program effectiveness. This information is obtained from a formative test with objective-type test items. The achievement and perception data collected in phase one provide information for short term  maintenance decisions for the coursework preceding student teaching. Phase two involves the confirmation of the stability of the assessment instruments. Two measurement processes constitute this phase: final cognitive assessment and observation of classroom teaching skills. Phase three centers on assessing the ability to apply teaching skills emphasized in the course work preceding student teaching. Phase IV of the model expands the effort to collect \"consequence of instruction\" information. Graduates of the program are asked to evaluate their preparation after one semester of classroom teaching experience on a brief questionnaire. (The report also includes a mathematical decision model, used when multiple sets of data are collected in determining whether the major goals for evaluation  programs are being attained.) (DMT)",

        "description":"Teacher directed inservice or professional development is one means of increasing teacher self improvement. However, unless the teacher motivation stems from an intrinsic desire to teach more effectively, the degree of professional growth will be minimal. For this reason it is imperative that a teacher directed inservice program depend on intrinsic motivation to facilitate growth. A problem solving approach probably has the greatest potential for resulting in real learning because of the unsatisfactory experiences that many teachers have had with professional development or inservice activities. The professional development model presented in this paper would be developed through a series of phases occurring over a period of time. The initial step in developing this model is to  create the items which will be included in the needs assessment instrument. It is imperative that the teachers involved in the program have input in the creation of these items. Once the needs assessment has been developed, it should be administered to all teachers within the area to be covered by the professional development center. After results have been tabulated on the needs assessment, they should be shared with teachers and a list of 10-15 highest priority items drawn out of the total list. A decision on which instruction to offer and when this instruction would be offered would then be determined by a teacher policy board which would also set the objectives for each course or workshop. Past dependence on administration or university to set goals will be replaced by a realistic  professional approach to continued self development.

ATI research has had dissappointingly inconclusive results so far, but proponents argue that this has been due to imprecise methods, which can be rectified. They believe that intervention strategies can remedy learning deficiencies, circumvent a learning deficiency by presenting information in a highly accessible manner, and capitalize on specific learning strengths. One way this is possible is by taking into consideration the cognitive development level of the learner. This is done by providing highly structured learning environments for students at a low conceptual level, and very little structure with an emphasis on  choice and decision making on the part of the students for learners at high conceptual levels. Proponents of ATI argue that it broadens competency based teacher education by stressing the importance of the individual and the environment, and by varying the content, sequence, and practice variables of teacher education.

For the FAIS group this was near the beginning of the term; for the PAIS group this was near the end of the term. At the end of the term post attitude and instructor evaluation data were collected. A final summative achievement measure on all course objectives was administered 10 days later. Under the FAIS treatment the most experienced instructor got high achievement but negative attitude gains, whereas under the PAIS treatment this instructor got both high achievement and positive attitude gains. The PAIS treatment produced consistent results regardless of instructor or level of aptitude. (RC)",

        "description":"The instructional effectiveness of learning programs derived from Gagne-type task analysis, ordering theory analysis, and random sequenced presentation of complex intellectual skills were investigated. Fifty-seven high school students completed a self-instructional program derived from one of the three sequences. No significant differences were found among the three groups in number of objectives mastered. The two groups receiving hierarchical presentations required significantly less time to complete the program than the random sequence group. The study seems to support in part the assumption that an optimal sequence of successful instruction exists. It is concluded that it is unwise to consider the learning of intellectual skills only in terms of prerequisite skills, but that  interactions with other variables must be examined. For learning hierarchies to have a profound effect in the classroom, more efficient procedures for task analysis or hierarchy generation are needed. Improvements upon the ordering theory analysis may provide promise in this direction. (Author/LBH)",

Twenty-six preservice teachers taught microlessons in social studies to eighth grade students; data were collected using three observation instruments and were analyzed using the covariance technique. Students of teachers who received training in values clarification questioning behaviors did use significantly more statements associated with this instructional objective. The  experimental teachers achieved their values clarification objectives without a decrease in the level of student subject-centered behaviors.

The subjects for the study were 26 preservice teachers enrolled in a social studies methods course. The instrument used was the Social Studies Observation Record (SSOR). All subjects were asked to prepare for and teach a 15-minute lesson. Their second lesson, two weeks later, was related to the same topic. Eighth grade students from a local middle school participated in the microteaching. Graduate students collected the  SSOR data. The observer-coder did not know the purposes of the study or which student had been assigned to either the experimental or control groups. The experimental group was provided with an instructional module describing a questioning strategy designed to enable them to attain their instructional goals of subject-matter learning and values clarification prior to teaching their second lesson. The results of the study indicate that the questioning strategy used does enable teachers to reach their goal of values clarification more often than instruction based upon a values clarification approach which does not focus on developing questioning strategies.

Four stages of values clarification are defined: (1) the comprehension phase, in which the student understands the situation; (2) the relational phase, in which the student sees relationships within the situation and between the situation and the instructional unit; (3) the valuational phase, in which the student has an affective response to the situation; and (4) the  reflective phase, in which the student examines his/her responses and the responses of other students. These phases are then examined in detail. The paper then tries to define exactly what constitutes moral reasoning. Finally, two stories are presented which contain moral dilemmas concerning property, law, money, theft, and other issues. Suggested questions are presented which would help the student look at the problems with a focus on understanding his/her own sense of ethics. (CD)",

The emphasis is on the nature of the tutorial interaction during the learning of complex material, with the eventual goal of being able to construct an automated, computer- controlled tutorial system. An active structural network (a type of semantic network) was used to represent both knowledge and procedures within the same data base. An event schema representation was developed to study the acquisition and organization of complex events. The schema was used to study students learning American Civil War history or how to program in the computer language FLOW. The studies of the learning and teaching processes are primarily concerned with developing models of the student and building automated  tutorial instructional systems. The automated systems provide a controlled environment in which to observe learning and teaching, and the two topic areas of history and programming were used to ensure the generality of the models. The technique of incremental simulation, in which the computer performs whatever aspects of the tutorial project are fully understood and human tutors enact the roles of other system components, provides for the extension of understanding of the interactions among the components of the overall tutorial system.

The CJMS provides a means by which jobs and job applicants can be matched at the semi- and low-skilled levels in both white- and blue-collar jobs. The CJMS operates by obtaining numerical profiles of both job seekers and jobs, across 16 Dimensions of Work, from self-completed paper-and-pencil questionnaires. The job and job seeker profiles are compared by correlation and difference statistics to rank order matches. The analysis of the validity of the job seeker/job profile match statistics, provided by the CJMS, as a predictor of the retention potential of subsequent job seeker/job matches was undertaken by tracking the retention of 142 job seekers over a period ranging from 14 to 21  months. The CJMS measures were found to provide statistically valid indicators of retention. In addition, interviews conducted with the staffs of manpower and vocational rehabilitation agencies who used the CJMS indicated that these personnel found the CJMS to be useful in assessing individuals and providing vocational counseling. Based on the results of this evaluation, the CJMS should be considered for use in labor exchange activities of the U. S. Employment Service, CETA prime sponsors, and other manpower programs.

        "description":"The Anchor Test Study (ATS) yielded equating tables for vocabulary, reading comprehension, and total reading scores for eight commonly used reading tests at the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade levels. Because of the original ATS sampling design which resulted in a nationally representative sample of school children at those grades, the equating tables might not be considered equally applicable for selected subgroups of the population--specifically, for black and Spanish-surnamed subgroups. The present study was done to determine whether use of the ATS equating tables for these two ethnic subgroups is warranted. Essentially, the analysis focused upon detecting interaction between test interrelationships and ethnic affilation in a way most relevant to the expected uses of the ATS equating  tables--average differences between equivalent and obtained scores for each ethnic group, in various parts of the score range, were tested for significance. The detailed procedures for accomplishing the implied statistical tests are described. The analyses appear in Appendices A, B, and C (for grades, 4, 5, and 6, respectively) organized by vocabulary, reading comprehension, and total reading scores within grade level. The results did not indicate any systematic ethnic bias. The few isolated instances which did exist might be attributed largely to the sampling procedure used in the ATS; i.e., maximizing representation of the total population, rather than that of any specific subgroup.

        "description":"Four monte carlo simulation studies of Owen's Bayesian sequential procedure for adaptive mental testing were conducted. Whereas previous simulation studies of this procedure have concentrated on evaluating it in terms of the correlation of its test scores with simulated ability in a normal population, these four studies explored a number of additional properties, both in a normally distributed population and in a distribution-free context. Study 1 replicated previous studies with finite item pools, but examined such properties as the bias of estimate, mean absolute error, and correlation of test length with ability. Studies 2 and 3 examined the same variables in a number of hypothetical infinite item pools, investigating the effects of item discriminating power, guessing, and  variable vs. fixed test length. Study 4 investigated some properties of the Bayesian test scores as latent trait estimators, under three different configurations (regressions of item discrimination on item difficulty) of item pools. The properties of interest included the regression of latent trait estimates on actual trait levels, the conditional bias of such estimates, the information curve of the trait estimates, and the relationship of test length to ability level. The results of these studies indicated that the ability estimates derived from the Bayesian test strategy were highly correlated with ability level. However, the ability estimates were also highly correlated with number of items administered, were nonlinearly biased, and provided measurements which were not of equal  precision at all levels of ability.

Items were developed and evidence of content validity generated. A pilot sample and a final sample of high school students were administered the Source Credibility Measure (SCM) so that actual response data could be used for instrument refinement. Both pilot and final data were submitted to factor analysis to explore construct validity. Reliability scores were also generated. Intertest construct validity evidence was generated for the final data. The study resulted in generating five factors represented by 29 items. These factors were Openness, Qualification, Communication Effectiveness, Defined Expectations, and Objectivity. The estimated alpha  internal consistency reliabilities generated for these dimensions ranged from .77 to .89. The 29 item, five factor SCM Questionnaire is intended to be used as a feedback tool for inservice and preservice teacher training and individual teacher self-improvement.

These results, along with those of a second statewide study done primarily to assess the reliability of the tests, formed the basis for a statewide planning effort. These studies are used as illustrations of the applicability of group data for evaluation purposes and provide a basis for suggesting some of the necessary sampling strategies. An urban district used the tests as one ingredient in a full-scale evaluation study, and some of the methodologies  of this study are described as exemplary of ways in which the tests may be employed. The use of these data for planning purposes will also be described. Finally, a suburban district used the tests to measure a set of goals different from, but similar to, the Phi Delta Kappa goals, in conjunction with a needs assessment. This required an added validation process and altered scoring. These procedures, along with the uses of the results for subsequent curriculum planning, illustrate the flexibility and usability of the approach for a variety of district needs. (Author/RC)",

Significant sex differences are found on 12 of the 24 ACL scales, with black females tending to score higher on all differing scales. A factor analysis of ACL scores yields two significant factors: that of ego structure and characteristic approach to life. A comparison of the sample VPI scores with black college students scores indicate significant differences  on most of the II VPI scales. Results indicate that the poor, black adolescent's perception of himself is one of self-depreciation. However, this does not mean that this population possesses a low self-concept since they may think they are worthwhile individuals but do not perceive themselves as competent or effective. The fact that they remain in school and actively seek work in the summer poverty program reinforces the hypothesis that they are trying to become effective and competent in their own lives according to society's dictates.

        "description":"Three districts that desegregated their schools by choice--Berkeley, California, Moore County North Carolina, and Searcy, Arkansas--as well as the Hillsborough County, Florida school district, desegregated under court order, are examined in this publication. All four studies examine the desegregation plans of each district as well as the compensatory education programs sponsored under ESEA Title I. As the local educational agencies desegregate, they have to modify or completely change their existing Title I programs. Sometimes the children receiving Title I services change, sometimes the district merely changes its way of delivering services. The case studies describe in detail the various methods each school district uses to revise its Title I compensatory education program  after desegregation. The Berkeley school district is primarily urban with a large minority group population: Moore County and Searcy are rural school districts, and Hillsborough County is a combination of the urban population of Tampa and the populations in surrounding rural areas. Despite differences, all the districts encountered some problems and at least a moderate degree of success in meeting the challenges of integration. The experiences and ideas presented in the case studies suggest ways of making integration a success in other school districts and support the argument that there is no general decrease in Title I effectiveness when desegregation occurs.

        "description":"The analysis of the planning for an implementation of an alternative high school in a large urban school system is the focus of this study. Interview data are used. This investigation draws on, and compliments, the previous literature on implementation. While most of the earlier studies look at failures, this one is based on an instance of successful implementation. The study identifies four factors that may account for successful implementation, the intent being to partially account for that success and to provide some clues to what program administrators can do to make it more likely that new programs will get fair trials in the schools. The school was formed from the top-down providing legitimacy within the larger system and a measure of homogeneity. A large amount of lead  time allows the faculty to develop personal ties and to share goals and values pertaining to the new school. Staff commitment to the school is fostered by mutual shaping by principal and teachers. Internal and external harmony is facilitated by stacking-the-deck. The strategy utilized by City Wide High School also has some negative features. The approach seems to reduce the chances for dissemination of the innovation within the school system. The large amount of lead time and the stacked deck, in particular, cannot be duplicated every time. Despite its shortcomings, City Wide High provides an alternative, and it is surviving.

        "description":"Results of an earlier six-year followup study demonstrated that a group of children with four years of Montessori education, including preschool and primary . school, score best on all seven variables of the third grade level Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT). The group with no preschool experience scored lowest on five of seven variables of the test. The children in the highest scoring group had been in at least two different Montessori schools with as many as three different teachers. The strong positive results indicate that the common elements of the Montessori philosophy withstood the exigencies of being set forth by several teachers. The purpose of this nine-year followup is to investigate whether these positive effects are maintained up to sixth grade level. Twenty-eight  of the 77 students evaluated at the third grade in the earlier study are again compared on MAT scores. Although no statistically significant results are obtained, those groups of children who had early Montessori training generally score higher on sub-tests of the MAT administered at sixth grade level than do those children who had Head Start or no preschool. Results obtained on the third grade MAT of those same children show similar but more brilliant results. Results of the study tend to re-confirm the importance of preschool experience for disadvantaged children. Research questions are listed. (Author/AM)",

Minority workers (data refers to all races other than white), are being seriously affected by the current economic recession. Their unemployment rates, like those of white workers, have increased steadily. Moreover, the gap between the unemployment rates of minority and white workers has widened. In addition to the higher unemployment rates of minority women workers, these women suffer other disadvantages in the labor market, which have lessened over the last decade or so. Despite  advances, minority women are more likely than white women to be in low-skilled, low-wage occupations. Even when they are fully employed, their earnings continue to be lower than those of white women or minority men or white men. Women of minority races are more likely than white women to be in the labor force (includes employed and unemployed persons) and to be working wives and mothers. They are also more likely to be heads of families. Although they still have slightly less formal education than white women workers, the gap in educational attainment between the two groups has been sharply reduced in recent years. (Author/AM)",

One of its purposes was to collect the diverse sources of earnings classified by education in OECD countries. but the more important purpose was methodological. Thus, the major part of the volume is devoted to a review of four aspects of the relationship between earnings differentials and level of schooling: (1) the role of student ability, (2) the role of school quality in determining earnings, (3) the extent of monopoly elements in earnings by level of education, and (4) fringe benefits by educational level. In particular the OECD report discusses the issues and possible analyses ralated to education and  earnings, analyzes the above-mentioned four special topics associated with the interpretation of earnings by educational level, documents the sources and presents in summary form whatever data are available on earnings by education in OECD countries, and points at some areas of future research. An appendix gives more detailed tabulations of earnings by education and documents the sources of such data in a number of countries. The document concludes with a four-page bibliography.

        "description":"Adult educators, recognizing grade communication problems between members of middle-class society (to which most belong) and individuals from culturally different groups are attending to cross-cultural communication research. Vastly different perceptions of reality, shaped by distinctive value systems and attitudes, underlie the problems. Intersection fields of experience, necessary to communication, may be extremely limited. Nonverbal transmissions are highly susceptible to misinterpretation. Communication barriers include differences in native language, the severe language limitations the &quot;hard core poor&quot; suffers outside its milieu, and the unrecognized reliance of many groups on nonverbal communication. Implications for adult educators are: (1) they must understand the  communication process; (2) they must realize that they perceive reality differently from their students; (3) they must respect the languages of culturally different groups; (4) they should not overlook the importance of relevant oral communication in the learning process; (5) they must be acutely aware of the nonverbal modes of communication; (6) they must understand proxemics (the study of human space needs); and (7) they must be aware of the negative implications of superordinate-subordinate communication patterns. Finally, adult educators must utilize the vast array of materials and media available to them. (Author/AJ)",

A survey was undertaken to determine (1) the type of training and background desired and (2) recruitment procedures and employment prospects for persons deliberately trained to work within the general area of educational research in the health professions. A four-page questionnaire was sent to the deans of the 57 accredited dental schools in the U.S. and responses were obtained from 55. Parts I and II of the questionnaire asked for ratings of the importance of studies in educational psychology, statistical analysis, measurement, the design of research and related areas (e.g., the  development of funding proposals) using a five point Likert-type scale, with categories ranging from \"irrelevant\" to \"imperative.\" Part III of the instrument dealt with the utilization of graduates of an educational research training program. Over 45% of the responses indicated that knowledge of specific topics was imperative, with only one response indicating that a topic was irrelevant. The results also suggest that a rather conventional doctoral level preparation in research methodology, with supporting work in curriculum and instructional materials development, is regarded as optimal preparation by the majority of deans responding.

The approach was to trace the student enrollment figures and provincial contributions to operating revenues from 1971-72 until 1973-74 in order to determine the levels of support on a per student basis. The results showed a dramatic decreasing position for Ontario in its funding on a per student basis when compared to the other provinces. In 1971-72 and 1972-73 Ontario's per student contributions were above the national average by $55 and $64, respectively, and ranked third in Canada, while in 1973-74 the contribution was $45 below the national average and the province ranked sixth in the nation. The  preliminary data for 1974-75 indicate a continued deteriorating position for Ontario, falling even further behind the national average and having a lower rank order position. In 1973-74 Ontario would have had to contribute approximately $12.4 million in order to match the per student contribution average of the other provinces. The financial estimates for 1975-76 show that the gap between Ontario and the national average has grown larger. (Author/LBH)",

In scores of colleges studied, very few boards of trustees were found who met the standards of composition, organization and performance necessary for solution of basic institutional problems, including the financial crisis. Where boards have been strong, well organized and committed, the institutions, though facing financial pressures, still view the future with expectation of success and continued viability. Weak boards were found in institutions in deep trouble. Implications of these relationships are discussed. It is suggested that trustees as well as management must be held accountable for  institutional performance. Possible legal actions, such as class action suits against trustees evidencing neglect are considered. Most of the problems of institutions focus primarily on one function of management--financial stability--but trustees also have ultimate responsibility for policies defining educational objectives, faculty support, and student cocurriculum.

Nine preconditions for fiscal procurement responsibility, from private or public sources, are outlined that deal with: (1) response, not  reaction, (2) the chief executive, (3) academic deficits, (4) management assurance, (5) financial options, (6) staff ingenuity, (7) constituent perceptions regarding private, public, and church-related institutions, (8) tax implications, and (9) institutional marketing.

The study indicated that: (1) the professional reputation of alumni was one factor which influenced 41 percent of the Music advanced degree graduates to enroll in the college; (2) History majors (82 percent) revealed that the use of a variety of teaching techniques were not relevant to a college choice; (3) proximity of the college was a major  influence in selecting a college for many of the Elementary Education (84 percent) and History (82 percent) majors; (4) over half of the English majors indicated that a major influence in college selection was the possibility of graduate assistantships; (5) approximately 71 percent of the Reading graduates felt that they had received a variety of learning experiences; and (6) travel (over 10 miles one way) to attend classes was a pattern for over half of the Elementary Education and Music graduates.

Additional discussions not reported in this monograph were reflected in the recommendations from the conference that were published separately. Emphasis in these papers was on the proper relationship of tuition levels and student aid, and the proper balance of federal and state support of higher education. This monograph contains four major parts dealing with (1) the problem of race and class inequities; (2) higher education finance and its effect on equal opportunity: two approaches to public policy; (3) southern state policies and programs, state financial aid programs and student access, some documents on educational finance in the South;  and (4) statistical appendices on race and income inequities, participation of blacks in federal and state student aid programs, and public college tuition charges in the South.

There is a place for external degrees based on competence demonstrated by examination schools without walls, and semi-professional, occupational, and vocational programs. Distinctions between formal and informal education are breaking down and education is expanding its horizons to be more in harmony with real life and the real world. These changes present a new dimension of measuring and  awarding credit and degrees. At the same time that accrediting agencies are expanding their focus to include these new forms or education there must be careful review of questionable education standards to deter the federal government from acting as a regulatory agency.

The C&amp;PD program is an educational development program in which faculty members, either singly or in groups, prepare proposals for projects or programs they would like to conduct. Each project or program must be related to instructional activities and/or the instructional mission of the university and must have provisions for evaluation. Each must have the capability of becoming self-sustaining if successful. Programs may be funded for one, two, or three years. Guidelines for funding are outlined, along with a formative evaluation plan. The evaluation consists of three components: (1) bringing in a team of evaluation consultants; (2) collecting data on campus awareness,  knowledge, and perceptions of the C&amp;PD program; and (3) examining evaluative data on individual projects in the context of the program as a whole. Recommendations of the evaluation team are reviewed regarding increased program management, better definition and refinement of policy and guidelines which govern the program, improvement of program operations, clarification of university commitment to the C&amp;PD program, publicity, and name change. Questionnaire results indicate a very high agreement among faculty with the program's purposes but a less high evaluation of the program's effectiveness. Appendices include a listing of projects funded by the C&amp;PD program, 1974-76. (LBH)",

It is noted that only the Naval and Merchant Marine Academies require a comprehensive examination to evaluate students' professional competence before graduation and commissioning. These examinations should not serve as rigid formats, but as guides for the other academies in developing systems to meet their specific needs and to identify military training shortcomings. The Naval and Coast Guard Academies have recently established formal programs to assess individual and group performance after graduation; the Air Force and Military Academies lack such programs, relying principally on informal,  fragmentary feedback. A formal program is suggested to give the academies better information on the competence of graduates they are producing. (Author)",

The origins and policy of the faculty contract are described. Faculty appointments and reappointments are made for specified terms of three to seven years, the first contract generally being for three or four years. The process assumes an open file into which evaluative material is placed by the faculty member under review and all  other persons who choose to comment. The College-Wide Committee of Faculty Reappointments has the power of recommendation to the President. The responsibility for presentation of the file itself to the College-wide Committee rests at the school level with the school dean.

The role of advising by faculty members is examined, and student responsibilities outlined. They include assignment to advising centers, examination proposals, and transcripting. Post-graduate placement is also described. Strengths and weaknesses of the system are considered. Outside evaluations have reinforced the college's notion that the examination or evaluation process contributed  strongly to the college's overall objective of increasing the student's autonomy and independence as a learner, not just in the classroom, but in everyday life.

It was found that USC's appeal to academically talented students is not strong. Such students who considered USC but elected to go elsewhere cited as the primary reason the academic reputation of the school. Those who chose to attend USC were more likely to cite low cost as the major reason, although the availability of the  Carolina Scholars Program was a major influence for some. Based on student recommendations, USC could enhance its appeal to these students by taking steps to strengthen its undergraduate academic reputation, by promoting its newly created medical school, by expanding existing honors and study abroad programs, and by offering additional scholarships awarded on merit.

        "description":"A sample of 783 students responded to the Autumn Quarter 1975 survey on questions related to the allocation and use of mandatory student fees and opinion toward international students. The respondents recommended a broad base of support for most services from university resources and user fees as well as student fees. Selective pruning of services, reductions in programs, and charges to users were advocated as preferred accommodations to possible reductions in funding or increased costs. Asked to allocate a hypothesized increase in student fees, the largest number of respondents named financial aid as most deserving. The large majority of respondents had met international students and considered them as contributing valuable diversity to the University of Washington.  (Author)",

It is hoped that the church will see the need for interdisciplinary theological research and communication and will identify the valuable resources in personnel which already exist in these fields. Then, through the development of centers for interdisciplinary scientific/theological research, or through the creation of an academically oriented campus ministry which  is qualified to speak to specialized issues in the intellectual community, the church will again have a voice within those institutions who determine through their research and teaching the character of the individuals and the society of the next century.

Cognitive variables (GPA and ACT) accounted for achievement variance under criterion-referenced conditions, and affective variables (SSHA and 16PF) accounted for achievement variance under norm-referenced conditions within the course. Time, which was inversely related to achievement, was explained best by college GPA and personality variables.

It is noted that it is normal for a foundation to enter heavily into a particular field for some years and then gradually to withdraw from it. This cyclical or impermanent character of foundation support is grounded in the basic principle that foundation funds should be used flexibly in application to emergent needs of society and not permanently committed to purposes chosen once and for all. Trends of foundation support and future foundation planning are discussed. Reference is made to the necessary  diminution of the Ford Foundation total budgets.

Because College Park is such a large institution, despite a low percentage interest there do appear to be enough individuals to begin a facility.

        "description":"Conceptualizing progress through college as a sequential process, the study examined factors that affect rates of persistence and dropping out, using longitudinal data for a national sample of young men attending college in the late 1960's. A principal conclusion was that factors important to understanding persistence vary with the stage of the undergraduate career. Pre-college attributes of parental socioeconomic status, race and age exhibit no significant net relationship with dropping out at any stage. The effect of having pursued a college preparatory program in high school is relevant only to completion of the freshman year. The net importance of pre-college measured ability declines substantially after the freshman year and is nonsignificant by the junior year. While  working evidently inhibits persistence in college, not all employed students become dropouts and the impediment appears to be greatest for those who work between half and full time. It is found that young men who initially matriculate in a two-year institution are much more likely to drop out at every stage of undergraduate life, even after having transferred to four-year institutions. Receipt of a scholarship bears a consistently positive relationship to the probability of successful persistence in college. It is concluded that much previous theoretical and empirical research on dropping out must be viewed with caution. (Author/LBH)",

The relationship between a student's &quot;significant others&quot; and his staying or leaving college was examined. The construct &quot;significant other&quot; was defined as one who influences an individual's conceptions (about himself and his orientation toward life) through either interaction (definer) or by example (model). The findings supported three hypotheses: (1) A student will have a propensity to drop out if he has no &quot;significant others&quot; at the college. (2) A  student will have a propensity to remain if he has at least one &quot;significant other&quot; affiliated with the college. (3) The Significant Other Survey is a useful instrument in the early identification of students who are most likely to drop out of Spring Arbor College. Highlights of a program designed to reduce attrition based on the Significant Other Model were used in summarizing the project. (Author/LBH)",

The faculty and administration have been drawn from traditional university experiences. This paper examines two characteristics commonly held by all universities: the practice of university governance and the concept of faculty tenure. While it is conceded that governance truly rests in the Board of Regents, disagreement occurs in the discussion of the formalized process of governance. An examination of the basis of faculty tenure shows that it is awarded in recognition of promising scholarship, teaching, and research and designed to allow the scholar to proceed with his investigation without being fettered with concerns  arising from loss of job and salary unless unusual charges could be established against him. Upper-level institutions have an opportunity to practice general governance, blurring distinction between faculty and administration. Administrative activities can be justified as tenurable for faculty. (JMF)",

If universities are to accomplish these tasks, given the scarce resources available to them and given the pressures from different sectors of society and the academic community itself, each institution must consider its response carefully. First, each university has to decide the extent to which it will assume new roles to replace older ones, and then it must design the modifications in its organization and management to achieve those objectives dictated by the new roles. Transplanting Western educational technology  and business technology to university governance has resulted in the creation of a number of training and development programs yielding a new breed of Asian university administrators, professionally trained and prepared to apply innovative technologies to traditional patterns of organization and management with a commitment to growth, change and efficiency.

The essay is a collection of the views expressed and deals with such topics as conceptions of the role of the U.S. university; conceptions of the role of the Latin American university; comparative roles of the two; the authority system in each; the political roles of the U.S. and Latin American university; the role of the university in modernization; and mutual cooperation  in international development. Specific recommendations that emerged from the conference were for technical assistance through educational exchange; improved inter-American communication; and Latin American integration. (JMF)",

Having built up their resources, they must now find means of sustaining these resources and of matching their capacities more closely to Asian needs. This process is complicated by the status of many Asian universities as hybrid institutions largely based on Western models. As useful as these models have been in the formative years of Asian higher education, they have not proved entirely sufficient to the special requirements of higher education in Asia. This essay focuses attention on the role of educational cooperation between Asian and U.S. institutions in the present and immediate future, and attempts to provide a sense of the collective contribution of the participants of the 1974 Institute of International  Education conference.

The reexamination has led to a renewed stress on basic science education and an explosive growth of graduate education. In view of these structural changes, almost every Latin American country has established a national council of science and technology to provide support for scientific and technological research in the universities. Parallel to the research councils are the national associations of universities and the councils of rectors charged with the task of allocating national funds to universities, courses and programs. What is needed now is greater hemispheric collaboration, increased technology  transfer, and interaction in the area of scientific and technological policy studies as well as innovations in funding of research.

Tuition and student charges have continued to increase to help meet escalating institutional expenditures, much of which is due to national inflation. It is contended that there is much evidence of an abating of these economic conditions, as well as encouraging signs that higher education has passed through the financial crisis of the early 1970's. However, there still is a \"confidence\" crisis afflicting higher education, which may not diminish until institutions spell out more clearly to their various funding public how the student is being served. A set of comprehensive indicators of institutional health, to be developed nationwide with federal and state cooperation, is advocated  that should receive the highest legislative priority. (LBH)",

Implications are drawn about the effects of this policy on such national concerns as providing equal educational opportunity and maintaining the quality of the nation's postsecondary education system. An important distinction is made between the identification of federal policy through the legislative process of establishing programs (authorization) and the implementation of federal policy through the legislative process of funding programs (appropriation). Consideration is given to such critical issues as completing priorities for federal  and state funds, different enrollment trends, emphasis on student aid almost to the exclusion of institutional aid, and the problem of maintaining low-cost public higher education while also preserving a viable private education sector. The student aid funding levels for disadvantaged students are found to be insufficient, and increasing costs and rigorous financial needs tests are reducing the college attendance rates of middle income students. New directions for identifying and implementing federal policy to serve national purposes are given. (LBH)",

The thesis is that the role of the institutional researcher is to create reliable data bases about the institution's faculty members in order to influence the decisionmaking process of power elites in the institution. A taxonomy for creating a data about the personal, professional and organizational dimensions of faculty members is presented to guide the institutional researcher.  (Author/JMF)",

Because there was no reliable data base about faculty development, a research project was undertaken to provide information about how faculty members perceive their own growth and development. A structured interview with 42 professors in each of the three ranks of full, associate, and assistant yielded the following results: (1) Faculty members are making only minor changes in their teaching and often these changes are hard to identify by professors. (2) Such changes are brought about primarily by the organization in which professors work rather than by outside sources. (3) Changes in teaching methods are not  being evaluated in a scientific way. (4) The freedom provided by the university environment both helps and hinders faculty development. (5) Faculty members do not perceive that they are rewarded by the organization for teaching. (6) Traditional superior-subordinate yearly evaluation is the most frequently used evaluation for faculty performance. (7) Provisions for planned faculty development do not exist. (Author/JMF)",

        "description":"Data were collected from a selected group of four-year, comprehensive colleges located in urban areas in New England, Mideast Atlantic Coast, and Middle West states. Eighteen schools were selected on the basis of their offering bachelors and masters degrees, and being public schools. Their operating expenditures for FY 1975 were collected from Part B of the HEGIS Survey on revenues and expenditures in higher education. Other factors were obtained to determine the total number of full-time equivalent students taught during the period covered by the expenditure report. Data of this type were obtained through a telephone survey of each institution and included the number of credit hours used to determine a full-time student at the graduate and undergraduate levels, number of terms  in the academic year, credits being offered, and the total head count and full-time equivalent enrollment served during each term in FY 1975. Comparative statistics are offered for this group of schools and Federal City College (FCC). It is noted that FCC spent only $20 less per full-time equivalent student than the highest expenditure for institutional support found in the sample colleges and that FCC's per student expenditures for libraries and overall academic support were only slightly lower than the highest in the sample.

It is noted that higher education is becoming increasingly accessible to all segments of the population and that increasing numbers of students put priority on learning skills they need for employment rather than on a general education. More people beyond the usual college age of the late teens and early twenties are enrolling in postsecondary education, and the idea of lifelong education has spread. Federal efforts have been concentrated on equalizing opportunity, improving the quality and relevance of education, and providing limited general support to state and local education agencies, developing postsecondary institutions, and adult and vocational education.  The financial plight of higher education and the impact of inflation is discussed, as illustrated most starkly by the small private liberal arts colleges in the U.S. Variables that will affect the future of higher education are seen as the federal education policy, the economy, the nature of society, and ethnicity and social class.

A residence hall solicitation survey was conducted and usable responses received from 421 of 675 students approached. The findings indicate that although support for solicitation varies with different groups, strong support for solicitation does not exist at USC. Students did not favor the complete removal or restrictions on any type of solicitation, especially solicitation by non-students. The data seemed to suggest potential support for some liberalization of policies  concerning student solicitation while still retaining strong control over non-student solicitation. (LBH)",

A false drug (derbisol) was included in the questionnaire as a validity check. A total of 848 students (28 percent of the freshman class) was surveyed. The data indicated a stabilization of drug usage for most drug categories when compared with previous surveys. The usage of alcohol, amphetamines, narcotics, tobacco, and tranquilizers had increased by negligible amounts since the 1974 survey; use of hallucinogens, barbiturates, cocaine, and marijuana/hashish had decreased by negligible amounts. Important sex differences were noted, with females reporting higher usage levels in seven of the ten categories while closing the gap in the other three  drug categories. The data clearly demonstrate that substantial numbers of entering freshmen already have well-defined levels of usage of individual drugs and drug categories upon entering the University of South Carolina. It is recommended that the Freshman Drug Survey be administered every other year at Summer Orientation to enable the University to monitor the levels of drug usage of entering freshmen. (LBH)",

The research strategy, methodologies, data collected, and major findings of a study of such clerkships are reported. The data from more than 1000 hours of observation and self-reports of 77 medical students provided a substantial base of descriptive information about the commonality and diversity of experiences. No judgment as to the quality of the experiences has been undertaken; rather, questions about students' activities have developed that have begun a process of examination to determine if such experiences are consistent or inconsistent with good educational planning. Major concerns are  outlined regarding equitable distribution of time, student-patient contact without direct supervision, purposes of conferences, roles and responsibilities of faculty toward the medical clerk, procedures that all students should learn, and instructional possibilities in the operating room. It is concluded that these studies are a beginning of a systematic examination to determine whether learning under the circumstances of the core clerkship can be optimized. (LBH)",

Peer and instructor rating forms were also developed for evaluation of leadership, decision style, ability to cope with stress, and interpersonal effectiveness. Five objectives were accomplished under the research extension contract reported here: field testing and operationalization of the revised simulation for use on representative ROTC campuses, refinement and preliminary validation of the behavioral style rating scales, development and application of a multimedia training system for instructing faculty in the use of the simulation and assessment battery, and follow-up of the  simulation's assessment capability. The final version of the simulation, entitled The Leadership Effectiveness Development Simulation (LEDS), enables participants to develop leadership and interpersonal skills and exhibit realistic and relevant behaviors in these areas for diagnostic purposes. The LEDS can be administered in four 50-minute periods: introduction and initial involvement, the simulation experience, completion and diagnosis, and personal feedback. This report includes a description of the simulation including the setting, physical facilities, roles, simulation operations, scoring and evaluation, leadership diagnosis using the Leadership Description Scale (LDS), and feedback procedure.

The following are examples of those concepts the students observed in operation at the conference: Social structure affects social policies; the creative use of conflict can be used to restructure relations between groups; guidelines exist to determine whether pluralism or elitism prevails in a given power structure; non-decisionmaking, as the counterpart of decisionmaking, must be examined to determine who holds power; values, feasibility, and effectiveness must be considered in choosing social policies to support. It is suggested that this method of enriching classroom experience  can be generalized to include local as well as national settings. Specific recommendations are made for sociology departments developing such projects. (JT)",

        "description":"In an effort to elicit student attitudes concerning residence hall living on campus a questionnaire was designed and administered to a random sample of 1,100 resident students at the University of South Carolina. The survey instrument consisted of a set of sixteen statements that required an &quot;is&quot; and a &quot;should be&quot; response. The greatest disparity between the percentages of respondents who agreed or strongly agreed to an &quot;is&quot; statement and a &quot;should be&quot; statement was with the item &quot;the residence hall is/should be a place where one can study quietly&quot; (52.6 percent/93.3 percent). The item with the highest percentage of agreement was &quot;the residence hall is/should be a place to make new friends&quot; (over 95 percent agreed). The high response rate of the item dealing with opportunities  for interaction with the opposite sex reinforced the thinking of the staff about the need for co-ed living. Results were analyzed to compare dormitories and to compare male and female responses and were used by the Residential Life Services staff in planning for residence halls. In general the students expressed satisfaction with the residence hall program of the University. Over 50 percent feel the residence hall is a place to seek advice, to make new friends, to be known as a person and not as a number, to study quietly, to be alone, to find help with courses, to help with one's judgments in solving problems, to provide an opportunity to complete one's growth into adulthood, to sleep, and to party. Questionnaire items and data are included in this report. (JT)",

Work done so far has essentially validated an initial approach to the problem where past enrollment behavior has been taken as a predictive factor. Analysis of the data specially compiled for the study shows that the more numerous and more recent a student's enrollment has been in the past, the higher his probability of return is. The difference between the summer quarter and other quarters has been documented. A model that fits well the observed data on return probabilities has been constructed  and, using it, the effects of the various components of past behavior affecting return probabilities have been measured. Future work will validate the model with more recent data, fortify it, if necessary, with other explanatory variables, and put it into operation, setting up systems for data collection analysis. Appendices discuss mathematics of probabilistic predictive models: Operationalizing Predictive Models and Fitting an Additive Model to Logarithm of Reenrollment Probabilities. (Author/JT)",

        "description":"It was hypothesized that organizational participants have one of four preferred power balancing styles--Independent Style, Outside Interests Style, Organization Man Style, or Collegial Style--and further hypothesized that such styles have biographical correlates and that certain styles will tend to be overrepresented in organizations. The Situation-Reaction Checklist was developed for measuring the preferred power balancing style of faculty members in one large school, in a university, and in two community colleges. Subjects were asked to respond to the mailed questionnaire, and a panel of raters at each of the institutions also assigned each subject to one of the four style categories. Statistical analysis of the data, showing close correspondence between subject and panel  ratings, showed considerable proof of the existence of power balancing styles among college faculty. Biological correlates of styles were also demonstrated, and the groups were heavily biased toward Styles III and IV. The Style III (Organization Man) person (characterized by building of organizational dependency on the individual through hard work and flattery of superiors) is oloer, stable, pro-administration, and supports major cultural values. The Style IV (collegial) person (favoring unions or informal pressure groups) is young, anti-administration, less accepting of major cultural values, and has had a career path with an early calling.

        "description":"A study was designed to develop a method for identifying and ameliorating faculty salary differentials or inequities at a moderately large (500 faculty members) master's-degree-granting institution. A linear regression model was chosen to determine the relationship between the observed salary and the independent variables of rank, years experience, and degrees held. The model was used to compute an individual's predicted salary, and those earning less than predicted were identified as possible salary inequities. Several 2- and 3-way cross-tabulations were conducted to detect possible nonlinear effects. The increment for each rank was determined by calculating 10 percent of the mean salary for each rank and adjusting everyone's salary upward by that amount or until the salary  ceiling of the rank was reached. Salaries were then adjusted for the 200 full-time faculty identified as underpaid. Although no discernable overall pattern of sex or race related salary inequities was noted, the model did identify disproportionately more individuals of certain ranks and/or departments as &quot;inequities.&quot; Problems involved in such a study are (1) getting agreement as to what are appropriate variables to be considered in determining salary differentials, and (2) developing the mechanism for gathering data, quantifying it, and putting it into machine-compatible form (JT).",

Pre- and posttests of the subjects showed that after one year the subjects encouraged to watch. Sesame Street showed slightly accelerated achievement, but not at a significant level.

An attempt has been made to systematize criticism of multimedia presentations by using a variety of typologies to look at the style and structure of the presentation, its value to the audience, and the critic's personal reactions. By uniting the taxonomies of traditional schools of criticism with the philosophies of aesthetics and theories of mass media, a definition was synthesized for the role of multimedia critic, and formats for systematic criticisms were formulated. Future research should use this organizational framework to further examine how media format affects perception and learning. (EMH)",

        "description":"Cooperative library programs in Great Britain began with suggestions made in the 1915 Adams report commissioned by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust. Following the report's recommendations and with grants from the trust, countries began library services to rural areas and the Central Library for Students (CLS) was formed and later became a clearinghouse for interlibrary loans. Recommendations adopted from the 1927 Kenyon report led to formation of regional library systems and centers and to the evolution of CLS into the National Central Library (NCL) in 1931. The 1942 McColvin report focused on dissatisfactions with the system, while the 1952 Vollans report examined some of its problems. Resulting recommendations led to cooperative acquisitions and the establishment of special  subject collections. The Roberts report in 1959 led to the 1964 Public Libraries Act to provide supervision for public libraries and statutory provisions for regional councils. The innovative acquisitions policies of the director of the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLLST), the 1963 Parry report on university libraries, and especially the 1969 Dainton report on centralization led to the present reorganization of the system. The mainstay of the new system is the British Library and its four divisions: lending, which encompasses NCL and NLLST; reference, headed by the British Museum Library; bibliographic services; and central administration.

The proposal includes a centralized network which provides instructional, research, and administrative services to participating institutions. Since the network serves a variety of different needs, diversity has been provided for by encouraging individualized equipment selection and independent creation of computer programs. The program, called Kentucky Educational Computer Network (KECNET), is managed by the Kentucky Educational Computer Board, a representative committee which makes crucial policy decisions.  (EMH)",

The thesis was advanced that educational technology is a threat to the power base of education and the more comprehensive the technology, the greater the threat; therefore the laws and policies setting forth the governance of education would act to inhibit and/or prohibit applications of educational technology that are alternatives, rather than supplements, to classroom teachers. Four key areas of educational governance were studied: (1) certification; (2) accreditation; (3) state financial aid; and (4) professional negotiations. While the hypothesis was confirmed, the situation was found to be in a state of flux, with some traditional means of  enforcing certain barriers easing, or disappearing, and other means of enforcing those barriers taking over. Thus state financial aid is moving away from instructional units, toward \"equal yield\" formulas based soley on equal support of students. However, teacher associations are moving in to ensure continuance of what they regard as favorable pupil/teacher ratios. Another finding was the unsettled question of the extent to which school districts can contract away their responsibilities and authority. It was concluded that education is no longer a self-governing community, and now the courts have become key agents of change in education. (HAB)",

Basically, those provisions require recipients of federal grants to use those funds in a non-discriminatory manner such that the benefit of the programs funded by the grants is available without regard to race, national origin or sex. The thesis of the paper was that there are some questions whether Titles VI and IX can be applied to public broadcasting under the terms of the provisions themselves. And even if the Titles themselves permit their enforcement with respect to public broadcasting, serious First Amendment questions are raised both by their very application and by the procedures established for  their enforcement. Legal precedents are cited to conclude that the objectives sought to be achieved by Titles VI and IX are secured by other means and the application of those provisions to public broadcasting would constitute an unwarranted burden on the system.

This study focused on the programs on the ATS-6 satellite and evaluated the effectiveness of the programs in terms of the objectives stated for the project. In addition, recommendations were made: (1) on the impact on organizations; (2) to the educational community; and (3) to social services experiment and demonstration managers. The issue of local control for each village or region was explored along with international policy implications. It was found that  the educational objectives of both the federal and state agencies were continually in conflict with the practical objectives of establishing a basis for a communications network for Alaska. The results of the evaluation shed light not only on the strengths and weaknesses of using interactive telecommunications, but also on the relationship between sponsors and those responsible for demonstration/experimentation management.

Three successive systems (PLATO I, II, and III) displayed the potential of the computer to deliver high quality instruction, including programs emphasizing student autonomy and encouraging the development of inquiry and critical thinking skills. The aim of PLATO IV is to take advantage of technical advancements and economies of scale to produce computer-assisted instruction at $.35 per student contact hour, a much more economical figure than existing instructional costs. This report discusses the educational advantages of each of the PLATO systems, and it emphasizes the possible economic savings that will be  demonstrated in PLATO IV. (EMH)",

        "description":"An experiment was conducted to test the generalized response suppression hypothesis by comparing the amounts of retroactive inhibition for items whose retrieval cue was the same on both lists to the retroactive inhibition for items whose retrieval cues were different on the two lists. Subjects were 56 adults randomly assigned to experimental groups of 14. Groups were instructed to use either alphabetical or free recall, or alphabetic or clustering organization when learning successive lists of nouns. Alphabetic instructions produced faster learning than free recall instructions; alphabetic and clustering instructions did not differ. Groups that used the same organization on both lists recalled fewer items than groups that used different organizational strategies, which indicates  that organizational overlap was the source of interference. In each experiment, the first letters of half the items were repeated on both lists; the first letters of the remaining items were unique. Groups that alphabetized both lists recalled fewer words with duplicated than non-duplicated initial letters, a fact suggesting item-specific interference rather than generalized suppression of first-list responses.

A recently invented, compact, electrically activated pneumatic control valve facilitates the conversion of digital signals to pneumatic signals which in turn control the mecahnical positioning devices.

Civic and government leaders and interested citizens attended demonstrations related to a local environmental issue. Data collected from the experiment suggest that people are willing to work through such a program and would like to see more issues presented this way. Participants found the computer useful for presenting concise and relevant information, and they found particular advantage in being able to make comments and responses to questions. Suggestions were made for including more information on  costs, sources of information, political considerations, and views of the various interest groups. Criticisms primarily concerned the inconvenient location of computer terminals and the presence of some bias in the program. (CH)",

The study involved 32 kindergarten children randomly assigned to four treatment groups, each group receiving a version of a PLATO lesson. A 2x2 factorial analysis of variance was used to assess the effects of two independent variables on four dependent variables. Results of the study suggest that multimode knowledge of results may be superior to simple knowledge of results in maintaining a student's interest and attention during a lesson. Subjects in the multimode conditions  were less distracted than those in the simple knowledge of results conditions. Type of format had no effect on the dependent variables perhaps because the children satiated their interest in pictorial lesson materials during the warm up period. (CH)",

Over 1,000 remote computer graphic terminals each requiring a 1200 bps channel are to be connected to one centrally located computer. Digital data are distributed to these terminals using standard commercial cable television (CATV) equipment and a PLATO IV network interface unit. The data are transmitted in a synchronous time division multiplexed mode which is compatible with standard television signals. The receiver is contained in the PLATO IV site controller which also houses the circuits for multiplexing information from terminals onto a single voice grade phone line for transmission back to the computer center. The communications cost of this technique is  approximately one-tenth of the costs of using a single voice grade telephone line per terminal. (CH)",

However, before such systems can be economically applied to public education, the cost of high performance memory must be reduced. By using massive amounts of serial memory in conjunction with a highly sophisticated memory controller, a system was constructed which performs as well as random access memory, but at less cost. To demonstrate the control structure, and to determine the applicability of the memory system to PLATO computer-based educational system, a memory controller was installed and operated, a small memory system was introduced, and software was written to slave the memory controller system to the operation of the PLATO system.

Financing comes from the county general fund. There are no written goals or policy statements and no professionally trained librarians. As indicated by an opinion survey, citizens appreciate the existing library service and are aware of its limitations. The presence of these limitations is verified in a comparison of the county's library services with others of similar size and wealth and with commonly accepted library standards. Some possibilities for improvement are: the formation of an advisory board to aid the library and advise the county supervisors; a specific library  tax; a materials selection policy and some collection weeding; expanded services; and hiring of trained librarians. The recommended plan calls for contracting for bookmobile and administrative services from Santa Clara County, joining the South Bay Cooperative Library System, bringing the San Bautista library into the county system, hiring trained staff, and expanding the materials budget. Survey instruments, data tables, and other working papers for the study are appended. (LS)",

Wide use of instructional television makes advanced knowledge more usable and increases public awareness of new discoveries, reduces the time lag between conception and application of ideas which change society, and improves the image of higher education by becoming a resource to faculties. Improvements in instruction from video will have an impact on teaching standards, and the widescale use of video may be significant in countries where teachers are scarce. A model for instructional video supports the following recommendations for policy: (1) funding for course development should be drawn from the segments of society most likely to benefit  from the product; (2) five year funding is necessary at a level that would maximize creativity and productivity; (3) six regional course development centers should be established; (4) coordination should be developed among the production centers; (5) academic review of the courses should be encouraged; (6) institutions should award credit for students in video courses who pass national achievement tests; and (7) incentive should be created for institutions to participate in the offering of courses.

        "description":"The true state of the system described here is characterized by a probability vector. At each stage of the system an action must be chosen from a finite set of actions. Each possible action yields an expected reward, transforms the system to a new state in accordance with a Markov transition matrix, and yields an observable outcome. The problem of finding the total maximum discounted reward as a function of the probability state vector may be formulated as a linear program with an infinite number of constraints. The reward function may be expressed as a partial N-dimensional Maclaurin series. The coefficients in this series are also determined as an optimal solution to a linear program with an infinite number of constraints. A sequence of related finitely constrained linear  programs is solved which then generates a sequence of solutions that converge to a local minimum for the infinitely constrained program. This model is applicable to computer assisted instruction systems as well as to other situations. (Author/CH)",

Also, most of the respondents provided additional services besides the broadcasting of instructional programs, such as printed materials, technical consultation, utilization services, and technical maintenance. The licensees' relationships with the schools which they serve often reflected the types of stations which they are and their primary sources of funding. Fifty-six percent of  the licensees did not charge a &quot;per student&quot; rate or failed to report what those rates are.

The New Hampshire State Library is a member and serves as a consultant to the project. Its base of operation is the Manchester City Library. The original intent of the cooperative was to show by a demonstration project how a group of libraries of various types could share their resources within an urban framework. The project began in September 1970 funded by grants from the Bean Foundation of New Hampshire. The intent of this report is to detail the objectives of the project, the socio-economic background in which the project took root, the method of approach, the short-range outcomes, and some possible guidelines for other  cooperating groups interested in more effective programs of service.

Given data on interlibrary loan demands, the probability of request success, processing and delivery times for various libraries, and a network request routing policy, the model predicted the probability of satisfying a request, the average delay in receipt of the desired item, the cost, and processing loads. Comparing resource centers in the network revealed that Illinois State Library (ISU) and University of Illinois Libraries (UOI) are superior to Chicago Public Library (CPL) and Southern Illinois University (SIU) in terms of probability of request success and average processing times. When CPL and SIU were removed from the model, performance  was not significantly degraded. While available data were too limited to make a strong recommendation for removing CPL and SIU from the network, a careful data collection procedure should be pursued to study the network and perhaps at some time in the future to automate data collection.

Outputs are functional relations trees, functional block diagrams, a teaching sequence chart, and frames (a combination of words and visuals on a specific topic from the teaching sequence chart). The three step production flow consists of content requirements, content  development, and use. Material is divided into levels of detail, so that the student studies only until he has reached the level he needs.

The probability correct for each of the 700 problems was then predicted and the next 25 problems were selected for the student by matching predicted probability correct with the probability correct assigned to the student at the beginning of the study. The results showed a close match between the predicted and obtained probability correct when the experimental groups were evaluated. (Author/CH)",

The programs were written in Fortran IV for use on most CDC 6400/6600 and IBM 360 computer systems. Research designs to which the programs are applicable represent paradigms which test for aptitude-by-treatment interactions under four conditions: when one continuous aptitude has been measured that is linearly related to the criterion (program ATILIN1); when two continuous attitudes have been measured that are linearly related to the criterion (program ATILIN2); when one continuous aptitude has been measured that is curvilinearly related to the criterion (program ATICURV); and when one  aptitude has been measured that is linearly related to the criterion and group sizes are sufficiently large to permit a blocked analysis of variance on individuals with extreme scores in the aptitude distribution (program XGROUPS). Reference to technical and design issues is made in methodological notes which accompany each program. A short annotated bibliography appears at the end of the manual. (CH)",

Effectiveness was defined as: 1) acceptance of the quality of the presentation by a distinct group of viewers; and 2) their recognition of cognitive challenges presented by the show. A multimedia presentation based on excerpts from the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar was presented during a one-month period around the Easter celebration. The results showed that: 1) the particular congregations chosen did prove distinct in terms of orthodoxy; 2) the hypothesis that unorthodox worshippers would be more positively responsive to this multimedia presentation than would orthodox  worshippers was not statistically confirmed; and 3) orthodoxy group and test group scores on the Superstar evaluation factors indicate that the presentation was effective since it was qualitatively lauded by all groups and received best by the more unorthodox Protestants.

This document presents two possible reasons why disproportionate aid is awarded to community college students: (1) the common belief that community college education is free, and that students do not, therefore, need financial assistance; (2) the argument that money should be available through employment, a spouse's employment, or other resources, since more than half of community college students attend school on less than a full-time  basis. These reasons are refuted, and a method of revamping the student financial aid system in the community college is suggested, focusing on the hiring of a skilled financial aid administrator, and a trained financial aid staff. Finally, the author reasserts the need for student financial aid in the community college. (NHM)",

Part I contains articles on four states where faculty collective bargaining was in existence before 1971: Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Part II includes discussions of some more recent experiences in Hawaii, Massachusetts, Alaska, and Montana. Most of the papers cover three basic topics: the nature and scope of bargaining legislation, the organization of state government and the structure for collective bargaining in the state, and the nature of systemwide-campus authority relations under collective bargaining. The data bases on which the papers rest vary considerably and are related to the amount of experience a state has had with faculty  bargaining. A summary paper compares the experiences in the individual states, identifies major patterns in state-institutional and system-institutional authority relations as associated with faculty collective bargaining, and puts forward six propositions which summarize the factors that are associated with the degree of centralization that occurs under collective bargaining.

This document reports the progress which has been made on this evaluation. Information from participating institutions is being gathered by administering questionnaires to faculty and administrators, and by making site visits to selected schools. Information  from students is being gathered by administering a questionnaire which requests their reaction to the various course components, and the administration of the course. Design and delivery evolution of the course is described, and a preliminary analysis of the survey is presented here, which indicates the considerable diversity in local patterns of utilization of the curriculum.

Smith, president of Brookdale Community College, describes the origin and development of the original master plan for Brookdale, the implementation of that plan, and the current proposed project to review the past and plan for the future through 1990. Smith's position is that every community college must have an ongoing master planning effort, since &quot;a college without a plan may not have a future.&quot; Gordon C. Blank, president of Western Piedmont Community College, is more qualified in his praise of master plans. He notes that Western Piedmont's master plan was based on a number of faculty assumptions, being too specific in some respects, and too vague and global in others. In general, he  feels that the master plan recorded expectations that the institution could not deliver. Since the alternative to master planning is, however, a reliance on chance to shape the institution, Blank concludes that only the careful formulation of a master plan can produce an institution &quot;whose style is reactive to its milieu rather than dynamically proactive.&quot; (Author/NHM)",

        "description":"A survey of the literature indicates that the adult reading student requires instruction based on perceptual, skill-learning principles, rather than on the analytical framework used for the instruction of elementary school reading students. This document proposes a systematic method of organizing a community college reading center to meet the students' wide range of abilities, needs, and interests through the use of self-instructional programmed materials, utilizing audiovisual modes. This method was implemented at Lake Michigan College (LMC). Statistical data compare the success of this student-centered program with the teacher-oriented, analytical program previously in use at LMC's student reading center. The data indicate that the student-centered milieu produces far higher  gains in the reading skills of comprehension, vocabulary, speed, and percentage of total improvement than had the teacher-oriented method. In addition, this document proposes a system of self-instructional, reading center management materials to train reading center instructors. The application of these experimental materials indicates that they constitute a feasible system deserving exploration and testing. A bibliography, and detailed results of the implementation of the proposed systems are appended. (Author/NHM)",

A comparison of the group's performance before and after the T-group experience revealed significant changes over the two scales measuring: (1) an individual's ability to utilize time in the Present; (2) an individual's ability not to be overly directed by others.

Furthermore, the motivating stimulus for most exceptional community service activities has not been the concern of community college governing boards, administrators, or state politicians, but instead has been the availability of federal or foundation funding sources. Excluding programs funded from external sources, community colleges have not generally been accountable to the broad heterogenous community that they are designed to serve. Although community colleges offer some of the services of an area university, and some of the services of an area vocational school, many have been unable to identify and clarify the community college's one truly unique mission--community services. To be accountable,  community colleges must conduct frequent community needs assessments, and take appropriate follow-up action. At present, community colleges have very little community services accountability, and unless we can interrupt the traditional credit-hour fixation, influence funding patterns, and design new yardsticks for measuring community college productivity, there is little hope for improvement.

        "description":"Community and junior colleges can play an important role in helping women exercise their options in life without discrimination, as equal partners with men in fulfilling national economic and social needs. The responsibility of junior and community colleges goes beyond providing career education for women. They must also create an awareness among young women of their future role in society, and provide encouragement and insight for those oolder women who are seeking to enter or reenter the work force. Unfortunately, even in community colleges which are primarily committed to career preparation, women continue to be poorly motivated and limited in their career asPirations. The core of the problem is sex stereotyping--in textbooks, in counseling, and in the attitudes of society  toward the social, political, and economic roles of women. The rights of women to equal educational opportunity have been well established by law. Community colleges must see that these laws are enforced by examining their curricula, their staffing patterns, and the kinds of guidance they offer to students. The community college must seek innovative approaches to the problem of preparing a knowledgeable, trained women's work force to meet the challenge of a growing economy and an ever increasing demand for skilled workers.

Interview results indicated that parents know that the college is accredited, that its facilities are available for community use, and that financial aid is available. Parents are aware of the comprehensive nature of the college program, of the college's low tuition policy, and of the attention paid to students through counseling and course design. Parents have least knowledge about the college faculty.  Administrators at the college were asked to review each of the interview items, and predict parental response. For the most part, the administrators displayed an accurate perception of what parents know about the college.

The first 7,000 calls will be made to persons who are already familiar with LACC. The second group of calls will be made to persons living in the Northeast Los Angeles area who have not had contact with LACC. A cost analysis indicates that additional telephone bills and recruiter salaries will total approximately $9,057 for the six month program. If the recruiters increase enrollment 10 percent over fall 1973 (1,918 new students), and if each student  takes at least one three-unit course, LACC could receive between $20,000 and $670,000, depending on the persistence of the students.

        "description":"A review of the literature indicates the recent popularity of student evaluation of faculty in (1) providing feedback to faculty so that they can modify or improve their instruction; (2) acquiring information to be used in evaluating faculty, and in making tenure and promotion decisions; (3) acquiring information to be disseminated to students so that they can make course and curriculum choices. In spite of the high number of evaluation instruments produced in recent years, few have specifically been geared to the theoretical model of instruction being applied in the course to be evaluated. In order to alleviate this problem, a new student evaluation instrument--The Student Assessment of Systematic Instruction (SASI)is being developed at College of the Mainland. The proposed  instrument divides the evaluation into six categories: the organization and structure of learning, the quality of learning materials, students' perception of the value of course content, students' perception of their own personal growth, quality of teaching, and quality of student-teacher interaction. Students are asked to rate the section in which they are enrolled in relation to other sections in the same course, department, division, and college; and to explain what reasons they have for their rating. Results will be reported by computer, and a sample computer printout is appended. (Author/NHM)",

This process diagnoses the quality of instruction as judged by instructional peers at other institutions. Content raters are sent course syllabi, course documents, selected examinations, and descriptions of the course target group and COM student body, and are asked to fill out a checklist including questions relating to the course rationale, learning objectives, learning activities, testing techniques, and course organization. To date, 27 courses have been sent to 135 raters throughout the United States. The 116 rating checklists which were returned represent an 86 percent response rate. The raters  felt that the courses at COM have well-developed behavioral objectives, and that the course objectives are relevant, challinging, and appropriate for the target group. Overall, content standards are high, and these high standards are reinforced with rigorous testing procedures. However, only 15 percent of the raters encountered courses which are open-entry/exit in format, and only 11 percent encountered self-paced courses, implying alternate learning activities. Tabulated responses to 24 of the 27 checklist questions are included in this document. (Author/NHM)",

Although community college instructors seem more likely than their four-year institution counterparts to experiment with course content and format, there is an evident need for teaching reform in the profession as a whole. In order to encourage experimentation in the teaching of economic principles, the Joint Council on Economic Education, in conjunction with the Committee on Economic Education of the American Economic Association, began pilot programs to provide instructors at eight institutions with experimental resource materials. Only six of these schools completed course development, involving the development of a course outline, course syllabus,  evaluation procedures, and methods of student testing.

Predetermined criteria were applied to the responses of the 29 colleges, and six colleges were selected for further study. Personal interviews with 21 administrators representing these six schools established that (1) the most successful linkages are by person-to-person contacts with community people; (2) community services administrators need to be in the community interacting frequently to create and continue linkages; (3) ad hoc committees are more successful linkages than ongoing advisory  committees; (4) meaningful input comes from teacher applicants, present teachers, students, and administrators; (5) informal contacts provide more valuable linkages than formal organizational contacts; (6) demographic and socio-economic factors greatly affect community services linkages; (7) community services administrators must be creative, innovative, receptive, responsive, and must have a pioneering attitude in searching for and serving linkages.

The course involves at least two different instructional divisions, corresponds to the personal characteristics of the student body, and includes members of both the counseling staff and teaching faculty as co-facilitators. To identify the characteristics of the student body, the Omnibus Personality Index was administered to a representative sample (four percent) of 514 students. Then, a local panel of faculty, counselors, students, and administrators was organized and surveyed to ascertain the desirability of various human development course components, objectives, and implementation strategies which have been utilized  at other community colleges. These two surveys facilitated the development of a model co-disciplinary human development course entitled \"Living and Working in Sacramento.\" This model course was evaluated by surveying a national panel of seven experts identified through a review of the literature, and on the basis of their evaluation a second model course was developed, entitled \"You and Your Life in Sacramento.\" A complete course description, including suggested activities for seven modules, is presented here, and the survey instruments are appended.

The current data indicate that SUNY maintains a favorable position with regard to comparable national figures. The most striking characteristic of the current data, as compared with data from previous reports, is that summary data for SUNY have remained virtually unchanged. This constancy is in spite of some substantial changes in the data for individual institutions, especially some of the community colleges. (NHM)",

Davenport concentrates on the impact of vocational education on urban minorities and the disadvantaged. After identifying potential problems which must be encountered if vocational education programs are to be reformed (the need for specially trained, sensitive instructors; the blue collar stigma of vocational education; the reluctance of employers and trade unions to accept trained minorities), Davenport emphasizes the need for special educational theories to handle special educational problems. Reginald Petty discusses some of the major areas of debate taking place in Congress, and within the education and manpower communities, regarding manpower training  needs in general, and vocational education in particular. Petty provides a brief history of vocational education, gives statistics describing the present state of the art, and identifies problem areas which will dictate the shape of the field in the future. Roy G. Phillips describes a career education model for Seattle Central Community College for the period of the 1980's and beyond. The model accounts for the diverse educational needs of the multi-ethnic population that the College is designed to serve. (Author/NHM)",

This constraint makes impracticable certain of the above calendar systems, specifically trimesters. Additional constraints on calendar design include articulation with K-12 public and private school calendars, and with senior institutions to which community college students transfer. The various calendars are discussed with regard to their effectiveness in promoting student progress, faculty success, staff performance, and cost effective management. In  addition, surveys of various community college populations concerning their academic calendar preferences are reported. Two-thirds of the students rate their educational program under the present traditional semester calendar as satisfactory. Similarly, faculty and staff prefer the traditional semester calendar. Administrators, on the other hand, favor the early semester calendar, and specifically reject the quarter system as administratively impractical. On the basis of this information, retention of the present system in the San Diego Community College District is recommended. Survey results are appended. (Author/NHM)",

These councils are charged with reviewing existing programs and with making recommendations to encourage the development of needed offerings and/or the alteration of duplicated offerings. In order to determine which councils were most effective in carrying out their mandated functions, council meeting minutes were studied, a questionnaire was mailed to all 190 members of the 20 active coordinating councils in 1974-75 (the 144 responses represent a 76 percent response rate), and personal interviews were  conducted with the chairmen of community college boards of trustees and school boards. Specifically investigated were: (1) the nature of council goals; (2) the operating procedures; and (3) the behavior and qualifications of council members. In spite of a general agreement as to the potential impact of the councils, most of the existing councils were considered ineffective in carrying out their mandated functions. In order to improve council effectiveness, a list of guidelines is compiled in this document for adopting and implementing effective council procedures and practices. (NHM)",

MICS, the fourth college in the District, is dedicated to community services and modeled not on existing structures, but on societal needs. It operates on a community base with a performance-oriented instructional delivery system of credit and noncredit learning experiences. Regarding human renewal as its primary purpose, MICS helps community learners define their competencies and obtain performance skills. During its first year of operation, MICS has served over 16,000 &quot;new&quot; students. It has operated as a consortium effort of the three other Metropolitan Community  Colleges with a policy board composed of the three presidents and the chancellor. For convenience and because of the natural grouping of program effort, the Institute has been organized around three structures or centers: the Center for Urban Studies, the Center for Career Development, and the Center for Community Education. The various MICS programs for 1975-76 are described and directions and goals for the future are suggested. (Author/NHM)",

The Metropolitan Institute of Community Services (a college without walls) expanded from serving fewer than 2,000 students in 1973-74 to more than 16,000 in 1974-75. From MCC's beginnings in 1915 as the Polytechnic Institute to today's multi-college system, MCC has served more than 200,000 persons in the Kansas City community. This document reports the District's progress in meeting 28 two-year priorities set by the Chancellor's Cabinet in 1974. Special attention is paid to progress in developing a ten-year Master Plan for the District; progress in developing a staff development program; in recoding District  policies, regulations, and procedures; in conducting an educational needs assessment; and in expanding access to the District's programs. The document ends with a projection of future District needs and plans, and an appeal for a united drive to pass a $59.5 million bond issue in fall 1976. (Author/NHM)",

        "description":"Nontraditional education is based on three basic tenets: (1) a student should have responsibility for, and control over, his own education; (2) a student's education should be directed toward the acquisition of competencies rather than the accumulation of credits; and (3) traditional limits of time and space should not constrict student development. It can be carried out on a formal campus, or on no campus at all. It can provide college credit, or no credit at all. Although it stresses student determination of his own goals, it provides for competent teacher supervision. It allows for flexible grouping and scheduling, independent study, continuous progress curricula, hands-on experience, and community internships. There are at least two methods by which the leader of a state or  regional community college system can stimulate the capacity for change and the capabilities for introducing nontraditional approaches to instruction. The first method entails the establishment of system-wide goals and objectives that will require some reorganization within the college, the classroom, and the curriculum. The second method involves establishing a nontraditional unit within the system. Such a unit is a Metropolitan Community Colleges' proposed fourth college, a college without walls which will encompass all existing community services programs and activities currently offered by the existing three District colleges.

        "description":"In order to obtain a profile of Central YMCA Community College (CYCC) entering students, CYCC participated in the 1975 American Council on Education and UCLA survey of incoming freshman students. At CYCC, the survey was administered in class to 322 students (187 first-time, full-time freshmen, 133 transfers-in, and 12 part-time freshmen). The entire CYCC entering population was 1,154. The national sample consisted of 300,000 students in 562 postsecondary institutions. This document compares the CYCC student body to the national sample. Although the national sample was almost evenly divided between males and females, the CYCC sample contained two and a half times as many females as males. The national sample was nine percent black, while CYCC's sample was about 80 percent black.  The percentage of Puerto Ricans, Orientals, and Mexican-Americans was also higher at CYCC than nationally. The CYCC student body exceeded the national norm in the percentage of students who had never completed high school, or who were significantly delayed between high school and college. CYCC students were significantly older than the national norm, and were ten times as likely to be married. CYCC students also tended to be poorer, and had parents with less education and lower income levels than did students in the national sample. (Author/NHM)",

        "description":"In order to determine whether or not systematic desensitization or hypnosis have any effect in alleviating the test anxiety of community college students, 30 Massasoit Community College student volunteers were matched for GPA and assigned to one of three treatment groups: (1) a systematic desensitization group, in which subjects listened to tape recorded training sessions in relaxation, and were asked to imagine the anxiety provoking scenes described on tape; (2) a hypnosis group, in which subjects listened to hypnotic inductions, and were asked to imagine the same anxiety provoking scenes; or (3) a control group. At the outset, each subject had a two-semester GPA of 3.0 or below and each had scored in the upper quartile on the Mandler-Sarason Test Anxiety Scale. Pre- and  post-treatment examinations of GPA, scores on the Mandler-Sarason Scale, and two other self-report measures of anxiety, showed no significant effects of the treatment. It is concluded that these behavioral change techniques, found successful with other populations, must be critically examined for their suitability for two-year college students. Also included are a review of the evolution of community colleges in the United States, a discussion of the unique characteristics of community college students, and a survey of recent approaches to behavior change.

Data were collected from the following activities: (1) observations and anecdotal records of socialization and group endeavor, the effect of ego involvement and social behavior, group sensitivity, competition and cooperation, and group locomotion toward established goals; (2) measurement of tasks completed in relation to goals and objectives set up at the beginning of the course; (3) student evaluation of the course; and (4) a review of final course grades as compared with  performance on tests and participation in discussions. The evaluation data indicate a 100 percent concensus among participants that the student-centered class was more interesting than other classes they had taken. Ninety percent favored the group dynamic methodology, and 93 percent said they had learned more in the course than they would have in a traditional course. Final grades reflected this higher achievement. In addition, these classes had a slightly lower rate of attrition than Health 10 classes held the year before which employed a traditional lecture method. (Author/NHM)",

The study was conducted to determine whether past findings which indicate a relationship between low sex role identification and creativity were a function of the scales used in the experiment or of a developmental stage. Subjects were given masculinity or femininity scores determined through teacher and peer ratings of gender identity. A measure of non-verbal creativity was made one year later using the Torrance Figural Form A. The four dimensions measured included fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration. Within each age and sex group, subjects were divided into \"high\" and \"low\" sex role identity groups. Data were subjected to an  analysis of variance and analysis of covariance, results indicated no significant main effects. Overall, sex-role groups did not differ in creative functioning, sex groups showed no difference, and age groups were not differentiated. However, boys with high masculinity scores had lower originality and fluency scores; girls with high femininity scores were characterized by higher originality and fluency scores. The results of the teacher gender ratings, showed a similar significant interaction effect for elaboration. Implications of the findings are discussed. (SB)",

        "description":"This study investigated the pretend play behavior of 16 boys and girls aged 12 and 18 months. Each child was presented a standard set of stimulus materials during two home visits. For each of three 10-minute episodes, the child's pretend activities were recorded by means of a coded observation schedule. During episode 1 the child played alone, during episode 2 the child played alone or with the mother (with order reversed across visits), and during episode 3 the child played alone. Analysis of the data suggested that pretending with age, and that mothers enhanced the play of older girls. A developmental progression from self-directed to other-directed activities was also indicated. Analysis of sex differences showed that differences in pretending may appear as early as 12 months  of age and that girls are involved more than boys in other-directed nurturing activities and in the use of representations of animate objects. The effect of the mothers on pretend behaviors was examined and it is suggested that although sex differences in overall level of pretending may stem from direct adult interventions, the selective maternal enhancement of sex stereotyped patterns was not found. The results suggest that in a semi-naturalistic situation, mothers differentially influence the tendency of a child to engage in pretend play behaviors, not the content of the pretend behavior.

These questions were based on the assumption that language acquisition is based on a cognitive non-linguistic foundation of concepts, categories and meanings. Films were made depicting first standard, then reversal, events. The standard events consisted of repeated trials of actor A (a male actor) pushing actor B (either another male actor or a chair), with position and direction alternating. In the role reversal events, actor B  pushed actor A, again with position and direction varying. Visual fixation and heart rate were measured while infants viewed the films. Data from 26 of the subjects were used, since data from the other subjects were unusable due to fretting, excessive moving or equipment failure. Results indicated that action role reversals are perceived by infants regardless of changes in the direction of action; there was little evidence that infants consider the category of agent to include only animate objects. The implication of the findings in relation to language learning is discussed. (SB)",

Mothers' accuracy in describing their own behavior was also examined. Forty-three mothers and their 18-30-month-old children were brought in pairs into a playroom which contained an object (a microphone) which mothers had been asked to keep their children from touching. The behaviors of mother and child were recorded. After 5 minutes in the room, the mother left and the child remained alone for 3 minutes, while his behavior was observed. Following the playroom experience, mothers were administered a questionnaire and their children were tested using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and the Embedded Figures Test.  Latency of each child's responses was timed to obtain a measure of impulsivity or reflectivity. Preliminary results showed that mothers used a variety of techniques to control their children, although \"forbidding\" was the most common techniques used. Parental report was found to be a poor indicator of the actual type of controlling behavior used. The forbidden object was touched by nine of the 29 children who were willing to remain in the room alone when the mother left. (Author/BRT)",

It is suggested that the basic concept of the invisible pedagogy in infant schools is play, which socializes the child while he explores and allows the teacher to evaluate his development. Theories  of learning which are consistent with the invisible pedagogy are described in general terms. The differences between visible and invisible pedagogies are described as reflecting an ideological conflict between the old and new middle classes, and the social significance of the invisible pedagogy is said to differ according to the social class of the child. Problems arising in the transition of children from homes to preschools with invisible pedagogy, and from these preschools to secondary schools and universities with visible pedagogy, are discussed.

A wide range of studies are cited which are interpreted as evidence that most children are not ready for academic schoolwork until they are 7 or 8 years old. Then the bioplasmic model is explicated. According to this model, bioplasmic forces are in continuous motion maintaining all the elements in the body to keep the organism growing and healthy. The same forces are transmuted into the power to control thinking, and each person has only a certain amount of these energy forces available. The argument against early schooling based on this model contends that inappropriate curriculum,  activities, and assignments cause children's energy forces to be displaced and atrophied prematurely, thus causing damage to the children's development.

It was observed that Chinese infants dispalyed no anxiety when approached by strangers. Toddlers evidenced none of the rebelliousness associated with American children of the same age, even when expected to share toys or sit in chairs for long periods of time. Caretakers gave these children consistent, affectionate physical stimulation. In the primary schools (for children aged 7-12), large group lessons and recitation as well as out of class tutoring for slow learners appeared to be planned so as to preclude failure by any child. School children were found to be friendly, bright, and spontaneous, but  conforming. Their conformity is attributed to careful management of aggression in the schools and society. It is concluded that (1) some developmental landmarks which Americans accept as universal are actually culture bound, and (2) the control of competition, aggression and violence within a society does not necessarily eliminate such qualities as liveliness, initiative and self reliance, but it does appear to require the sacrificing of individuality.

Subjects were 120 undergraduate and graduate students who were either teachers or teacher trainees. A fictitious school transcript and student essay were randomly assigned to each subject to use in rating the fictitious student on two dimensions: (1) personality, and (2) performance on the essay, including a comparison of performance with academic ability. Color photographs of boys and girls who had been judged as either highly attractive or unattractive were attached to 80 of the transcripts; the remaining 40 transcripts served as a control for physical attractiveness. Data were subjected to four  3-way analyses of variance. Results replicated the findings of an earlier study in that positive expectations existed for attractive females but not for attractive males; attractive females received fewer negative personality ratings than unattractive females, whereas the converse of this was true for males. An unexpected finding was an apparent general lowering of raters' judgments when photographs (of either attractive or unattractive students) were attached to the transcripts. (Author/CW)",

The negative social consequences of inadequate programing, particularly for lower class and minority children, are noted. Single model programing is discussed and found inadequate when constructing a model for all of early childhood education. A brief review of three competing models (Montessori, DISTAR, and Cognitive Stimulation) is given. The multi-model method is described in terms of three major classes of variables (child variables, curriculum variables, teacher variables) that must be considered when selecting a curriculum.  It is proposed that each school select several curricula to be implemented simultaneously and that children entering school be studied and matched to a curriculum on the basis of an empirical knowledge of favorable child-curriculum interactions. Teachers are to be studied and matched to curricula on the basis of analogous empiral knowledge. The role of the researcher in assessment and design is discussed. (SB)",

The Clifton form of the Anderson observational system was used to measure teacher contacts with individual children in their classes. Teachers were then asked to assess each child's likelihood of school success, family interest and socioeconomic status. Chi-square tests of goodness of fit showed that the teachers differentiated among children in their contacts.

Only booklets with four or more paragraphs on infant feeding were used. Successful and unsuccessful breast feeding and supportive and unsupportive information are defined and the past trend away from breast feeding and its effect on nursing mothers is reviewed. Results indicate that the majority of breast feeding information given to expectant mothers is unsupportive (55% unsupportive, 30% supportive, 15% ambivalent). This finding may be connected to the fact that many physicians rely on drug and formula companies to supply them with literature. Booklets of publishers  with vested interests were compared to those of publishers with no vested interests. Findings showed that fewer supportive booklets and more unsupportive material came from publishers with vested interests. It is concluded that while supportive material is available and though progress has been made in informing women about breast feeding, pregnant women will need to seek physicians who are supportive of successful breast feeding.

It is suggested that interest in parent-teacher involvement has grown as a result of several other developments: a growing national interest in child development and preschool education; a change in attitude toward the value of preschool experience; an increase in the time available to parents for outside activities because of modern time-saving devices in the home; and the women's liberation movement. Interest in working with parents is based on their being the child's first and most important teachers and on the improvement in both parenting and teaching possible through an exchange of information. The necessity of agreement by parents and teachers on developmental  factors is stressed. Such factors include the importance of the child's self image, the effect of environment on intelligence, the importance of the environment to learning, and the necessity of matching a learning task to the child's developmental level. The second half of the paper lists specific strategies for parents and teachers working together. A section on home-based interaction includes suggestions to teachers about observation and communication. For school-based programs, ten basic principles are listed that deal with establishing a successful parent volunteer program. (SB)",

The development and implementation of a program for 10 mothers and their toddlers is described in detail. Phenomena found to be unique to a group of mothers and toddlers were: the issues of separation, style of participation, and the nature and development of the leader. These and other aspects of mother-toddler groups are discussed. Modern urban society offers little  opportunity to experience the support system that can exist in intergenerational family relations.

        "description":"Investigators in this study looked for conditions that can rapidly establish continuous stimulus control of continuous response variations, or &quot;response mapping.&quot; Unlike previous research in stimulus control, where a single stimulus comes to control a single response, 36 5-year-old children received errorless discrimination training at three points along a circle-to-ellipse continuum following one of two different pretraining conditions which showed no difference in later acquisition. They were then tested on two stimuli intermediate between two of the training stimuli. Subjects were divided into two test groups and tested under conditions in which (1) the correct response bore a spatial relationship to the ordering along the continuum, or (2) the spatial location of the correct  response key bore a constant but unordered relation to the stimuli. Subjects learning the ordered test acquired the new test responses faster than those in the unordered condition. Discussion of the results considered the effect of discrimination training, the errorless procedure, and response-produced feedback. (Author/SB)",

Randall, Greta Fein, Richard Bauman and Murray Newman, looks at informal learning from an anthropological viewpoint with an emphasis on inversive theory. It is suggested that the irrational elements of informal learning, the combinations of order and disorder, allow children to relate to reality by creating a reality of their own. Informal learning then becomes a way to use the familiar to explore the unfamiliar, helping the child anticipate behaviors in a preadaptive rather than a directly socializing way. It is proposed that informal learning will be most effective when its inversive elements are explored, that through the alternation of familiar and unfamiliar the child's imagination will be the center of focus in a learning  situation.

        "description":"Sex role stereotyping by parents of male and female children was assessed by asking parents in 88 middle-class families to rate the importance of five broadly defined categories of attitudes they believed a 2-year-old should learn. All parents had at least one child 5 years old or younger. It was assumed that if sex role stereotyping was present, parents of males would highly rate the categories related to social behavior and exploration (defined in terms of independence and orientation to the world of work). It was assumed that parents of females would highly rate the categories related to family cooperation, appreciation for others, and the self (defined in terms of perseverance, imagination and passivity). Comparisons were made among the mean ratings given by parents who had  only a male child, only a female child, multiple male children, multiple female children, and multiple children of both sexes. Findings indicated some stereotyping in families with more than one child of the same sex but no stereotyping in the other families studied. (CW)",

Descriptions of the family laboratory's communication procedures, group composition, evening social activities, field trips and schedule adjustments are given. Evaluation of the project was based on scheduled parent conferences, student teacher conferences and informal interviews and conversations with parents, teaching assistants, student teachers, fellow teachers and interested colleagues. Mid-year and  end-of-the-year questionnaires were sent to participating families in order to determine their reaction to the total program and their involvement in it. While child attendance was high, parent participation did not meet desired levels. The results of the program are discussed with attention to possible effects the program may have had on its participants and suggestions are given for future projects. (Author/SB)",

Children responded to three attitude inventories concerning social and occupational roles of adults and activities appropriate for boys and girls. Data were analyzed by a 3-way analysis of variance, with sex, home environment and grade as factors. Findings indicated that boys and girls from traditional homes were significantly more inclined than those from non-traditional homes to assign children's activities on the basis of sex. Regardless of home environment, girls held  more non-sexist attitudes than boys toward adult social roles. Boys from traditional homes possessed narrow views of adult role options as early as kindergarten; girls from traditional homes revealed more stereotypes in first and second grades than in kindergarten. An additional analysis was performed on a subscale of household task items from the social adult scale which were assumed to be familiar to all children. A significant difference was found between scores of children from traditional and non-traditional homes, suggesting that the influence of non-traditional role models at home could counter stereotyping influences outside the home.

Four of the studies assessed: (1) the educational and occupational attributes of parents, (2) the availability and usage patterns of television and radio by children and parents, (3) the ability of parents to follow printed instructions of specified readings levels (second, fourth, and eighth grades) and different presentation styles, and (4) the competencies which parents expected their children to possess by six years of age. These studies were conducted in 1974 through home visits by paraprofessionals to a single sample of 699 families living in selected areas of seven states. The fifth study  was a re-analysis of U.S. Census data pertaining to the parent population. Among the findings were indications that about one-fourth of the parents were unable to use materials prepared at a second grade reading level, that more than 91 percent of the mothers had at least an eighth grade education, that more than 96 percent of the families in non-urban Applalchia had television sets, but that less than 78 percent of the families had telephone service. Data are presented in tabular and narrative form; a typical Appalachian family of 1970 is described. Implications of the studies for the planning of home-hased programs are suggested. (CW)",

In both settings, preseparation, separation, and reunion situations were observed. Observers coded proximity-increasing and proximity-decreasing behaviors to mother and to other adults; in addition, distress, exploratory behaviors, and peer-directed behaviors were recorded. Behavior in day care centers shows clear evidence of attachment to mother: attachment behaviors were directed preferentially to mother, and rates of attachment behaviors increased from preseparation to reunion episodes. In the laboratory, age-related differences in behavior were consistent with those previously found in home-reared children. The results indicate a lack of  intraindividual consistency between the two settings. (Author/SB)",

Discussions focus on child maltreatment from various perspectives, including characteristics of the parents and children, effects of abuse and neglect, a phychiatrist's view of the problem, and a discussion of state reporting laws. The first chapter defines child maltreatment and lists characteristics that may identify an abused or neglected child. A short discussion of the lasting emotional, physical and psychological scars from mistreatment emphasizes the possible long term effects such as mental retardation, loss of hearing or sight, lack of motor control, and speech defects. In Chapter 2, a psychiatrist looks at the \"natural history\" of child abuse pointing out that  most abusive or neglectful parents were themselves victims of maltreatment. The abusive parent is often immature, dependent, lacking in self confidence, socially isolated and unable to deal with family crises. In Chapter 3, the punishment vs. treatment dichotomy in the laws written to deal with abuse is discussed. Some state laws label child abuse as a crime and others treat child abuse as a family problem requiring therapeutic treatment. Aspects of case reporting are also reviewed. (SB)",

The data analyzed for this report came from the Educational Testing Service Head Start Longitudinal Study, and in keeping with the aims inherent in the longitudinal study, particular focus was on the relationship of these findings to the child's attendance or non-attendance in Head Start and the extent of differential prediction for Head Start children of varying characteristics. A total of 467 children  comprised the sample with four subsamples identified: (1) northern urban black Head Start, (2) sourthen rural black Head Start, (3) urban black with no preschool, and (4) rural middle-socioeconomic status white with non-Head Start preschool. The results are presented in detail and implications for preschool and elementary programs and future research are discussed. (JMB)",

        "description":"After a detailed study of the scholastic retardation of Latin American children in Texas public schools due to the language barrier, the National Office of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) decided that this problem was of the utmost importance and a matter which the organization should work to correct. After obtaining the necessary authorization, pilot projects of the &quot;Little School of the 400&quot; were opened in various places, at LULAC's expense. Named after a list of 400 basic, indispensable English words for beginning non-English speaking children, the program enrolled 60 children in 2 schools in 1957. Nine more &quot;Little Schools&quot; were opened in 1958. In 1959, the Texas Legislature adopted a House Bill authorizing the program's establishment under the official  title of &quot;Preschool Instructional Classes for Non-English Speaking Children&quot; with the understanding that these classes would not be exclusively for the Latin American child, but for the overall benefit of all non-English speaking children in Texas. More than 15,000 non-English speaking children were enrolled in 1960, and this attendance progressively increased through the summer of 1962 to over 18,000 children. Based on the program's efforts, recommendations concerning such items as a state mobile teacher unit law, job training school for elementary students, and Federal grants-in-aid were submitted to local, State, and national education agencies.

        "description":"Data derived from the Southern Youth Study (a randomly stratified sample of 250 black and 409 white males from Southern rural counties with lower than average annual incomes) were utilized to analyze veteran status as a determinant of occupational and educational attainment via the interaction effects between race, veteran status, and residential background. The respondents were young adults who had been interviewed as sophomores in 1966, as seniors in 1968, and again as adults in 1972. The control variables employed were: age (mean age of 21 years); lack of physical handicaps; father's educational level; occupational status of family breadwinner; number of siblings; and education completed. Contrary to expectations generated by Fisher, et.al.'s 1975 findings, no interaction  emerged between veteran status and residential background for either occupational or educational attainment, but some interaction effects were found between veteran status and race on educational attainment, which necessitated separate regression analysis for both blacks and whites. With the exception of the relationship between military service and educational attainment for whites, the bridging environment hypothesis was not supported nor was the more general societal assumption that military service enhances one's career, for exactly the opposite effect was observed.

The variables measured were parental socioeconomic status, number of siblings, significant other influence, work value, level of occupational aspirations, level of educational aspiration, and educational attainment. Findings indicated: the application of a status attainment model to a nonmetropolitan Southern data set yielded results similar to those reported in the original models developed by  Blau-Duncan and Sewell in that the formation of adolescent attitudes were important mediating influences immediately antecedent to adult status attainment; 88% of the effects of socioeconomic status on educational attainment were found to be mediated by the five intervening influences (level of occupational and educational aspiration appeared to be the most important); the formation of attitudes was found to be associated with the antecedent influences of social origins and significant other encouragement; sibling number also played a role in development attitudes.

Developed to integrate demographic and status attainment perspectives, the model depicted a network of relationships in which the exogenous factor, social origins, influenced young adult timing of marriage and fertility through a complex of intervening variables. The model was evaluated within a path analytic framework. Respondents were initially contacted in their high school sophomore year (1966-67) when family background and  significant other encouragement data were obtained. Recontacted as seniors in 1968, respondents were questioned regarding status aspirations. In 1972, approximately four years after graduation, respondents were contacted for a third time and levels of attainment and procreation were recorded. The model \"explained\" 28% of the variation in early fertility indicating the importance of marital-timing, adolescent marital plans, and educational desires as important antecedents of early fertility. Fertility desires during adolescence were not found to be related to either time of marriage or actual early fertility. (Author/NQ)",

Contrasts between Spanish folk and Anglo urban cultural values are outlined. Textbooks, audiovisual materials (motion pictures and filmstrips), and library books are suggested to supplement and reinforce instruction. Appendices consist of biographical sketches of Mexican Americans who have achieved and listings of Chicano Congressional Medal of Honor winners, Mexican American newspapers and periodicals, Spanish language radio and television stations in the Southwest, and historical monuments and landmarks in California.

        "description":"In reference to the American Indian's problem of maintaining his values while trying to participate in the economy of the larger society, the role of the change agent was explored via review of some 15 development models derived from the economic, political, sociological, and applied sciences. Included in the review were models which approached change as a phenomenon of: the advancement and diffusion of technology; social/cultural orientation; the transformations which constitute \"modernization\", social change in a force field; issue oriented power clusters; social action processes; linked input factors; multi-interrelated input factors; economic growth; conflict control; institutions; politics; education; an infrastructural orientation; and comprehensive development. It was  concluded that all approaches were important, since socioeconomic development requires technological application, human engineering, power structure manipulation, and social action and is dependent on economic growth, conflict control, efficient institutions, modernized leaders, infrastructural development, and capital development. It was suggested that the successful change agent should be a generalist capable of stimulating an area's many agencies and individuals to make the necessary adjustments for development. (JC)",

In response, the Government of Newfoundland made a $5.00 per pupil grant to school districts for the purchase of instructional materials during the 1970-71 school year and has raised it to $8.00 for 1975-76. However, most school districts in the province are unable to make maximum use of this grant since they lack either the trained personnel to purchase and organize the materials or the proper physical facilities to house and distribute the materials. The problem is especially acute in those districts and schools located away from the major urban centers. This report discusses various alternatives for providing  adequate instructional materials to schools in rural Newfoundland. These are: individual school libraries, a school-housed public library, bookmobiles, use of volunteer help, and regional centralized libraries. (NQ)",

        "description":"The national reclamation program was to encourage people to settle on the land, to enable them to own the land they farmed, and to spread the benefit of subsidized irrigation water to as many independent farm families as possible. The San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project, the largest pumped water diversion and water storage project, was built largely to deliver water to the Westlands Water District, the largest single contractor for federally provided and subsidized water anywhere. This federally provided water has made the Westlands area one of the most richly productive agricultural areas in the country. In 1973, the gross value of farm produce in the Westlands District was $167 million, and the distribution system so far is delivering water only to part of the District.  Yet, total Federal cost of the San Luis Unit, plus the cost of the huge water distribution and drainage system being built by the Federal government in the District itself, will amount to over one-half billion dollars. These joint hearings reexamined the Westlands Water District and the Federal expenditures that have been made there and reviewed how well, how effectively, and how fully the mandates of Congress were carried out. Among the witnesses were representatives of the National Farmers Union, National Land for People, United Farm Workers (AFL-CIO), the U.S. Department of the Interior, and Westlands Water District.

        "description":"The Federal Water Pollution Control Act provides that each and every point source of pollution be under treatment with the best available technology by July 1983. The Act mandates that: every point source of pollution be issued a national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit and comply with effluent guidelines, and the 1983 best available guidelines be economically achievable. Issuance of a NPDES permit is conditional upon compliance with the effluent limitations. Part of the statutory definition for &quot;point source&quot; of pollution contains the phrase &quot;concentrated animal feeding operation&quot;. On February 14, 1974, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated final regulations, exempting certain classes of point sources (animal feeding operations below 1,000  beef cattle unit equivalents) from compliance with the Act's permit and effluent guidelines. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed suit in Federal district court in Washington alleging that the EPA did not have discretion, under the act, to exempt certain classes of point sources from compliance with these provisions. On June 10, 1975, the court agreed with the NRDC and ordered EPA to propose new draft regulations covering all segments of the concentrated animal feeding operation category of point sources by November 10, 1975. These hearings explored the numerous and complicated issues and problems involved with developing a program to comply with the law and the court order. (AUTHOR/NQ)",

Specifically, the following orientations were examined: the quest for theory in aspiration research; pre-path analysis; post-path analysis; the conceptual conservatism of functional status; social stratification and status attainment research; some alternatives. It was suggested that the plethora of studies in sociology on youth aspirations and the corresponding studies of status attainment have implicitly embraced a  structural-functional theoretical approach. Criticism associated with this theoretical framework was examined in terms of social stratification research, particularly the writings of Karl Marx and Max Weber which comprise the \"domains\" of stratification. An alternative direction for status attainment research was sketched in terms of integrating functional psychology within current functional systems of status attainment, leading to more parsimonious theoretical development.

The Navajo environment must be considered in terms of the external (non-Indian) demands for expansion and diversification of coal production and the related demands of: meager water supplies; the Navajo's emotional/religious reaction to current and proposed expansion of coal production; the environmental impact of mining activities; and the future needs of the Navajo Nation. Questions pertinent to these conflicts are: (1) To  what extent does the non-reservation world depend upon Navajo coal and can these consuming areas survive without expanded production?; (2) What is the meaning of mining to a society which is traditionally not entrepreneurial and what effect does strip mining have upon the Navajo's religion and his sense of place and being?; (3) Can the royalties received from coal production sustain improvements in the Navajo standard of living or should the Navajo tribalize coal production and seek profits as well as royalties?

Major points presented are: (1) forced assimilation has not worked; (2) indifference is the essence of inhumanity; (3) a viable social philosophy must unite and utilize the experiences and cultures of many different peoples, taking into account the evolving experience of multi-cultural/multi-lingual people; (4) the new organizing principle of our institutions may be symbiotic--the successful and necessary reconciliation of apparently irreconcilable differences; (5) the loss of  traditional ways does not necessarily equate with loss of identity (the loss is in and of itself part of the identity), since identity is the conception of or feeling about events lived by a people; (6) the Indian in America needs to feel pride in his people before he can gain self-esteem, and he cannot develop self-esteem if others rob him of the opportunity to do things for himself; (7) coexistence of multiple viable social systems in America should enhance our sense of freedom, as freedom is predicated upon the presence of alternatives.

Self-determination, control, parental involvement, and educational relevance constitute the necessary components of improved education for American Indians. Specifically, Indian students need programs in which: their culture is valued; their language is recognized; their special needs are met; and they feel comfortable and involved. Recent Federal legislation has rejected the paternalistic policies of the past and substituted Indian self-determination, but cultural differences must be recognized in the educational curriculum, textbooks, and class offerings.

County knowledgables were surveyed to determine the type and adequacy of available health and government services in the 6 counties, and health care services in 20 eastern Montana counties were inventoried to determine the ratio between population and health personnel and facilities. Findings indicated: the more sparsely populated counties had fewer medical facilities and personnel than their urban counterparts; many eastern Montana residents lived in isolated areas along poor transportation  routes; medical facilities and personnel were located in the larger urban areas; rural residents tended to expect less health care and engage in more self-treatment than urban residents; rural health service problems were comparable to rural government service problems (i.e., geographic isolation, sparse population, and financial shortages). Suggested alternatives were: multi-legged service delivery centers (communities assigned a single service responsibility); the circuit rider concept (regional specialists); computerized coordination (interagency communication/cooperation).

On the role of rural social science in Theological education, one study reports that the pastor is not only a man of God but a man of knowledge, not only in theological but in all fields of study. On the basis of these studies covering 50 years, the author states that while rural is by definition non-metropolitan, people everywhere since the 1960's have received the same knowledge, entertainment, and news from metro TV. Therefore, the rural community no longer depends upon the church to furnish knowledge in all fields of study,  but rural people continue to depend upon the church to provide their theology and man of God.

        "description":"The oral literature of the Navajo people generally falls into two categories: the sacred stories and the folk tales, which often, but not always, point a moral. Sacred stories relate the Navajo's emergence history. These stories tell how the universe holds two kinds of people: the &quot;Earth Surface People&quot; (both living and dead) and the &quot;Holy People&quot; (powerful, mysterious beings that belong to the Sacred World). While the Holy People who travel on lightning, sunbeams, and rainbows are very powerful, they are not all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good. They make mistakes and have human emotions. They can be invoked, supplicated, propitiated, and coerced to help the people of the tribe, or to cease doing damage. The Holy People also serve as ideals of behavior for the Navajo people  to follow or emulate. Although the sacred stories differ from story teller to story teller and from time to time, the outstanding lesson remains the same. Basic lessons taught by these stories are: the universe is a very dangerous place; to survive you must maintain order in those areas of life that you can control; avoid quarreling, avoid excess, and stay in harmony with your community and with nature; be wary of non-relatives; when in a new and dangerous situation, do nothing; and if the situation is really dangerous, escape.

Transportation facilities generally follow a four phase approach before construction: long range systems planning, corridor location study, design location study, and final preparation of plans. Traditional engineering education emphasized the latter two phases but now all phases are treated equally. Thus, the impact of environmental, social, and economic concerns on the initial planning phase of construction must be assessed by engineers. This new emphasis has engendered citizen participation in engineering decisions. Curricula must provide students not only the mathematics and sciences of engineering, but also social and environmental understandings as well. (MR)",

His suggestions are given in such a way as to relate how at each of the undergraduate levels the students could get involved in design projects related to recycling or reuse. Examples of projects recently carried to successful status are cited. A second suggestion relates to the potential of recycling for giving interdisciplinary, industrial, and governmental dimensions to an engineering program. To illustrate this point, a description is given of a local recycling  enterprise that was initiated. Its goals and purposes are stated. Future plans are suggested in relation to proposals of other such separation-based systems. The third potential explained is that of recycling with respect to giving social relevance to an engineering program indicating concerns for ecology and resource recovery and by coupling the recycling action with jobs or voluntary action.

Several of the studies in this issue were attempts at identifying broad areas of teacher behavior affecting student outcomes, which, once identified, could be the basis for further cause-and-effect research. Inservice training using modeling strategies was found to bring about improvement of student and teacher behavior by two authors. Two other studies established correlations between teacher behavior and the attitudes of students, students' critical thinking skills, and students' views of the tentativeness of science. One investigator reports an inverse relationship was found between the frequency of a  teacher's use of student names and the frequency of non-productive silence and confusion in the classroom. Other studies presented may be of interest to a broad spectrum of science educators. Fifteen papers are presented. (Author/EB)",

The developmental focus was the logical groupements associated with the concrete operations period of middle-childhood. Sixty-four binary choice items were devised; one half of these assessed the operation of logical composition while the remainder assessed the inverse operation and reciprocal operation. In addition, complimentary concrete operations tasks, adapted from the procedures of previous normative investigations, were administered. These included dichotomous sorting, some-all understanding, class inclusion, cardinality,  combinatorial reasoning, serial ordering, addition, and correspondence, transitive inference, and conservation of length, weight, and number. A sample of 180 children (equal numbers of kindergarten, and third and sixth grade male and female subjects) received the concept task series. Significant sex differences and order of presentation effects were generally absent. As anticipated, grade-level main effects were significant for the great majority of the tasks. Psychometric analyses were conducted, and it was concluded that the task series was a generally reliable assessment of logical reasoning. (Author/SD)",

The study described postulated that certain teaching strategies, when used for science instruction with native children, will maximize both achievement and attitude toward science instruction. Sixteen student teachers were participants in the study and the students consisted of native Indian children from 25 classrooms in eight different northern schools; grades included were 4 to 11. Six different strategies were implemented at various cognitive levels. Analysis of data for grades 4 to 6, as well as 7 to 11, indicated the most frequently used strategy  (questioning) was least liked by native children. Student achievement using this strategy was reasonably high, and very high for students in grades 7 to 11. The most successful strategies used with the elementary children were the experimental approach and activity sessions; for the secondary group, information-centered assignments and questioning. The least successful for both groups was values discussion. (Author/EB)",

        "description":"Effects of strategy instructions on the problem-solving performance of junior high school algebra students was investigated in two experiments. In the first experiment, three groups of students were instructed to solve algebra problems using a backward, forward, or mixed directon of search. The pattern of solution times and errors indicated that the students followed the instructions, and that the efficiency of each direction-of-search strategy was strongly related to the probability of starting the solution incorrectly (\"entering a blind alley\"). The mixed strategy proved difficult for junior high school students. In the second experiment, instructions were given on how to identify and respond to blind alleys. The effect of instructions varied with the search strategy used  (backward or forward). Although overall results showed that forward search groups performed significantly better than the backward search groups when blind alleys were entered, when forward and backward groups received full instructions for dealing with blind alleys no difference was observed. The pattern of results suggests that the optimum strategy depends on the problem type, but that if the backward strategy is chosen, it should be combined with full blind-alley instructions.

The author studied 32 fourth year medical students from two colleges: 16 were from a college with a traditional curriculum; 16 were from a college whose curriculum included some early attempts at problem-oriented teaching. Students were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions. Four students from each college were provided with a set of heuristics for clinical problem solving and prompted to use them; four were provided with heuristics, but received no prompts for their use; four students from each college developed their own personal tests of problem solving heuristics and were prompted to use them; four developed their  personal test but received no prompting. Subjects had initially worked through a paper case from which pretest measures were derived. Subjects who received the prepared set of heuristics were given aid in their use through another case. All subjects worked through two additional cases from which posttest measures were derived. The results indicate that fourth year medical students perform better on clinical cases when they have been given powerful heuristics. (Author/EB)",

Data were collected from 67 teachers and analyzed using the QUANAL program. From the results and conclusions of data analysis, it was noted that three distinct science teacher types were identified. Overall Type I favored student-centered, indirect teaching behaviors. Type II favored open classroom  communications along with strong discipline and small group activities. Type III favored large group activities, structure in their lessons, and flexibility and variety in classroom materials and techniques.

The observed teacher behavior was recorded through use of the Teaching Strategies Observation Differential (TSOD), (Anderson, 1974). Data tables and data analyses are presented. Conclusions drawn show a moderate correlation of the CAC and an instructor's years of teaching, indicating that younger teachers are perceived as being indirect in teaching style. Teachers in larger schools are also perceived as indirect by students. Correlations of the number of  laboratory days to the CAC, and the number of options opened to students and the CAC, indicated that students were aware of activity options offered them. In the appendix a copy of the CAC checklist, a background questionnaire, a class composition questionnaire, and the TSOD are presented. (Author/EB)",

        "description":"The hypothesis of this paper is that the patterns of political influence on public school systems are changing. Public school systems are subject to so many political influences that one can raise the question, \"Who governs?\" The educational policy-making procedures seem to have become politicized in the wake of the turbulence of the 1960's. The relationship among school boards, superintendents, and the public in the realm of education is unclear. In order to gather data to test the hypothesis, a longitudinal, comparative research method was devised to include both systematic observation of events and periodic recordings of participants' perceptions. Data were collected for the 1974-75 academic year on the flow of communications and decisions in 11 public school districts in the  United States and Canada. Observation of open school board meetings in these districts indicates that among the evident differences are variety in the functions of decision making and communication, distribution and intensity of discussion, the qualitative nature of communication, distribution and intensity and against specific action, and the responsibility for setting the agenda of the meetings. The finding is that, in spite of marked contrast in these and other areas, the superintendent still emerges in each case as the dominant actor. This conclusion implies that further research investigating public communication to the school board and to the superintendent is indicated. Tables, charts, appendices, and footnotes are included in the essay. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The response of the American public education system to the challenge of preparing citizens to respond intelligently to global challenges and opportunities is inadequate. State education agencies should be actively providing adequate experiences in international/intercultural education. However, according to a 1969 survey by the Education Commission of the States, the state boards of education of the 50 states generally concentrate on the areas of curriculum and materials development rather than research and evaluation and they do not perceive the need to provide leadership for globalizing public education. There are many key factors in internationalizing public education, but they generally center around the personalities, organizational structure, and funding priorities of  those in positions of state leadership. Recent information shows that many states are moving toward a global approach, particularly in the following areas: credit for overseas experience, transfer of foreign credits, leave granted for foreign teaching, number of inservice programs on international topics, global-approach curriculum development, and stress on international training in teacher preparation and certification. Implications of the research are that, in spite of some significant progress recently, too little has been done to internationalize public instruction; there is inadequate funding and too little tracking of results against global goals and objectives.

A series of interviews in several cities with 45 people, including members of city government and university administrators and faculty, provided the data for this study. In particular, the work of the Urban Observatory Program in selected cities was observed. The program's goals are to promote and coordinate urban research by universities which will relate to urban problems and to make the results of this research available to local governments. Some of the significant obstacles to the implementation of social science research carried out by universities in the solution of urban problems are (1) the differences in organization, philosophy,  and methodology between universities and the city governments which are the subjects of the research; (2) the theoretical nature of some types of research; (3) the poor methodology used for some research; and (4) apathy and bureaucratic red tape on the part of the city governments and universities. Suggested methods to insure better implementation of research projects include a minimum five-year tenure for university programs and better communication between participants in cooperative projects.

These leaders include the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., Chief Albert John Luthuli, and Mahatma Gandhi. The unit emphasizes the principles these men stood for in their struggles for political rights and individual freedoms. Questions and exercises which follow each section of the student's pamphlet place the student in the role of the leaders discussed and of the people deprived of their freedom for whom these leaders struggled. The teacher's guide provides exercises designed to help students appreciate the ideas that political freedom and civil rights can be achieved peacefully and that these rights  must be constantly safeguarded.

Given data about a neighborhood area in Houston, students make predictions and express feelings about future developments in the area. The second activity investigates urban planning in Moscow. Issues that are examined include the future of cities, urban sprawl, the morphology of a large city, and the relationship of people to an urban environment. It is hoped that students learn to apply the regional method of geography to a study of Moscow, and that they develop an understanding of their local urban environment. Problem-solving and inquiry skills are utilized as teaching techniques. Five investigation questions and 24  activities are offered. The activities described above are two of 12 (SO 009 140 through 150) teacher-developed elementary instructional activities and 17 teacher-developed secondary instructional activities (SO 009 151 through 167) comprising this series on geography-related topics. They are available individually and as elementary or secondary sets. The materials are intended to help teachers in developing units for the classroom. Topics that are covered require student inquiry into current problems such as land use, development, pollution, and population. Mastery of geography skills is emphasized. Instructional approaches include simulations, role playing, mapping, group discussion, experiential learning, field excursions, gaming, and case studies. (ND)",

Despite the differences in site selection, clientele, and relationship to treatment, both evaluators and researchers must make adjustments in method to accommodate ethical concerns. Based on a research study of the political socialization process of Colombian children and several educational program evaluation projects in New England, participant observation systems are considered for methodological modification for ethical reasons. In both the research and evaluation studies, the investigators felt that the risk of the Hawthorne effect or other biasing effects must be subordinated to the  observed subjects' right to know the nature of the observations. In addition, honoring assurances of confidentiality to one group of subjects enhances the confidence that other groups will have in the investigators' promises. Examples of ethical conflicts that arise uniquely in muliclientele program evlauations are also described. (Author/DE)",

The reduction in sex inequalities throughout the world, regardless of political or economic orientation, will necessitate a new perception of the woman's role in the family unit. The hypothesis is that contemporary women, with their high levels of education and knowledge, are not well served by the traditional functions of marriage and family. Comparative studies reveal that women in all industrialized societies are moving inexorably toward equality. They will begin to perceive the dysfunctional effects of the nuclear family, particularly patriarchal nuclear family structures, upon themselves and will increasingly shun  traditional family sex roles. The effect on family structures will be great, either precipitating a substantially reduced birthrate, increased willingness by men to assume household tasks equally with women, or proliferation of communal households which are well suited to accomplishing such tasks efficiently.

        "description":"The formation, development, and demise of a women's center in suburban New York are described. The women's center resulted from a conference designed to assess problems confronting women and to mobilize resources to meet those problems. However, after the formation of the center, a struggle for leadership and conflicts over the values and beliefs of the participants emerged. Many of the middle-class women with children at home tended to be more moderate and emphasized education, counseling, and referral to existing facilities rather than social action and radical change. As the emphasis shifted from social action to service, the center's reason for existence became eroded. The leaders became immobilized and quarreled among themselves, and the ambivalences among the leaders  reflected the role strain prevalent among most women today. Women feared appearing too militant to attract other women or too ineffectual to accomplish the improvements they desired in the status of women. In addition to internal factors accounting for the Center's demise, external problems were prevalent, such as inability to tap funds. Recommendations for future women's centers are included.

        "description":"This doctoral dissertation examines alternatives for public-school religious education which stress spiritual values but do not conflict with legal restrictions. The study is divided into four parts. Part one is an historical survey of religious education in public schools that includes an interpretation of the legal restrictions and the importance of spiritual education for everyday life. Part two is an analysis and study of teacher training in the area of spiritual education, how various academic disciplines relate to this education, and administrative guidelines used to develop those activities which conform with the philosophy of court decisions. The third part provides objectives and sample elementary-level units which would develop spiritual concepts and yet remain neutral  in legal areas. Part four contains a summary, conclusions, and recommendations for further teacher training and curriculum development. (DE)",

        "description":"Traditional familialism as a basic antecedent for understanding Japanese-American communication in Honolulu is examined. The traditional Japanese extended family evolved from economic interdependencies in agricultural, rural communities. This familial communalism demanded that individualism be suppressed so that the needs of the corporate group could be met. Permeating this sense of hierarchy and order was a feeling of obligation and adoration to one's place in the scheme of things. However, Japanese immigrants to Hawaii encountered a new society in which the close-knit family organization was challenged by expanding capitalism, urbanization, and industrialization The structural changes which the Japanese family underwent in Hawaii due to this new culture can be seen in the  reduction of birth rates, family size, and urbanization of the Japanese family over the last 50 years. However, as the Japanese became ethnically assimilated into the culture, their familial identification strengthened with commensurate importance of filial piety and family honor in their human relations and communication patterns.

Through the program, qualified candidates of developing countries are educated and trained in the United States and other countries where opportunities exist for relevant learning and problem solving. One of the primary objectives of U.S. development assistance is the development of human resources and the building of self-reliant and productive societies. Since the program's inception in 1941, over 170,000 participants from 135 countries have received special training in the areas of education, agriculture, industry, public  health and safety, family planning, public administration, labor organization, and youth leadership. Over 99 percent of all participants in the training program returned to their home countries to work and train others in these fields. The publication contains brief descriptions of the following: (1) academic training provided through the program; (2) specialized and on-the-job training; (3) observation training; (4) emphasis on population and family planning; (5) training the trainers; (6) locating new avenues for training; and (7) complementary programs which add to the training experience.

The act concentrated aid efforts on food and nutrition improvement, population control, health improvement, education, and human resource development. It directed programs toward reaching the poor majority, required greater coordination with private and voluntary organizations, stressed the importance of integrating women in the effort, and emphasized the involvement of the poor as active participants in their own development. After a short introduction, chapter two discusses AID's basic approach to development, defines who will receive the aid and how they must participate, and  describes various policy programs.

        "description":"A project to determine the effectiveness of a program designed to create more positive attitudes among students studying social studies through use of simulation games is described in this dissertation. The purposes of the project were to describe the design and implementation of a plan for such a program and to determine whether simulation games could bring about greater student interst and motivation for secondary students of varying abilities. The dissertation contains a review of the literature, methodology of the study, discussion about simulation games, presentation and analysis of the data, and conlusions and implications. One hundred 11th-grade students from Elmsford, New York, were tested using five simulation games--&quot;1787,&quot;&quot;Democracy,&quot;&quot;Inter-Nation,&quot;&quot;Hat in the  Ring,&quot; and &quot;The Union Divides&quot;. Data for the project included responses to opinion-type questionnaires, teacher observations, interviews, written reports, and student records. Results suggest that simulation games do enhance student interest and do produce more positive attitudes toward the social studies. Because the extent to which attitude changes were due solely to the simulation games was not established, it was concluded that no single factor associated with changes in classroom methodology could be identified as having greater influence on attitudes.

Public interest law is a phrase that describes efforts aimed at providing legal representation for underrepresented interests in the legal process. The report is arranged into four major sections. The first section, on the evolution of the concept of public interest law, discusses the provision of legal aid for little or no fee in cases involving poverty law, civil rights law, public rights law, the representation of charitable organizations, or the administration of justice. The second section discusses the Ford Foundation's relations with 16 public interest law firms. Cases handled by the firms cover such diverse areas an environmental protection, governmental reform,  employment practices, voting rights, the regulation of the mass media and consumer protection, regulation of mental health and the rights of patients, women's rights, and international issues. Section three, dealing with concerns about public interest law activity, focuses on the role of courts as an appropriate forum, the effect of overburdening the judicial system, competing public interests, and adequate representation of all segments of the public. The concluding section looks at the future of public interest law over the next few years--probable sources of support, efforts to develop them, and new forms of dealing with social and economic problems including inequities that may emerge from present experience and practice.

Discipline and moral values in education are the keys to responsible citizenship, which is disappearing in the United States today. Without abandoning compassion and special attention to minorities, a nationwide commitment to high standards and academic vigor is needed on all levels of education. Studies point out the declining standards in education and the emphasis on students' rights to the exclusion of students' responsibilities. Many of the discipline problems in schools today are probably a response to student boredom caused by permissiveness and a lack of challenge. Although the teaching of values and moral development in schools has many opponents, the current permissiveness  and neutrality on values in education have not had many positive results. The educational system should assume more responsibility for teaching the values and virtues of the American way of life. Only education can break the pattern of civic withdrawal in the United States today and, together with media outside the formal school structure such as television, instill in young Americans the values that lead to responsible citizenship.

The sample population is divided into four age groups: 55 years and over, 65 years and over, 75 years and over, and 85 years and over. Chapter one presents a brief introduction on the nature of demographic aging. Chapter two examines the numbers and proportions of older persons in the United States. Chapter three breaks the groups down by sex and race composition. Chapter four provides data on geographic  distribution and internal migration. Chapter five surveys various factors of mortality and survival including quantity vs. quality of life, life expectancy, sex differences, race differences, causes of death, geographic variation, and prospects for mortality reduction. Chapter six considers the major social and economic characteristics of the older population including marital status and living arrangement, educational attainment, labor force participation, and income level.

The unit's goals for students include ability to list the major characteristics of the American economy, apply basic economic analysis to current economic situations, list the basic economic tools used to stabilize the economy, and review present economic trends through a personal and societal perspective. Among the teaching methods suggested are brainstorming, creating models, simulations, short lectures, interviews, short readings, and case studies. The unit is comprised of 12 activities. Student  goals, class materials needed, specific teacher instructions, and questions with which to stimulate classroom discussion are provided for each activity. Also provided are pre- and posttests and quizzes, a test of basic economic concepts and their definitions, 18 expectations which are considered a minimum competency requirement in the achievement of economic literacy, and a bibliography of additional resource materials.

        "description":"This paper reports on a study in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area designed to assess social studies teachers' perceptions of knowledge, attitudes, and skills goals in social studies education. Four hundred and sixty K-12 social studies teachers responded to the assessment instrument. The results indicated that secondary social studies teachers emphasize the teaching of content knowledge while elementary teachers give greater attention to the socialization of the child. Teachers from all grade levels believe that more emphasis should be placed on teaching social science knowledge. Greater emphasis is being given to processing and application skills than to knowledge acquisition and interpretation skills in the curriculum. However, teachers at various grade levels differ in their  opinions about what skills are most important for their students. The overall data from the study indicates that there is not wide-spread dissatisfaction among the faculty with the present curriculum. The major implication for curriculum change is that priority goals, rather than social science disciplines per se, should serve as a basis for the design of the curriculum. Implications for staff development based on the assessment are also included. (Author/DE)",

Although the survey provides no way to gauge the amount of student interest in the programs offered or to know whether any given college or university has increased or decreased its offerings in this area during the last year, most of the reporting colleges are making a concerted effort to provide some sort of global education. There is, however, no single approach to teaching global studies at the college level. Most of the program  descriptions contain a brief overview of the program or course offerings and the name of a faculty member to contact for further information.

The ongoing processes of continuity and change in culture and their relationship are emphasized. The first chapter is devoted to the concept of culture, the total way of life of a people from language and games to work and housing. The next chapter examines the processes involved in cultural change and the reasons why cultures do not remain the same, including their stability and lag. Spanish, Indian, and English cultural heritages are discussed in the third chapter. Heritage refers to the fact that modern-day Americans and Mexicans are what they are because of their past. Subsequent chapters deal with language, religion, land tenure  and labor, and political institutions. These particular aspects of culture show how cultures remain stable while change occurs. Each chapter contains an organization section that precedes the chapter's text and provides an overview of main ideas discussed. The first three chapters can be used as supplementary material in courses on religion, geography, or political science. (Author/ND)",

The hypothesis behind the current program is that the level of economic literacy of both the preservice teachers and their students may be substantially improved by a unified and total approach to the transmission of economic knowledge. The program consists of four separate classes which stress the knowledge of economics, the methodology of teaching economics, and the practice of teaching economics in the classroom of preservice teachers. The economics course stresses the view of economic man as a three-part interrelationship among personal and household finance, producer and manager of production, and director of public production. Each of these areas  includes eight general economic concepts, such as specialization, income distribution, price, consumption, and role of government, and 36 subdivisions which are reproduced in the appendix. A description of an experimental course taught on the basis of this model program and plans for future research and publications are also included. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The first in a series of monographs that describe various aspects of the development of musical intelligence, this paper describes two distinct and contrasting strategies which individuals use for making sense of simple rhythmic figures. The strategies are identified as (1) figural, related to gestures, and (2) metric, referring to measuring durations. The paper proposes that, while individuals tend to favor one of the strategies, both are necessary for intelligent musical behavior. Data are derived from children's drawings of simple rhythmic figures. Analysis shows that the dynamic interaction of the two strategies leads to development of new knowledge and to creative learning and performing in music and possible other disciplines. It is concluded that traditional schooling  tends to emphasize only one strategy which does not stimulate the interaction of both strategies, thus inhibiting students' developments. Basic data and description of the taxonomies are presented in the first of the paper. Part two describes relationships between the strategies. Part three contains data that exemplify the interactions. The last section discusses the developmental issues inherent in the data and makes some suggestions for teaching music. (Author/ND)",

        "description":"The purposes of this paper are to identify the current trends in social studies curriculum and teaching strategies and to make some projections about the future. Three conflicting movements, or paradoxes, are identified. The first paradox is the back-to-the-basics movement vs. an expanded curriculum. This is due to conservative reactions to useless courses and teaching methods that change basic American values, which conflict with a trend toward broader, more diversified curricula that deemphasize traditional courses. A conflict between emphasizing the individual vs. creating a responsible \"community-ship\" is the second paradox. On one side is a trend toward exploring feelings and values, and on the other is renewed emphasis on responsible participation in the community. The  third paradox involves interest in the local community vs. global awareness. An increasingly fragmented society causes family relationships and background to become more important but also creates the need for global studies and global education. It is advised that educators use parts of all the trends to create a new, synthesized curriculum. Conflicts involved in the first paradox appear to be nonresolvable, the second is a choice that must be made, and the third conflict will probably continue for a long time. It is the teacher's responsibility to know these trends so they can make qualified curriculum decisions and choices. (ND)",

The comparison was made by using the author's Moral Atmosphere Scoring System, involving hour-long interviews of 12 randomly selected students at each of the three types of school. Findings show clear  qualitative differences in perceptions of \"rules and authority\" in the three schools: 82% of the students at the democratic school accepted that atmosphere; 17% at traditional schools accepted their atmosphere; and 42% at the laissez-faire school approved of the rules. These preliminary indications that students evaluate settings in terms of their perceived justice must be followed by conceptual and methodological progress before one can genuinely categorize school moral atmospheres and link them to changes in ethical reasoning.

In 1960 the Industrial Relations Center at the University of Chicago initiated the ESE program to study student comprehension of basic economic concepts and integration of economics into elementary school social studies programs. Designed to develop fourth and fifth graders' understandings of processes of consumption and production, ESE offers 11 units, requires 20 to 34 teaching hours, and includes a teacher's guide, instructional aids, evaluation materials, student readings, a project book, and progress checks. Program evaluation  involved student understanding and interest, teacher evaluation, and parent reaction. Over one thousand elementary students were tested and equated for mean and range of IQs, socioeconomic status, age, and grade in school, and they were divided into experimental and control groups. The ESE program was given to the experimental group. The control group was given regular social studies course materials. The experimental group showed over 25% greater acquisition of economic understanding than the control. Ninety-three percent of the teachers evaluated ESE materials and the program as good or very good, 97% of parents interviewed felt that the program was helpful to their children, and a majority of the teachers surveyed indicated a student preference for ESE over other social studies  programs.

        "description":"This 1976 Bicentennial Yearbook shows how the values expressed in the Declaration of Independence have been applied in specific episodes of U.S. history and provides current teaching strategies for values education. In the first and major part of the book, ideas about values associated with the birth of the nation are explored and traced as generations of Americans attempted to apply the values of &quot;real life&quot; circumstances. Four case studies examine how the values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were expressed in conflict situations in U.S. history. The first case study explores the meaning of &quot;life&quot; as applied to the impressment of American sailors by foreign powers. The second case study examines the meaning of &quot;liberty&quot; in the challenge of Susan B. Anthony to  gain equal political rights for women. The third case study also examines the meaning of &quot;liberty&quot; in the struggle of the Mormons to be free from an oppressive government. The fourth case study details the meaning of the &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; as illustrated in the collision between individualistic and societal interpretations of the antitrust movement against the Standard Oil Company about 1900. In a natural sequel to the historical treatment of Part I, Part II of the yearbook addresses instruction about values in a contemporary setting. It is concerned with the issues of values education and provides practical teaching suggestions. Included are philosophical definitions, questioning strategies, role-playing activities, and classroom techniques for analyzing value-conflicting dilemmas.  (Author/DE)",

A comparison was made of economic understanding and attitudes of 330 students from six similar colleges. One instructor at each school taught both control (lecture-discussion approach) and experimental (AVT films, tapes, worktexts) classes, covering the same content but differing in teaching method. Two forms of the Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) were administered on first and last days of class. T-tests on pre- and post-TUCE scores and postcourse estimated weekly study time showed little difference between the groups. An analysis, using multiple-linear  regression, showed that both groups spent equal time studying and achieved equal levels of economic understanding. Another multiple linear regression model was used on pre- and postcourse questionnaire data to investigate AVT effects on student attitudes toward economics. Few differences appear between both groups. Although the AVT approach might not be a more motivating teaching method, it might offer instructors and students an alternative to the conventional methods. (AV)",

        "description":"In order to understand what motivates children to participate in or avoid engaging in physical activities, it is necessary to understand something about motivation. There are two sources of motivation. Intrinsic motivation comes from drives, psychological and physiological processes, and needs such as the desire for achievement and self-determination. Extrinsic motivation comes from the expectation of rewards, either material or in the form of praise and admiration. The family structure and peer influences affect the kind of achievement needs the child will have. Some children will have such high achievement needs that they will persist at everything they try; others will vary their efforts greatly depending on the situation. Extrinsic rewards must be delicately handled because  too many may undermine intrinsic motivation, while an appropriate level will complement and prop up low motivation. Attribution theory is also important to understand in studying motivation. Those who see the locus of control as outside of themselves, dependent on task difficulty or luck, will behave differently than those who feel there is an internal locus of control based on skill or effort. Involvement of children in physical activities can best be facilitated by offering them the maximum possible involvement and decision-making contribution to physical education programs. (CD)",

In New York, the demand for increased accountability has been translated into a state requirement for the development of competency based teacher education programs. This paper describes the Syracuse Teacher Corps Project, which recruited 31 interns who had completed two years of undergraduate training, and provided teacher education that led to a bachelor's degree and an initial teaching certificate. The program is field based to the extent that the interns spent approximately half of their time on instructional  teams in an inner city school setting. The other half of their commitment was directed toward the university courses necessary to complete their academic program. Competency agreements were negotiated between the preservice interns and either a field-based team leader or a field-based clinical instructor. (DMT)",

The stated philosophy of the program is that teachers in training need more contact earlier with the public schools--that is, that all theory with practice delayed until later results in little application of theory because too much time has elapsed before there is opportunity for practice. The information in this report is based on data gathered from two questionnaires devised to evaluate the success of the program. In the first questionnaire, principals and cooperating teachers in schools where the 12 graduating EXEL participants were doing their student teaching were asked to rate the students on nine qualities that had been identified as important for success as a teacher. The  second questionnaire, EXEL Perceptions, contained two parts and concerned working relationships and integration of off-campus with campus experience. The second questionnaire was also completed by the principals and cooperating teachers. The appendix contains the questionnaires and a suggested schedule for students in the EXEL program. (RC)",

It discusses teacher organizations as advocates functioning not only to support and protect teacher interests but also to actively seek attainment of improved curriculum and more adequate instructional materials. The booklet documents the thinking of teacher organization leaders on the future of local and state organizations in instruction and professional development. Their views were gathered through a modified Delphi technique. Results were tabulated into long- and short-range priorities. The six immediate priorities were that the local organization: (1) should participate with school boards in policy decisions on curriculum and instruction; (2) should use political action to provide the means for  establishing legal and financial foundations for instructional improvement; (3) should legally share in policy decisions that establish conditions under which teachers, student teachers, teacher aides, and other instructional personnel are placed in schools; (4) should implement positive action programs ensuring fair treatment of racial and ethnic minorities; (5) should initiate and plan inservice programs in professional development of members; and (6) should program and budget a portion of fiscal and human resources to projects on instructional improvement. The seven long-range priorities are items that the local associations would like to achieve inthe next 10 to 30 years and deal generally with giving teacher organizations more influence in professional development programs, teacher  certification, administrator evaluation, and student evaluation. A checklist for local organizations and a priority ranking of teacher organization role statements are given. (DMH)",

With respect to physical education, every consideration should be given to the changing emphases, frameworks, and models in comparative education. Comparative  education has proceeded from intuition, description, and analysis to prediction. The historical-philosophical-national character tradition has been superseded, to a large extent, by a movement towards the social sciences. The field of comparative physical education and sport has come a slower route, has attracted less worthy scholars, and is relatively new in the academic world.

The norms section, which is the most important part of the total complex, deals with items that test physical fitness and motor skillabilities. Upon completion of both the requirements and norms at each level, silver or gold badges are awarded as well as a badge with honors at stage four. The requirements section deals with basic principles of physical culture, personal and social hygiene habits, morning exercises, and fundamentals of civil defense. The five stages of the PWD program  are: (1) brave and agile (boys and girls 10-13 years); (2) the rising sports generation (boys and girls 14-15 years); (3) strength and courage (boys and girls 16-18 years); (4) physical perfection (men 19-39 years, women 19-34 years); and (5) vigor and health (men 40-60 years, women 35-55 years).

The primary objective of such a course is to provide the student with the basic tools necessary for adequate analysis of human movement, with special emphasis upon those sports and games encountered in elementary and high schools. The course also seeks to prepare students in scientific areas that can enrich the undergraduate curriculum and serve as a solid basis for those who will pursue biomechanics at the graduate level. A problem that was identified half a century ago is still prominent in the teaching of biomechanics: most students enrolling for such a course do not have extensive science  backgrounds; consequently, they have little or no knowledge of physics. To avoid inefficient use of instructor time, Iowa State University has designed and requires a basic course in physics for all students entering the biomechanics course. The course is designed so that the problems encountered are expressed in biophysical terms. The biomechanics instructor can then begin with a brief review of anatomy and muscle physiology and examination of kinematics and an overview of instrumentation and analysis techniques used in biomechanical investigation, along with practical applications to a variety of games and sports. Students are examined in three ways: review of lab work, written examination, and practical examination. (Slides were used with the presentation.) (DMT)",

Unipacs consist of two parts: the student's guide and the teacher's guide.

The teacher's guide contains background information, learning objectives,  post-evaluation instruments, and information on the evaluation of both the self-tests and the post-examinations. The success of an individualized instruction program involves the complete participation of the parent, student, teacher, paraprofessional, and the administrator. The parent should provide encouragement outside of the school environment, while the teacher's duties are redistributed so that he/she is more of an educational guide. The paraprofessional assumes the responsibility for routine duties, and the administrator provides training assistance and encouragement for the professional staff. (DMT)",

Oregon is selected as a case study in the making of a profession because, along with California, it has moved farthest towards a true professionalization of teaching. The Bicentennial Commission of Education for the Profession of Teaching of the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education has issued a report, &quot;Educating a Profession,&quot; containing a criteria of twelve items listing the characteristics of professions. These twelve items are examined here and compared and contrasted with the Oregon experience. The criteria are divided into two groups: those in which there is no  significant distinction between Oregon education and the rest of the country, and those criteria that Oregon has begun to meet in a more clear-cut way than most other states. It is concluded that teaching does not yet satisfy the criteria that other established professions clearly meet; in Oregon, at least, educators have taken essential steps through legislation that can lead to full professional status.

The volume and diversity of the products of research on education have not helped the effort to improve the quality of that research. A major problem for education policy-makers and practicing educators and for persons who use their skills in other disciplines to seek new truths about education is their inability to communicate with each other. The problems that worry educators and for which they seek definitive answers through  research are vastly complex and cannot be compared to technological problems. In education the fundamental units that are dealt with are individual human beings whose behavior is influenced by differing inheritances, by varied experiences in life, and by feelings and attitudes that are unpredictable and changing. Information about human beings cannot be fed into computers with the expectation that the calculations about them will have the predictability that the laws of gravity will produce when fed into the same computers.

The researchers believed that theories of cognitive balance do not adequately explain such behavioral changes; therefore the Achievement Motivation Theory was used in the test. The student ratings referred to 14 modes of teacher behavior which, according to Berlyne's theory of epistimic curiosity, can be assumed to provoke curiosity behavior on the part of the students. Forty-four German language teachers, teaching seventh to tenth grades, were assigned randomly to the experimental and control groups. The major hypothesis, that the teachers in the  experimental group would approximate their behavior more to the ideal behavior than the teachers in the control group, was tested by the interaction in a two way analysis of variance with repeated measures on one factor. The effectiveness of feedback on the behavioral changes in teachers was not estimated as especially high. The teachers in the control group changed for the worse, while the teachers in the experimental group improved only slightly as an average. It was assumed that the students did not perceive their teachers in a very &quot;accentuated&quot; way, so that teachers would have to change their behavior to a large degree before students perceived it. It was recommended that teachers should use the feedback technique in combination with other methods. (SK)",

Two measures must be taken into consideration when measuring accountability. Minimum standards must be established that apply to all schools in the city in the selected goal areas, as well as a student development index that measures the relative achievement of students against some starting point. This system of accountability  assumes that educators are adaptable and trained and are able to deliver in their particular disciplines. Teachers are convinced that by participating in research-oriented, problem-solving study they can find out what factors make for effective learning and take corrective action, if necessary. Unless accountability is to remain merely a concept never to be successfully implemented, accountability systems must be designed. Teacher Organizations have to contribute to such designs. (Author)",

The conceptual framework contrasts with most earlier studies that report teacher behavior as the most direct influence on pupil achievement. Two premises form the basis of the framework: (1) The total amount of time devoted to a particular instructional topic is the most important determinant of pupil achievement; and (2) There is enormous variation in learning time for different pupils. The foci of the conceptual model are pupil pursuits and activities, teacher activities being relevant only in the way they influence those of the pupil. The leading organizational concept is an \"a priori\" concept of time in the Kantian sense. A pupil spends a  certain amount of time in school as defined by educational policy. The time factor preconditions educational effects by defining the quantity of schooling. Amounts of schooling have strong, causally interpretable relations to achievement. Pupil activities and time allocations are additionally influenced by outside administrative and organizational superstructures. Teacher planning and classroom carry through, teacher evaluation procedures, and policy research emerge as unexamined but vital foci for further research. (MM)",

        "description":"Several practical suggestions or guidelines for deriving objectives in traditionally difficult curriculum areas (written and oral communication, fine arts, social sciences, and humanities) are presented in this paper. The author believes that educators do not know how well they can define important, teachable objectives in these areas until they try. The guidelines include: (1) if you merely want to provide the learner with \"nice to know\" information or content, rather than to teach a skill that the learner can apply in many situations, then you probably do not need objectives anyway; (2) when deriving objectives, it is useful to consider the basic stages a real writer, artist, or actor goes through to come up with a good performance or product and develop a scheme for each  stage; (3) objectives should be written so that they define the essential elements or characteristics of a product or performance in a clear, recognizable way; (4) it is helpful to first develop actual samples of the product or performance you want the learner to accomplish; (5) when considering objectives for school-based programs particularly, one must recognize that schools must limit objectives to the time that is available; and (6) objectives can be substantially improved through the curriculum developer's attempts to teach objectives, either personally or through products. Examples of objectives in four areas and a structure of an advanced expressive language program are given in the appendixes. (SK)",

        "description":"School based teacher educators are specialists in instructional improvement and facilitators of teacher learning whose primary base of operation is the elementary or secondary school. The role of the clinical instructor is both supervisory and facilitative and requires that the instructor constantly conceive, implement, and evaluate changes in instructional practices. Four different school based teacher educator roles have been conceptualized: part-time preservice, full-time preservice, part-time inservice, and full-time inservice. The most important preservice teacher educator is the supervising teacher. This is the person by whom the student teacher is most influenced in terms of classroom behavior. The main function of supervising teachers is to develop the student teachers'  perceptions of the teaching-learning process. Inservice staff development will take on increasing importance as teachers lengthen their tenure. The school based teacher educator role has promise as a dynamic factor in the upgrading of inservice staff development. Individuals filling the school based teacher educator role will have to be educational clinicians who can maintain positive attitudes amid the rigors of assisting teachers to modify and change their classroom behaviors.

Forty-four states reported no formal credentialing for supervision of student  teachers. Six states required more than a teaching certificate. When asked if their state had any credentialing staff developers, forty seven of fifty states replied in the negative. Alabama, Delaware, and Oregon have a credentialing system for staff developers.

The questionnaire designed for the survey focused on three areas: (1) the organization and workings of the teacher center; (2) the communication paths and media within and between teacher centers; and (3) the training and credentialing of school-based personnel who work with preservice and inservice teachers. In order to select a representative sample to respond to the questionnaire, the sixty-four teacher center contact persons designated by the Texas Education Agency were asked to nominate ten individuals. As a result, 513 questionnaires were mailed. Of these, 294 were returned. In terms of the findings of the study, teacher  centers are dealing primarily with three areas: (1) procedures and practices related to student teaching, assignment of student teachers, and selection of inservice cooperating teachers; (2) undergraduate program designed to gather preparation programs; and (3) inservice-oriented staff development. Contact between teacher centers appears to be infrequent. Only 38 percent of the sample reported contact with another teacher center; 6 percent reported contact with as many as four. An issue of prime concern to teacher centers is the selection, training, and credentialing of individuals who work in the schools with preservice teachers. The large majority of teacher centers are involved in training supervising teachers. This is an important area that would profit greatly by communication among  the centers. (DMT)",

The task analysis approach, using data derived from interviews, was selected as the basis of the study and as one of several methods for identifying competencies of the school-based teacher educator. The interviews were designed to reflect the problems, functions, and tasks of persons involved with teacher training. To identify persons in this role, letters were mailed to personnel directors of five school districts in the Houston area asking for names of individuals who have responsibility for staff development involving actual work with teachers in the classroom. Specifically, interviews focused on three questions: (1) Who are the role groups with whom these persons  interact; (2) What tasks are performed; and (3) What functions are engaged in it. After analyzing the interview data, it appears that work with teachers is not considered a top priority by these educators. Very few of them actually worked with teachers in trying to improve the teaching-learning experience, and it was not reported as a major task. In comparing amounts of time spent on tasks with rated importance, the function ranked as first in percent of time spent was organizing, but it was ranked as fourth in importance. Training teachers was ranked second in percent of time but seventh in importance. The role description perceived by those interviewed indicated that they spent the major portion of time in administrative functions--planning, coordinating, and developing, with little  involvement with classroom instruction.

The purpose components serve as the foundation for describing the functions of movement in achieving goals and, thus, for defining the scope of the physical education curriculum. In order to determine how students view the 22 purposes for human movement defined by the framework, a study was conducted of the responses of 420 seventh, ninth, and eleventh grade students to the purposes for human movement.

The findings of that study, known as the Meyer and Cohen study, were sufficiently challenging, and in certain respects surprising, to warrant intensive, longitudinal investigation. During the longitudinal study, the MITT Project (Management Implications of Team Teaching), it was possible to use the initial data returns to attempt to replicate the original Meyer and Cohen study without waiting for the through-time results. Some important causal relationships suggested by the original study were confirmed,  notably that extensive work collaboration curtailed the individual teacher's sense of control over his/her own work. The most significant discrepancy to arise from the replication effort was an indication that unitization was a multidimensional rather than undimensional variable. Work collaboration did not operate alone to effect an alteration in teacher attitudes. (JMF)",

Distinguishing between the two kinds of change has been a central feature of the MITT (Management Implications of Team Teaching) research project at the University of Oregon. The study described in this paper selected schools for study according to the presence or absence of change in managerial structure at a given point in time and measured their instructional organization, as well as a number of other school and staff attributes, before and after that time. The paper reports some of the things learned about the coincidence of change in the two. It swells heavily on the measures of instructional  organization, first describing the level and nature of task interdependence observed in the &quot;before&quot; data (while the schools were operating under a conventional managerial structure) and then turning to the changes in task interdependence found after some of the schools had installed the multiunit model.

One hundred and twelve first graders were randomly selected to serve as tutees. Results indicated that both tutors and tutees learned a significant number of words.

        "description":"Research has provided inadequate scientific basis for incorporating fundamental motor skills into the curriculum. More knowledge on how children acquire motor skills is imperative. Motor development of a child is generally viewed as an inherent sequential process of motor unfolding, while skill acquisition is the process mediated through practice, training, and the associated learning mechanisms. The development of motor skills in infants and children is largely the result of growth and maturation. Three major factors that should be considered by the practitioner teaching physical skills are the state of the learner, the nature of the skill, and the methods of instruction. Sex differences are not apparent in the rate of acquisition of basic skills. There is also little evidence  to show that the rate of skill acquisition is any slower or faster in young children as compared to more mature learners. It is important to the success of learning to maintain an optimal arousal level throughout the acquisition level. Skills described as continuous are generally learned more rapidly than discrete skills. The best methods of instruction that can be employed by the practitioner are those based on a complete knowledge of the nature of the learner, the nature of the skill, and the quality and amount of practice given. Knowledge of results also qualifies as a most important factor in skill acquisition. Practitioners and researchers are doing a better job now than in the past. Efforts should be concentrated not on producing more highly skilled youthful athletes but on  producing a larger number of adequately skilled children. (SK)",

There is a physiological and biochemical basis for obesity. Basically, fat has a number of constructive functions in the body: it supplies a reserve source of energy; serves as a medium for fat soluble vitamins; acts as an insulator from cold; and provides support and protection to body organs. However, excess adipose tissue places added strain on the circulatory, respiratory, and renal systems, and body composition is the only valid criterion for determining the state of obesity. The role of  exercise and physical activity have been traditionally played down in weight control education, but physiologically these are vital because muscle cells are the most active metabolic cells in the body. Physical educators can play a major role in the furthering of obesity education by including in their curriculum a test of body composition and instilling in their students and future physical educators the idea that obesitv control is an individual responsibility.

        "description":"By the turn of the 20th century, research had begun dealing with the subject of sport psychology in America. In the early 1900's, Coleman Griffin, the father of sport psychology, led the way in researching sport psychology. It was not until the 1960's that research in this field became popular in Great Britain. In 1967, in both America and Great Britain, national associations of sport psychology were formed by groups of interested physical educators and sport theorists. Two of these groups which have orgainzed conferences are the British Society of Sport Psychology and the North American Society for the Psychology of Sport and Physical Activity. Very few conferences have been sponsored by psychology departments of universities or even universities themselves. The conferences, as  well as the associations, have helped to bring professionals together, but more important, have helped sponsor cross-disciplinary study and inquiry. Many noteworthy books have been produced from the conferences. Four major areas of emphasis which suggest the developmental trends of sport psychology include socio-cultural psychology, sport psychology, psychological growth and development, and human performance. Contemporary developments in America and Great Britain include: (1) a longitudinal approach to personality work, looking at factors in the personality setting from more precise state approaches; (2) a social psychological approach to studying sport; and (3) a serious examination of competition from all angles. There no longer exists an American version of sport psychology  distinguishable from a British version. (SK)",

        "description":"The two studies reported in this paper extend the knowledge about the effects of longer field experience with multiple role models (supervising teachers) upon student teachers' value orientations toward education and schooling. Previous research indicates that student teachers tend to adopt the values and attitudes toward education modeled for them by their supervising teachers during student teaching experiences. A 1975 study chose 54 student teachers and clustered them into three elementary schools for 36 weeks. The student teachers taught daily on two grade levels and under two different classroom teachers. The value orientation toward education held by the student teachers was determined three times during the program by administering the Educational Preference Scale (EPS).  Students' satisfaction with their student teaching experiences and supervisory personnel effectiveness were also measured. The 1974 study is essentially similar to the 1975 study insofar as the treatment of the data is concerned, but in the 1975 study the experiment design was expanded to allow study of the attitude change effect at a semester as well as program level. The two studies conclude that there is little doubt that the supervising teachers' values and attitudes exercise a powerful influence upon the orientations of their student teachers, if a perceived disparity exists between the student and the teacher, the student will tend to adjust his value orientation to minimize that disparity. The extent of this adaptive shift is expected to be a function of the duration of the  situation. No correlation was found between the educational orientation of the teachers and the degree to which students perceived them to be effective. Also, students who experienced a positive attitude change and students who were more liberal when they exited the program tended to be more satisfied with their experience. (SK)",

The activities in the program require more teacher preparation than the traditional push-ups, jumping jack routines, and Six Hundred Yard Run Walk most commonly used in grades four through six. They emphasize development of strength and muscular endurance in neglected areas (primarily the abdominal, arm, and shoulder girdle regions) as well as in leg and running muscles. Most of the activities described (rope,jogging, parachute, position, abdominal, and leg activities) require a minimum of space and equipment, are  adaptable to any group size, may be used inside or outside, and require varying amounts of class time. They can be presented in the form of questions or challenges for the children to answer in his or her own way thereby allowing for individual success. They also allow the teacher to obtain desired responses by continually refining and revising the challenges used. Challenges are in the form of \"Can you. . .?\" and progress to \"How long can you. . .?\" Successful completions and times can be recorded on individual program cards (examples given) that enable both child and teacher to view success, progress, and improvement.

        "description":"When attempts are made to utilize the procedures generally accepted in evaluation to look at something as vague as the term \"exercise\", confusion becomes compounded exponentially. It is important that the fundamental elements of movement, the laws of motion, and the basic movement of skills be taught to everyone. If there is a need to know what has been learned over a period of time, an initial test given at the beginning of the instructional period can be compared with similar tests given at another period. What you want to measure must be carefully defined so that valid, reliable, and objective measures may be taken. Pre-testing, after assuring that procedure and basic skills of every test are learned, provides a criterion measure. A well-designed activity program that includes  time for formative evaluation to take place is necessary to continue motivation and improvement. If the teacher is doing a good job teaching, it is rewarding to see the students enthusiastically recognize their abilities by noting that they are performing above the average on standarized tests. It is a simple task to find an instrument that purports to measure whatever facet you have decided upon as your goal. To realize the potential of evaluation to determine the effects of exercise involves considerable effort on the part of the teacher, particularly in terms of planning before the actual need to evaluate begins.

        "description":"In an effort to clarify understanding of the concept of critical learning periods, this paper discusses problems that people concerned with the motor development of children have had determining relationships between critical periods and learning, and a \"readiness model\" is offered as a solution that could enhance understanding of critical learning periods. The author states that the first step in developing an understanding of the meaning and implications of critical learning periods is to realize that the concept of a critical period for learning is but one of at least three critical periods that affect development (emotional, social, and learning). In this paper, attention is directed primarily to the consideration of critical periods as they relate to learning and,  specifically, the learning of motor skills. Three views on the determination of the onset of critical (optimal) learning periods are presented and diagrammed on a continuum. The extreme left side of the continuum indicates maturation as the primary determinant, the view of McGraw and Gesell. The extreme right indicates learning as the primary determinant, the view of learning theorists Gagne, Skinner, and Bruner. In between is the adaptation theory of Piaget. It is stated that no conclusive evidence supports any one of these approaches over another. The author adopts a viewpoint that seems compatible with the whole range of research evidence--critical periods for learning are considered as optimal readiness periods. The readiness model indicates three areas of concern in the determination  of the onset of an optimal readiness period: (1) the physical and cognitive ability of the child; (2) the skills already possessed by the child; and (3) the motivation of the child. The model implies that critical periods of learning should be properly viewed as periods of optimal readiness and should be used as essential guidelines in the selection of activities to be taught.

The material categorized as information consists of research studies and educational project reports selected from a review of the literature on teacher behavior and the self-concepts of pupils. In an attempt to provide a unifying perspective, educational research is interrelated with educational reality as experienced by pupils, teachers, administrators, and other active educators. The philosophy of education inherent in the perspective is middle of the road--right of the radical reformers and left  of the fundamentalists. The design of the organizational schema is categorization of self-concept into five constructs of self (the bodily self, self-identity, self-esteem, self-extension, and self-image). The conceptual framework defines the interaction between teachers and pupils as a behavioral dialogue (a psycho-social concept of interaction that contains the subjective reality of both the self and the other, and an observable objective reality, which can be perceived as the behavior of the two participants). In conclusion, the investigation suggests that pupils who are perceived as worthwhile, participating, and contributing members of the small society of the classroom will eventually reflect that perception of self as members of the greater society.

Chapters 2 and 3 examine contemporary research designs and procedures implemented for the selection of subjects and testing of behavior over time. Particular attention is given to the sequential research paradigms developed by Schaie for the purpose of simultaneous assessment of age-, cohort-, and time-related behavior change. Some of the common problems in measuring change and models for analyzing longitudinal data are considered in Chapters 4 through 7. Particular emphasis is given to interpretive problems resulting from the properties of scales widely used on standardized achievement tests, to the limitations of current  techniques of vertical equating and consideration of alternative equating methods, and to the evaluation of the constancy of a construct over time. Chapter 8 presents an exposition of time-series analysis along with a new procedure for parameter estimation especially adapted to data from longitudinal studies. In Chapter 9 the problems of measurement of true change are reconsidered, and it is stated that lower and upper bounds for estimated true change are derived under more relaxed conditons than in classical test theory.

Teacher educators promote sound theories of how to acquire and demonstrate various competencies of classroom management but unsuccessfully relate these theories to the realities of the classroom. It is helpful to approach the problem of classroom management from an eclectic viewpoint with the aim of developing an eclectic model for teacher training. Competence in classroom management begins with decisions and decision making. The first competency encompasses the ability to look within, to make some objective statement about self, and then project how this will affect teaching behavior. The next sequence of competencies relate to intervention strategies or actions that can be taken  if student behavior does not conform to expectations. An additional set of competencies is needed which specifically addresses the emotional needs of the child, his self concept development, and his emotional self-expression. Training in each area should begin at the cognitive level. Following success at the cognitive level, each teacher should be able to assimilate the concepts into an integrated schema of classroom management. The third phase in the training sequence is implememtation. Each student should be provided with actual classroom experiences that allow for implementing with children each of the concepts taught.

Teachers successful in open space schools have stressed that their key strategy is coordination. Their suggestions have been organized into five basic categories to help teachers survive in an open space atmosphere. First, it is easier to enforce a few basic rules rather than numerous detailed ones. Rules and standards are most effective when they are organized into school-wide  and individual pod rules. Secondly, careful consideration must be given to the patterns of student movement in the open space school. Again, agreeing on student movement patterns must be done both on a school-wide basis and within each pod. Thirdly, it is essential that teachers working within the same pod take every precaution to minimize distracting noise. Fourthly, teachers in a pod must jointly plan where to locate furniture, equipment and supplies, and should agree on decorations for their open areas. Lastly, it is essential to inform parents about open space as early and thoroughly as possible. Successful coordination in these areas will not only allow teachers to survive in open spaces but will lead to more coordination in implementing new programs. (SK)",

This study concentrated on two major questions: (1) what are the opinions of 13 client groups about the perceived needs for the HCTEC; and (2) how do these client groups differ in their opinions of the needs of the HCTEC. The data was obtained from the answers to 34 questions given by the 13 client groups in the previous study. The Fisher Least Significant Difference Formula was used to analyze the data. The results of this study revealed that the existence of a center to perform a wide variety of important functions in Harrison County's educational structure elicited a strong, positive reaction from all groups  surveyed. Further, there was a strong homogeneity among all groups, indicating unanimity of opinion. The most notable exception to this pattern were college supervisors. Those functions of a teacher center that elicited the highest and the lowest homogeneity are given. The author recommends that a larger, more comprehensive study be done, preferably one involving all seven centers in the state of West Virginia. Tables are included. Appended are the survey instrument used and a list of terms and their definitions. (RC)",

        "description":"The purpose of this practicum was to comply with the recommendations of the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education Evaluation Team by evaluating the competencies developed by the Teacher-Media Librarian Program at Trenton State College. A two-part questionnaire was developed that covered the teacher education competencies and the media librarian competencies of the program. The questionnaire was sent to the 50 graduates of the program from 1973-1975. The data were analyzed by using the mean rating for each competency listed on the questionnaire for evaluation by the graduates. The findings indicated that the graduates felt that both areas of the program more than adequately prepared them to be a teacher or media librarian. However, the graduates identified two  teacher education competencies and one media librarian competency as weaknesses within the program. In addition, other competencies in both areas of the program were identified as having great strength within the program. Based on the findings, recommendations were made for correcting the weaknesses that were identified by the graduates. The recommendations concerned changes that should be made in two of the program's courses. A copy of the questionnaire is appended. (Author/RC)",

The role of the federal government in education is one of leadership and financial and technical assistance to the states or to individual school districts or higher education institutions. The birth of federal support to education research occured in 1862 when Congress passed the Morrill Act. Another jump in education research took place in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act for vocational education. In 1954 the Comparative Research Act was a major turning point for educational research and development. It was followed by the National Defense Education Act in 1958. A number of other acts passed by Congress have also led to  noticeable improvements in American education including the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Many recently developed forms of educational technology are now being widely employed in instructional programs because of federal education policy. Education research is in its infancy in the United States and operates in a complex social arena. Its accomplishments are difficult to measure and evaluate because it is a social science. (RC)",

There were several reasons for revising the programs: (1) new faculty members with different orientations were eager to work on program development; (2) increasing graduate enrollments emphasized the need to take a closer look at the masters programs; (3) the needs of the students in the masters programs have also changed in recent years; and (4) there was inadequate sequencing in the programs and little coordination among faculty members to avoid duplication of topics. Before actual program revision began, innovative programs of other teacher education institutions were investigated. Two groups were then formed: an initiating group, which met once a week  and developed guidelines for program revision, and a reacting group, which reacted to the guidelines and other documents that were produced. The original program has been revised several times, and the revision is still continuing. Appended are (1) a brief discussion of innovative masters degree programs in teacher education; (2) a rationale for revising the Elementary and Secondary Masters Degree Programs; (3) \"belief statements\", for a program design scheme; (4) areas of student capabilities; (5) a proposed elementary and secondary masters degree program; and (6) a summary of reactors' comments.

The book offers suggestions that will enable DARCEE teacher trainers to avoid some of the pitfalls into which other trainers have stumbled, and it offers a number of suggestions that will make their work more productive. For an understanding of the training sessions, it is advisable to read \"The DARCEE Teacher's Guide\" in conjunction with this book. The primary focus of the book is to provide objectives and procedures that a trainer might use in teaching DARCEE teachers. The book deals with three basic kinds of training: preservice; observation-feedback visits; and inservice. The first chapter defines DARCEE, traces its  history, and discusses the DARCEE trainer and training program. The next chapter describes how to establish an effective preservice training session and schedule a preservice training workshop. The next two chapters discuss observation feedback visits and inservice training. Three appendixes constitute the majority of the book. Appendix A outlines in detail 12 lessons for preservice training. An overview, objectives, strategies, and list of materials used are discussed in each lesson. Lessons cover such topics as teacher, positive reinforcement, skill development, and attitude development. Appendix B correlates the special materials needed for the lessons in Appendix A. Appendix C contains recommended observation and feedback report form. (SK)",

        "description":"Much of the important thinking that teachers do occurs during the act of teaching as well as in planning and evaluating. What teachers think about while they are teaching was the basic question addressed in this study. A model was drawn to describe the researchers' concepts of the way a teacher thinks while teaching: the teacher begins with a teaching plan; the teacher receives feedback while teaching; and, on the basis of this feedback, either makes judgment to proceed as planned or to modify the plan. The decision-making processes of 12 experienced teachers were then studied in a laboratory setting. Each teacher was given the task of teaching a social studies lesson to eight junior high school students. Before teaching, each teacher was given 90 minutes to plan, thinking aloud  into a cassette tape recorder. Segments of the actual teaching were videotaped in order to stimulate recall. These stimulated responses were also recorded. The model proved to be a useful way of conceptualizing what teachers think about while they are teaching. In addition, the results implied three generalizations: (1) teachers considered alternative plans only when the instructional process was going poorly, not because they were trying to optimize instruction; (2) pupil participation and involvement were the primary cues used by teachers to judge the process; and (3) teachers rarely changed their plan, even if the instruction was going poorly.

        "description":"The structure and quality of classroom interaction and the ways in which children learn how to interact appropriately was the initial focus of the research and field work described in this paper. The site was a kindergarten/first grade class in a suburban Boston Title I elementary school with many students from second and third generation Italian-American families. At the outset the primary research tools used were collection and analysis of videotaped classroom activities and behavior and discussion sessions involving the teacher and the researcher. A participant observation component was later added to the project, and the researcher then visited the classroom on a weekly basis. This change in research technique indicated a new direction for the project--that of making the  teacher a co-researcher. Since the research was being done in a context of discovery rather than proof, the researcher and the teacher together were able to focus on isolating, describing, and discovering the dynamics of the classroom environment (how it functions, what is predictable, what kinds of breakdowns occur). It was suggested that teachers could share in this discovery process in the absence of a trained researcher and become sources of idea exchange and dialogue for one another. This method might be applied on a larger scale in schools where there is a need for inservice training and continuing education courses designed to help teachers share experiences and raise individual self-esteem and awareness.

Now, ten years later, the mental health of these adolescents as well as the mental health, structure, and process of the family are being studied. The general research objective is to learn what early and concurrent factors predict good versus poor functioning at adolescence. The study reported here focuses primarily on the &quot;How I Feel&quot; instrument constructed to measure self-reported psychological well-being in adolescence. To circumvent the generally poor reading skills of the population, the test items are presented on a tape accompanied  by a single answer booklet in which answers are reported. The tapes were produced by a black actor. Items were developed for the usual clinical components of psychopathology: anxiety, depression, anger and aggression, bizarre-peculiar-paranoia, obsessions, and compulsions, fears and phobias, mania and grandiosity, plus a global psychopathology construct. Results of the various statistical analyses and reliability and validity data are included. The results show great potential for affective measurement in school settings. (RC)",

Adequate computer facilities that are available to students on a low-cost or cost-free basis are necessary; also students must be able to meaningfully communicate with their major advisor regarding their statistical knowledge. The second concern implies some usage of traditional ANOVA terminology. Using a standard ANOVA topic such as the analysis of covariance is generally convincing in the efficacy of the multiple regression approach. The analysis of covariance can be accomplished through two rather simple linear models. (Author)",

A 20% sample of schools containing grade 6 was drawn and attempts made to collect sixth-grade test data compatible with the ATS tables. The data were tabulated and reported as total reading mean scores and standard deviations for the state as a whole and for ten categories based on district size. Because of sampling and data  collection problems, changes were made in the second year's endeavor. All districts using tests covered by the ATS norms were given the opportunity to contribute data. No attempt was made to generalize beyond the population supplying test results, but the analysis was expanded to include the reading subtests and grades 4 and 5 as well as grade 6. (Author)",

For this reason, a battery of seven tests was developed to measure kinesthetic memory, perceptual speed, performance under stress, associative learning, immediate and delayed memory, concept identification, and performance under divided attention. To determine the factor structure and the psychometric characteristics of the battery, 21 paper-and-pencil tests were administered to a sample of airmen. The measures  from the psychomotor/perceptual battery were generally highly reliable. Factor analyses resulted in the identification of six factors specific to the psychomotor/perceptual battery, four to the paper-and-pencil measures, and one factor common to both batteries. Further, the sample was divided into upper and lower groups based on Armed Forces Qualification Tests (ADQT) scores. Their performance on the paper-and-pencil and psychomotor/perceptual batteries was compared and differences evaluated for statistical significance. The differences between the groups were generally much smaller on the psychomotor/perceptual tests than on the paper-and-pencil measures. (EVH)",

However, its major impact on educational research is linked to its provision requiring written parental permission prior to the collection or release of personal data to outsiders. The School District of Philadelphia's Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE), one of the nation's larger school-based research organizations, has evolved an omnibus policy and a number of different procedures for handling research data. This paper presents an examination of ORE's approaches to dealing with problems in data collection, storage, and release. In  addition to general considerations, the differences in procedures for in-house versus outside efforts are explored. A set of guidelines for the release of research data is discussed, as are special data security arrangements and the way in which a central office research review committee functions. (RC)",

        "description":"The intent of formative evaluation is to improve programs as well as to justify their continuation. It is critical to separate clearly those functions of the evaluation which are political from those which may lead the way to instructional improvement. Data for formative evaluation should be gathered in an interpretable way at the level at which decisions will be implemented, usually at the classroom level. This forces data collection activities to a single planned incursion. This recommendation may suggest rethinking some of the measurement differences usually assumed to distinguish good classroom from good program evaluation. Purposive evaluation mandates asking questions about those areas over which a program developer or implementer exerts some control. Sometimes the specific  implications of alternative data patterns are not kept in mind during the design of evaluations; the evaluator should attempt to foresee plausible alternative patterns the data might take. Rather than literally apply the evaluation plans of others, evaluation designs should be allowed to conform to the specific questions needing answers. What is desired are evaluation activities that have instructional improvement as well as, where necessary, political utilities; where with limited waste, data are provided that are pertinent and obvious to program needs.

The focus is on two programs--migrant programs and neglected/delinquent programs--funded under Title I, Public Law 89-750. A common dilemma of these programs is determining the success of children whose attendance is of short duration (less than two months in the migrant programs and an average of seven months in the neglected/delinquent programs). Government guidelines had influenced the SEA and Local Educational Agency (LEA) staff to use standardized tests on a pre and post basis. The evaluation unit found such testing inappropriate because of time factors, student  attendance patterns, and student language abilities. As soon as communication linkage developed, there was mutual agreement by the state evaluation personnel and field people that standardized tests provided meaningless data. It was concluded that the intervention of state data collection in local projects requires that the chief audience of the data should be the LEA's themselves. It is only in this way that relevant information can be amassed that will lead to improvement of projects. Data must be collected in a variety of ways and using a variety of tactics. (RC)",

The inputs were: number of mastery states assumed, test length, prior expectation of masters in the examinee population, and conditional probability of a master getting a randomly selected test item correct, and of getting an item incorrect. Classification accuracy was shown to be a function of all of the above parameters for any specified level of mastery (in the criterion-referenced sense). Specific results showed that for some combinations of prior information and test length, no information from the test could force a reversal in the decision rule, or provide classification accuracy within acceptable error bounds...hence,  test results would be irrelevant. The vulnerability of a Bayesian model to changes in the prior probabilities was also demonstrated. For example, a 10% change in conditional probability was sufficient to completely reverse a classification rule across all test lengths studied, when the prior probability was held constant. Less drastic shifts occured with changes in the prior probabilities. (Author)",

However, the wording and intent of the requirement was purposely left vague because of the conflict between the schoolman's concern over federal interference and Congress' demands for feedback that could lead to efficient spending of the funds. Evaluation can be a useful management tool for the practitioner of Title I because it explains whether objectives are actually being met and because it gives needed data on whether to continue, modify, or terminate a project. Such considerations must be balanced with educators' tendencies to maintain the status quo. Some recommended characteristics of evaluation reports should be: accentuate the positive in reporting  results; use of layman's language, especially in a summary section; reevaluate essentials every year and nonessentials sporadically; be sure that each evaluation reports on some common strand of effectiveness, such as pupil achievement in reading and mathematics; and use longitudinal studies for information purposes only, not to evaluate the overall effectiveness of Title I. Finally, the evaluation should not be able to determine which services any child is to receive. (Author/RC)",

Most programs were aimed at unique populations--disadvantaged, bilingual, etc. This proliferation and the evaluation requirements inherent in each of the categorical efforts created problems of sufficient magnitude to warrant action to relieve school districts. Through reform efforts schools were required to provide thorough needs assessments of their pupils to develop plans in which the various funding sources could be brought together into a coherent whole to meet the established needs of the students. While this reform movement has forged ahead the problem remains that there are still unique evaluation requirements for each of the  individual programs. The problem arises of attempting to make reasonable judgments about the total effectiveness of a reform effort and yet having to meet the legislatively established requirements of unique funding source evaluations. This dilemma presents itself: The kind of information policy makers need is not of the descriptive nature, which has typically characterized an evaluation, but rather one which can yield inferences about contrasts between programs. A movement toward a &quot;hyper-evaluation&quot; which is more akin to experimental or research design is foreseen. (RC)",

Chapter 2 analyzes the economic costs of the food stamp program, taking into account the direct and indirect costs of both federal and non-federal food stamp  organizations. Chapter 3 looks at the total benefits from the program, focusing particularly on the estimated relative gains to eligible recipients and the difficulty of determining program benefits.

In as much as the open admissions policy had the aim of increasing the participation of minority group students in the University, a set of analyses were conducted designed to assess the effects of the new admissions criteria upon the ethnic composition of the University. It was found that 72 percent of blacks, 20 percent of whites, and 65 percent of Puerto Ricans who were admitted in 1971 would have been excluded had the new admissions criteria then been in effect. Under the original open admissions policy in effect in 1971,  the ethnic composition was as follows: 18 percent black, 72 percent white, and 10 percent Puerto Rican. If the new policy had been effective at that time, the composition would have been 7.5 percent black, 87 percent white, and 5 percent Puerto Rican. In short the minority group enrollment would have been reduced from about 28 percent to 13 percent. Forty-four percent of those who entered with less than the eighth grade reading level in 1971 had either graduated or were still enrolled in CUNY three years later. There were no significant ethnic differences. (Author/JM)",

A reasonably rigorous experimental design was also incorporated in the second year. The projects' purpose was to answer an actuarial question: Can behavior modification solve the referring social problem, which has been analyzed into two sets of behavior, those behaviors which are too high or too low in rate? The central question in this study is whether or not teachers can be trained to use the techniques made available  through behavioral analysis to provide large number of students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds with some modicum of individual success. The emphasis has been on the training preservice and inservice) of teachers in the use of positive behavior modification.

        "description":"The third year of the project, funded under Elementary Secondary Education Act Title III, was essentially a replication of Year Two. Second Year results indicated that the success technique had provided inner-city teachers with both an effective classroom management system, and an effective program for the acceleration of academic performance. Therefore, no major changes were made in the technique during Year Three. To ascertain whether the results of Year Three would indeed replicate the results obtained in Year Two, in class observation (ICO) was continued on a limited basis and achievement testing was again conducted in September and April. The design and procedure for achievement testing in Year Three were essentially the same as for Year Two. However, changes were made in  the procedures for collection of ICO data in order to evaluate hypotheses different from those posed in Year Two. Additional teachers were trained during the summer of 1972 and their classes were added to the research base for Year Three making a total of 20 classes. To assess the effectiveness of the training and the importance of experience as a success teacher, the in-class behavior of the new teachers and of their students was compared to the behavior of the experienced teachers and their students throughout the school year.

Most school districts received allocations under 50,000 dollars. Over one-half of the 378 school districts which offered Title I programs participated in cooperative Title I programs. Some 53,157 children participated in Title I programs; 28 percent of the Title I participants were preschool or kindergarten children, 59 percent were first through fourth graders, 11 percent were fifth through eleventh graders, and two percent were upgraded or in ninth through twelfth grades. More than 75 percent of the children  participating in Title I only took part in a regular year project, 12 percent only participated in a summer project, and another 12 percent took part in both a regular year and a summer project. Approximately 88 percent of the Title I dollar was used for instructional, rather than supportive services. English reading, mathematics, preschool, and kindergarten programs accounted for 81 percent of the monies spent on instructional activities during the regular year, and for 68 percent of the monies spent on instructional activities in the summer. Most Title I expenditures also occurred during the regular school year. (Author/JM)",

Participants in the 21 projects reviewed include dropouts, potential dropouts, and former dropouts. Almost all of the participants are enrolled in public schools. Participation is 21,200 for the regular school term and 2,050 for summer school. Some participants attend both regular and summer sessions. Of the total $8.1 million expended, an estimated $2.5 million is expended for direct  educative services in such areas as English usage arts, culture, and science. Pupil services account for about 21 percent of the total expenditures. This category includes food services, pupil transportation, health services, guidance, counseling, and others. An estimated 31 percent is spent on administration and program development, including general and instructional administration, information dissemination, research and development, planning, evaluation, demonstration, and personnel development. Instructional administration accounts for nearly $1.2 million, and program development for $676,000.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to consider two criticisms which have been directed at the new admissions policy of the City University of New York. First, it is suggested that this policy has the effect of ending open admissions. If open admissions is defined as the provision of access to the university to all high school graduates in New York City, then the new criteria do maintain open admissions. This contrasts with the earlier eighth grade model which clearly would have ended the program. The second assertion made is that the new criteria create an ethically segregated system within the university. The conclusion on this point is more ambiguous. First, the community colleges have, since the very inception of open admissions, contained a larger proportion of minority students  than the senior colleges. If one considers only students not in special programs, the new admissions policy does increase the initial disparity somewhat. On the other hand, if one considers all students including those in SEEK and College Discovery, then it is clear that the new policy does not change the minority group enrollment proportions. The essential conclusion is this: with special program students included, the new model approximates very closely the senior college-community college minority group ratios which existed under the original admissions policy.

This document presents a process by which improvement in the educational enterprise may be sought in a continuing and systematic fashion. Among the topics that are covered are the following:  identifying critical needs, steps in applying for a grant, project development and preparation of project application, processes of administration, fiscal control and management, evaluation, dissemination, and final report. The heart of the PACE program is in its provisions for bringing a creative force to the improvement of schools and for demonstrating that better practices can be applied. Since the innovative and exemplary programs supported by PACE are intended to contribute substantially to educational improvement, priority in funding is given to those projects which offer the greatest promise of solving persistent problems, thereby advancing educational excellence.

Three of the postulated solutions have been implemented in the Cincinnati Public Schools. A secondary objective of the symposium is outlining criteria used in Cincinnati as indicators of success or failure in achieving racial balance. One paper outlines the role of options that permit pupils and parents to select programs that are suitable and attractive, thereby promoting voluntary integration. Another approach is provided by the position taken by those promoting racial balance through the provision of quality education, especially through alternative programs. Criteria used in  Cincinnati's schools to determine the success or failure of racial balance efforts are provided in the next paper which also provides some preliminary data on the achievement of racial balance. A fourth possible perspective, which is not presently being pursued in Cincinnati, is also presented. Here, it is asserted that all strategies for achieving racial balance have a metropolitan context and a metropolitan impact; and that the metropolitan context and impact of any strategy need to be made explicit. An introductory paper addresses itself to policy change as a strategy for racial balance. Three court cases, which racial balance in Cincinnati have been a major issue, are described. (Author/AM)",

A commentary is provided on the nexus between social change in education and other aspects of society and the utilization of busing as a tool of social change. Information is also presented on schools in urban and rural areas status in regard to desegregation and integration. An important perspective of this delineation is whether busing will facilitate social change. To highlight conceptualization of social change as it relates to desegregation, integration and busing time frame charts are presented. The rationale postulated is that commitment is needed from other sectors of society in order to facilitate change. Open housing and adoptation of  schools to desegregate student bodies is suggested as possible strategies along with busing to facilitate social change in education and ultimately the total society. Without meaningful dedication to the goal of integration from other sectors of society, busing alone may be a waste of effort, time and money. Most importantly, the physical and psychological well-being of students may be jeopardized. (Author/AM)",

The instrument of education reveals a structure and a profile with the following components: a design and a structure, a philosophy, a psychology, a system of objectives, a concept as to the nature of man, the structure of subject matter, the relevant versus the irrelevant, a value system, a concept of society, and the product or end result relfecting the utility of the instrument used for behavior modifications of the agents. A subsidiary thesis in this research is that nothing remains the same, and the only certainty is change itself - continual change. The research reviews the strategy  of colonialism and imperialism around 1835 to the present in such countries as Trinidad and Tobago and in all of the British West Indies as reflected in the school curricula. The curriculum is an instrument resulting in a product or outcome which is revealed in the curricula field of the student-centered approach and the society-centered approach culminating in the processes of individualization versus socialization or a capture and rupture of the human mind by imperialistic techniques for economic exploitation.

This approach makes the implicit assumption that, at each step, all previous operations upon the data are both well reasoned and technically correct. As the critique progresses, it becomes obvious to what extent this assumption is incorrect. The first point made concerns the data base used, and, by implication, the range of variables considered for inclusion in the various regression models used. The  second point relates to the unit of analysis employed. Another potential problem concerns the partitioning of the data into two categories based upon school district size. The treatment (or lack of treatment) of the standard errors of the regression coefficients is also criticized. Finally, one of the more misleading of the methodological errors is reflected in the attempt to control for the unique characteristics of the cities through the use of dummy variables. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The significance of the black student union in the past decade (1965-1975), both for black students and for the white college, and some reasons for the apparent decline experienced by black student unions in recent years are the concern of this paper. Its focus is on reviewing some of the functions, activities and impacts of the black student union during its most active years, and reviewing some of the internal factors which seem to have played a role in its current decline. Several functions served by the student unions are suggested. Their goals and change oriented activities center on five general areas and their implementation and impact upon white college vary, both in degree and permanence. Two sets of influences seem important in the apparent decline of black student  union and the black student population and those internal to them; four such internal factors are emphasized in the discussion. A final cautionary note is sounded, indicating that despite apparent decline and a seemingly apolitical stance in many colleges and universities, black student unions have not disappeared, and retain the capacity for renewed vitality and activism.

        "description":"This study is based upon a mailed questionnaire taken from a nationwide sample of adoptive parents, and is part of a larger on-going study of contemporary trends in adoption. A question of interest is that whether those parents who have renounced more traditional conceptions of family life have become more receptive toward \"hard-to-place\" children. It is hypothesized that political conservatism and conventional religiosity would be incompatible with accepting the \"hard-to-place\". This was found to be true only in some cases, such as in the adoption of black children. The findings suggest that those parents in the forefront in assuming more contemporary family life styles are more amendable to parenting minority children. Also suggested is that the kind of child parents choose to  adopt closely reflects their values and institutional commitments. The findings point to a more general need to re-evaluate the criteria employed in placing stigmatized children. For instance, commenting on the reported exclusion of couples with radical politics from the pool of prospective adoptive parents for trans-racial placements; the study suggests that these parents might in fact be among the most appropriate.

        "description":"The black family is the primary socializing agent of the black child and, thus, the primary educator. The culture of blacks in America, in which the child is steeped, is unique, complex and rich-the result of a convergence and fusion of African, American, and European influences. In its education of the black child, the black family must deal, from beginning to end, with questions of racism and with questions deriving from racism. Today, most questions involving race in the raising of children still fall into the two main categories of how to deal with overt and covert racist expressions, and the resolution of questions of racial identity. Prime among the special problems facing the black family is the need to raise its children bi-culturally. The black child's bicultural  experience is one of the ramifications of racism, and it is pivotal in his struggle for racial identity. Also central to the child's bicultural experience is language. The challenge to the black family, as mediator, as educator, is monumental; but its broader structure, its extended family, and its rich heritage can transcend racism, and produce bilingual, bicultural skilled Americans.

        "description":"This thesis is composed of two studies which look at the impact of exposure to schooling on achievement growth of children. Both use data from the National Follow Through Evaluation. The first study investigates the hypothesis that the difference in achievement growth between poor and non-poor children is greater during the summer months than during the school year. This hypothesis is studied with achievement test and background data on approximately 1000 children in kindergarten through second grades from Philadelphia. The data are analyzed in three ways, and the three analyses are seen to produce roughly the same pattern of results. Under each approach, the first grade results provide strong support for the hypothesis, while the second grade results provide moderate support,  with kindergarten results being inconclusive. The second study involves an analysis of data from a small experiment designed to test the hypothesis that participation in a summer program increases achievement growth and that this increase is maintained throughout the following school year. The findings from three of the four programs used are quite similar and indicate that the programs do have a substantial short term effect on achievement, and that a portion of this effect is maintained throughout the following school year.

What follows is an attempt to place urban public schooling within the context of America, 1975. The short era of equal educational experience, in contrast to the two long standing eras of competitive privilege is drawing to an abrupt close unless an immediate change of direction in public policy emerges, as happened in 1954. What is most urgent today is not better urban education but a national full employment policy that guarantees to every high school graduate capable of work, a decent job and wage. Also needed in terms of bearing or early childhood education is a  combination of new preschool programs with an emphasis on the responsibility of parenting. In conclusion, it urged that four specific areas of urban education become focal: parenting as an extension of the preschool movement; a shift from educator preference to schooling objectives; the development of a full employment program; and, relating urban education to the process of life-long learning.

This study further analyzes this important result with the aim of finding useful information for the operation of the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA) which replaced ESAP. Several different approaches to estimate the existence and size of tenth grade black male achievement ESAP effect are utilized. These estimates consistently agree with the direction of the original analysis but consistently show a smaller effect, although not so much lower as to place the effect in a different league. The two analyses agree that the size of the effect is not large but is worth pursuing. The secondary analysis of ESAP high  school data also indicates the effectiveness of teacher race relations training programs and student intergroup relations programs, with student impact primarily upon whites and none upon black males. No convincing explanation of how ESAP improves black male achievement is found. There are suggestions of positive effects of ESAP for white males and mixed efforts for both black and white females. There are no apparent new conclusions leading to suggested changes in federal school desegregation aid programs. (Author/AM)",

No program effects were reported for other groups of students. The analysis reported here accounts for the programs effect on black males. The orientation of this investigation is exploratory and not confirmatory in nature, and this is reflected in all stages of the work. The aim is to search for clues, not clear-cut certainties, about the existence and causes of program success. Basically five issues are addressed as follows: (1) did ESAP alter the racial climate of the funded  schools; (2) are there relationships between student educational performance and non-cognitive variables that are dependent on his race and sex; (3) what did ESAP buy; (4) can teacher and student non-cognitive variables be related to particular educational programs; and, (5) can educational achievement levels be linked to non-cognitive variables and these in turn to educational programs. It is suggested that ESAP changes the attitudes and behaviors of white males and black females in a positive direction. (Author/AM)",

These are the population explosion, the population implosion, and population differentiation. These three developments are interrelated and are affected by accelerating rates of technological and social change. By reason of these developments many problems are created, a highly significant one being that of education. The thesis of this paper is that many of the contemporary problems may be viewed as frictions in a transition still under way from an agrarian society to a metropolitan order. It is contended that education, up to World War II, was a major factor in unifying the nation, but that since then the educational establishment has failed to keep  up--and contributes, not to democracy, but to social stratification. After describing the population developments as manifest in the history of America, the necessity for making both quantitative and qualitative changes in the educational establishment becomes obvious. It is also suggested that the past prevents the solution of educational problems. It is concluded that survival depends in abandoning nineteenth and prior century ideologies and systems of governments. (Author/AM)",

The impact of the mass society and the role of government in the lamentable financial crisis in higher education are also discussed.

The Department's affirmative action plan for 1970 and for each succeeding year has been developed to resolve problems surrounding employment of women, blacks, Hispanics, native Americans, and Asian Americans. A continuing element in the program is its effort to more fully integrate women and minorities into the major occupations of the department. Some major breakthroughs have been achieved to incorporate women and minorities more fully into six key occupations. The  evolution and growth of the strong, vigorous Equal Employment Opportunity Program which the Department of Justice has indicates that, in a period of rapid growth as experienced by this department over the last seven years has increased minority employment at a great rate.

English dominant children, taught in English, receive instruction in Spanish Language Arts. The use of the open classroom permits highly individualized or small group instruction in homogeneous or heterogeneous groupings. The program is exemplary for several reasons. Most important is its equal emphasis on instruction  in both Spanish and English language and culture. The bilingual emphasis eradicates the stigma children from minority groups have traditionally experienced in American education.

Human relations sessions have done a great deal to increase understanding and reduce tension. Through judicious use of various funding sources, the district has initiated a student advocate counseling activity; para professional aides;  an organized community volunteer program; and a monthly newsletter.

In 1968, the 12 elementary schools were divided into K-3 and 4-6 schools in four residential zones with approximately 3500 elementary children who live beyond walking distance being bused to school on average of 15 to 20 minutes each way every day. Since that time the majority of Berkeley's staff, parents and students have worked together in various ways to implement total integration: however, most agree that they have not yet reached this goal. But the efforts to replace tracking with heterogeneous classrooms have met with near total success; the ratios of minority staff in teaching and administrative  positions have increased significantly, and people are tackling the school board's most recent goals dealing with the development of basic skills for minorities and the elimination of institutional racism. While Berkeley schools are desegregated, not totally integrated, they are staffed, studented, and parented with a significant majority of those who seek to develop &quot;total integration&quot; in their community.

        "description":"The Richmond, Virginia Follow Through program is currently in its sixth year of operation in grades kindergarten to three in 12 urban schools. Funded primarily by Educational Opportunity Act Title II funds, the program serves a student population in which the majority of pupils are black and 50 percent are from poor families. The program seeks to improve the learning ability of the child and the education and participation of the parent through a continuous program in which both home and school are integral parts of a single unit. The program provides educational, social and cultural experiences for the child and his family so that the entire environment becomes more conducive to learning. This is done through several methods: the institution of a new kind of paraprofessional,  the parent educator, into the classroom; weekly home visits in which the parent educator collaborates with the parent on an educational task program for the child; field trips for parents and children; the fostering and encouragement of an active Parent Advisory Committee; on extensive, continuous in-service training program; and a multi-level educational component. This program is found to be exemplary for several reasons. (Author/JM)",

The school currently has an enrollment of more than 600 students who range in age from 16 to over 40. The student body is primarily black, male, and from the lower socioeconimic groups. However, the student population also includes whites, women, and a few higher socioeconomic backgrounds. The background of the faculty is as varied as the students. These heterogeneous groups are molded into a cohesive society through the school's over riding principle of diversity in unity. While a traditional college preparatory program is followed, courses are also given that reflect the student's interests and backgrounds. The particular courses are determined jointly  by the students, faculty, and administration. Harlem Prep has created an educational milieu that enables students, whom other schools had labeled &quot;deprived, different, disadvantaged, and disaffected&quot; to achieve and develop. This exemplary program could be replicated elsewhere if administrators, teachers and able students create an atmosphere and expend an effort commensurate with that of Harlem Prep. (Author/JM)",

There are several categories of human resource policy: (1) policies designed to achieve the fullest development of human resources, (2) policies concerned with the optimal allocation of resources, (3) policies concerned with human resource utilization, (4) policies concerned with human resource maintenance and conservation, and (5) policies concerned with maintaining a high level of demand for employment in the economy. A basic relationship exists between human resource policy and vocational education research and development. However, there are several issues that need to be studied.  It is important to know the proper mix of training in and out of school in generating the competence required for various kinds of careers as well as the manner by which the school system can better provide the kinds of labor market information that will allow youth to make rational occupational decisions. There is also the complex task of integrating the entire educational experience in order to achieve all of the objectives that education is designed to serve for all students. (Author/EC)",

Paralegals may be employed by private sector or public sector (Community Services Administration Legal Services and government). Training may be on-the-job training; community college, college and law school, or proprietary school training; or short-term intensive training. Paralegals may be classified as generalists or specialists. Organizations active in the field include: paralegal professional associations, the American Bar  Association, the National Paralegal Institute, the Association of American Law Schools, and the National Consumer Center for Legal Services. Accreditation for paralegal training programs and certification or licensing are current issues in the paralegal movement. (EA)",

The models were tested using a sample from 10 firms participating in the National Alliance of Businessmen (NABS) and the Job Opportunities in the Business Sector (JOBS) programs formed to identify, hire, and train unemployed members of the secondary labor market and to integrate them into the primary labor market. The withdrawal processes were studied using econometric simultaneous equation techniques along with multivariate statistical and probabilistic methods including reliability theory. A simultaneous model of turnover, retention, and absenteeism was developed, in order to investigate the hypothesized relationship between  absenteeism and turnover. It includes the disaggregation of job satisfaction into a number of variables and also the introduction of supervisory variables. The study supports the assumption that turnover and attendance do not have identical determinants. Solely in terms of significance the findings show company policy variables to be the most important determinants of the propensity to terminate. The implications of the findings for hiring and supervisory policies relating to programs attempting to integrate disadvantaged workers are discussed at some length.

        "description":"Management Engineering Teams (MET) were used in the development and testing of a methodology for determining non-aircrew officer grade requirements. The methodology tested was an extension of the Officer Grade Requirements (OGR) procedure developed during the 1963-1966 time period. In the OGR project, a criterion board rated 3,575 officer jobs for grade, then a nine-variable multiple regression equation was developed which efficiently predicted the criterion ratings. In the current application, the METs rated 485 officer jobs from the OGR job sample and 1,687 new jobs. For the 485 job samples, predicted composite scores were obtained from MET ratings utilizing the nine-variable regression equation. These scores were correlated with the criterion board ratings on the same jobs,  producing a validity coefficient of .90. An interrater reliability of .95 on the total 2,172 jobs was obtained for these raters. These results indicate that METs can reliably rate officer jobs for determination of grade and can accurately replicate the criterion board ratings. Recommendations were made for operational implementation and for further research to provide a more stable grade conversion table and to determine the total distribution of non-aircrew officer grade requirements. Research instruments are appended. (Author)",

Because of the diversity of administrators' educational background, more data were needed to establish a systematic basis for program planning. In September, 1973 a questionnaire was mailed to 962 nursing home administrators and supervisory level personnel. Two groups were surveyed: 482 students, who had attended non-credit programs or courses of the Long Term Care Unit and 480 administrators who had not attended any programs. Of the 962 questionnaires mailed, 473 (49%) were returned. The major portion of the document (54 pages) presents  without discussion the survey responses, showing the characteristics of administrators and non-administrators (environmental, personal, and professional), their preferences for further education (bachelor's degree, master's degree, credit courses only, and non-credit courses), and program format preferences. A description of the potential student body for a degree program and implications for planning are derived from the responses. Appended materials include: sample cover letter, the survey form, tabulated responses, a list of administrator degree majors, and a map of Pennsylvania's baccalaureate and masters external degree programs.

Tests for four different levels of achievement are included, with minimum performance standards specified for each level. For all four levels a test is included for timed typing, letter typing, and tabulation. There is a test for manuscript typing for levels two through four, and level four includes a test for typing numbers in context. Alternate forms of each level of test are included to provide for pretests and posttests. Development of the tests involved two testing programs with approximately 2,000 students in over 40 secondary schools and colleges. Data are also provided on the statistical treatment of the tests. Data indicating  student scores on the various exercises will enable the teacher to compare the performance of students on a statewide basis. Standards for scoring timed writings, letters, tables, and manuscripts are also provided. (Author/NJ)",

Results of the evaluation are organized around four major areas of interest: student self-concept, career awareness, student attitudes toward career development, and teacher use of career education resources. Evaluation instruments used with the students were self-observation scales, an Occupation Awareness Survey, and the Career Maturity Inventory (for grades 10-12). Teachers were asked to complete the Career Education Teacher Practices Survey. Detailed in the report are a description of the career education program, the conceptual basis for the evaluation (information based evaluation), test results, a cost analysis, and conclusions and recommendations. The evaluation team recommended that  information gathered should be considered as baseline data for future planning and evaluation, and that continuing structured feedback should be obtained from teachers, students, and the community.

Parent and student occupational aspirations and knowledge of career development principles and planning were investigated with three groups--tutor-parent-student, parent-student, and student. All three groups received guidance materials and school counseling. The first two added direct solicited parental involvement, and the first also received home visits by guidance tutors (graduate students from Utah State University in Logan). Pretests and posttests of all groups revealed no significant differences in career development knowledge, but it appeared that parents had higher aspirations than their children. Recommendations based on  the study data included: (1) establishing a career center at the school, (2) providing career counseling for sophomores in an English program, (3) employing guidance tutors (graduate students from the university) for home visits, (4) holding inservice programs for school faculty, and (5) providing career counseling to sophomore students using career files. About half of the document consists of an appended report on a previous study to ascertain the feasibility of conducting a career information education program with parents of grade 10 students at Logan Senior High School.

After first outlining the background of benefit-cost analysis, problems in establishing cost functions in education are presented along with some important cost concepts and uses of cost information in education. The next section deals with the identification and measurement of societal benefits of vocational programs. Five different methods of analyzing data related to societal costs and benefits of vocational and manpower programs are discussed in the last section. These methods are present value of net benefits, annual value of net benefits, rate of return, benefit-cost ratio, and pay back period. Procedural steps used and the  advantages and disadvantages of each method are given. One of the major problems in establishing societal costs and benefits of vocational programs is the lack of relevant data, consequently, a need exists to develop a management information system for vocational, technical, and adult education. The report concludes that data required for the costs and benefits should be incorporated in a management information system. The required information for implementing various steps in establishing societal costs and benefits is outlined for curriculum, faculty, space, equipment, supplies, and administration. (MF)",

These areas are: improved communication with the general public, greater use of vocational facilities, more involvement in manpower training, greater use of community resources, and more practical use of research and demonstration funds. Specific recommendations and rationales for achieving these objectives are offered. A brief evaluation of vocational education in Kentucky for fiscal year 1975 is presented in terms of enrollment figures, dollars spent, and construction of new facilities. The activities of the  regional advisory committees for the year are generally summarized and a report on the action taken in response to the council's recommendations for the previous year is presented. Appended are tables and charts indicating enrollment in vocational education, sources of funding, and the projected percentage of employment in the State in nine major occupational clusters by 1980.

        "description":"The purpose of the one-year study was to determine the ability of public and private employment agencies to meet the job placement and educational needs of vocationally trained, disadvantaged individuals living in three rural Texas counties. The overall goal was to develop an effective system that would allow for the continuous placement of these individuals in meaningful jobs. The investigation involved collection of data from three groups: vocational education graduates, public and private employment agencies, and employers or potential employers of the vocationally trained population. Questionnaire surveys of stratified random samples of graduates and employers resulted in an analysis of 300 graduates and 72 employer questionnaires. All available employment services were  contacted. Results of the study showed that factors affecting the employment of the vocationally trained were lack of transportation, inadequate vocational preparation, lack of work experience, inadequate pay, and unwillingness to relocate. Employment agencies were found to be not effective in job placement, generally because they were not readily available to the community. Recommendations were made for meeting the job placement needs of the population studied. The report includes a bibliography. Appendixes contain the survey instruments and a map showing placement of employment services in the area. (Author/RG)",

Western Kentucky University, in cooperation with Bowling Green Junior High School, provided a total of 40 hours of planned career exploratory experiences in two occupational areas for 126 ninth grade students. Pretesting and post-testing of participating students and a control group utilized the School Sentiment Index (SSI), Career Maturity Inventory (CMI), and Ohio Vocational Interest Survey (OVIS). Three evaluations were conducted, two by external evaluators  and one by a member of the project staff. Data for the internal evaluation were obtained from questionnaire surveys of students, parents, work experience sponsors, teachers, and the principal and counselor. Program costs were compared to the cost of establishing career exploration/practical arts programs. Based on data collection, analysis of test results, and the evaluation surveys, conclusions and recommendations were formulated. Eleven appendixes include project forms, student evaluation instruments, school sentiment index, and the two external evaluation reports. (RG)",

Following a literature review, collection of data from schools and employers, and assessment of guides in current use, articulation advisory committees were formed. Although interest was high in the group, signed articulation agreements were not achieved. Curriculum guides were developed and field tested for  five vocational areas: air conditioning/refrigeration, drafting occupations, electronics, nursing occupations, and office occupations. Evaluation results are shown for each of the three institutional levels, and 80% of the 153 instructors said that they would use the guides. Revised guides were disseminated in the State.

Survey data were collected from interviews with State personnel and from questionnaires completed by secondary school and junior college administrators, instructors, and students at 15 secondary and eight postsecondary schools. School AVE enrollment, instructional, and funding statistical data are reported in tables, figures, and narrative. In general AVE was evaluated as a successful learning experience by all of the participants. However, the student questionnaires rated AVE significantly lower than either the  administrators or instructors. Contrary to State planners' previous assumptions, findings indicated that the junior college commitment to and involvement in AVE is significantly lower than that of the secondary school, due to lower reimbursement for noncredit courses. The flexible scheduling of AVE is acceptable but lack of adequate student personnel services weakens the program improvement based on the data collection.

Focus is on services for adult law offenders in penitentiaries and on parole, the juvenile justice system, and court services in the pretrial, probation, jail, and work release areas. Planning issues and methodologies are reviewed, and a recommended program plan for fiscal year 1976 is presented. Review of the current system indicates that manpower services are not delivered in adequate scale or quality  to meet the needs of Illinois law offenders. A basic services model was therefore developed, stressing community-based services for clients not yet institutionalized and reintegrative services for those in corrective institutions, with emphasis on screening and referral, work release, practical diversion, training and job placement, and other manpower vocational services.

The project was designed to assist graduating seniors of four high schools and those exiting prior to graduation. In meeting the project goal the following activities were carried out: an advisory board and separate advisory committees in each high school were established, a listing of local educational opportunities was compiled, the Strong Vocational Interest Blank and the General Aptitude Test Battery were administered, and interviews were conducted with each student. The goal of placing all students was not attained; only an estimated 50% were placed. Objectives attained to varying degrees were: helping students  reconcile post high school ambitions with existing educational programs, ascertaining prospective employers' suggestions for curriculum modification, and providing teachers with staff development activities to help them relate curricular offerings to occupations. Results of a student evaluation are appended, along with an evaluation report which discusses project accomplishments in terms of objectives and offers possible explanations and solutions to the problems encountered.

        "description":"Summarized in the 13-page report are the goals, objectives, procedures, accomplishments, and problems in implementing the Montgomery County (Alabama) three-year career education pilot project. Emphasis has been on integration of career education in the regular classroom as the most effective means of teacher and student involvement. Of career education activities, 90% were subject-related and relevant to the course content. These included hands-on activities, simulation games and skits, use of resource people, audiovisuals, written exercises, and onsite observations. The largest problem encountered was acceptance and commitment of teachers to career education. Inclusion of new pilot schools required orientation of most of the teaching staff in the project. This was accomplished  by an initial workshop followed by monthly inservice, distribution of a career education newsletter, and use of a monthly report to determine teacher involvement and assess progress in career education activities. Appendixes (21 pages) include inservice materials, sample lesson plans for career education activities, copies of the newsletter and monthly teacher report, and results of a pretest and post-test teacher opinion survey on career education.

Implementation strategy included the following activities: (1) appointment of project personnel, including a full-time placement coordinator; (2) implementation of career education and occupational guidance in the six participating schools through teacher inservice and information dissemination; (3) establishment or revision of school advisory committees to assist in data collection, student screening, and other areas; (4) special emphasis on involvement of potential dropouts in work-study programs; and (5) identification of the community and area resources capable of  providing employment opportunities. Results of the program included the placement of 19 unemployed adults, and college placement of 18 persons by assisting them to secure financial aid. Accomplishments indicate that the program is workable; the greatest need is community awareness to stimulate the hiring of students for paying jobs.

A list of vocational education research areas was developed as a survey questionnaire and administered to 244 professional staff members of the seven postsecondary vocational-technical institutions in the State. One hundred and forty-nine (61%) were returned. Responses were analyzed question-by-question for each of five areas: needs for vocational education, curriculum development, instructional learning processes, student development and needs, and administration of vocational education. The responses are first reported by question according to institution, and following that, the highest priority  responses for each of the five areas are reported, reflecting the following concerns: labor market requirements; assessment of educational needs of 16-18 year olds; development of new programs from emerging technologies; relating preparation competencies to job entry; development of multimedia instructional approaches; vocational counseling and followup; provision for advanced placement; and exploration of the role of the vocational, technical, and adult education system within postsecondary education.

This paper sketches one large-scale attempt to do just that in the development of managers in a large, multicompanied, international service corporation. This paper recounts the initial efforts to plan, implement, and evaluate a three-year longitudinal program of personal and organizational development and to present data and tentative conclusions about the effectiveness of the program two years after its inception. The main feature of this program is the concept of developmental need. After careful assessment, a list of developmental needs is prepared for each manager involved in the program. The goal is to have these need statements serve as a prescription for an individualized management  development program. The management program consists of four states of developmental programming. The criterion for change or development is the degree to which managers close their development gap as deisgnated by their developmental needs. Partially tabulated results after two years suggest that the program is effecting positive change. Whereas this is a report of the first phase of the longitudinal project, additional materials concerning the project will not be available for at least three years. (Author)",

The writer developed a group testing strategy which is concerned with ways students learn as well as subject matter testing. This evaluation strategy used successfully in high school and college classes is based on group work principles as applied in the classroom. This paper deals with group size, determination of group membership, and cohesive task centered groups. While this paper does not claim the test anxious student will eventually perform better on individual paper and pencil tests, the evidence suggests that students generally, improve test performance when group testing strategies are used.

Ninety-three of these persons were employed by and assumed responsibilities in the Foster Grandparent program at the local state school for the mentally retarded, while the other 36 respondents were members of a local chapter of the American Association of Retired Persons. The original Neulinger and Breit questionnaire was modified for administration to the elderly, in accordance with difficulties evidenced in a pilot study of this instrument's application with the elderly. The data were factor analyzed using a principle component method and a varimax rotation to five factors being in good agreement with the findings of Neulinger and Breit  (1969, 1971) and were so named; Amount of Work or Vocation Desired; Amount of Perceived Leisure; Self-Definition through Leisure or Work; Affinity for Leisure; and Society's Role in Leisure Planning. In comparing both groups' responses to the items which comprise these five leisure attitude dimensions, the latter group evidenced a stronger self-definition oriented toward work rather than leisure. It is recommended that the usage of the schedule be restricted to research. (Author)",

Results indicated that subjects motivated by the intrinsic or social factor showed less ego-bias in their causal attributions than extrinsically-motivated subjects.

The second paper examines the alternative strategies open to voluntary agencies depending on the societal context, from a U.S. viewpoint. It puts forth a strong case for the voluntary sector's leading a revolution in social values which will result in qualitative improvements in the lives of  elderly people. Moreover, agencies should do their best to direct the forces of social change into constructive rather than destructive channels. (Author/SE)",

All subjects were administered the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale for Children. Both treatment groups were divided into categories of high and low socioeconomic status and high and low IQ using a 2x2x2 factorial design to analyze the data. The data indicated that there was no significant difference between the open school group and the traditional school group in mean self-concept scores, thus not supporting the theory that an open educational philosophy promotes a more positive self-concept than a traditional educational  philosophy. However, simple interaction analysis of the joint effects seemed to imply that children from a high socioeconomic area seem to benefit more from a school that practices an open educational philosophy, in terms of self-concept, than children from a low socioeconomic area.

It is hoped that the report will be useful to schools in determining the emphasis which guidance services should be giving to career education. The survey sampled 3,690 students from 46 metropolitan Toronto secondary schools. The major finding were: (1) over half the sample had at least &quot;fairly specific&quot; career plans; (2) three in five students attached high importance to consideration of their interests and satisfaction of personal needs; (3) a large majority preferred learning about careers through talking to people in the field, practical job experience, and visiting institutions; and (4) over a third were dissatisfied  with career information and help provided by their schools. The paper makes a number of suggestions for actions designed to improve career education in schools. (NG)",

Experimental and control groups were compared. Measures used were subjects' videotaped role plays; audiotaped counselor sessions; and supervisor self and client ratings. Doctoral students rated the skill acquisition and global effectiveness. The skills training program was expected to show that the counseling practicum students trained in four selected counseling  skills would demonstrate a significantly greater gain in these skills than students in the conventional counseling practicum. Also, the researcher expected that practicum students trained in the specific skills approach would demonstrate significantly greater counseling effectiveness on selected global measures than students in the conventional counseling practicum. The results of this study warrant further research concerning the implementation of systematic skills training for counseling practicum students. (Author/NG)",

The program has been in effect since 1968, and the data seem to indicate that students whose parents had been involved in the program had better chances of completing a post high school education and were more satisfied with their past educational majors and  present occupational choice than were those students whose parents had not been so involved.

Wells pointed out that \"human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.\" In the next two decades we must rely even more on education, training, human resource development, and effective counseling to keep our commune of creatures working together with harmony and purpose. However, if counselors are going to be in a position to make this contribution, some significant changes in perspectives and perceptions must come about. To be successful agents of change in the future, counselors will find it necessary to join force with people in the world of work in a very direct and real sense. The new career options for counselors during the 1970's and l980's will be a shift from academic counseling in educational settings to a much more broadly-based  counseling activity dealing with people of all ages in all walks of life and will be conducted in the classrooms of the real world, namely offices, factories, and homes where most of the people in our society work and live. The program explores some of the inroads that are already being made in industry and specifically details a program developed by the Smith-Carona Corporation in their laboratory facility in Cortland, N.Y.

Career development at Firelands involves the dean's office, admissions office, veterans affairs office, placement office, and faculty (both technical and general studies). As a result, innovative programs are initiated that extend beyond the campus to include industries and businesses in a three-county area. Students develop realistic decision-making skills by participating in recruitment at county fairs and festivals, serving on vital campus committees, and are voting members of a Planning Team, a unique campus-wide council which reviews the mission and goals of  Firelands Campus, approves budget requests, and reviews departmental objectives and needs. Administrators visit area industries and businesses to explain various academic programs, faculty members are part of a team that visit area high schools, more than 50 leaders of local businesses and industries serve as advisers on academic committees, and faculty are involved in placement resources for Firelands graduates. This team approach has resulted in a greater sensitivity to realistic career decision-making as part of the total educational process rather than a counseling process. (Author)",

Special emphasis is placed on personal and environmental characteristics which tend to cause bias, such as a counselor's mother's educational attainment, the demographic location of the counselor's work setting, the sex and age of  the counselor, client dependency, and client deviate or conforming career goals. The paper concludes with a discussion about the value, significance, and reliability of the findings, and a brainstorming session on ways to end this bias, which is usually nonmalicious, unconscious, and prevalent throughout our culture.

Developing a course such as this has involved securing approval and encouragement from university administration who trust faculty judgment but who are under community pressure to eliminate \"sick sex.\" The approach involves team teaching by two persons who publicly espouse divergent life values. To achieve a pluralistic approach the interpersonal relationship between the two instructors who have had little in common, except for the interest in teaching sexuality, had to evolve from one of tolerance, through risk, openness, acceptance, and finally to love. Beginning the teaching term by using a  value positioning exercise the difference in values but the acceptance of the difference is modeled for the students. Throughout the course through the presentations the sociological content is viewed by one in alternate lifestyles as well as a person who lives the style that is traditionally established through legal and social supports. Student journal reflections provide the feedback on affective growth and learning; explicit media materials add an important dimension. (Author)",

Twelve women, ages 22 to 53, participated in the assertive training program. Participants received six training sessions consisting of stimulus film vignettes; behavior rehearsal; peer, video, and trainer feedback; homework assignments; trainer and peer group support. Participants were compared with a group of 20 Ss who did not request assertive training and who were unaware of the assertive training program. Fifteen males and five females comprised the comparison group. The age range of the comparison group was 22 to 53, and all comparison Ss possessed at least a BA degree. Participants in the assertive training program improved significantly in their reported assertive  behavior from pretesting to posttesting. Also, assertive training participants were significantly lower in reported assertive behavior than comparison group members prior to training, but participants were no different than comparison group members on completion of training.

Project SCHOOL operates as a dropout prevention program in grades 1-12. Teachers and counselors, using a locally developed check list and other materials, identify 120-150 students they feel are potential dropouts. The objective of the project was to significantly reduce the dropout rate in the Rawlins Public Schools. One of the major facets of the program was to enlist support in both the school and community to bring available resources to bear in an attempt to increase the holding power of the public schools. These students are scheduled into special counseling sessions one hour  per week. The parents are contacted individually and asked to attend a two-hour discussion group conducted by a qualified counselor once every two weeks. Both groups are small enough so that those attending feel free to discuss their problems. High interest guidance materials are made available to both parents and students. Parents are encouraged to become interested in the school, and their child's progress and any special problems that may exist. The students receive an incentive award for attending their counseling session and for getting their parents to attend the evening sessions. The incentive awards consist of tickets for local entertainment establishments and drive-in restaurants. Inservice training sessions were conducted for the project counselors and the teachers who were to  be involved in the selection of the students. (Author)",

The faculty initially carried the major responsibility for operating and refining the program. Recently, however, students began taking a more active interest in the operation of the project until today, students not only run the project, but provide the major force for innovative change. The faculty have assumed the role of consultants, allowing students to carry the responsibility for further development and improvement of the program. Undergraduate student  researchers have been hard at work developing new methods of remediation, small group seminars, procedures for monitoring staff performance, a supportive social environment for serious students, and other components of a comprehensive educational program. we have found that students, when provided with proper training and given the opportunity, are very capable of operating and continually improving an innovative educational program.

Level of need achievement was found to be significantly related to chronological age, with the highest scores obtained by women 35 to 50. Sex role views were not related to need to achieve except in women twenty years old and younger; young women holding contemporary views of woman's role tended to express high need to achieve. Level of need achievement was also related to the level of education already achieved and the level of education hoped for. Only 35% of the women in this study expressed fear  of success; women holding traditional views of sex roles were most likely to show fear of success. Women in the two highest SES groups showed more fear of success than did women in the lower SES categories. Motive to avoid success was also related to women's stage in the family cycle, with single women expressing the most fear of success. (Author)",

It is argued that powerlessness associated with the female role may be responsible for women's elevated risk of psychological disorder. Second, the paper considers the extent to which psychotherapy is a vehicle for reducing women's powerlessness. It is noted that only a few therapies focus on increasing clients' power. A study of therapists suggested that male therapists with strong power orientations may seek out female clients. Furthermore, therapists with strong power orientations are more likely to endorse therapist-client sexual contact in the treatment situation. The need for more extensive study ofpower in psychotherapy is  underscored by the seriousness of the issues. (Author)",

Subjects were observed according to their ease of excitability and extinction in the haptic and visual modalities. Set patterns were examined at different age levels to determine if there was any trend from one age to another. The findings support those of Uznadze's in that excitability is a distinguishing feature in all children. Although the subjects did not vary in rate of excitation haptically and visually, there were significantly different rates in the number of trials it took before extinction took place. The data indicate that, as subjects increase in age, there is a drop in the number of assimilative illusions in both modalities. The study demonstrated that there are  significant age differences in the way children develop and maintain sets, particularly in the haptic modality. The study suggests that the development of set has little meaning outside the context of the physiology of the nervous system and its relation to maturation and the learning of cognitive operations.

Analysis of covariance showed program significance at .001 level on career maturity. Posttest decision making scores increased, significance was noted with one academic and three nonacademic groups.

The monograph attempts to demonstrate the degree to which the structured group movement has matured and enhanced the ability of helping professionals to help people resolve both existing problems and developmental needs. The monograph presents the theoretical basis for structured groups and the critical  elements in their design. Three major categories of structured groups (life skills, life theme, and life transition groups), their core components, and models for their development and implementation are described. Specific examples of activities for skill development are presented for each structured group. The issue of deployment of resources in utilizing these approaches, and future needs and directions for employing structured developmental groups are also discussed.

In the first chapter the authors describe why schools need to change, and suggest the part that those who provide guidance and pupil personnel services can play. The second chapter explains schools as social systems and describes some group processes through which work is accomplished in schools. Examples and tools appear in the third chapter, while the fourth chapter presents guidelines for facilitating  change. The authors suggest trends for the future in the final chapter and conclude with an annotated bibliography for further reading. (Author)",

In the first experiment, retention was assessed by a recognition method, and in the second experiment, it was measured by cued or primed recall. In the first experiment, high predictability and simple sentences resulted in significantly better recognition of old sentences at both the zero and 48 hour retention intervals. Transformational complexity was not significant, active and passive sentences being recognized equally well. The detection of word  changes did not change over the 48 hour retention interval. In the cued recall experiment, high predictability and simple sentences again resulted in significantly better recognition at both time intervals. Another result which paralleled one from the first experiment was the relatively high level of recall of simple unpredictable sentences compared with complex unpredictable ones. The relationship of the findings to various theories of memory for sentences is discussed. (MKM)",

Subjects' miscues or reading errors were analyzed according to the criteria Goodman and Burke established for the Reading Miscue Inventory. The subcategories under the categories of graphic similarity, sound similarity, grammatical function, grammatical relationships, and comprehension were analyzed for each reader. Some of the results indicated that braille  readers applied phonic cues more efficiently than did visual readers, while they did not apply grammatical and semantic cues as efficiently as did sighted readers. Braille readers' miscues caused a greater loss of comprehension than did visual readers' miscues. (MKM)",

This study reports on the development of a word analysis test which evaluates potential teachers' ability to apply nine structural analysis generalizations before and after instruction in word analysis. The tests were administered to 83 students enrolled in teacher education courses in basic reading skills before instruction in syllabication was introduced and after such instruction was completed. Analysis of the data in this study indicated that definite gains can be made in raising the proficiency level of students' syllabication skills after systematic instruction in these generalizations. Pre-testing with a measurement tool that  was designed to be a specific diagnostic aid as well as a general evaluative test proved to be of assistance to the instructors and to the individual students in directing emphasis for teaching and learning. A multiple choice form of the test was found to be as useful as a form which required students to syllabicate the words themselves. (MKM)",

A technique which is used in miscue research to evaluate a reader's comprehension of written material is called the retelling. The reader's retelling of a story or passage provides information about his or her ability to derive meaning from what was read. In addition, student responses to teacher questions posed during the retelling can provide feedback so that the teacher can examine and analyze the comprehension questioning techniques. The retelling is divided into two portions, the unaided retelling and the aided or directed retelling, each of which is described in detail. When readers use their own experiential backgrounds to interpret any written  material, reading becomes personalized and meaningful. In this context, reading is an active process with the reader as participant. (TS)",

Fifty-six first grade students and sixty-three fifth graders were tested. The children individually read sixty words from flash cards presented by the examiner. Each word had up to one-third of its letters deleted in either the initial, middle, or final position. The words chosen were controlled for grade level, imagery rating, and consonant to vowel ratio. The findings showed that both first graders and fifth graders depend more upon the first part of a word than the other parts in reading. Fifth graders were consistently more accurate than first graders in recognizing words with  any deletion pattern. On the basis of this study, it is evident that early reading instruction should focus the child's attention on the individual letters and their correspondence to pronunciation of English.

In two research studies students were asked questions at two levels of comprehension. Their responses were tape recorded, analyzed, and compared. It was found that comprehension questions asked at the higher cognitive level elicited answers that were significantly longer than the answers to the questions asked at the lower comprehension level. The study determined that the effectiveness of  comprehension questions to stimulate higher cognitive processes can be evaluated by analyzing the language children use in answering the questions according to the number of words of the communication unit.

Each read a single version of both passages, recorded time to read, wrote free recalls of both versions, and then answered a series of probe questions. The community college subjects recalled less of the passages; recalled only isolated pieces of information; and produced recalls which were greatly affected by the presence or absence of explicitly stated logical and relative relations. The Cornell subjects recalled the passages more completely; tended to recall more  whole propositions or inter-propositional units; and produced recalls that were not affected by the textual manipulations. It was concluded that logical and relative relations between propositions are part of memory for text, and that the Cornell subjects reflect a population of truly-fluent readers while the community college subjects reflect a population of non-so-fluent readers.

The ten children in the experimental group received instruction from graduate students through the use of games, teacher-made materials, and commercially prepared materials in addition to reinforcement of positive behaviors by verbal and written praise, self-monitoring of progress,  and hardware such as an audio recorder. Standard instruction with no attempt at reinforcement was provided for a group of ten control subjects. Analysis of data after ten hours of instruction indicated that remediation of specific reading deficiencies is improved through the use of behavior modification techniques.

Data was gathered on book completion, interest, and difficulty assessments. An additional factor in the study was the readability match category. These data were compared between book types. The scores from the total group of books were also analyzed between completion and interest; completion and difficulty assessments; completion and readability match categories; interest and difficulty assessments; interest and readability match categories; and difficulty assessments and readability match  categories. Some of the findings indicated that there is no significant difference in the third-grade remedial reader's responses to book completion or book interest for series books compared with picture books; the series books had more difficulty assessments that were \"too easy\" and the picture books had more difficulty assessments that were \"just right\"; and books above the pupil's reading level according to the readability match were frequently rated as \"just right\" in difficulty by the pupils.

A positive sex role identification would include a recognition that each sex can show emotion, protect one's feelings, cry when something is truly moving, or be aggressive physically and mentally. Examples of sex stereotyping include expecting girls to be more obedient, boys to be chivalrous, boys to work the audiovisual materials machines, and girls to do the cleaning. Teachers are asked to search their own feelings about traditional male and female roles such as which parent should have  major responsibility for childcare, which parent should be smarter or more successful economically, and which sex would they prefer to have as a boss. Ideas for increasing more positive sex role identification include values clarification activities, advertising studies, career education studies, and literature analysis at different levels. (MKM)",

While the language of the middle class child is probably not an important concern in the choice of reading methods or the selection of word lists, it does have relevance for the procedures to be used within a given method. Specific suggestions for classroom teachers of middle class children concerning the introduction of words in reading include extending children's oral language, utilizing peer conversations, arousing interests, developing a literature program, making use of context clues in literature, emphasizing the relationship of the spoken to the written word, implementing word lists,  becoming aware of the language used in instruction, and teaching respect for the diversity of dialects in our culture.

Accountability levels were defined from low to high as follows: use of the regular first-grade reading program without supplementation; the regular program plus a supplementary system including instructional objectives, regular assessment and remedial exercises, and objectives-keyed pupil performance records for each of the fifteen instructional units in the program; the second condition plus either a pacing schedule or reporting of unit  scores to the school principal; and the second condition plus both pacing and reporting. A 45-item criterion test based on the major objectives of the reading program was individually administered at the end of the school year.

Sixty-two children were tested, interviewed, and observed. Each child was shown a photograph of a word in its natural setting and was asked what it said. The same question was repeated using a drawing representing the photograph, then the printed word symbol in a simple context, and finally the printed word symbol in isolation. Words used in sentences tested the child's recognition of words in total context. Results led to the conclusions that learning to read is as natural  as learning to talk and that reading is a natural outgrowth of language development and is not entirely dependent upon the phonetic property of the printed symbol.

In the second study, two lists of target items and cues representing complementary and similarity relationships were constructed and presented verbally to third graders, sixth graders, and college students. The results of this experiment indicated that complementary and similarity did not represent unique dimensions that were used differentially.  Subjects of all ages were using similarity cues better in accessing recall. In the third experiment, preference for clustering dimensions was assessed for the same age groups using complementary and similarity relationships as a within-list effect. No evidence was found for any age group to indicate that one dimension was spontaneously chosen or preferred over the other dimension in forming clusters during free recall. It was concluded that a complementary-similarity shift in bases of memory organization with age is unlikely. (MKM)",

One hundred three kindergarten children participated in a study of assisted reading to test the validity of this hypothesis. Ten teachers, trained in treatment methods, were the sole administrators of the program. Results indicated that generally, for pupils of high, medium, and low ability, a supplementary period of instruction in experimental treatment methods produced a  greater increase in reading behavior than a comparable exposure to more formal and phonetically oriented instruction. In addition, those children in the experimental group were more able to use their set for diversity, or the ability to process diverse kinds of sentences than were controls. (KS)",

Described in this paper are techniques for helping elementary school children build writing skills by using literature selections as models for expression. Through imitation, pupils can utilize story patterns provided by literature models to create group stories as well as individual stories and poems. Similarly, literature can provide a model for sentencing, in which children achieve a sense of the structure and sequence of clear communication. Finally, stories and poems can be used to encourage vocabulary development. Specific literature selections and teaching techniques are delineated.

Because teachers have experienced an elementary school setting in which free reading was discouraged, and because teachers teach as they were taught, this trend continues. The need for a second reading course at the undergraduate level is clearly apparent. Teaching in the content area of children's literature can be accomplished by the extension of the student teaching experience to a full day. Preservice students can work with small groups of children experiencing difficulty in reading, facilitating free reading and directed reading, and exposing the children to the listening experience.

Items described as organization and management concerned getting the children's attention, introducing the lesson, calling on children, and meeting individual learning needs within the groups. Items included under the second category, responding to children's answers, suggested appropriate teacher behavior when a child does not respond, when the child's answer is incorrect, and when the child is correct, and commented on praise and criticism. In the experiment, teachers in nine schools were divided into three groups:  treatment-observed, in which ten teachers were instructed in the 22 principles and were observed once a week for most of the year; treatment-unobserved, in which seven teachers were instructed in the 22 principles but were not subsequently observed; and control-observed.

Sustained silent reading, oral reading once a week to the teacher, bookselling, and skills work in small groups or individual work with materials such as SRA kits were some of the activities utilized in the personalized reading program. The program in the P.K. Yonge Laboratory School was investigated regarding achievement, self-esteem, and social acceptance gains and their interrelations. Treatment group, sex, and race were the three independent variables. Results indicated that the personalized  reading program students had higher gains on reading tests in grades two and four and comparable levels in grades three and six. The control group had higher reading test scores in the first grade, while the experimental group had higher scores on self-esteem and social acceptance. In subsequent grades, these measures increased for experimental females, control males, and experimental whites. (MKM)",

Basic skill number two requires the teacher to permit, or force, as the case may be, students to actively pursue their own education. The end result of basic skill number three should be for students to be acutely aware of what is logical and what is illogical. The abilities to analyze and synthesize represent skills number four and five, respectively. Other important skills for teachers include: helping students develop a writing style, helping  students discover who they are and that they have something to say, and helping students to establish a pattern of living which is intellectual. It is suggested that the most basic skill is the ability to create. Accordingly, the ultimate goal of the teacher should be to help all students fulfill their potential to be articulate, sensitive, confident and creative persons. (LL)",

Regardless of how innovative or unique methods of teaching language and communication promise to be or how instructive and enlightening curriculum workshops or institutes may be, unless teachers soften negative attitudes toward dialect and dialect speakers, it is doubtful that any meaningful progress toward facilitating language teaching, learning, and use can be successfully effected. Teachers need to be aware that many linguists consider Black English to be a different, highly structured, and fully developed linguistic system with an internal consistency and  regularity in its phonological, grammatical, and semantic components. While many students want to learn standard English for academic and professional reasons, many consider their black dialect valuable for their personal and group communicative, expressive, and identity needs.

A national survey consisted of a structured questionnaire mailed to a stratified, random sample of newspapers selected by circulation size. Analysis of responses from 149 managing editors (46% of those queried) shows that 41% of the newspapers surveyed have newshole policies which set aside a minimum number of column inches for news each day regardless of advertising load; that 91% of the managing editors consider their paper's newshole policy to be adequate; that, however, the majority of managing editors frequently need to negotiate for additional space after the newshole is filled; that the  proportion of space set aside for nonadvertising content has changed little in recent years; that those using a fixed minimum system for determining newshole size tend to be larger circulation papers which rank higher on a news potential index than papers using other systems; and that although the fixed minimum is the most popular method for determining newshole size, the number of papers using it has recently decreased.

Findings of the study indicate that the Chinese Communist revolutionary plays deal mostly with the salvation factor, which advocates the full dedication of the masses to the revolutionary causes; that traditional plays are mostly concerned with the family security factor, which stresses the importance of family love, individual  rights, and human feelings; and that the traditional opera functions for social control, while the revolutionary opera works for social change.

Using the GALILEO metric MDS program, judgments were scaled and plotted in three-dimensional space. The three hypotheses were confirmed: (1) the structure produced by a criterion pair involving the extremes of the concept domain was statistically identical to the structure produced by the same scale with no concept anchors; (2) as the distance between the criterion pair was increased, the judgments of distances among concepts increased but the pattern remained the same; (3) a criterion pair that was close together produced a larger structure than an extreme pair,  yet concept interrelationships remained stable. These results are discussed in terms of the subject's ability to use metric MDS and of the reliability and validity of the technique. (Author/AA)",

This paper demonstrates the feasibility of effects research that is free from this assumption and focuses on diversity in agenda holding within the community as the main criterion variable. To illustrate this type of research, secondary analyses of two bodies of archived survey data are presented. Communities are grouped according to their comparative media richness, as indicated by the number of competing newspapers published in each locale. Both  the mean number of problems mentioned per person and the entropy in the distribution of problems across a set of categories are higher in communities with competing daily newspapers.

        "description":"This paper empirically evaluates the proposition that political conformism, specifically structural, passive, psychological, and defensive conformism, is a function of exposure to mass media. Secondary analysis of data from the National Opinion Research Center's 1975 General Social Survey revealed a significant relationship between TV viewing and conformism. The 484 heavy viewers were less active and interested in political affairs and had greater apprehension in regard to interpersonal and national relations than did the 650 light viewers. However, education weakened the correlation between viewing and passive and psychological conformity, and in the small nonwhite sample none of the four aspects were related to television viewing. There was no support for the hypothesis that  heavy viewers generally approve existing political policies. In fact, the heavy viewers favored more government action to change social structure than did light viewers. Researchers suggest more attention to routine television viewing as a variable in political attitudes. (Author/KS)",

        "description":"In this paper, the possibility of a bidirectional relationship between mass media use and political participation and a possible interaction of sex with other model variables are examined. A Two-Stage Least Squares analysis explores the mutual causation of mass media use and political participation, and separate analyses for male and female respondents explore the sex interactions. Data are from a 1971 survey of North Carolina. Mass media use is shown to have an effect on political participation in both the male and female subsamples. Political activity has a positive return effect on media use in the female subsample only. Results indicate that models which specify media use as a unidirectional cause of participation behavior are probably incorrect. Since empirical observations  can lead to accurate inferences about the nature of a system only when the causal model is correctly specified, this analysis suggests wider use of techniques which allow the investigation of nonrecursive relationships.

One group saw a brief fight scene portrayed as a news story in a simulated TV newscast, while a second group saw the same scene presented as a movie preview during a commercial break. The primary dependent variable was hypothetical situational aggressiveness, measured with self-report hierarchical response scales. The reality treatment produced significantly more aggression than the fantasy treatment; both types of violence significantly increased aggression above the baseline for the non-exposed control condition. Interaction analyses indicated that the perceived reality of the presentation was the key factor facilitating effects on  aggression. The findings suggest that realistic televised violence is more disinhibiting than fictional violence and that TV news programs have a distinct potential for producing aggressive behavior among young viewers.

Interviews were used to obtain their attitudes toward a number of issues as well as their perception of the attitudes of other undergraduates. Results from the 1971-1973 panel indicate that congruency is causally prior to agreement and that incongruency leads to opinion seeking and opinion giving. Congruency is also related to high levels of media use, increased political activity, non-Republican party affiliation, and movement toward the dominant political values on campus. Results from the 1973-1975 panel show a curvilinear relationship between incongruency and newspaper public affairs use, peer discussion, political label, and political interest; this is, in part, the result of  confounding between incongruency and other variables related to change. The contingent variables, expectation to change and political label, produce changes in the strength and direction of relationships between incongruency and the dependent variables. (Author/AA)",

One hundred seventy-two individuals were contacted with a mail questionnaire: 34 completed an initial TV viewing log in which they kept track of their viewing for a three-day period, 86 completed a second log, and 52 finished both logs. While cable TV increased the number of available programs, the five additional channels provided more redundancy than variety. Data revealed that the expansion of available viewing choices was associated with the pattern of conscious intentions (motives) that people have for watching television. Two sets of motivational schema were defined: one type refers  to motives initiating viewing and includes media-seeking, program content-seeking, generic content-seeking, information-seeking, and a mixture of motives; the second refers to decisions to continue watching subsequent programs and includes continuation media-seeking, program content-seeking, criteria content-seeking, and watching the \"least objectionable\" programs. Enlarged viewing availability was also linked to types of programs chosen and maximization of interests. (Author/KS)",

The emphasis by UNESCO in recent years on national communication policies is related to this concern. One important justification offered for focusing attention on communication policies has been their impact on development efforts. Certain mass communication policies at the national level will affect the success or failure of efforts at economic development. Analysis of available data suggests that a basic role of high centrality of mass communication information control in development is one of coordination of system units within relatively homogeneous and small nations. For such nations, centrality is moderately associated with economic growth. For large and heterogeneous  countries, centrality of control appears to be unrelated to rate of economic development, or even to assume a negative relationship. Though further research is needed to confirm initial impressions, policy makers should carefully consider the interactions of present and proposed policies with national functional and structural characteristics.

By linking the results of the INDSCAL analysis with content attributes suggested by prior research, a parsimonious four-dimensional mapping is identified. This cognitive mapping is virtually identical for children at three different stages of cognitive development. Further, dimensions identified are strong predictors of the children's desires to model the social behaviors of the TV characters. The dimensions identified and discussed include those of feminine  attractiveness, buffoonery, masculine strength, and activity. The findings also indicate that young boys and girls use the same dimensions in markedly different ways. (Author)",

This may be a result of the textbook presentation of grammar as a straightforward set of rules to be mastered without discussing the incredible complexity of the language and acknowledging the students' internalized knowledge of linguistic rules. In order to give the students more confidence in their own linguistic abilities, the author devised an exercise consisting of a series of five sets of four sentences, each involving highly complex rules of pronominalization. For example, the first set of sentences requires that the students choose the sentence or  sentences in which more than one person is referred to. Through class discussion, students attempt to construct a set of rules to explain their choice. Students then discover that they can understand pronominalization even though they have not received direct instruction in that aspect of grammar. (MKM)",

The sixth project was a Visiting Artists program and did not involve student teachers, but focused on pupils and teachers working with a poet. The  Northwest Project brought poets to secondary schools in this area of Connecticut, and the Connecticut Poetry Circuit enabled poets to read their work at several colleges and provided a forum for student-poet readings.

The theoretical background is reviewed and the mathematical derivation of the hypothesis is given. A set of fifteen nations was scaled by 64 undergraduate and graduate students in communication classes at a large university using Woelfel's Galileo system of multidimensional scaling. Experimental messages were introduced and the posttest interconcept distances compared with those predicted by theory. The crucial partial correlations were low and did not confirm the hypothesis. Secondary analyses suggested that the failure may have resulted from inadequate control of message content and failure to consider the  concept of \"domain.\" The theory made better predictions for a subset of the concepts that might be a domain.

The Act applies to federal agencies, which are defined to include any executive department, military department, government corporation, government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency. The federal statute does not apply to Congress (or its committees) or the judiciary. The nine exemptions to mandatory disclosure which refer to the types of documents which the  government may withhold are discussed. A section on how to use the act, including a discussion of the initial request, appeal to the head of the agency from an initial adverse decision, and appeal to the courts is also included, as well as a listing of additional sources for assistance and information.

In the normal course of events perceptual confusions occur as a mismatch between an utterance and stored linguistic data. A speech sound perception task based on matching-to-memory was constructed and administered to 80 children from four age groups. Results show that traditional tests underestimate normal children's perceptual control over phonological oppositions. The data also reveal a novel dimension of perceptual confusion data related to marked and unmarked feature categories. (Author)",

Techniques were devised to elicit multiple occurrences of the construction, including questions and negatives. One technique used was a convergent communication technique in which children were seated at opposite ends of a table with an opaque screen placed between them and were asked to describe similar or different pictures from the one which their partner held. The use of \"have got\" by Anglo children seemed to result from a transformational \"got\"-insertion rule as indicated by these two sentences: \"Joan has big hands. Joan has got big hands.\" No evidence indicated such a rule in Black  English. Acquisition of the \"have got\" structure does not seem to be complete for all children at the kindergarten and first-grade level. There are forms used by these children which do not occur elsewhere, notably \"haves,\" and a lack among young Anglo children of \"have got.\" Social differences in use associated with number were noted. Children from lower income black schools used person-number agreement much less frequently than did black children in middle income areas. (MKM)",

Despite an active-on-site Master of Engineering Program at Colorado State University, there remained a need to revitalize the skills of senior engineering personnel in subject areas particularly unique to Xerox.

The responses of the pupils were then subjected to an iten-by-item analysis and to the t-test, analysis of variance, and correlational analysis. Some of the results of this study were: there was a significant difference between the amount of incidental science knowledge possessed by urban school children and that possessed by their non-urban counterparts;  the performances on the Piagetian tasks were age-dependent, with the older children performing better than the younger children; and a significant positive correlation was found between the amount of incidental science knowledge possessed by school children of each grade of study and their performance on the Piagetian tasks.

Spatial allocation analysis is the study of the distribution of economic flows and transactions over geographical space. This account represents a general introduction to the process and its application in geographical inquiry. It proceeds by examining a series of models of spatial allocation systems, where the term \"model\" signifies an idealized representation. Under examination is a transportation problem model that includes (1) a set of geographically distinct points or regions which produce some commodity, (2) a set of geographically distinct points or regions which consume the same commodity, and (3) a given unit cost for transportation of the  commodity from any producer to any consumer. In examining the flow of commodities, constraints are observed so that no supplier's total productive capacity is exceeded and all consumers' demands are met. Attention is focused first on the purely computational properties of the simple transportation model, then on the theoretical underpinnings of the model, and lastly on a variety of important, formal generalizations from the model.

Focusing on the unfolding of man's patterns over geographic space and through time, the paper provides the basic theoretical background of this new, rapidly growing area of geography. Following a short introductory section, chapter two outlines the various carriers and barriers to both physical and cultural diffusion. Carrier processes may take the form of expansion, relocation, hierarchical filtering, or contagious diffusion as with diseases. Barriers to diffusion may be physical or cultural, such as differences in languages or levels of technology. Since spatial diffusion takes place on many different scales, chapter three focuses on the various  models of individual or micro-level diffusion, urban diffusion, regional diffusion, and macro-level (or national and international) diffusion. Chapter four discusses the frontiers of diffusion research. Also included is a list of further readings and illustrative references. (Author/DE)",

The students were measured for total self-concept as a learner, motivation, task orientation, concept of themselves as problem solvers, and how they saw themselves in relation to other students in the class. The results indicate that only the dependent-variable motivation showed a significant, positive increase with the experimental group. However, when tested alone, MACOS materials significantly affected black students. Particularly, black males indicated  that they were more motivated by the MACOS curriculum. Black students in the sixth grade perceived themselves as significantly better problem solvers and black males saw themselves as stronger members of a class. (Author/DE)",

The paper stresses a need for reemphasizing the educative role of the family and assisting it in making the home an effective learning center. The concept of the home as a learning center, as developed in the paper, examines individual learning pursuits and lifelong education in the home setting, learning throughout the family life cycle, and resources used in home learning. The second  part of the document presents the data results of a survey of blue-collar families in three stages of the life cycle to determine the feasibility of the home as a learning center. The third section provides a curriculum design for family-life and occupational education. The last two sections present statements of recommendations and next steps for family-life and occupation educators for developing the home as a learning center; and a summary article, Home as a Learning Center.

        "description":"This paper examines the relationship between educational theorist Edward L. Thorndike's psychology and his social viewpoint. Many of the revisionists in educational history have oversimplified Thorndike's thought by not examining his views from this perspective. Thorndike's educational ideas and practices are reflections of certain fundamental constitutive structures that determine the very character of his thought at many different levels of conceptualization. One of the early behavioralists, Thorndike viewed education as the control of the human being through operant conditioning. This same desire for control permeated his social viewpoint in that he felt only experts such as scientists, lawyers, and businessmen should make decisions for the rest of society. As a consequence,  these experts deserved a special and privileged place in society. Education, then, prepared the great mass of the population for their role as followers. Thus, viewing Thorndike's thought from the theoretical and social perspective, his conceptualizing of human behavior in terms of control led inextricably toward designing social institutions that reflected a control orientation.

        "description":"Based on two years of research experience in Zambia, the author examines ethical and political implications of research inforeign countries. The economic and political reality is that richer, Western countries have the resources to do the research while the poorer countries have the information. Cooperative efforts could alleviate this situation, but often are doomed to be &quot;helping&quot; on the one side and &quot;giving&quot; on the other--at best, a benevolent academic imperialism. Furthermore, once research is accumulated, the findings are not readily available to the host country. Western ideology structures the research questions and interpretations of the answers and, therefore, affects the kind of respect afforded to the participants in the research. Most researchers feel that the  information gathered by the research will uplift the people or contribute to their progress. However, any attempt to mold a foreign culture on the basis of Western ideology and values is subject to serious moral question. In many cases, the greatest harm may be done by those who think they are doing good. As long as social sciences are dominated by Westerners, only what Western ideologies can unveil will be discovered. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The relationship between the psychological process of social-cognitive development of elementary children and social science education is reviewed. Social cognition is defined as the ways in which children come to understand the thoughts and feelings of others. For the most part, research findings have shown that a fundamental aspect of social cognition is \"perspectivism,\" the ability to accommodate one's behavior to other points of view. Failure to consider other points of view results in \"egocentrism,\" a form of cognitive solipsism in which individuals behave as if everyone experiences the world as they do. Studies in the psychology of social-cognitive development provide the empirical foundation for teaching the process-oriented, new social studies in the elementary school.  Specific techniques of the new social studies education that develop social-cognitive development include inquiry activities, role playing, and values development. However, there is little evaluative research on these new techniques and curricula. Therefore, current theoretical interest in social cognition and practical interest in social science education create a particularly favorable context for the cooperation of psychologists and educators.

The purpose of FDP is to improve teaching as part of a continuing process. AHA guidelines recommend that these programs be initiated and supported by AHA under the following conditions: (1) a regional confederation of schools and colleges should assume joint sponsorship of faculty development programs; (2) each workshop should focus clearly on a specific teaching problem; (3) there must be an identifiable clientele of experts and participants; (4) systematic efforts to disseminate the results of such workshops to the historical profession are to be planned in advance; and (5) representatives of the Committee on Teaching and other appropriate AHA  bodies must be involved in the initial planning and in conducting an assessment of the program's effectiveness. Based on the results of the Long Island faculty development program, the AHA has learned that FDPs cannot be imposed from an outside source. Other lessons of importance concern the value of interinstitutional cooperation and of local institutional funding if the project is going to succeed. Building upon the Long Island model, the AHA will develop five or six regional centers for faculty development. Each center will reflect the underlying philosophy of the program and will also mirror the particular interests, strengths, and problems of the region and institutions involved. (Author/DE)",

Originally sponsored by the American Historical Association's Faculty Development Program to improve history instruction, this project includes faculty representatives from four Long Island universities, colleges, and junior colleges. The program plans to achieve maximum impact by selecting teams of five experienced, innovative teachers from each of the four participating institutions. These teams share experiences and resources with teachers from other institutions, acquire new skills, and then return to their home institutions to work as a nucleus for disseminating new teaching approaches among their colleagues. Three basic strategies used to launch the program include a  content focus on historical areas and problems rather than teaching skills per se, a conscious effort to develop the broadest base of support among all levels of personnel and students, and emphasis on the ongoing need to improve teaching. Based on both the successes and mistakes of the program, 17 general and specific lessons that have been learned in the planning and implementation of the program are outlined. (Author/DE)",

Currently, global realities and interdependencies are such that traditional assumptions about international affairs and education are no longer operative. Nor is international education as a discipline conceptually or structurally responding to contemporary challenges. The priorities of international educators are curiously inverted so that attention to state, local, and institutional legitimacy is superseded by a disproportionate emphasis on seeking federal support, disciplinary benediction, and political abstraction. Yet compelling survival, humanitarian, and cultural reasons make the need for stronger international education programs imperative. Internationalist scholars must design  new curricular and research models which will yield pertinent new insights and provide a base of relevant expertise which can be utilized by government and professional groups in policy making. They must integrate international programs into every curriculum, produce paraprofessionals who can take an international dimension into the public domain, raise professional standards, become active and aware of political realities at the local level, and reward professional endeavors for improving the discipline.

        "description":"First in a series of six documents, this report describes the Urban Life-Population Education Institute (ULPEI) program which was designed to demonstrate population realities to Baltimore public schools so that teachers can introduce population studies into the school curriculum. The first part of the paper presents background information on the ULPEI program. Through a series of workshops with Baltimore public school teachers, the format of population education units was developed. A global approach to the population problem was decided upon along with an understanding of how population problems exist on the personal level. Using this philosophy, a series of units were developed by teachers that can be infused into existing curricula. (See SO 008 941 through 945). Several major  conclusions reached by the ULPEI Program are that population education should be introduced into the school system, racism is an essential component of population education and must be discussed and understood, the ULPEI curricular materials can be adapted to other school systems, and teachers can more easily accept population education after they have been sensitized to its need through awareness workshops. The second part of the paper contains several appendices, including footnotes, questionnaires, short discussion papers emphasizing the need for population education and teacher awareness, a brief annotation of each of the curriculum units, and an order form.

Based on the idea that our past and present educational system has been largely determined by the needs and ideology of the capitalist economic system, the author proposes an alternative society and educational system that places human needs above private profit. The booklet is divided into three sections which analyze the past, present, and alternative future educational systems. The first section examines how the capitalist ideology influenced the development of our educational system through such concepts as tracking, political indoctrination in history courses, and the direct and indirect capitalistic control of school administration. Section two explains the school  socialization process under capitalism and how the capitalist system benefits from this process. It focuses on how punctuality and attendance, obedience to authority, competition and individualism, sexism and racism, and acceptance of boredom contribute to the capitalist ideology. Section three outlines the Chinese and Cuban educational systems as examples of socialist countries that have made great strides in the development of their educational systems. (Author/DE)",

Objectives are to make students aware of local environmental problems and clarify their personal values about environmental issues. Along with general kinds of land-use problems and historical overviews, the unit focuses specifically on four major land-use issues in Pinellas County, Florida, including beach development and natural disasters; land-use and planned zoning; transportation; and water supplies, distribution, and wastes. Each unit of the guide contains appropriate teacher information, such as materials needed, special notes to the teacher, activities, objectives, skills, generalizations, and guidelines. Although focused on Florida, the unit  serves as a good model that can be easily adapted in other regions. Teachers can substitute maps, graphs, and other kinds of local information using the Pinellas County model as an example. (JR)",

Section two gives contending perspectives on the problem. These selections help the reader understand the current argument for and against action, while section four presents a wide range of substantive and specific legislative proposals now being considered as aids in resolving the crisis.

The unit uses a comic book format to teach 12th-grade students the fundamental political concepts of system, political-system types, and political experiences which will be used in later units that focus on specific issues. The unit is self-instructional, and students proceed at their own rate. The unit centers around the fictitious planet of Acton which is facing environmental disaster. In searching for a new planet to inhabit, the Actonites experience and learn about many new and diverse political systems. Episode 1 identifies the concept of system and describes a participant political system. Episode 2 describes and applies  the concepts of political resources, activities, and maintenance. Episode 3 examines the elite political system and explains the concept of political development. Episode 4 identifies a bureaucratic political system and explains the concept of political conflict. Episode 5 defines a coalitional political system, political change, and the role of the observer in bring about change. (Author/DE)",

This approach avoids lengthy narratives of a theoretical approach and yet is more in-depth than the case-study approach of the first-semester units. The documentary approach emphasizes gathering interview data from actual participants involved in the issue. The first activity unit introduces students to the concept of political conflict by examining the opinions of the various actors in the issue. Activity two focuses on how the two political factors on inequality and competition affect the conflict situation in Boston. Activity three  demonstrates how the concept of mobilization and interdependence have affected the busing conflict. Finally, activity four is designed to teach students conflict-management skills and how to forecast future trends in a conflict situation. Each activity contains the necessary student materials and student discussion questions. A data packet of supplementary readings and exercises is also included. (Author/DE)",

A documentary approach represents the core of instruction in this 12th-grade unit which is divided into five activities. The first activity introduces students to the structure of mines and various mining safety problems in order to grasp the meaning of the issues and problems with which the UMWA, as a political system, must deal. Activity 2 studies the organization, structure, and growth of the UMWA in the 20th century. Throughout activity 3, students relate  the miners' idea of union legitimacy to the concept of political maintenance. Activity 4 examines how the union has been maintained over time by the use of such political devices as control and mobilization. Activity 5 focuses on how union interdependence with other organizations and governments also contributes to political maintenance. The activity requires students to speculate about the future of the UMWA. Each activity contains the necessary student materials and student discussion questions. (Author/DE)",

Students focus on the court case &quot;Riverside vs.  Ruckelshaus&quot; as an illustration of political innovation. Activity 4 examines how the concept of interdependence affects change and the extent to which Riverside became interdependent with aspects of the political environment. Activity 5 teaches students how to forecast the future of a political system experiencing change by examining alternative futures for Riverside.

The primary purpose of the report is to record the evidence of accomplishment and expertise on which the Fulbright program has been built and to designate in detail the unique set of binational and academic mechanisms that have been developed. It is prepared for persons who have had some past connection with Fulbright educational exchange programs--including men and women in the Congress, the Executive Branch, and every part of academic life in America who have supported the program. This informal history, prepared during the anniversary year of the Board of Foreign Scholarships, tells the story of the experiences  of more than 100,000 participants in more than 100 countries under the Fulbright program. Following an introduction which tells how and why this report was prepared, the study presents sections on The Laws Behind the Program, The Binational Approach, The Focus on Academic Merit, The Foreign Relations Component, Support of The American Educational Community, Achievements of the Program, and Final Thoughts. Supplementary materials are enumerated on the last 22 pages and include tables and charts showing the number and distribution of American and foreign grantees by state of permanent residence and by area and category from 1949-70 and 1970-71.

Attention is focused on two general areas of environmental problems: (1) problems of the natural, physical environment involving aesthetic and physical qualities as well as the quantity of natural resources; and (2) problems of human-made  environments. Ways in which environmental education programs can be structured at all grade levels are considered. Suggested teaching strategies for use in environmental education programs are presented in the third section, including field trips, graphic studies, nature walks, diaries and logs, field training, and time perspective studies. Sources and resources in a bibliographic format comprise the last part of the document. Articles, publications, films, filmstrips, student materials (games), bibliographies, and ecology-oriented organizations and projects are topic organizers of the bibliography. (Author/JR)",

Project SEARCH is geared to humanizing education by making students aware of the values that underlie their own acts and the acts of others and the consequences of holding those values. The aim of SEARCH is to develop ways to teach children, K-12, to make choices on the basis of reason, emotion, and research. Major objectives are to help students develop reasoning skills; recognize feelings and emotions, with an implication of their importance in determining thought and conduct; examine issues from different disciplinary  approaches; and know and apply the steps on the valuing process. The underlying philosophy of SEARCH is that the integration of the arts and the humanities with science and technology is a powerful educational tool. (Author/JR)",

The four events under examination include the Boston Massacre, the Denmark Vesey Slave Revolt, the Republic Steel Strike of 1937, and the Berlin Airlift of 1948. Each unit contains social background to the event, a description of the events leading to the incident, a description of what happened, a summary of important outcomes of the incident, a list of suggested student activities, related matters for consideration, and a bibliography. The related matters for consideration include additional student activities, value-oriented discussion questions, and appropriate instructional strategies on related political, economic, and  social concepts inherent in the events. The unit on the Republic Steel strike may be integrated into economics or sociology courses since the strike reflects attitudes, ideas, and actions of labor, management, and government. Since the Berlin airlift unit explores the powers of the presidency in the area of foreign policy, it may be used in political science or international relations courses. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"Distinctions must be made between the positive intent of certain legislation and the negative backlash which this legislation can create for those persons it is intended to help and protect. Recent laws have been passed, for example, requiring physicians to obtain a patient's consent before treatment can begin and to provide sufficient information to the patient so that he can make an intelligent decision. Problems arise, however, when the patient does not have the capacity to consent or if the patient is institutionalized and, therefore, conditioned to obey officers in charge, or is of \"lower\"socioeconomic status and lacks knowledge of legal recourse. The field of children's legislation, also, provides a wealth of examples to support the thesis that the intent and reality of  certain legislation are not congruent. Children are now entitled to due process in the school system and can abuse enlightened parents, teachers, and other professionals concerned with their education if youth stress their individual rights at the expense of the rights of others. Fundamentally, these findings suggest that since laws are made and implemented by human beings and since much of the difficulty and confusion resulting in legislative backlash is due to a perspective involving operationalism, those persons working in public service professions must be committed to live by a higher standard than that of the law.

In addition to outlining the basic educational philosophy, five major goals of social science education are outlined to direct students toward the achievement of civic competence. Programs will be planned to enable students to develop understandings based on data, generalizations, and concepts from the various social science disciplines; develop and practice a variety of intellectual and work-study skills; understand and respect cultural differences and  similarities; reflect on society's values and develop and clarify a personal set of values; and participate in activities in the society as individuals and members of groups. Ways in which each of these objectives can be achieved through the social science disciplines and philosophies of the school systems are illustrated throughout the bulk of the document.

Although this recent humanistic revolt hardly affected the patterns of working life in America, it influenced attitudes toward work not only among middle-class adolescents and youth but also among blue-collar workers. One of the needs made apparent by the humanistic revolt is the need for meaningful work roles, through which youth can actualize their humanistic ideals in practical ways. The next era of history should be concerned with providing, for liberal middle-class youth as well as for the poor, satisfying work roles that do not require prolonged and expensive college education.

A four-page questionnaire, designed to obtain data from classroom teachers on a broad range of topics and areas pertaining to the status of population education within their respective schools, was mailed to 300 randomly selected Florida middle, junior high, and senior high schools. Responses received from 45.3 percent of the public and private school teachers indicated the following findings: (1) population education is included in schools regardless of the size of the school's enrollment; (2) classroom teachers are consciously incorporating population education content in a variety of elective and required courses; (3) there is a wide range  of length of time spent by teachers on population education; (4) the majority of population education teachers are social studies teachers; (5) population education priority rankings suggest that population is primarily studied as an integral part of the examination of broader environmental problems and processes; (6) classroom teachers of population primarily teach units whose objectives are developed and written by the teachers themselves; (7) the majority of teachers indicated that they would attend a preschool or inservice population workshop if such were offered; and (8) the majority of teachers may not have received any college course preparation in the population education area. From these findings it appears that population education is included in school curricula.  (Author/DDB)",

        "description":"Reflections on the fundamental problems of teaching political science in community colleges are outlined. Facing the stark reality of a student population deficient in reading and writing skills, the teacher must make difficult concepts and material comprehensible in order to create a sense of attachment for the nation, its Constitution, laws, and institutions. The necessity for thoughtfulness about political things must overcome the constant repetition of slogans and simplistic rhetoric which is common among the under-educated community college student. The author has found the lecture-discussion technique supplemented by student dialogue debates on controversial political issues to be an effective means of imparting information in an American government course. In more  difficult political theory courses, it is often necessary to greatly simplify the concepts of the political theorists being considered. To create a greater sense of public responsibility in our public servants, public administration courses in the community college must become less removed and more relevant to the things public servants actually do. For example, since police officers often encounter situations involving Constitutional rights, a relevant community college course should involve a study of the development of Constitutional law. Not only would courses of this nature prepare students to be better citizens, but they would also instill public responsibility in our public servants. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The Aspen Institute formed a National Commission on Coping with Interdependence to investigate the capacity of Americans to cope with interdependence and consider how that capacity can be enhanced. This paper responds to two questions: to what extent do our existing institutions perceive the predicament, analyze its implications, and act in accordance with that analysis; and what new attitudes and arrangements may be required to enhance the capacity of Americans to cope with interdependence. It was found that the capacity of American education is limited by a lack of political consensus, the complex character of many interdependence issues, and the nature of the educational enterprise. Other problems are the constitutional incongruity that public education is a state and local  responsibility while most interdependence issues are perceived as national concerns, decentralization of education makes educational change difficult to introduce, education is only one of many means to inform the public, and some embedded cultural views exist that inhibit efforts. Thus, a sustained effort to bring about a new and expanded civic literacy on interdependence issues is required. This effort involves strategy development, policy support, development of a stronger knowledge base, analysis of embedded cultural views, strengthening of existing cooperation activities, and assistance from the educational community for the mass media.

        "description":"This booklet traces the historical development of human education as it has been instilled into the young people of America from colonial times to the present and provides a future prognosis of humaneness in the schools. Humane education promotes humane behavior and is an important part of the humane movement in the United States, although until recently it has remained largely outside the education community. The authors explore various methods of inculcating humane ideals in children, such as formal instruction in just, kind, and compassionate behavior for all living creatures; dealing directly with animals, either by owning and caring for a pet or collecting scrapbook pictures and stories about animals; and reading animal stories. Topics discussed include Why Humane  Education?; Humane Education and Its Subsystems (Conservation Education, Environmental Education, Outdoor Education); Humane Education--An Overview of Development; and Contemporary Humane Education (The George Washington University Study, the Humane Education Development and Evaluation Project, the National Association for the Advancement of Humane Education). The authors conclude that never before in the history of America have conditions been so right for humanitarians to impart their message of humaneness. A bibliography is included. (Author/DDB)",

The Cross-Cultural Southwest Ethnic Study Center (CCSWESC) of the University of Texas at El Paso conducted the survey to promote interinstitutional communication and cooperation between and among CCSWESC and analogous entities on other campuses. A two-page questionnaire was mailed to administrative officers of most junior and senior colleges in California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma. Nearly 100 institutions of the approximately 150 responses indicated a program or activity relevant to the areas surveyed. Survey results include the  following: nomenclature of the ethnic curricula; academic levels involved; the regional and minority concerns treated; the manner in which faculty for such programs are distributed among the various teaching departments; and names, characteristics, and activities of related research centers, departments, divisions, committees, offices, and other institutional entities having an interest in minority concerns and interethnic relationships.

        "description":"The high school journalism teacher who initiated the Foxfire Project discusses the memorable learning experiences and community studies in which students are involved as they develop and publish the Foxfire magazines. The author describes the project objectives and the successfully implemented teaching techniques and learning activities so that other teachers can use or adapt these ideas and tailor them to their own specific teaching situation. At the heart of Foxfire is the conviction that students can learn about their community and humanity only outside the classroom. The project emphasizes process rather than product. Some observable achievements that accrue to participating students include an acquisition of vocational skills such as editing and writing, photography,  marketing, and advertising; pride in their communities and their elders; and interdisciplinary perspective toward learning; and an appreciation for the visual and literary arts used in communication. The major portion of the book describes the four &quot;touchstones&quot; for students and the learning activities through which students achieve these. The four touchstones include: Gaining Skills and Confidence; Growing, Reinforcing, Checking Bases; Beyond Self; and Independence. Included in the appendices are the Introductions to &quot;The Foxfire Book&quot;&quot;Foxfire 2,&quot; and &quot;Foxfire 3.&quot; (Author/RM)",

The major goals of the units are to provide factual information about immigrants to America from about 1820 to 1920 and to assist students in investigating immigrant history and heritage in their families and communities. The user's guide provides introductory information on how to use the series and background information about immigration. A brief description is given on the influence of immigrants on America and is followed by a discussion on how and where students gather and interpret information. Content topics and processes used in the activities are described along with a scheme for recording and evaluating student progress.  In addition to the user's guide, the series is composed of four units each for two levels--one for grades 4-8 and one for grades 9-12. These units, available only from the publisher, are classroom-oriented and emphasize gathering and interpreting information, valuing strategies, group sharing and discussion, activities for research projects and class field trips, and individual student research in family ancestry and community. To use the materials in the classroom, both the user's guide and units for either level are needed. (Author/JR)",

The author interprets and alters two learning models previously presented to the geographic community: one model, developed by William D. Pattison, involves learning and the other model, developed by David Harvey, deals with scientific explanation. The activity-oriented model, designed by the author, offers one mode of teaching as an example of an alternative approach to the lecture method or a content-oreinted classroom. The activity--a regional problem involving map use--is described first in an idealized situation and then in actual classroom situations. The author states that all  evaluations of the learning activity, the learning model, the students, and the instructor must consider whether the student has been allowed to become the central focus of the learning situation. The conclusion proferred is that the quality of geography education, as well as of people's understanding of themselves, others, and the world, will improve if the student rather than the subject becomes the focus of education. The appendix includes an activity evaluation form and a selected bibliography. (Author/DDB)",

The first activity presents information about the history of the engine company as a political system. Activity 2 introduces the concept of political development and the related ideas of mobilization and planning. It explains how the Cummins Company changed from a primarily elite-type structure to a primarily bureaucratic  structure. In activity 3, students learn about the concept of penetration through a role-play exercise and then apply the concept to the expansion of the company into Mexico and India. Activity 4 focuses on the concept of interdependence through an examination of how the company has become interdependent with Mexico. Finally, activity 5 requires students to predict alternative futures for the company under different economic conditions. Each activity contains necessary student materials and discussion questions.

Some are the relationship between public and private education, school administration, equal opportunity for education, and social reform through education. Jefferson's fundamental educational question was the nature and role of education in a new nation committed to principles of liberty and quality. The educational needs in the new United States as viewed by Jefferson are reflected in the education he obtained while becoming a statesman, his political activity, his acceptance of the Doctrine of Natural Rights, his perception of the role of education in a free  society, and his establishment of the University of Virginia. Jefferson's educational contributions lie in the realm of the &quot;why&quot; of teaching, rather than the &quot;how&quot;, and in initiating discussion of several controversial issues. (Author/ND)",

The findings of two recent studies of elementary and secondary textbooks are summarized and directed to four questions: Do textbooks describe the real world as females and males experience it in our society? Should textbooks describe the real world as females and males experience it? Can textbooks be nonsexist? Will we eliminate sexism in textbooks? The elementary textbook study indicates that boys are generally portrayed as active and girls as passive, and that adult males have a large choice of occupational roles whereas adult females have a more limited choice. The secondary textbook study suggests that the majority of women in textbook indexes are included because  of some relationship to a male. Although these images are representative of the present sexist mold of our society, care should be taken to use only those textbooks that show alternative male and female role models and the complexities inherent in each of these roles. Extreme sexism \"consciousness\" on the part of textbook authors and editors combined with active concern by citizens groups, teachers, and education organizations can produce good nonsexist literature.

The thirty-celled instrument behaviorizes the six processes involved in decision-making and combines them with the taxonomic levels of the affective domain. Each cell describes signs of decision-making from problem definition and valuing through the process of deciding, as the individual voluntarily expresses his position. The AII can be used to: (1) program involvement and dissonance to study attitude change; (2) describe, diagnose, and redesign teaching strategy; and (3) provide information for teacher self-evaluation.

        "description":"In this monograph, the author discusses eight propositions derived from research which support the contention that, to adequately measure student performance, research designs must be capable of measuring multiple outcomes simultaneously. The first proposition deals with this need to measure multiple outcomes. The second proposition states that students affect teacher behavior, just as teachers affect student behavior. Proposition 3 concerns cultural differences in the dynamics of learning and states that no single teaching style works equally well with all of these differences. Proposition 4 deals with the interaction of social class with instruction, in particular, the large learning gap between middle-class and working-class children. The fifth proposition states that the  emotional adjustment of students often has a powerful effect on their learning. Proposition 6 presents the need for a logical model that examines the interacting effects of teaching strategies and student characteristics on multiple outcomes of instruction. In proposition 7, it is stated that the most effective learning system is one which identifies and addresses each student's particular intellectual and emotional needs. Proposition 8 states that the most difficult step is putting a revised system into practice. In a final section, research needs in the area of student teacher interaction are discussed. (RC)",

Of this estimate, approximately 45,000 injuries occurred on public playground equipment and approximately 41,000 on home playground equipment. Over three-fourths of the reported injuries involved children under 10 years of age. Lacerations, contusions/abrasions, and fractures accounted for 86 percent of the injuries. Nearly half of the injuries occurred to the head, and the injuries to the extremities comprised 41 percent of the total. More than two-thirds of the injuries occurring on home playground equipment involved swing sets. Climbing  apparatus, slides, swings, and swing sets were each involved in from 25 to 35 percent of the injuries related to public playground equipment. Indepth studies of 83 public and 62 home playground-related injuries conducted since February 1973 indicated that the primary hazard pattern involved falls from the equipment. Other frequent patterns included instances in which the victim was struck with a moving piece of equipment; or an extremity was entrapped at a pivot or pinch point. Twenty-four death certificates showed that falls, hanging, and being struck by a moving part of the equipment were the most frequent causes of playground equipment deaths. (Author/RC)",

The model is personalized in that it calls for the determination of competencies and objectives based on the individual teacher's philosophy of education. It is also individualized since the learning that takes place is self-paced. Finally, the model is flexible and can be used with preservice or inservice programs. There are five phases of the model: (1) philosophy, (2) rationale, (3) objectives, (4) mastery of competencies, and (5) evaluation. The five phases are guided by a collaborative section which serves to familiarize participants with influences that must be considered in developing one's philosophy,  objectives, and competencies (e.g., that the teacher must function within a school district, dealing with students and parents). After recognizing the influencing factors and dealing with them in a collaborative manner, the participant is ready to begin the five phases of the model.

First discussed is some of the history of agriculture education in America, including (1) the Morrill Act, which gave public lands to states for agricultural colleges; (2) the Hatch Act, the purpose of which was to promote investigation, experiment, and dissemination of information on agricultural science, and (3) the Smith-Lever Act, which legislated matching funds for extension work to offer practical demonstrations, publications, and other instruction to the public. For approximately the past 100 years the building of a constituency for research and development in agriculture has progressed very slowly. Few students took agricultural courses at first, even when the American  economy was largely rural. To build a constituency, research in agriculture must produce something of value to potential constituents, and the results of research must be communicated to them. Discussed are various methods of disseminating information, including publication or research findings, and participation in meetings of commodity organizations. Questions from the audience concern specific accomplishments of research and development in agriculture, ways in which the quality of life of Ohio farmers has improved, and priority-setting. (CD)",

Students, however, cannot form powerful groups to protect their own intersts, and therefore, the state should have a role as advocate for children as consumers of education. Most states delegate the responsibility of providing an education to the board of education, which must decide what outcome will be desirable for students. Since the board must remain sensitive to public opinion and criticism, it is appropriate for it to have an ultimate voice in teacher certification. Schools of education, on the other hand, should have input but not final control because their perspective is limited. They tend, for instance, to overvalue course work and undervalue real life  performance ability. Teachers should not exclusively regulate the profession either; if they have that power they will not use it in the public interest any more than doctors or lawyers do. A board of education is at least minimally accountable because the highest officer is usually elected or appointed. State boards should be composed of laymen, not professional educators. If a policy board of laymen is established to oversee the administrative agency and if opportunities are provided for the public to scrutinize the bureaucratic process, we will have the structures necessary to insure state responsiveness.

Fifty high schools were randomly selected from each of five size classifications. A random sample of 750 Texas public high school teachers were selected for the study (150 from each category). Each of the 750 teachers was mailed a 41-item Linkert type survey instrument which was designed to reveal the degree to which they felt a loss of control over matters of student discipline. Responses were returned from 386 teachers. The study revealed that the size of school enrollment does not affect the teacher's perceived control over matters of student discipline; that is, there were no statistically significant differences among  those teachers from each of the five high school classification categories. Analysis of the data further revealed no significant differences when considering the specific variables of teacher age, sex, teaching experience, and subject taught.

A small number of innovations have succeeded--either by surviving in a \"near-original\" form or by leaving a residue of desirable change. The causal factors present in apparently successful attempts to significantly change school programs seems to be the following: (1) the innovation is a response to a locally recognized educational need or problem; (2) the relationship between the innovation and the problem is clear to administrators, teachers, policy-making boards, and parents; (3) the innovation is an appropriate response to the defined problem; (4) the local school is making a significant investment of resources in  the project; (5) the school staff understands the rationale for the innovative program and is adequately prepared to perform the tasks required for its success; (6) supplementary services are adequate to support teachers in the classroom during the initial stages; (7) the evaluative criteria are appropriate to the innovation and are applied during the course of the program as well as at its conclusion; (8) the innovative program is started on a manageable scale; and (9) program leadership is capable and remains relatively unchanged throughout the implementation period.

        "description":"Although sex discrimination has been widespread in many areas of public school education, in no area has it been so blatant as in athletics. Much of the support for the posture that competitive athletics was morally and physically bad for girls came from the physical education profession itself and from the women in the profession. Misconceptions about anatomy and physiology and about the strength and endurance of females also played a part in fostering the idea that girls and young women were to be protected from vigorous activity. Discussion of the evils of competitive athletics and the undesirability of competition for girls is now irrelevant, however, since Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits persons from being excluded from educational programs and  activities by reason of sex. So many changes have already occurred that Title IX will only accelerate changes that have already begun. Elementary physical education has made great advances in the past decade. Children are being taught early to be comfortable with their bodies--to be agile and dexterous. In many areas of the country, high school girls now have opportunities to play in up to eight or ten sports at the varsity level. Generally, competitive play is organized through the high school activities associations, and there is little coeducational competition so far. It seems obvious that the time has come for enlarged programs for girls' sports and for informed parents to support them. (RC)",

        "description":"Title IX legislated, among other things, equal educational opportunities for boys and girls in physical education. Although there are many practices which discriminate against girls' sports, and it is important to correct these, Title IX really calls for a fundamental change in all physical education programs to give each individual child the best possible opportunities for acquiring motor skills. Children need varied kinds of movement for both psychological and physical reasons. Male coaches too often teach a limited range of sports based on the sports they engaged in in college, while women gym teachers have frequently had too little exposure to competitive sports. A balance between the two is needed. Furthermore, in theory, physical education instruction for all is the main  concern, with interscholastic competition an additional component. In practice, however, less emphasis is given to providing an instructional program geared to the needs of all students. Change is clearly necessary, and teachers must be involved in the change process, both in terms of devising a framework for a new curriculum and in examining the basic goals in their programs. Instructors should realize how crucial it is for people to learn to move effectively, since life cannot proceed without movement, and to upgrade their physical education programs according to the requirements of Title IX.

Groups of 139 and 137 undergraduate students took three physics courses taught by either the PSI method or the lecture/discussion method. Students from these groups were compared in two subsequent chemistry courses and a subsequent biology course. The chemistry and biology courses were taught using lectures and discussion sections. The PSI group achieved significantly higher grades in both the physics courses and the subsequent courses. The fact that the PSI students achieved higher grades in the subsequent lecture courses seems to indicate that they were not at a disadvantaged because of the earlier PSI courses. The junior year major  area grades of students who majored in applied mathematics and engineering sciences, biology, chemistry, and physics were also compared. In each case, the PSI group achieved significantly higher grades. For each comparison, the mean high school grade point average, SAT scores, and freshman university grade point average were used to verify that no selected attrition had occurred. (Author/RC)",

(TIAC is a system of 10 categories which classifies verbal interaction in the classroom as either contributing to or interfering with student autonomy.) Preservice instruction in FIAC involved 13 hours of practice in recording interaction behaviors, constructing and interpreting matrices, and developing indirect teaching skills. The findings indicated a positive relationship exists between preservice instruction in FIAC and subsequent verbal interaction during student teaching and first, second, and  third years of teaching experience. Few persistent trends could be identified demonstrating a consistent difference (either direct or indirect) continuing from student teaching through the third year of teaching experience. However, student teachers and first, second and third year teachers with preservice instruction in FIAC consistently utilized more modified indirect influence, and more extended use of student ideas. In contrast, the comparison group exhibited more direct teacher response to student talk (with the exception of second year teachers) and more student talk (with the exception of first year teachers).

        "description":"Introductory educational research courses are often based on the scientific model of research derived from natural science. Scientific research using theoretical constructs and measurement of variables establishes a body of verified knowledge through replication of experiments. The conceptualization of the introductory research course presented in this study is one based on a decision-making model of research derived from social science. This approach has been field-tested six times on 267 students in various M.Ed. programs. The two major objectives are for students to become aware of the field of educational research and to develop basic skills in research for educational decision-making. Five major findings emerged from this case study: (1) students learn basic research  concepts through conducting a study for educational decision-making; (2) students learn the total research process; (3) decision-making research must be formally taught and contrasted to scientific research; (4) educational leaders should become familiar with the field of educational research before taking courses in specific methodologies, research designs, or statistics; and (5) introductory educational research textbooks and materials should include both decision-making and scientific models of research so that educational leaders gain further insights into research processes and multiple uses of research.

        "description":"Preference scores were determined for several different groups of students ranging in age from seven to adult. In addition, instruments were administered to determine the cognitive level at which the students were capable of functioning. Comparisons between the students' cognitive level and preferences were made. The results indicated that the students' preference to a method of solving a problem was independent of the cognitive level of development. However, the data support the premise that preferences may be task dependent. Children who are only capable of functioning at the concrete level of operations frequently prefer to attempt to solve problems in a manner through which they are not capable of success. Further, formal operational children frequently prefer to solve  problems in a concrete manner. A possible explanation is that they feel that the concrete mode will either be easier or more fun; additional research, however, will be needed to confirm this explanation. Another aspect of these studies compared the manner in which students actually began to solve a problem with a previously stated preference. It was found that the overall &quot;consistent score&quot; for both groups was similar; formal students, however, were generally more successful in solving the problems.

Learning centers are a tool to individualization and can be of types: (1) a skill learning center or (2) an information learning center. A skill center is designed to enrich, reinforce, or teach a skill or a concept, while the main purpose of an information center is to provide the student with information and/or to enrich a skill or concept. Organization of learning centers is one of the common concerns of teachers as they work with this approach. There are many plans, and the best plan is the one that is most appropriate for the learning styles and needs of the  students. The teaching style of the instructional leader should also be considered. Regardless of which plan is used, the teacher should begin use of the learning center slowly. Learning centers can be a beneficial venture for both the teacher and the student, and there are many resources available which can be of help to teachers as they work with learning centers.

An insufficiently used alternative method of obtaining a valid analysis of a teacher's abilities is to get objective information from the students themselves. This can best be done by a third-party interviewer who is not in a position of authority over either the teacher or the students. This person can randomly select approximately five students for an interview session of about one hour. He/she might first ask the students to share things they appreciate about the teacher, then ask them to cite problem areas. A general discussion should follow in which the teacher takes part. Three weeks later a second interview should be held with another group of randomly selected students. Often it is  found that either the students or the teacher have subtly changed their behavior in the intervening weeks. The best way to wrap up the process is for the interviewer and teacher to meet a third time without students and for them to document what happened during the process. This kind of teacher evaluation fosters student involvement and trust in their own education, and is likely to win their respect because it offers the opportunity to improve their own conditions as involuntary recipients of teaching.

Thirty-nine of these students voluntarily participated in a personalized teacher education (PTE) program, while the remaining 38 students voluntarily participated in a traditional program. Both programs included university work, classroom observation, and practice teaching. The PTE program also consisted of (1) repeated counseling sessions, (2) the differential assignment of instructional tasks  and activities based on the specific attitudinal and personality characteristics of the prospective teacher, (3) self-observation of teaching behavior through videotaping, and (4) affective feedback and assignment of tasks and activities related to the self-observation. Personality and attitude scales were administered to students in both programs on entry into training. Teaching effectiveness variables were measured at the end of the practice teaching semester. The program differences for observed teaching behavior and for the student teachers' perception of their training program indicated that the PTE program was producing behavior change in the desired direction.

It is speculated that obese people have a regulatory mechanism which makes them eat more than they need. The paper then evaluates exercise as a means of modifying body weight, but.cautions that there must be sound medical reasons to maintain a person at a colorie deficit. Diseases caused or exacerbated by obesity are listed.

The paper also explains how almost all of the aspects of individual freedom are negated in far too many competitive sport situations on this continent today. It, however, is noted that there are still some programs of educational competitive sport in the United States, and  that such is still the prevailing Pattern of competitive sport in Canadian education.

The author first discusses three developments in philosophy which have dealt with the function and purpose of philosophy: logical atomism, logical positivism, and ordinary language philosophy. The author then looks at four studies concerned with the meaning of some aspect of the term \"physical education.\" Next, William Frankena's explanation of the various meaning of the term \"education\" are presented, and the author explains how he  came to apply these and two additional meanings to the term \"physical education.\" These meanings include (1) the subject matter, (2) the activity of education, (3) the process of being physically educated, (4) the actual or intended result of 2 or 3, (5) the discipline, and (6) the profession. The author continues his analysis of the term \"physical education\" with a diagram which includes its various meanings. He concludes that \"physical education\" has characteristics of both being a \"family resemblance: term and of not being one (i.e., it cannot be definitely stated that \"physical education\" either is or is not a \"family resemblance\" term).

        "description":"This study investigated the extent to which teachers teach more effectively as a result of practice. Each of 12 experienced teachers taught a three-lesson social studies unit to three successive classes of eight junior high school students. The classes were taught on different days during one week. At the end of the unit each student completed a multiple-choice recall test, an essay test, and an attitude inventory that measured attitudes toward self and situation. Adjusted class means were calculated from the student tests. For the recall test, scores were stable from day 1 (the first class) to day 2 and then decreased significantly on day 3. Both sets of essay test scores were stable across teacher and day. Attitude-toward-the-situation scores increased from day 1 to day 2 and  decreased from day 2 to day 3. Attitude-toward-self scores did not change significantly. Twenty teaching-process variables were measured and correlated with student posttest variables. These processes included teacher talk, teacher feedback, subject-matter focus, activity structuring, goal setting, and summarizing. Teaching processes did not vary significantly with practice, and few teachers showed increases in student learning with practice. If teaching tends to become less effective across practice on the same unit, conventional skill training may not be the remedy, Perhaps training can be devised to focus on eliminating ineffective teacher behavior that appears with practice.

It begins with a description of normal schools, whose function was closely tied to the church (e.g., teaching people to read the Bible). Then it covers the educational revival in the 19th century which established free public schools. James Carter, Samuel Hall, and Horace Mann are discussed in terms of their educational leadership. Standards for teachers were low at first, with high school graduation not even a minimum requirement. Normal schools turned into teachers colleges with higher standards, and finally teachers colleges became liberal arts colleges. Gradually the normal school disappeared, and teacher education became the province of colleges and universities. A discussion of teacher supply and  demand explains both the earlier periods when far too few teachers were trained, and the modern period in which, for a number of reasons, there are too many teachers. The paper also describes the development of the science of education through advances in psychology, testing, child development, and the behavioral sciences. Criticisms of education departments are covered, notably those which state that education courses are too shallow and unscholarly. Finally, the paper describes the conflict between educational preparation through history, philosophy, and scholarship, and preparation through teaching of techniques and administration. (CD)",

In response to the psychological stress associated with athletic competition, state anxiety significantly increased in all subjects. These rises in state anxiety were occurring between practice and regular season and playoffs. High Trait subjects exhibited significantly higher elevations in state anxiety than Low Trait subjects which was in agreement with Spielberger's Trait-State Anxiety Theory. Stressful athletic environments (regular season and playoffs) did not, as has generally been believed, differentially  affect the state anxiety of both groups of subjects. Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory successfully discriminated between practice and competitive athletic environments and was successfully used in assessing the presence and strength of state anxiety levels of athletes in these environments.

        "description":"This project was undertaken to develop and validate a pupil response instrument for evaluating the instructional competence of aspiring teachers. Two school districts of moderate size and in close proximity to a university were selected for the project. The sample consisted of the pupils of 96 secondary area teacher candidates completing the student teaching requirement for a teaching certificate during the 1974-75 academic year. An instrument of 55 items was devised in which the pupils responded to each item on a five point scale ranging from agree to disagree. Candidates were requested to select one class section to complete the instrument near the end of the program. The resulting data was treated with a variety of statistical procedures which resulted in the selection of 30  items grouped into nine different factors. Results indicated, however, that the instrument could not be validated for students in grades seven through nine, because the terminology used was too difficult. It was concluded that pupil assessment of teaching competence adds a significant dimension to the student teaching program from a measurement viewpoint. However, because the fear of this practice by student teachers is great, the use of pupil assessment instruments for determining competence should be placed in the context of a formative test of self improvement and not be a final measurement of the candidates' capabilities to teach.

        "description":"Process oriented educational research has failed because it has relied too heavily on scientific method and has neglected \"unscientific\" but important questions. Educational research should study the society and how social forces influence teaching practices. Teachers can not be expected to change at will. They are constrained by pre-existing ideas of what education is all about which come from political and economic forces in the society. Schools, which appear to be neutral, are in important ways agents of the state, and the selection and training of teachers is similarly related to the state's interests. Yet research, particularly in capitalist countries, has failed to explore or discuss this. A part of these functions may even be viewed as symbolic violence--that is, the  squelching of certain values of students in favor of others. The power relations within education allow this domination of certain values to occur. Teaching remains a way of socializing children into the middle class and of obtaining cultural and social conformity. The content and methods of teaching thus have specific reasons for existing as they do which researchers have neglected to study. (Notes and references included). (CD)",

A study conducted by Crump (1974) provided the baseline data for comparison. Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities were established in the baseline study and in the present study. Each observer (a black female and a white female) independently categorized and analyzed teacher verbal and nonverbal behaviors using the French and Galloway IDER matrix which allows simultaneous classification of verbal (indirect or direct) and nonverbal (encouraging or restricting) behaviors. Findings in this study indicate that while  both observers appeared to have heard the same thing in the verbal communication interaction, there were extensive differences in what each saw in the nonverbal message. In conclusion, studies regarding communication patterns of different cultures should consider systematic observation techniques that are culturally unbiased, and results that reflect multi-ethnic perceptions.

Milwaukee then became known as the &quot;City of the Lighted Schoolhouse&quot;. The Division was formed as a result of a law passed by the Wisconsin Legislature which permitted school boards to use school facilities for evening schools, vacation schools, reading rooms, library stations, debating clubs, gymnasiums, public playgrounds, public baths, and similar activities and accomodations. In 1912 two social centers and eight playgrounds met the needs of the extension department's program. Today there are 153 playgrounds and 142 centers, and the activities include day camps, nature centers, a farm, and camping sessions. The Divisions goals are people-centered and humanistic. Programs  and activities are constantly being evaluated and changed to meet new needs. The work of the Division brought the Milwaukee System the National Sports Foundation 1974 Gold Medal Award for excellence in park and recreation services in American cities of over 250,000 population. Some of the programs to which the &quot;Lighted Schoolhouse&quot; is pointing in the future are the movements toward community education and leisure counseling. As outdoor education, special population, and other services have emerged in the past, so will these and others be the services of the future. (RC)",

        "description":"The purpose of this project was to produce materials that would foster favorable teacher attitudes toward the philosophy behind mastery learning. One other purpose was to help teachers acquire the skills needed to use mastery learning in their classrooms and to determine the effects on pupils when mastery learning techniques were used. Forty-four teachers and interns from four Indianapolis schools were equally divided into groups according to race and sex. The material developed was a Mastery Teaching module which included an introduction and six sections. A slide/tape accompanied each of the seven parts. An accompanying manual contained objectives, practice exercises, and feedback. The manual also included self-tests with answers for each section, a pre-test on prerequisites,  and a project section. Pre- and post-treatment measures were administered to the teachers and interns on both cognitive and affective variables. The results indicated that teachers and interns acquired the mastery teaching skills and used them to the degree that pupils perceived differences in their teaching. Teacher attitudes toward the mastery teaching philosophy were generally positive, and students' attitudes and achievement were favorably altered because of their teachers' use of mastery teaching.

        "description":"This monograph examines six periods in the history of teaching. The first section describes the period from 1776-1823 as a time when teaching was not the career choice of educated people. A case history of a New England school teacher is included in this section. The second section pictures the period 1820-60 as the time when teacher preparation schools and teacher associations began to appear. A case history is also presented in this section of a normal school student. The third section, covering 1860-1920, states that teachers were generally better educated during this period than previously. A more thorough knowledge of subject areas was required of those teaching high school students, and some teachers attended new departments of education in universities. Modernization of  instruction is said to have developed in this period. A case study is included in this section of a teacher on an Indian reservation. The fourth section describes the change in status of teaching which occurred during 1920-45 from a part-time, seasonal occupation to a full-time occupation staffed by women rather than men. It is stated that a conflict developed during this period between academic and professional orientations of teaching programs. Also during this period, the public became concerned with illiteracy and the education of immigrants, blacks, and rural people. The period 1945-75 is described in section five as a time which included burgeoning power for teachers unions, a knowledge explosion, and social upheavals. Finally, in looking at the teacher of 1976, the three  characteristics by which competent teachers are identified are discussed: teacher personality, student achievement, and teacher behaviors. This last section states that future teachers will have better skills and resources and will be better able to fulfill the specific needs of their students. (CD)",

It is an individualized professional education degree program leading toward a Bachelor of Science degree in education. It is an inter-disciplinary degree option for students who wish to examine and pursue careers in a vast array of educational roles other than that of the certified public school teacher. The major is especially designed to provide a professional education program for individuals currently involved in existing community-based education programs or who intend to participate in the development of alternative educational projects. Each student enrolled in the program is assigned an advisor whose area of specialization closely relates to the  student's professional goals. The advisor assists the student in defining his/her major and in selecting courses, opportunities for educational experiences, and resource persons with whom to work. While the programs are individualized, all students must have learning experiences in the fine arts, humanities, natural and social sciences, and 34-credit education major which includes an inter-disciplinary education foundation, a field of specialization in education, and a field placement in a non-school setting to acquaint the student with an education role other than that of the public school teacher.

Called the Study-Service Trimester (SST), the program provides the geographic setting for direct experience in culture shock by exposing students to first-hand, live experiences and confrontations in unfamiliar environments. As part of their general education, elementary education students participate in SST assignments specially fitted for the future teacher in the classroom. Scheduled during the sophomore or junior year of college, SST combines the general studies component with early field work in the middle college years of professional studies. Students generally locate in Caribbean or Central American countries, where they study, work, and interact as a unit, while living in the homes of  nationals. The faculty director coordinates a seven-week study program in language study, field trips, and readings and lectures in history, the arts, government, and education. During the second half of the term, students are assigned to Peace Corps-like projects where they work side by side with nationals. Elementary education students are assigned to schools and children's homes for their work experience. Students keep daily journals, stimulating them to interpret and reflect upon the total experience. The college grants each student who satisfactorily completes SST ten credits in language, social science, and humanities. Additional credits may be earned for language proficiency. (RC)",

The students in this program take special courses and have special training intended to qualify them to teach children from lower socio-economic groups. Sixty-six elementary teachers who had been through the TOD program and 76 elementary teachers who had completed a regular course of study were sent three-part questionnaires in the spring following graduation. The first part of the questionnaire established that TOD participants were in fact teaching in disadvantaged schools to a greater extent than non-TOD participants. The second part had respondents rate their preparation for teaching according to the 10 stated objectives of TOD.  The TOD respondents expressed more satisfaction with their college preparation for teaching, although they cited discipline and communication with parents as problem areas. The third part provided the opportunity for suggestions to improve the elementary teacher preparation program at Ball State. The author of the report concludes with some suggestions toward revising the education curriculum to make it more flexible and to allow students to elect courses of special interest to them without being over-burdened by other less useful courses.

Advisement relates to use of electives, assignment to laboratory settings, and individual development of students. Instruction is carried on by personnel with interests and qualifications related to the program drawn from many areas of the university. Public school teachers serving as classroom supervisors of laboratory experiences are selected specifically for the program.

The design model developed consisted of three major components: (1) identification of needs, (2) planning and organization of experiences and resources, and (3) evaluation. After the needs were identified, the workshop was organized into five phases: (1) an introductory session; (2) a simulation to involve participants; (3) a session highlighting techniques to use  with students acquiring English as a second language; (4) small group discussions and debriefing sessions; and (5) the presentation of filmstrips, videotapes, and films related to the theme of the workshop.

Two groups of teachers from two schools acted as experimental and control groups for the purpose of analysis. The experimental group was involved in an inservice program which utilized mental health consultants from local and state clinics. The results indicated that teachers' attitudes toward children with emotional problems were changed in specific areas. The results seemed to indicate that teachers have a better understanding of children with emotional problems after attending inservice programs conducted by Mental Health consultants. Also, it was found that corporal punishment was  used less and behavior modification techniques were used more by those teachers in order to assist children in becoming more emotionally stable.

The previous study used 60 preservice teacher interns, mostly female, from Michigan State University. Seven identifiable types were discovered. The unique characteristics of each type concerned such things as respect for authority, concept of the goals of teaching, conformity, and alienation from other teachers. The present study used 60 randomly chosen teachers from six school districts. The subjects included male and female teachers, elementary and secondary teachers, and new and experienced teachers. Only five types were  identified in this study, and those types did not have as definitive characteristics as in the first study. It was concluded that the Olmsted test could not be generalizable to a larger sample of teachers and therefore should be used neither to predict teacher behavior nor as a screening tool for teacher education programs or for hiring. It was recommended that future studies of teacher attitudes utilize clearer and more definite scales and that better ways of measuring reliability of raters be established.

Respondents were asked to evaluate the effects of their program experience on their personal growth and on their occupational performance. From 60 to 95 percent of evaluative ratings across items were positive. Ninety-one percent of the respondents were employed in education organizations, and almost three-fourths were teaching. Program advisement and counseling were reported as being available and of reasonably high quality, although access to these services could be improved. There were clusters of positive responses with reference to feelings of personal achievement, valuing by peers, occupational security, and occupational competence. This growth  corresponds to a coincidence of 76 percent between completion of the program and receipt of promotion, advance in salary, or increased job responsibility. More than 25 percent of the respondents reported an increase in job responsibility. With the exception of those program objectives which represent skills development and cognitive development, the respondents were positively oriented toward all objectives, but less emphatically so to the following objectives: increased understanding of the mission and function of education; increased interest in adjunct fields of study; and increased ability to seek and find solutions to professional problems. High levels of satisfaction were reported in reference to the faculty, instructional methods, and the effectiveness of the instructional program.  (CD)",

In this particular 16-week course, students must write a research paper on one specific health problem and then devise a 10-week instructional unit which tries to solve the problems uncovered by their research. These problems must deal with the psychological or sociological aspects of health behavior rather than with physiological ones. While the students are taking the course, they are simultaneously enrolled in a field study course where they teach the unit they develop. At a certain point in the course students form four-member  health support teams in which they discuss health issues and prescribe behavior for one another for improved health. The thrust of the course and the program is that students must actively apply knowlege if college courses are to be meaningful. (CD)",

The games of ring and pin and snowsnake were played during the period under observation. The ring and pin game consisted of thrusting a needle-like object through multiple targets which were strung on a thong with a needle. The implements of the game were similar throughout the culture area. Snowsnake was a game where a javelin-like stick was thrown across a hard surface to  outdistance opponents. Snowsnake generally was played in ice or hard packed snow, but on paths, roads, or bare ground. Ring and pin had some limited ceremonial significance; no rituals accompanied snowsnake, nor was it a part of a ceremony. (Author/CD)",

Although these programs benefited some, few changes occurred in CEEB's major testing programs. CEEB found that extensive validity studies confirmed the predictive validity of their tests despite accusations of bias. Massive aid, to the neediest first, was seen as the only method for improving the educational opportunities of the poor, as the Board's College Scholarship Service  need-analysis system was inadequate. Suggestions for the future were presented in these areas: explicit activities that should be continued or undertaken; explicit needs to which the College Board should make pragmatic response; explicit activities that should be deemphasized; general activities in which minority interests should be kept in the forefront of staff thinking; and areas in which the College Board has a social responsibility to support the interests of minority youth.

The overall goal of the program was to enrich the curriculum in North and Northeast Minneapolis elementary schools by giving intermediate grade students one to one contact with professional artists serving as potters in residence in the schools. Each of six elementary schools housed a Potters' House and a potter-in-residence. Program operations varied greatly among the schools involved. About 250 elementary students participated in sessions ranging in length from 8 to 15 weeks. This evaluation was conducted after the fall and spring sessions. Referring teachers and potters filled out similar questionnaires for each child in the program. The  questions asked why the student was enrolled in the program and if any changes in behavior had been noticed since the student's participation. Results seemed to indicate that children who were chosen by their teachers for the program because of lack of confidence, behavior problems, and/or boredom with school benefitted from the program. Increased creativity and self-confidence were the most noted behavior changes. (Author/DEP)",

Characteristics of the three tests using several scoring techniques were investigated while varying the discriminating power of the items, the lengths of the tests, and the availability of prior information about the testee's ability level. The tests were evaluated in terms of their correlations with underlying ability, the amount of information they provided about ability, and the equiprecision of measurement they exhibited. Major findings were (1) scores on the conventional test correlated progressively less with ability as item discriminating power was increased beyond a=1.0; (2) the conventional test provided increasingly poorer equiprecision of  measurement as items became more discriminating; (3) these undesirable characteristics were not characteristic of scores on the stradaptive test; (4) the stradaptive test provided higher score-ability correlations when item discriminations were high; (5) the stradaptive test provided more information and better equiprecision of measurement when test lengths and item discriminations were the same for the two strategies; (6) the use of valid prior ability estimates by stradaptive strategies resulted in scores which had better measurement characteristics than scores derived from a fixed entry point; and (7) a Bayesian scoring technique provided scores with good measurement characteristics.

Both sexes were about evenly represented. About 70 percent were white and 30 percent nonwhite, reflecting the overall racial composition of the state. The health test covered a variety of major health areas such as food and nutrition, dental care, first aid, safety, personal care, growth and development, mental health, and environmental health. Motor performance was measured by the physical education test. Softballs and balance beams replaced papers and pencils as third graders  participated in a variety of physical activities: shuttle run, wall rebound, standing broad jump, balance walk, and throw for distance. No conclusions are drawn about the health test performance because of its experimental nature and the absence of solid criteria for judging good performance.

This manual was prepared to help local educators interpret the information provided for individual students and for classroom groups. This booklet has four sections. Section one describes the tests used in the 1974-75 educational assessment program. The second section describes and illustrates the various report forms used to provide individual student and classroom  data. The third section includes aids in interpreting the information contained in the reports. A list of cautions that should be exercised in the interpretation of these results is in the final section.

Data from state testing programs and the National Assessment of Educational Progress were used to determine who takes the test and how well prepared they are. Results for one and two states showed that in recent years different people have been taking the test and that starting in the late 1960's and continuing to the present, they have likely been less prepared than previously. For their part colleges and universities would seem to have adapted to the declining admissions scores of their in-coming students. Score decline over the past ten years of about two percent to three percent of a  standard deviation per year has been typical. There is variation by subject matter field and there are marked sex differences. Overall the scores of men have not declined appreciably over the last five years, but the scores of women have declined considerably. This trend has been accompanied by an increase in the percentage of women among ACT-tested students. The percentage of high scoring students has remained about the same over the last five years, while the percentage of low scoring students has increased.

The focus of this paper is on the development of criterion-referenced tests having these four properties and some associated technical problems that are encountered. Solutions for these technical problems are not readily available nor immediately generalizable to all curricular areas for which criterion-referenced tests might be desired.

Four problems encountered in the literature are range of measurements, inconsistent instrumentation across similar studies, lack of a generic framework from which to select behaviors to be measured, and use of instruments with inadequate psychometric characteristics. These problems are discussed. From a review of the literature, three general dimensions were selected from the purpose of categorizing classroom behavior and the instruments used to measure it. These dimensions were: (1) stage of behavior on a process-product continuum; (2) level of inference required in measuring behavior, and (3) objectives  of the instruction. If the measurement of behavior is viewed as a longitudinal process, four distinct and consecutive measurement stages are apparent: (1)Preoperational (personality, attitude, experience, and aptitude/achievement); (2) Immediate (sign, counting, and rating systems); (3) Intermediate (Likert and Guttman Scales, semantic differentials and check lists); (4) Product (influences other than the teacher, unreliability of the raw gain score, and the teacher's desire to teach to the test). Last, some guidelines are offered for improving the measurement process. (RC)",

The mode of presentation is a cassette tape recorder, which the child is taught to operate at the beginning of the program. The NAM lessons were administered to children at four NAM mini centers; a group of parents administered the NAM lessons to their own children at home; and NAM lessons were given to a group of four-year-olds at a day-care center. All of this took place in inner city Trenton, New Jersey. Data on the effectiveness of NAM were collected for each of the three conditions. For each condition, both cognitive and attitudinal data were gathered. In addition, the reactions of parents whose children participated in one of the conditions were obtained. In general, the  results from condition to condition had many similarities. The cognitive areas in which the largest gains occurred were those emphasized in the NAM lessons. No attitude changes were discernable. Questionnaire responses indicated that parents were intimately involved in the NAM process and were satisfied with the results. Parents perceived the primary benefit to be in the area of beginning reading, although a number of other benefits were also mentioned. (RC)",

The result is an overview of four decades of manpower policy in terms of the issues to which the policy has been addressed. Seven chapters focus on the following areas: the origins of Federal manpower policies; a new manpower policy; Federal Government responsibility; equal opportunity and the War on Poverty; two appraisals of the  Johnson years; the Nixon administration; a comprehensive manpower revenue-sharing program; and, massive unemployment: a new manpower challenge. A table providing statistics on enrollment opportunities, first-time enrollments, and Federal obligations for work and training programs administered by the Department of Labor by program for fiscal years 1963-1974 is provided in the appendix.

        "description":"The anthropologist sees specific human non-verbal behavior as the medium through which relationships are maintained, regulated, and guided within culturally prescribed patterns. The spoken language, the use of space, eye-contact, smiling, and the use of the hand constitute unique patterns of behavior that are culturally specific and have wide variations cross-culturally. Cross cultural interferences in communication are largely the result of mistaken assignment of meaning. Some of the most perplexing cross cultural misunderstandings can occur when two people's patterns exhibit highly overt similarity and in fact have a significant number of identical forms and associated meanings, yet differ on more subtle levels. Included in the educational implications of cross cultural  non-verbal problems is the level of detail that is required for the study of children from distinct cultures in different contexts. When considering what can be done for the urban classroom teacher, some of the answers may lie in equipping them with knowledge about the children's culture and with empathy. It is also important that teachers attempt to make up for gaps in knowledge by developing an open sensitive mind that actively impedes the formation of ethnocentric value judgments. (Author/AM)",

The National League of Cities, which manages an urban research program called the Urban Observatory subcontracted the work to member Observatories in the cities of Albuquerque, Atlanta, Denver, Kansas City (Missouri and Kansas), Nashville, and San Diego. The project, initiated in the summer of 1970, was completed in the spring of 1972. The inquiry was limited to six social domains: income and employment, health, education, public safety, housing, and air pollution. For each domain there was at least one indicator on which information was uniformly gathered by each of the network cities. In addition, the research staffs were encouraged  to develop other measures of social conditions on which local data was readily available and which highlighted important trends or problems. The text is divided into two major sections. The initial chapters provide an historical overview and theoretical discussion of central issues involved in social reporting, social indicators research, and social monitoring. The remainder of the volume is concerned with the development and application of specific measures to the six social domains selected for investigation. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In order to examine empirically the impact of race on aspects of the nature and etiology of criminal deviance, questionnaires were administered to 234 predominantly lower class black and white inmates in a prison for youthful offenders. The data thus provided indicated that the different experiences associated with race in contemporary America provide a major cutting-edge in the expectations and self-perceptions of these youths. While both blacks and whites interviewed show similar criminal histories, increasing levels of criminal income and of the expected value of criminal choice are associated with increases in self-esteem and self-stability for blacks, but with decreases in esteem and stability for whites. In corollary fashion, while both races sampled appear to define  themselves as more \"criminal\" than \"straight\", increasing criminal identification is associated with marked decreases in self-esteem and stability for whites, but only marginal decreases for blacks. Such differences do not appear attributable to the potentially confounding influence of socioeconomic status, but, on the contrary, suggest that racial experience has been badly neglected as a factor in the process and perception of becoming criminally deviant. Race-specific etiological scenarios consonant with the present data are offered for consideration in future research. (Author/JM)",

This paper intends to demonstrate the need to juxtapose the relevant attitudes and perceptions of affected residents alongside primarily political factors in evaluating the potential viability of community control. Three low income New York City districts peopled predominantly by blacks and Puerto Ricans compose the sample. Results reflect general support for community control in principle and a desire to share decision making powers with non-residents. Significant  differences in viewpoint are associated with type of program affiliation: resident staff, program clients, and general community inhabitants. Degree of local autonomy bears little relevance. Provisional support for an overlap model of community control is provided, based on political feasibility and positive resident feelings in the context of a cooperative working relationship with outsiders.

Forty black and 40 white college students were administered the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale and a series of memory tasks about which contrived feedback was given. As predicted, results indicate no significant differences between the races on global measures of self-esteem. Racial and sexual differences are found in post-experimental ratings of ability to memorize. Although there are no significant differences in actual performance, remarkable differences are noted in self-evaluation between those given negative and those given positive feedback. Differences are observed between blacks and  whites, especially white men in their level of self-evaluation in the presence of external feedback. White men are less affected by negative feedback than blacks and white females. These differences support the existence of differential expectations and feedback on the part of social systems along racial and sexual lines. Results of the study have an important implication for subsequent research on self-esteem and race. It is important that the distinction be made between report of self-evaluation that occurs in a context of specific feedback and one which does not, because the choice of one procedure over the other may determine whether racial differences will be found.

A section providing facts about the schools describes ethnic content,  target students, socio-economic background, staffing, and funds follows. Section IV provides a listing of other schools and special projects suggested by various program units within the State Department of Education. Among these are incentive grant programs, programs providing alternative solutions to educational needs and problems, demonstration programs in reading and mathematics, library-media projects, and environmental education programs and projects. A directory of career education project sites is provided.

Parental involvement in the school program is seen to be extremely important to the effectiveness of educational programs in meeting the needs of children. The goals of parents for their children ought to complement those of  the school and the goals of both these institutions ought to reinforce one another. The primary responsibility for initiating good relations between the school and the home is seen to rest with the school personnel; however, the parents are also to be interested and supportive of the school program. A list of factors that the school must be concerned with, such as developing positive attitudes within parents toward the school, as well as a list of factors that parents must be concerned with, such as having full information regarding their child's intellectual, physical, social, and emotional growth are given.

It also contains a discussion of the institutional changes which have resulted  from the ECE reform. Since some ESEA Title I funds are being used to serve very distinct populations such as handicapped students and neglected youth, a special section about these specialized efforts is included. Among the findings are that ECE school are making major changes throughout many program areas, and that statistically, students in the ECE process achieve significantly higher than do matched groups of students not in the program.

In the first section, a model of how various community characteristics influence the occupational standing of black males is constructed. The second section varies the definition of upper status positions in order to study the sensitivity of the conclusions to the particular index break point employed. In the third section, the model is recast in a new frame work (that of \"elasticity\") so that the importance of various community characteristics can be  assessed from the perspective of the amount of change in the levels of the racial status terms which they are capable of producing. In the final section, the implications of these analyses are reviewed as they pertain to the traditional formulation of the status attainment process. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The relative importance of factors such as student characteristics, prior contact with the other race, opportunity for contact in the present situation, and conditions of inter-racial contact are examined in order to determine how they predict the social outcomes of inter-racial contact in high schools. Multiple regression analyses are performed which relate the total set of predictor variables to each of five dependent variables: friendly contact, friednship relations, avoidance, unfriendly contact, and opinion change. Data obtained are from both black and white students in all of the Indianapolis, Indiana public schools. Findings are consistent with previous work, which indicates that interracial hostility at the individual level may be in part a manifestation of a generally  aggressive personality, and that positive prior opinions do not lead to more positive opinion change. Among the findings, which are presented in a tabular summary, are: that more early positive interracial contacts contribute to more interracial contact of any kind; that family attitudes are a somewhat more potent influence than peer attitudes among black students with the reverse for whites; and, that there is little relationship between interracial behavior and attitudes and the relative status of blacks and whites. Among whites, only the personality indicator and sex made substantial contributions to predicting unfriendly interaction with blacks. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Although the systematic study of black people is much needed and long overdue, black studies programs as they exist are faced with problems and pressures concerning the way they have been created. Responding to black students demand for such programs, in some cases colleges have acted in haste and neither have recruited well-trained, intellectually accomplished scholars in black studies, nor students who have the command of language or of systematic analysis necessary to meet exacting standards. The particular direction these programs have taken can be understood against the background of the educational situation of black students and of the push for increased black enrollments, creating many cases of mismatchment of students with institutions. That the future of special black  studies programs and departments looks grim is a viewpoint that is a viewpoint that is not shared by the second contributor to this pamphlet. Here, black studies are defended, for they represent the most likely institutional structure under which courses of and about blacks are best organized and taught. The problems of black studies can be solved through proper organization and scientific conceptualizations. Where universities are able to organize and staff good black studies programs, they should do so. (Author/AM)",

Information on home background was collected by means of interviews of non-English speaking parents, and a questionnaire for those who speak English. Some of the areas covered in the interview and questionnaire include language usage in the home, educational level and work histories of mother and father, and the parents' aspiration for the child's future education and career. The main findings was that there are marked and consistent differences in performance between English and non-English speaking  children. Differences in socioeconomic status and other background variables that were likely to be related to school achievement were also noted. Yet despite these, there were no noted significant differences in general ability among the children with over five years of residence in Australia. No differences in achievement on the concept development and arithmetic tests between the children at the higher levels of the primary school were noted. The results indicate that there were no differences in the potential achievement of Australian and non-English origin migrant children and that differences on the language based school achievement tests could be overcome by appropriate educational programs.

St. Mary's High School, a private high school, also participated in the Title I program. A primary thrust of the Title I project at the four District High Schools was a clinical reading program designed to alleviate reading deficiencies of target students as indicated by scores on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills. Carl Hayden and North High Schools also had supplementary  compensatory programs in English/Writing and Mathematics. The Iowa Tests of Basic Skills and writing samples were used in evaluating the English/Writing programs. The Shaw-Hiehle: Individualized Computational Skills Test was used in the Mathematics programs. The Continuing Education Center used the same instruments for Reading, English and Mathematics, whereas the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills-Science and Social Studies-were used to evaluate progress in science and social studies programs. The total number of students served during the course of these programs was 3,171. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"An Elementary Secondary Education Act Title I English/Writing project was continued at two Phoenix Union high schools, Carl Hayden and North High Schools, in 1974-75. Although the objectives and instructional method (individualized, diagnostic, prescriptive approach) were the same at the two schools, the entry level skills and abilities of the students, as well as the instructional materials and procedures, were different. The past year, 1974-1975, was the first complete year for the Title I English/Writing Programs in the Phoenix Union High School System (Hss). This report presents the results of the English/Writing program on students' writing proficiencies. Two samples of students' writing were collected at the beginning of the course and again at the end of the course. The  samples included unstructured personal writing and structured order letter writing. Random samples for rating by an independent rater were chosen from those students with a complete set of pre and post writing samples. It is concluded that students who were enrolled in Title I and Phoenix Union High School System English/Writing classes improved their personal and order letter writing skills. Compared to students in Phoenix Union High School System classes, students in Title I classes made greater gains in personal writing skills and similar gains in order letter writing skills.

The following program elements are described: participant characteristics, objectives, personnel, organization  details, activities and services, instructional equipment and materials, information dissemination, community development, and budget. The third party evaluation involved two aspects: (1) a process evaluation utilizing planning and process evaluation worksheets to evaluate the program's functions, and (2) a product evaluation surveying participant reactions in relationship to the program's 12 objectives.

A two-way test, college self-appraisal with third party validation of the self-appraisal, is utilized to assist community colleges in future institutional planning and allocation of resources. Reliability of the COPES process was tested by conducting two independent site visits at five participating colleges in California. The degree of agreement between the two groups, separately considering the same information and following the same procedures, was examined. Ratings of the two teams on 60 evaluation items (which were based on COPES criteria statements) were compared. The test results revealed some  rating imbalance due to different rating approaches and inadequate heed or misunderstanding of criteria. A discussion of reliability test results and discernible factors affecting reliability includes tabulated data. Recommendations for improving the test are presented based on an analysis of the findings.

        "description":"Reports and studies on the achievements of vocational education over the last 10 years suggest that vocational education has not succeeded in offering programs that adequately prepare high school students to enter the world of work. Vocational training in specific skills at the secondary level is not sufficient for future employment since other, additional skills (reading, writing, and math skills and sociability) are needed. The separation between general education and vocational education has a detrimental effect on students if intellectual growth and actual experience are perceived as two unrelated processes. The two areas should be reconciled because general education offers important skills necessary for occupational success. To achieve this reconciliation, vocational  education in secondary schools should broaden its purpose and scope beyond skill training and come to a realization that knowledge in other areas is needed in the world of work. This has wide implications for agricultural education and teacher educators if the vocational and educational needs of the student are to be met. A list of references is included. (EC)",

        "description":"The document reports findings from a multiple jobholder survey. About 3.9 million workers (4.7% of all employed persons) held two or more jobs in May 1975. The multiple jobholding rate for men (5.8%) was higher than the rate for women (2.9%). Over half of the moonlighters held two nonagricultural wage or salary jobs. The incidence of multiple jobholding varied according to age, sex, and marital status. The number of female multiple jobholders increased during 1970-75 in industry and occupation of primary job. Multiple jobholding rates for male teachers below the college level was higher than for any other male occupation (16%). The larger proportion of male moonlighters had second jobs as farmers or professionals (17% each). Agriculture plays a much larger role in multiple  jobholding than in the general labor market. A review of the kinds of secondary jobs held by moonlighters as related to the job desires of the unemployed suggests that very few of the unemployed would take the jobs held by moonlighters. About 35% of multiple jobholders held second jobs to meet regular expenses (one-half of black moonlighters and one-third of white moonlighters). Definitions of basic labor force concepts are given. Supplementary tables support the analysis. (Author/EC)",

        "description":"Volume 1 of a study designed to conduct a state of the art review of driver problem assessment consists of a review of related literature. The purpose of the study is to identify diagnostic assessment techniques in isolating driver problems. The review was based on three levels of information sources: (1) information from primary sources--driver licensing file, (2) information from secondary sources--other agencies, and (3) information from direct driver measurement. Each level is further divided into the following conceptual areas: (1) driver performance and ability, (2) human condition and states, and (3) exposure variables. Level 1 data sources have the greatest current utility for diagnostic assessment in an operational setting, based on the relatively inexpensive means of  data retrieval and the consistency of significant predictors found at this level. Level 2 data present several legal and logistical problems due to the privileged information requirements and a lack of coordination between agencies. Level 3 data usually require further research before their operational utility can be determined since they are currently not widely used for assessment in social control agencies. The discussion is supplemented by illustrations and tables. A list of references is given for each chapter, and an author index is included. (Author/EC)",

Target groups for driver countermeasures are identified from research on diagnostic predictors and performance criteria. A diagnostic assessment model is presented which incorporates assessment techniques that were useful in an operational setting. The model is intended to serve as a practical guide for the operational assessor in the traffic enforcement/control system. The development of the diagnostic assessment model focuses on the interaction of the driver, the enforcement system, and social institutions which are concerned with remediation of the driver (courts, licensing agency, and social rehabilitation agencies). Guidelines for the operational implementation of the model are  presented in the following areas: administrative procedures, operational requirements for assessment, sample driver assessment, and options for indepth diagnosis. State requirements for the implementation and validation of the technique are cited. An evaluation plan for the validation of the model is presented through a pilot study. Concurrent and predictive evaluation, and a long-term plan for integration and diagnostic approaches and countermeasures. Other measurement and assessment materials are appended.

Among the study's findings, obtained through surveys of secondary sources, visits to systems, State and Federal agencies, and interviewing and questionnairing of knowledgeable persons, are these: a lifelong career development model is replacing static conceptualizations of  career choice; secondary students seem to desire various types of direct job experience; and two new practices consonant with developmental theories, career education and the computerized career guidance system, are emerging to supplement counselors' efforts. Thirty-three recommendations emphasize specific research needs and urge Foundation cooperation with other named agencies, particularly to improve the data base for a labor market information system. The recommendations reflect authorities' responses indicating that improving guidance materials and procedures for science students necessitates improving them for all.

The interviews were conducted at the time of exhaustion and four months later in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, and Seattle. UI exhaustees are a relatively representative cross-section of unemployed individuals, although older individuals and white women are disproportionately represented. The study determined that: (1) extending benefits keeps many individuals above the poverty line, but extended benefits also provide income to some families who already have relatively high incomes; (2) consideration of income and payroll taxes does affect the replacement ratio (the ratio of UI benefits to earnings on the pre-UI  job); (3) substantial numbers of exhaustees became reemployed within four months after exhaustionof benefits; (4) exhaustion of UI benefits led to a substantial loss in income for many families which could only be compensated for by reducing expenditures on food, clothing, recreation, and entertainment; and (5) few exhaustees received benefits from other types of transfer programs with the exception of the Food Stamp Program. Three appendixes consider the statistical methodology, sample selection and field procedures, and research related to unemployment insurance duration policy issues and the exhaustion of benefits.

Organizing for successful instruction is the topic of the fourth chapter, which presents overviews of team teaching, large and small group instruction, independent study, flexible scheduling, and  evaluation. Chapter 5 provides a curricular framework for the career development sequence of career education (focusing on career exploration), in which subject areas are coordainted through the occupational cluster concept and goals are structured by reference to eight skills categories. Chapter 5 also summarizes four phases of the career development sequence: career awareness, career orientation, career exploration, and early career preparation.

A telephone survey instrument, utilizing these 27 basic survival skills plus job attitude and demographic questions, was pilot-tested and then used for interviewing 589 workers throughout the State of Illinois. Responses were grouped into nine occupational classifications and analyzed. The following skills appeared to be important for occupational survival regardless of occupational  classification: being dependable, giving an honest day's work, knowing what is expected of you, maintaining good health, and managing time and materials efficiently. Priority differences in the types of survival skills needed in specific occupations are also examined. Most workers indicated salary, security, or work satisfaction as reasons for keeping a job. Interpersonal relations was most often cited as a job aspect that was disliked. Tables indicating response by occupational classification and by occupational survival skill are presented. (LH)",

        "description":"An assessment of the reliability of the followup questionnaire given to 715 graduates of the postsecondary Minnesota Area Vocational-Technical Institutes is presented. The questionnaire was designed to gather information that would facilitate decision making concerning vocational programs. Reliability was based on the consistency of group responses which are categorized according to their rate of response: early-returners, intermediate-returners, and late-returners. A random sample from each of the three groups was given the followup questionnaire for a second time one week after they completed the questionnaire originally. Data from separate items in the questionnaire were analyzed based on the original and duplicate responses of each group using the following methods:  chi-square, perdent of overlap, degrees of freedom, and significance level. The analyses revealed that the data gathered from the student followup questionnaire were sufficiently reliable to be used as a source of information. However, some items indicated less reliability and included those which required students to judge the training curriculum, school and community services, and items relative to salary and number of months employed. A copy of the questionnaire and 21 tables which present the crosstabulation of original and duplicate responses are appended. (Author/EC)",

The Army develops its training program twice a year, determining training requirements for the following year through personnel inventory, analysis model, and manpower program data. These methods were found not to accurately reflect Army requirements for each skill specialty, and recruiter contracting practices often committed the Army, in advance, to train enlisted personnel in specific skills which were overstaffed and had no valid training requirements. Present training program practices could cause the Army to train over 5,900 personnel in excess of requirements in some specialties, at a cost of $20 million, while not training enough  people in other skill areas. It is recommended that the Army improve its methodology for determining skill-training rates, minimize overcommitments in more easily filled skills by constraining recruiters, and promptly renegotiate contracts in skills with fiscal year 1976 recruiting overcommitments.

Following an introduction, part 2 describes the Center program, part 3 consists of a program analysis, and part 4 contains a summary and recommendations. The program analysis contains comments on the Center's clientele and needs; program preparation (identification of target groups, participant selection, resource personnel, and involvement of employing agencies); and program implementation (successful and less successful courses, curriculum methodology, learning materials, audiovisual aids, library, supervision, course evaluation, and participant/employer/trade union reactions). Workers  have benefited from their training in personal fulfillment and career mobility, and the Center has been able to establish rapport and empathy with workers, voluntary agencies, and resource persons. However, the organization and success of courses has varied, and there have been periodic spells of stagnation affecting the growth of the Center. Much future effort needs to be directed to course planning and formulation to adopt a truly innovative and interdisciplinary approach. Part 4 presents 26 recommendations and 10 prospects for the future. Course details and case studies of selected courses are appended. (EA)",

The first study looks at changes in relative earnings and evaluates them in the framework of alternative labor market models. It concludes that workers tend to leave their employer less as vesting status or retirement eligibility approaches and that higher wages generally tend to inhibit exit. The second study attempts to measure the extent to which firm exit is constrained by specific provision (such as vesting) of private pension plans. It concludes that the size of monthly benefits acts as a powerful determinant of firm attachment patterns, with higher monthly  pension benefits tending to reduce firm exit rates among those approaching retirement eligibility and to increase exit rates for those already eligible for retirement. Both studies use the Social Security Administration's LEED data file. (Author/JR)",

A telephone survey instrument, utilizing these basic skills plus job attitude and demographic questions, was pilot-tested before interviewing 589 workers throughout Illinois. Responses were grouped into nine occupational classifications and analyzed. Chapters include: (1) Introduction, examining the problem, limitations, hypotheses, assumptions, and definitions; (2) Review of Related Literature; (3)  Methodology, discussing study design, instrumentation, pilot test, study population, data collection, and analysis; (4) Discussion of Results, examining interviewing, sample characteristics, frequencies, means and discriminant analysis for survival skills, and frequencies for work satisfaction; and (5) Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations. Nineteen tables and five figures supplement the text; survey instruments and supplemental tables are appended.

Related occupational summaries show the specifications for each job, the job description, basic qualifications, additional training needed, sources of training, and entry and advancement information. The training modules cover 46 courses of instruction to be included in each training program. Each module has statement of purpose, content, topics, and effective training procedures. The  modules may provide the basis for the development of a training program manual for wastewater treatment plant workers.

Approximately 50,000 Indiana high school seniors were surveyed as to their educational and employment plans and their vocational choices. The seniors were given lists of nearly 400 occupations, arranged in career clusters, together with lists of colleges, universities, and training institutions to suggest available options. The survey instrument used for seniors in three previous classes was revised and mailed to all Indiana high schools. Tabulated responses make up the bulk of the document and are presented in two parts, statewide  survey results and survey results from each of Indiana's 14 planning and development regions. Principal areas covered by the survey included senior characteristics, characteristics of head of household, plans after graduation, career choices, college and university choices, and educational or training program choices. Other areas covered include student career interests, reasons for planning to delay or not to continue education, and educational financing methods. A sample copy of the survey package is appended.

This document is the result of more than a year of study and direct consultation with hundreds of professional and lay persons and includes their subsequent reactions to a first of a proposed plan completed in July 1973. It presents the results of the most comprehensive study of pupil personnel services ever conducted in California and the means of improving those services. Members of school district governing boards, superintendents of schools, principals, pupil personnel specialists, and concerned  citizens will find in this publication significant proposals for improvement that should be useful. The four major subjects dealt with in this publication are the following: (1) results of a statewide assessment of the needs and problems of individuals and society in relation to pupil personnel services; (2) plan of the State Department of Education for improving pupil personnel services in California; (3) development of plans for improving pupil personnel services provided by offices of county superintendents of schools and school districts; and (4) promising practices and programs in California schools related to satisfying identified individual and societal needs through pupil personnel services.

Physical punishment is still quite prevalent in the United States and Great Britain. Many studies indicate that not only does physical punishment not prevent the recurrence of undesirable behaviors, but it leads to psychopathology, especially delinquency and aggressive anti-social behavior in the child. As to the consequences of psychological punishment such as love withdrawal and ridicule and guilt induction, research results are not very clear, though there is some evidence which suggests psychological punishment also leads to anxiety and psychopathological disturbances. Several alternatives to punishment as child rearing practices are suggested: the training in behaviors which  are incompatible with the disapproved responses, and parental action contingent upon the child's commission of a deviant act. Empathy and reasoning should govern parental discipline, and the latter should address itself to the reasons rather than the consequences of children's misbehavior. The authors conclude that parental discipline should be a public, rather than private issue. (Author)",

As compared with women entering traditional fields, women entering nontraditional careers will be more likely to have a boyfriend who is supportive and tolerant of a nontraditional career.

Moreover, research indicates that preconscious and emotional elements play an important role in creativity. Consequently, the authors devised special teaching procedures to teach certain skills and means of using emotions to facilitate creative thinking and behavior. This booklet presents various procedures and programs which can be used in a  variety of situations, such as in the classroom, creative arts, testing, and the media to help people be more creative.

Ideally, one should blend selfessly into a system of &quot;other directedness.&quot; One must give indiscriminate devotion to his colleagues, for it is immature and divisive to like certain group members more than others. It is more important to avoid embarrassment or conflict than to search for or insist on the truth. One must endure and not complain. In traditional organizations responsible behavior is created more by inner values than by outer controls. Love of company and seniority are more important considerations than performance in promotion decisions. Management is based more on persuasion than direction and the system supplies little personal  authority to go with responsibilities. Through careful selection and the constraints of lifetime employment traditional organizations have exploited the unique personal selflessness created by the Japanese socialization process. They have harnessed the power of shared values and commitment to the utmost. Otherwise, their practices might well have produced helpless indifference and inefficiency. In view of current trends in technology exchange, international economic conditions, and defection of many Japanese youth from traditional values, one wonders if the traditional system of management can survive in its present form.

The attentional training factor was not significant, indicating that the visual attention of preoperational stage children could not be improved using the methods employed here. (Author)",

        "description":"This study investigated two questions: what relationships exist between a teacher's knowledge of reading and the teacher's ability to solve problems in reading? and What effect does teacher effort have upon teacher knowledge and the teacher's problem-solving ability in reading tasks? Three instruments (the Artley-Hardin Inventory of Teacher Knowledge of Reading, the Powell-Stoll Problems in the Teaching of Reading test, and the Blair Teacher Effort Scale in Reading) were administered to 36 reading resource teachers in a school system in North Central Florida. From the data it was concluded that the three stage model of studying teacher proficiency has merit. There is clear evidence that there is a significant relationship between the teacher's knowledge in reading and the  teacher's ability to solve problems in reading. The evidence in this study indicated little relationship between knowledge and problem-solving ability with teacher effort. It was recommended that teacher education programs redefine techniques for the diagnosis and prescription of teacher proficiency. (TS)",

The author of this paper looks at the diverse sets of criteria commonly used, the problems associated with these standard approaches, and the two different sets of criteria for word recognition error ratios to be offered for each condition under which the perception data was obtained. A rationale for each of these sets of criteria is presented for each assessment condition as they are developed within a partial theoretical framework.

The subjects were 60 children, divided into three age groups of ten boys and ten girls each; group one, ages 3 1/2 to 4 1/2; group two, ages 4 1/2 to 5 1/2; and group three, ages 6 to 8. The children's comprehension of factive and non-factive predicates was studied by having them choose one of two possible agents after hearing affirmative and negative factive and non-factive sentences. They could choose the agent mentioned in the complement, thus affirming the complement, or choose the unmentioned agent, thus denying the complement. Competence  increased into the early school years; the oldest subjects showed a fair mastery of the factive predicates of the study and also showed both general and fine discrimination of the semantics of the non-factive predicates, particularly between the semantics of &quot;true&quot; and &quot;posible&quot; versus those of &quot;think,&quot;&quot;want,&quot; and &quot;desire,&quot; The simplest factive, &quot;know&quot; was comprehended earliest of the studied factives.

It was found that in both spoken and written conditions, the order of recall was meaningful, then anomalous, and finally random words, suggesting that syntactic and semantic demands of spoken and written sentences were similar. Poor readers were inferior to good readers on written presentations. The groups were similar on spoken presentations. The reading comprehension deficiency could not be attributed to inadequate psycholinguistic processing, memory, or automaticity in  decoding. Incomplete decoding during silent reading by poor readers was supported as an explanation. (Author/JM)",

Each passage described the characteristics of a series of entities (diseases or countries) along a series of dimensions (symptoms, cause, etc., or climate, soil type, etc.). The first passage described five diseases and was organized by name; each paragraph treated a different disease in turn. Second passages were either name-organized or dimension-organized (each paragraph treats a different dimension), and discussed one of three different contents. A change in organization from first to second passage was expected to reduce interference. Instead the effect of a change in organization was moderated by the structural relationships that existed between the original and  interpolated passages. The third experiment demonstrated that when subjects were made aware of the underlying structures of the passages, retroactive inhibition was eliminated. These findings have implications for understanding the nature of the memory structures and encoding strategies employed by subjects while learning from reading. (Author)",

Using data gathered by the Publishers Information Bureau which show how much each advertiser spends in each consumer magazine, the researchers considered many periodicals to see how much money they receive from the government and what part of their advertising revenue this money represents. The years between 1960  and 1973 were considered, and thirty-four magazines are listed with the years in which U.S. government advertising accounted for between one and ten percent of the magazines' total advertising revenue. The authors feel that the fact that the federal government has become one of the largest national advertisers is a cause for concern, since it may be considered a form of propaganda distributed internally and paid for by the target audience.

        "description":"Current uses of standardized English tests are adversely affecting students, misleading lay people, and having a pernicious effect on the English profession. These tests are severely limited, incapable of assessing speaking skill and effectiveness, reading interests, appreciation of literature, listening skill, understanding and appreciation of nonprint media, or the development of values through literature. The public needs to be made aware of these truths: standardized norm-referenced tests may have little or nothing to do with the content and quality of the English language arts program in a particular school; testing and evaluation or assessment are not synonymous; ability to read and commitment to reading are not the same; eighth grade reading ability is a construct, not a  reality; the teaching of reading, writing, speaking, and listening is a responsibility to be shared by all teachers and by parents; tests which are not diagnostic are educational dead ends; schools and teachers are not responsibile for social conditions that militate against learning; and high performance on a test is no guarantee of recititude. Tests too often divert us from asking the truly significant questions. (JM)",

The course begins with a theoretical discussion of design, and then examines practical applications in the areas of photography, graphics, film, and television. The subject covered in greatest depth in this course is typography. &quot;Introduction to Advertising&quot; is designed to provide basic information on the theory and practice of  advertising throughout the media. Like the other courses, it is more of an attempt to develop taste than to develop skill. &quot;Advertising Copywriting: Print&quot; is a course in writing and visualizing advertising copy for the print media. Practical experience is gained by the students in regulation copywriting and layout exercises which are evaluated and criticized in laboratory sessions. (TS)",

A shorter lag appears more appropriate for television agenda-setting. Within the framework of agenda-setting research, this paper demonstrates the need for more precise theorizing, methodologies, and identifying of causal relationships in nonexperimental settings. Cross-lagged correlation is illustrated as one technique for empirically identifying the appropriate time lag and aiding in the development of agenda-setting theory. It is concluded that further research should focus on specifying the causal process suggested in the  agenda-setting theory of media effects, as well as on developing new methods for measuring and relating media and public issue agendas.

Articulating the language arts curriculum is talking about it to and with peers, with students, and with oneself. It is argued that this dialogue and internal searching for a directional sense for the language arts curriculum is actually the basis for the curriculum itself. Language arts curriculum articulation should focus upon the search for reasonable assumptive bases for the program, a thorough explication of the program, and the design of a conceptual framework for teaching language arts.

In addition, a grasp of productive teaching methods is essential concerning the following: the importance of writing, audience, writing as process, positive instruction, and students' responsibility for their own writing. A special course in \"Writing for Teachers of Writing\" can provide practical work in tutoring, editing, and grading, as well as make available student teaching placements which emphasize written work. In  order to sensitize prospective teachers to their students' needs, the quality of their own prose should be examined, and the following questions answered: What is a writing teacher? What's wrong with writing teaching today? What are the elements of effective writing instruction? In simulation of their future classroom experience, prospective teachers work in small groups, learn audience definition and response, work as tutors, and edit a class anthology. (KS)",

        "author":["Shelby, Annette N."],
        "description":"This is a historical study of the emergence of feminist rhetoric in the South. Feminism in the United States is associated with the abolition movement for it was the disaffected delegates to the World Anti-Slavery Convention of 1840 who, after being refused participation in that conference because they were women, organized the Seneca Falls Conference in 1848, the first of a series of conventions from which gradually evolved the woman's rights movement in the United States. Southern women were reluctant to embrace such a movement identified with the abolition movement, and after the war reconstruction was a primary motive at first. The commitment to feminism of Southern women, initially relatively few in number, derived from their concern for the welfare of those who had  traditionally been their responsibility. Through involvement in women's service clubs and WCTU, organizations which also provided respectability for the woman speaker, Southern women entered the political arena to support suffrage. Only through the political equality of the sexes could Southern women secure &quot;the good&quot; of society. Theirs was a rhetoric of justice--justice not so much for themselves as for those entrusted to their care. (MKM)",

        "description":"The premise of this paper is that a rhetorical analysis of Lenny Bruce's invective will help in understanding the cultural impact that he has had on twentieth century America. In evaluating his rhetoric in relationship to the audience to which he was preaching, both his rejection and acceptance are found to flow from the same point--an image of someone who was making a wholesale assault, as opposed to a piecemeal reformist modification, on the status quo. His rhetorical stance, the use of his life as the defining principle for freedom and morality, as well as his sacrastic and moralistic vituperation, account for his following in the youth counter-culture of the 1960's. An analysis of Bruce's rhetorical approach notes the fulfillment of the three criteria presented at the  beginning of the paper: being, knowing, and doing. The language and structure that his routines took functionally evolved from knowing the needs and responses of his audience and from knowing what had to be done to satisfy that desire. (MKM)",

        "description":"Recently, genre studies have become increasingly important in the area of rhetorical criticism. This method of analysis is based on the assumption that rhetorics vary situationally, like situations will produce like rhetorics, antecedent rhetorical events significantly affect the creative product, and analogy is more important than anomaly when assessing the relationship between two or more rhetorics. Subject areas most suited to the genre method are those in which seemingly separate rhetorical events culminate naturally into a single thematic strand. This type of analysis is actually not at odds with traditional (\"single event\") critical methods. Rather, as an outgrowth of traditional criticism, genre study is justified because it is most likely to promote the advancement of  rhetorical criticism, cross cultural and historical lines, and illuminate the situationally similar strategies and tactics which produce rhetorics.

The research demonstrated that children's conceptions of television's reality are multi-dimensional.

In order to assess the impact of Watergate during the months preceding the 1974 Congressional elections, 339 personal interviews were conducted during October with a probability sample of registered voters living in Syracuse, New York. Interviews focused on attitudinal reactions to Watergate, level of information about the scandal, and the voting behaviors and decisions regarding the state gubernatorial, U.S. Senatorial, and local Congressional elections. The long-term effects of Watergate were assessed in terms of changes in party affiliation, voter choice, changes in political interest, changes in political activity, and  turnout. Results show interesting patterns of media effects on the two types of variables, with attitudinal variables affecting political decisions and activity. For cognitive variables, the evidence of continual impact is less convincing. Tables of findings are included. (JM)",

Findings reveal that age is a weak predictor of the four consumer skill measures. Child-parent communication and expectations of the \"good\" consumer role predicted product-brand salience and slogan recall. Mass media and friends influence consumer activism, and school curriculum content is also associated with slogan recall. (KS)",

Key court decisions are cited because the implications of mainstreaming for contemporary education can be properly understood only within the broad context of the current legal and educational status of the handicapped. The pros and cons of the special education debate are summarized, and the classification methods and effects of labeling on children are criticized. Program attributes that seem to be essential to any effective effort to mainsteam include individualized instruction, a spectrum of services and resources, and inservice teacher training to  prepare teachers to educate the handicapped.

The development of educational specifications should be done by an educator, and it should involve and reflect the needs of the board of education, administrators, teachers, students, and the community.

        "description":"The job of superintendent is tough and demanding. Although conditions seem to be getting worse, the job has always been demanding because of its origins and its relationship with the board of education. As the job developed, dominant conceptions of leadership developed. The three dominant conceptions--teacher-scholar, administrative chief, and negotiator-statesman-have waxed and waned as time passed, yet they are all still present. They arose from the nature of the superintendent-board relationship and from the competing role demands of that beset the superintendent who has to be chief executive, professional expert on education, advisor to the board, and supervisor. Practices and beliefs grew up around these leadership role conceptions that seemed to succeed in increasing the  superintendent's prestige, salary, and tenure. However, the superintendent has always been circumscribed by a complex organizational role, the historical vulnerability of the position, and the particular set of larger environmental forces touching the local school system. This latter aspect was dominant during the 1960s. At a time when sharp external pressure strikes the schools, the leadership pattern with the strongest survival power is the negotiator-statesman.

Students' and community groups' nonnegotiable demands may also induce this fear and resistance to compromising. Subjects who believed their group member evaluated them on resisting intimidation, compared to gaining tangible outcomes, did resist agreements with the low-power person and developed competitive attitudes toward him. Subjects confronted with a nonnegotiable demand, compared to a negotiable demand, tended to resist reaching an agreement and did develop competitive attitudes. The race of the other bargainer did not appear to affect significantly subjects' reactions.

It is defined as a decision that stops a challenge to existing values or attempts to prevent something from reaching the stage of formal or overt decision-making. The common denominator is the suppression of wider participation in the formation of public policy. This paper presents the theoretical formulation, research design, and early field results from an ongoing project that is using the theory for non-decision-making to analyze the behavior of New York City high school principals. Data about four types of non-decision-making (default, abstentions, covert, and false consensus) are considered. Very preliminary and general hypotheses are that administrative non-decision-making is inversely  related to the responsiveness of the school to its clientele, that participation by the school staff and community is curvilinearly related to successful implementation of changes in the school (too little and too much impede success), and that administrative non-decision-making is negatively related to positive neighborhood attitudes toward the school in situations of impending conflict.

Students were divided into two groups that were matched according to the students' age, sex, and initial achievement level in math. Students in the free-choice group were allowed to select problems at whatever level of difficulty they wanted; students in the yoked control group were given problems of preselected difficulty. Results of the study indicate that allowing students to choose their own curriculum might have more positive effects on attentional and affective levels than  on academic performance. (Author/JG)",

The School Principals Task Inventory (SPTI I), an initial 52-item instrument, was prepared and submitted to graduate students in education. Based on a factor analysis of the responses, a revised instrument, SPTI II, was prepared and administered to a new sample of graduate students in education. Stability of the factors was tested by analyzing the  extent that the 34 retained items on SPTI II clustered similarly to the items on SPTI I. Of 12 factors that emerged from analysis of responses to SPTI I, 7 appeared in essentially the same form among the 10 factors constituting the subscales of SPTI III, a refined 46-item subset of SPTI II.

Goals of REEEP, an Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title III program, are to: prevent school failure with an intervention program which includes early identification and remediation of developmental learning deficiencies and to integrate handicapped children into the regular school program; provide in-service training to selected early childhood and kindergarten teachers and aides employed by various New Mexico school districts; and disseminate information concerning the program. Evaluation of the instructional activities was based on a  pre-posttest design using standardized tests which measured language development in Spanish and English, school readiness, and self concept and personality development. In-service training and dissemination activities were subjectively evaluated using site-visits, observations, records, and self-reports by the staff. Major findings included: students made significant gains in language development in Spanish and English and in general school readiness; students developed and/or maintained a positive self concept and substantially developed in various dimensions of personality growth; and an outstanding in-service training program was provided.

Personal interviews were conducted with 599 rural and urban households in 12 southern counties in 1972 and with 688 households in 20 northern counties in 1974. Secondary data sources were used to assess adequacy of services. Some findings were: variation in household use of health care services was not consistently related to ethnicity, education, occupation, income, or age; rural people rated travel time and distance as their biggest  difficulty; most respondents were reasonably well satisfied with both the quality and accessibility of health care services; the ratio of persons per doctor was about 20% higher than the national ratio and the ratio of hospital beds per 1,000 population was about 20% lower; general practitioners received the most visits and emergency services the fewest; and more Spanish Americans used home remedies and were more inclined to gather their own while Anglos looked to commercial sources.

In addition, parents, teachers, janitors, bus drivers, council members, and principals were interviewed via site visits to the five outlying elementary schools and Choctaw Central High School. Evaluation criteria were: objectives; administration; curriculum; in-service training; audio-visual aids; budget; safety handbook; accident reporting form; safety organizations; safety in shops; inspection of fire safety; traffic safety; first aid; first aid supplies; bicycle in-service training. Major conclusions were: (1) there should  be written objectives for the safety education program; (2) the safety education program is well incorporated in the regular school curriculum; (3) the high school driver education safety program is doing an excellent job; (4) funds should be made available for the safety education program; (5) there should be safety organizations within each school system; (6) each school should have a handbook tailored to its needs; (7) each school should have an accident reporting form to go to the Environmental Protection Agency every month.

        "description":"Economic development remains one of the most important objectives of American Indian reservations. Various programs for developing the reservations' resources have been implemented. Due to the multiplicity of needs, development policy has been multi-faceted: health programs to upgrade physical well-being; educational programs to enhance scholastic achievement; manpower programs to increase skill levels and employability; and job-creation programs and industrial projects to reduce unemployment. Thus, reservation life has improved. However, in order to determine the degree of improvement, the economic position of reservations needs clarification. This study describes the present economic status of North Dakota's Indian population and relates the current situation to major  development programs of the last decade and other identifiable factors. Data pertains to: social and economic characteristics--age, sex, family characteristics, labor force participation, employment status, occupational structure, income for persons and families, health and education; health, education, and welfare trends and programs; manpower and community developments--role of the Office of Economic Opportunity, employment and adult training programs, overall assessment of manpower programs; and land and capital resources.

        "description":"The study described the characteristics of Navajo and non-Navajo teachers and determined their similarities and differences. In the spring of 1970, 65 Navajo teachers of Navajo children and a sample of 100 teachers from the Bureau of Indian Affairs personnel including Negro, white, Oriental, and other American Indian tribes were mailed a questionnaire. Forty-two Navajo and 83 non-Navajo teachers responded. The instrument had two parts: (1) items which produced data on the teacher's background, including formal education and home style, and (2) an adjective check-list which gave general teacher perceptions of the Navajo child and four other concepts considered pertinent to the teaching process. Background data of the two groups were significantly different except in areas  pertaining to formal education and preparation for teaching. Navajo teachers started life as typical Navajos and were transformed, through education, to atypical individuals. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding their major perceptions of the Navajo child nor in their selected educational objectives for the child. Navajo teachers were more sensitive to the child and found the child to be more likable and to have more scholastic potential. The study concluded that while there were significant differences between the two groups, there were enough similiarities to form a basis for teamwork on behalf of Navajo children. (Author/NQ)",

Based on a hexagonal figure, each side represents a set of factors which may have a bearing on, or be affected by, the bilingual program's operation in a particular situation--psychological, sociological, economic, political, religio-cultural, and linguistic. A seventh set of factors are the educational ones. The model comprises three of the hexagons. Representing the total situation of a community before the program's introduction, the first hexagon includes any relevant socio-educational entity, ranging from a village or neighborhood through a school district, a geographically-focused ethnic group, province, region, or nation. The second one deals with  those factors which are more or less controlled by the people administering the program, or which may be directly influenced by the program's operation--i.e., the sources of the program's basic needs, the constraints within which the administrators have to work, the program's contribution to the community, and potential reasons for the program's failure. The third hexagon sets out the program's effects which may be on the individual participant or on the community at large. This report discusses the model, exemplifies the various factors, and outlines the interrelations between factors within and between the hexagons. (NQ)",

        "description":"During the 1974 spring semester, the Sanostee-Toadlena Title VII Bilingual Education Project focused on &quot;how and what to teach Navajo children&quot;. The on-site program included courses in human and growth development, classroom learning, production of materials, social studies, science methods, mathematics methods, developmental reading, and creative English. Trainees participated in class work with university professors and classroom and micro-teaching experiences in the two schools. Although the five professors presented various ideas of how to work with children, they basically focused on how children can best learn in school. The professors helped the trainees to: produce their own thinking and creative ideas in Navajo and English; see the value of a diagnostic approach to  language acquisition and the need for greater word attack skills; examine and evaluate their own value system and to try to figure out what and how they wanted Navajo children to learn; and integrate the curriculum using social studies, science, and math. This report contains descriptions of the experience of those who taught at Sanostee and Toadlena during the semester. Virtually unedited, the various accounts give details thought to be significant by the professor. Also included are samples of the students' creative writing and their evaluations of the creative English class. (NQ)",

Parents' education and the major family income-earner's occupation were used as measures of social origin; perceived encouragement by parents, teachers, counselors, and friends to attend college and close friends. college plans were included as measures of significant other influence. The effect of sex on the formation of educational plans was ascertained through a set of dummy variables. A proportionate, stratified, random cluster sample of 301 white high school seniors in rural Louisiana was used. Zero-order, first-order partial and multiple correlations of marital and fertility plans with  educational plans were also computed for the total sample and each sex separately. Some findings were: statistically significant influences were produced by perceived parental and friends' encouragement and close friends' college plans; sex did not have a significant influence on educational plans, but had a notable effect on parental encouragement and marital and fertility plans; the relationship between marital and educational plans was significant; and a strong positive association between marital and educational plans for females contrasted with a significant inverse relationship between these variables for males.

        "description":"Analysis of the spatial organization of Northeastern Arizona and the Navajo-Hopi land dispute affords the geographer ample opportunity to investigate the concepts of: cultural confrontation; spatial competition; the politics of enclaves and exclaves; the herding vs the farming economy; cross-cultural perceptions of boundaries and territories; the intrusion of a first world culture; and the survival of a fourth world culture. Historically, Anglo-Saxon policy has been one of forcing the American Indian to assimilate to the European ethic of land cultivation. Traditionally, the Navajo and the Hopi have had very different perceptions of territory, for the Navajo have been herders living in dispersed settlements, while the Hopi have been more sedentary living in nucleated villages.  Failing to distinguish between the two cultures, the Federal government has imposed Anglo law upon differing Indian belief systems, resulting in perpetual conflict between the two tribes and a general distrust of the Federal government. Although this dispute will be settled via the 1974 Public Law 93-531 (final settlement of the conflicting rights and interests of the Hopi and Navajo tribes), the difficulties inherent in this dispute should be further analyzed to promote an understanding of the problems of cultural and spatial confrontation encountered in land settlement and acquisition.

        "description":"Repeated encroachments by Mormons and Navajos upon Arizona lands traditionally inhabited by the Hopi American Indians occasioned the Executive Order of December 16, 1882 and creation of the Executive Order Reservation. However, assignment of lands was not limited to the Hopi, for the Order stated that the lands should be &quot;set apart for the use and occupancy of the Moqui (Hopi) and such other Indians as the Secretary of the Interior may see fit to settle thereon&quot;. Though never officially settling the Navajo on this reservation, the U.S. government did not take action to prevent further encroachment, and the Navajo continued to use these lands for grazing. Section 152, Title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations gave the Navajo grazing rights on the Navajo reservation, which  encompasses Hopi lands, and on all Hopi lands except Land Management District Number Six. Consequently, a joint-use policy has been applied to the lands in question, but such a policy has occasioned conflict between the Hopi and the Navajo. Differences in lifestyle (sedentary vs nomadic) and the Hopi's religious attachment to certain specific land formations have contributed to continued conflict between the tribes, but Public Law 93-531, enacted in 1974, has provided for final settlement of the conflicting rights and interests of the Hopi and Navajo tribes.

The sample selected for most of the data-gathering consisted of 479 students and 36 teachers from 12 schools (identified as high or low use institutions), though in some instances students and teachers from all 32 of the area's schools were surveyed. In an effort to distinguish between the effects of library use and the effects of other variables upon the user, the following data sources were utilized: (1) the proposal for  continued funding under Title III of the Elementary Secondary Education Act; (2) library use records from each of the sample schools; (3) Reading Preference Questionnaire (fourth and fifth graders); (4) Teacher Background Questionnaire; (5) Library Media Questionnaire; (6) informal interviews; (7) Library Media Use Questionnaires; (8) cloze tests (N=479); (9) Metropolitan Achievement Test (1971-72, 1974-75, and national comparisons).

In 1975, 199 students from the same rural mountain schools and 292 from 3 Fayette County schools serving low-income areas were given the same questionnaire. Both years, the urban sample was half black and half white, whereas the rural Appalachian sample was all white. The questionnaire consisted of questions about the students' aspirations and expectations, influence of various people on their future plans, and their parents' influence on their educational goals. Some findings were:  expectations were lower than aspirations both years; in 1969 only 27.8% of the black males and 25% of the white urban males aspired to professional-technical jobs, while in 1975, 58.7% and 46.3% respectively did; in 1975 black urban males projected higher career and educational goals than in 1969; white rural boys projected much lower goals in 1975; in 1975 females still projected higher educational and occupational status levels than did the boys; and black girls indicated higher parental aims, up from 74% to 82%.

Data were obtained from 378 white students in grades K-8 in 9 rural elementary schools in the Upper Cumberland region of middle Tennessee. Children's social class background (SES) was determined by their father's occupational strata (professional and business, white collar jobs, blue collar jobs and service workers) and their parental education level (college education, high school education, and below high school education). Picture-test with figures representing the upper, middle, and lower social classes was used. Figures were simple pen drawings of three men, three women, three male children, and three female children. There were also drawings of houses and  automobiles representing the three social classes. Findings included: much of the development of social class awareness occurred between first and eighth grades; the accuracy in understanding of cognitive cues increased substantially between grades one and two; most of the developmental process of cognitive class awareness was completed by the fifth grade; both SES and parental education were found to be significantly related to class awareness on all three dimensions; and sex did not seem to be related with class awareness among rural children.

The sample was composed of students in two high schools located in a &quot;wet&quot; county and a &quot;dry&quot; county. A questionnaire was administered to 525 students in 1964 and 793 in 1975. Both years, participation was voluntary and respondents completed the questionnaire in small groups of 25 to 40. The dependent variable, &quot;drinker&quot;, was considered to be a regular user of alcoholic beverages. Three types of independent variables were used to measure the amount of change by social categories of adolescent drinkers: socio-demographic factors (sex, race, age, and socioeconomic status), religiosity, and parental and peer influences.  Findings included: 60% of the respondents in 1975 were classified as &quot;drinkers&quot; compared to 37.5% in 1964, an increase of 22.5%; increase in the proportion of drinkers occurred by sex, race, age, socioeconomic status, religious behavior, parental attitudes, and peer influence; the largest increases were for whites, males, and those in the youngest age group; and religious attitudes and peer influence remained very good predictors of adolescent drinking.

A 1972 Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) survey estimated that 39% of the Indian school age population need special education services. While inclusion of the handicapped child in the public education system is mandated, there remain special problems associated with educating the exceptional Indian child. Foremost among these problems are lack of: specifications for a BIA budget line item; mandatory legislation relative to special education for Indian children; Indian special education personnel; coordination between the states, the BIA,  and the tribes; funding for Indian children in contract schools; and proper evaluation procedures relative to Indian special education classifications. Consequently, the Council for Exceptional Children has recommended that the National Advisory Council on Indian Education (NACIE) propose: priority consideration of special education for Indians by Federal agencies; a coordinated plan for Indian special education developed by NACIE; a BIA budget line item; mandatory legislation re: Indians; a special education emphasis by the American Indian Policy Review Commission; NACIE-BIA coordination in a special education staff training program.

Questionnaires were self-administered to 201 high school seniors (100 boys and 101 girls) in the spring of 1974. Information was gathered on a wide range of topics dealing with the youngsters' perceptions of their own social situations in the county and about their future plans. Dependent variable, &quot;plan to go to college&quot;, was treated as a dichotomy (those students who did or did not plan to attend a college or university). Key independent variables were social class origin, rapport with parents, and scholastic performance level. Sex was held constant throughout. The findings affirmed that parental rapport in the home  setting was an important factor affecting the educational mobility of young boys and girls in this rural Michigan county. The full impact of parental rapport emerged when viewed in the normative context of a youngster's social class background. The general conclusion was that rapport with parents was an important factor affecting the educational achievement levels of rural youngsters; it was especially important for those from lower status backgrounds and for those whose record of scholastic performance was not very strong.

Additionally, criticism from the Indian media is presented (Wassaja, The Navajo Times, The American Indian Press Association, The Ramah Navajo Broadcasting Station, etc.). Results of a survey are presented to indicate the lack of Indian representation in the New Mexico media where there is only one Indian reporter (Albuquerque Journal) and two Indian correspondents (Farmington  Daily Times and the Santa Fe New Mexican).

        "description":"Concerned with historical patterns and with comparisons from one area to another, this report traced the growth of the Navajo and Hopi populations over the past 100 years (1870-1970). Data on fertility, mortality, and migration were obtained from the: Indian Health Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Public Health Service Office of Vital Statistics, and 1950-1970 censuses. Information on migration was based on inferences from birth and death rates. It was found that the Navajo population had increased more rapidly than the Hopi population. It was suggested that epidemic disease among the Hopis until the 1930's accounted for the discrepant rates. Since the 1930's, the Hopi birth rate had declined to figures approaching the national rate, whereas the Navajo rate had declined  much more slowly. In addition, it was shown that the age-specific birth rate curves of the two tribes differed significantly, with Hopis terminating their childbearing at an earlier age. It was concluded that the Hopis had experienced accelerated demographic transition over the period of perhaps a generation, so that they had moved from a situation of high birth and death rates to one of low birth and death rates. The Navajos, on the other hand, were experiencing a more prolonged transition, with birth rates remaining high while death rates (especially among infants) dropped rapidly. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"Extant Navajo community studies conducted since the 1930's were surveyed. Data for selected social, economic, and demographic variables as reported in these studies were compared. Each community study was placed in one of three geographic classifications: western Navajo, eastern Navajo, and off-reservation. Each on-reservation area was subdivided into rural and wage work communities for comparison purposes. Comparisons among variables were made on three axes: rural-urban, east-west, and early-recent. Processes of change from rural traditional life to a modernized wage work economy was elucidated by comparing rural communities with wage work communities studied within the same decade and, whenever possible, within the same region. Since the eastern portion of the Navajo  Reservation was thought to have had more intense exposure to national influences, east-west comparisons were made to highlight the directions change was taking in the absence of comparable diachronic data. Throughout the review, comparisons among studies were made difficult by a lack of uniformity in the use of definitions and techniques of data gathering. Also differences among areas were exaggerated by the use of small sample populations even when the research design and method were adequate. Regularities of variation over time, from region to region, and between wage work communities and pastoral communities were described. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"The Federal government and private corporations involved in energy production are placing great emphasis on the strip-mining of vast coal reserves. The Navajo Nation, whose lands contain 20 billion tons of low-sulphur coal, sells vast quantities of its natural resources for use in the urban centers of Arizona and southern California. However, the benefits will not be of sufficient magnitude to significantly alter the Navajo economy. Approximately $10 million will enter the Navajo economy each year from energy-related industrial activities, whereas $380 million would be needed annually to raise the Reservation standard of living to the national average. Navajos are essentially in the same economic position, in several respects, as the residents of Appalachia. The Navajo Nation,  unlike the residents of Appalachia, is seen as a resource owner with contracting, law-making, and policy-making powers. However, decisions made by the Navajo Nation invariably are subject to Federal review, and this special relationship to the Federal government renders the Navajos semi-autonomous at best. This relationship sets the Navajos apart from the people of Appalachia in that the Navajos are a semi-sovereign political, legal, and social entity with expectations of full economic development. Yet, the Navajo Nation's economy continues to be severely underdeveloped in comparison to national economic averages. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"Navajo participation in labor unions and Navajo labor relations have undergone rapid and fundamental changes since the development of industry around Lake Powell and on Black Mesa. Early attempts to unionize Navajo workers met with stiff resistance from employees and the Navajo Tribal Council. Union entry into the Navajo Reservation was viewed as a threat to Navajo political power. In 1958, the Tribal Council passed resolutions making union operations on the Navajo Reservation unlawful. In 1961, unions attempted to hold a union election to bring Navajo and other workers at a uranium mill into several unions. The Tribal Council blocked the election, and a court case ensued which resulted in a U.S. Court of Appeals decision nullifying the Navajo Nation's legal right to outlaw union  activities. In 1971, worker dissatisfaction led to the establishment of the Navajo Construction Workers Association and the eventual establishment of the Office of Navajo Labor Relations (ONLR). The ONLR has become the chief instrument in labor relations for the Navajo Nation. Cooperation between unions and the ONLR is generally close, and presently the ONLR works with all union locals in the vicinity of the Navajo Reservation. Interviews with Navajo workers and union representatives revealed that Navajos are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of union membership. Therefore, union membership in the Navajo labor force is increasing rapidly. (Author/NQ)",

Racial and socioeconomic class comparisons were made to determine if the effects of social mobility orientations operated differentially on the early fertility of the white lower class vs the white middle class and of the white lower class vs the black lower class. The variables employed were: levels of occupational and educational aspiration; intergenerational occupational and educational  mobility; breadwinner's occupation; educational level of mother; and fertility. Results indicated: there were class and racial differences in the effect of education for self and occupation for mate on subsequent fertility; the effects of mobility orientations were the same as those of the aspiration measures but were not significant; the hypothesis was most consistently supported among the white lower class; both educational and occupational aspirations for mate were significantly related inversely to fertility among seniors; there were similarities in the white middle class for educational but not for occupational aspirations for mate and high educational but only middle range occupational aspirations for the black lower class.

It is important, then, that the Native corporations plan to train Native people as cultural resource managers to: monitor regional development plans; serve as contacts for subregional groups; coordinate the timing and execution of Environmental Impact Statements; set up cultural centers; control trespassers; serve as coordinating contacts for State and  Federal agencies involved in preservation; identify professionals as resource people; secure aid in developing Native regional plans. The Federal and State governments and the professional community can respond to this need by providing training programs (Federal and State agency internships, formal course work in related fields, and regional corporation internships) in cultural resources management that initially provide awareness and promote community involvement, preservation knowledge, and self determination. A training program should be developed immediately to insure Native involvement in the decisions relative to preservation. (JC)",

        "description":"American Indian urban immigration has put between 33% and 50% of all Indians in urban settings where they invariably are subjected to an initial cultural shock. Leaving the reservation to improve their socioeconomic status, Indians find urban adjustment extremely difficult. The Anglo culture is inherently opposed to the \"Indian Way\", for it emphasizes competitiveness, individualism, and conflict. While Indians differ considerably from tribe to tribe, in an urban setting they seek one another out and assert an identity which is distinctly Indian and different from the Anglo identity. In order to establish a reasonable relationship with the Indian, the Anglo must learn to recognize and accept the Indian's cultural differences. Among the more important cultural differences to be  recognized are the Indian's: dislike of friendly imposition; need for passive observance prior to social participation; soft spoken manner; subtle rather than overt expression of friendship; reluctance to bargain, argue, or otherwise prove himself; high esteem for privacy and non-interference; identification with the group rather than the individual; tolerant sense of time; and subtle physical expression. Among the Indian cultural practices most often retained in the urban setting are: Indian foods and languages; modest clothing; sharing; tolerance; pow-wow attendance; and trips back home for spiritual rejuvenation.

A comparison is made in terms of distance of place of origin and length of time in town for two French-Canadian migrants' folk taxonomies (taxonomies were derived from a respondent elicited domain of terms). Analyzing the changes necessary for commitment to a permanent townsman identity, this comparison elucidates the problems inherent in a French-Canadian's inability to distinguish place of origin from the mining town and to relinquish old ties over a relatively short period of time. Citing the literature of acculturation, migration, and evolving  social structure (Canada's industrial north), this paper suggests that the American Indian's lack of commitment to a townsman identity is grounded in his relationship with the land (a respect for the land that is not region specific nor significantly different in town) and a racism which implies that townsman identity is white identity. It is concluded that a particular acculturative experience wherein a migrant embraces a new identity based on identification with the town exclusive of prior identification is essential for developing the kind of commitment necessary for successful migration.

The second paper, titled \"Measuring the Cost of Non-Formal Education\", outlines the shortcomings of present cost analyses of non-formal education and, suggesting how such cost  analyses could be conducted in the future, proposes field tests for three forms (estimating costs of vocational training for youth, distribution of government costs by agency and level, and number of students). The final and most extensive paper constitutes a state of the arts review, including an introduction and summary and the following chapters: \"Towards an Economic and Social Theory of Non-Formal Education\"; \"Investment Criteria in Non-Formal Education\"; \"Application of Investment Criteria and Non-Formal Education\"; and \"Planning, Growth, Development, and Non-Formal Education\".

The present conference focused on the ways and means used in environmental education in Israel and abroad, mainly in the United States. The conference included five lectures, twenty-four workshops, and a symposium. The workshops were designed to enable teachers to experience activities, utilizing the variety of approaches which characterize environmental education, which could  then be used in developing their own programs. Summaries and descriptions of the lectures, workshops, and field trips are presented. Since an extensive list of suggestions and ideas were offered by the participants, there was a need to establish an appropriate channel to examine the suggestions and ideas and accomplish those found to be worthwhile. Hence, it was decided to establish a sub-center for environmental education under the auspices of the Israel Science Teaching Center and the Environmental Protection Service of the Prime Minister's Office.

Observing that science cannot solve all of the problems of the world, and that science education has had little effect on the willingness of the general public to accept superstitions, the author argues that instructional approaches to the testing of hypotheses must be re-examined. After briefly reviewing the development of general educational goals during the past century, the author turns to the objectives of science education. He discusses knowledge objectives and identifies four issues related to propositional knowledge. Turning to the debate over emphasis on mastery of conceptual schemes vs. understanding of scientific processes, he discusses normative and  cognitive objectives. In conclusion, he raises the question of when the objectives of science education should be stated in behavioral terms or formulated more generally. (SD)",

In 1974, thirty objectives were tested at grade 4 and forth at grade 7. For each of these objectives, this volume presents a sample item, a brief discussion of student performance on items testing the objective, remarks concerning the diagnosis of specific difficulties with the objective, and suggestions for classroom activities. Suggestions are offered to local education agencies for the use of assessment results in establishing priorities for curricular and instructional change. Specific advice for staff orientation and management strategies for teachers are also offered. Diagnostic  tests are provided for classroom use. Appendices provide a summary of statewide assessment results and a detailed list of changes made in MEAP tests between 1973 and 1974. (SD)",

The elementary teachers who had observed the university students teaching in their classrooms were given the semantic differential prior to the students teaching and following the students teaching in their classrooms. Five protocols were used to test the change in attitudes: (1) Science in High School; (2) Science as Remembered in Elementary School; (3) Science Methods Course; (4) Science in the News; and (5) Teaching Science to Children. At the end of five weeks of on-campus activities, the  university students changed their attitudes in a negative direction toward (1) and (2), but in a positive direction toward (3) and (5). Following the reality experiences with children in the field, attitudes toward (3) and (5) were even more positive than prior to field experiences.

One hundred thirty-two subjects were randomly selected from school populations, and randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Subjects in one group were given the CCRT and interviewed by the experimenter before performing four tasks; group two subjects were interviewed and tested after performing the tasks. Tasks used were: (1) providing free response explanations for four phenomena, (2) telling what might happen in a pictured situation, (3) stating a rule describing relationships depicted on cards, and (4) repeating a  story read by the experimenter. All tasks were scored for the number of times subjects used conditional language. Data on individual tasks were analyzed and interpreted. Several analyses of variance were performed, and correlational data were examined. Significant effects for grade level and interview schedule were observed for both the tasks and the CCRT. For seventh-grade students, a significant positive relationship between task performance and CCRT scores was found. (SD)",

Its objective was to investigate relationships between variables common to the arts and sciences as a means for hypothesizing alternative approaches for growth in scientific attitudes and skills. A group of PGSA students were administered four test instruments: the Biographical Inventory, Form R; the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire; the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, Figural Test; and the Pennsylvania Department of Education's Education Quality Assessment Goal VII Test of Creative Performance. Statistical procedures used to analyze the data included analysis of variance,  intercorrelations between variables, and regression. Although the data analysis was incomplete when this summary was prepared, these conclusions were drawn on preliminary results: (a) Positive relationships exist between certain art and science education constructs; and (b) Some affective skills appropriate to the development of artistic talent are related to some personality profile factors of research scientists.

The model related teaching competencies which had been identified previously by the researchers. The purposes of the research reported in this paper were to determine interrelationships among the competencies comprising the model, and to test the theoretical links between the model and the instrument designed for testing. Data were collected on student teachers (N=122) over a period of five semesters. The difficulty levels of items were ascertained and compared; items for which less than half the subjects met the criterion were identified and examined separately. Correlation coefficients were computed for pairs of competencies and  submitted to factor analysis. The first seven factors identified were compared with the seven major model components: (1) nature of content to be learned, (2) intellectual development of students, (3) objectives specified, (4) how humans learn various categories of content, (5) instructional strategy design, and (6) feedback resulting from implementation of plans.

In addition, skill development was compared between open space schools and conventional schools. A total of 903 fifth-grade pupils from seven schools were given a short revision of the Bristol Study Skills Test and a Student Questionnaire. Concurrently, teachers were given two instruments that would report their instructional practices and open classroom beliefs. The analysis of the results indicated that students experiencing high individualized science programs perform significantly better on the first four parts of the Bristol. The multivariate analysis of covariance statistically controlled for the effect of parents' educational level and  unique classroom effects. Students in open space schools likewise scored significantly higher on science-related cognitive skills than students attending conventional schools. Analysis of subgroup results (i.e., school, sex, and race) were also reported. Relationships between teachers' open classroom beliefs and their instructional practices were negligible. A similar finding was reported between student cognitive performance and teachers' open classroom beliefs. (Author/MH)",

The Panel on Extractable Resources was charged with reviewing the use of information from space systems in the operation of the extractable industries, particularly in exploration for mineral and fuel resources. The Panel concluded that operation of remote sensing systems from space will improve understanding of geological processes.  It also concluded that accurate measurement of large-scale crustal motions will lead directly to an improved theory of the processes of mineral concentration and to better selection of regions of the earth that merit exploration effort.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether success in the Science - A Process Approach (SAPA) process of classification designed for primary grade children is contingent upon the children's developmental level as defined by Piaget's theory. The investigators sought to determine whether children who had reached the concrete operational stage of intellectual development are more likely to succeed on SAPA exercises requiring multi-classification ability than their primary classmates who are at the defined pre-operational level. Thirty children were assigned to either pre-operational or concrete operational on the basis of two diagnostic instruments and their mental ages were determined with another instrument. Matched pairs, one from each developmental state, were formed  with each child having a mental age score within one standard error of one another. These matched pairs were assigned randomly to one of two teacher instructional groups and taught nine sequentially-arranged classification exercises as prescribed by SAPA. A two-factor analysis of variance with developmental level crossed with teachers was used to analyze the scores from the nine individually administered competency measures accompanying the SAPA classification exercises. The concrete operational group performed significantly better than the pre-operational group in three exercises requiring hierarchical classification and in four exercises requiring exhaustive sorting.

The goals of the project are to provide both mathematical and scientific knowledge, and to emphasize the development of tools for learning by emphasizing methods of acquiring knowledge rather than memorization of facts. Eight clusters of threads are woven through the curriculum; three of these are related to processes (observation, generalization, and linking of observations with generalizations), and five to subjects (real numbers, geometry, formal concepts of science,  scientific topics, and the links between science and mathematics). This volume presents a chart showing the relationship of these threads to individual units, a statement of skill development goals for each grade level, and brief descriptions of the individual units.

The study was conducted during the 1972-73 school year by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The mathematics assessment included six major content areas: numbers and numeration, measurement, geometry, variables and relationships, probability and statistics, and consumer mathematics. Each chapter summarizes results for one content area and indicates trends in ability illustrated by results for selected exercises. Concepts from all content areas are usually introduced at the elementary level and are then reinforced and expanded at higher age levels. In addition to age  levels, the assessment also provides results for the following groups within the national population: sex, race, region of the country, level of parental education, and size and type of community. Results for the different population groups are not given for each content area but are discussed in the data summary from all content areas.

Two salient trends identified during the compilation are (1) the attempt to make psychology content more relevant to the student's own life and (2) the individualization of instruction, making it more effective for heterogeneous student groups. The directory is divided into two major sections: the first specifies the various categories of innovations and the second consists of descriptions of the innovations themselves. The major categories are curriculum; method of content delivery; individualization of  instruction; learning through experience; evaluation, feedback and grading; and course management. Descriptions of the innovations provide detailed explanations of the programs, data on grade level, prerequisites for students, funding, evaluation, institutional characteristics, and name, address, and phone number of the innovator.

Among the 350 respondent educators, social scientists, businessmen, and others, most agree on the importance of economic literacy and its present low level in the general population. Where economics education efforts of the educational establishment are seen to be inadequate, recommendations are made to improve curriculum, train teachers in economics, and encourage or require student courses in economics education. Other, more global, needs include the establishment of specific goals of economics education, identification of skills and knowledge comprising economic literacy, and attention to the facts and processes of  economic systems. In addition, various possible characteristics of economics education are reviewed. The delphi-like process used in conducting the inquiry is explained in detail, and response data are tabulated.

        "description":"This research report focuses on the educational, migrational, and occupational characteristics of the rural-born people from various class origins in a highland minifundia community near Bogota, Colombia. Three main objectives are to describe the nature of growth and adjustment in the labor force under conditions of rapid population growth and highly skewed ownership and control of production; indicate the present limits on the quality and quantity of rural education along with limits on access to education and its role in opening new employment and income opportunities for rural people; and document the level of occupational attainment of rural-born people when controlling data for class of origin, educational attainment, and migration. The report analyzes the impact of a  shifting occupational structure on a cross section of rural families in the highland community of Fomeque. Some of the findings are that the mean level of educational attainment is less than four years of primary training; the mean occupational level for nonmigrants is directly related to degree of parental land ownership; and better educated migrants who move to urban centers enter low-level professional and clerical positions with high employment competition. Many data tables and concluding implications are included. (Author/ND)",

        "description":"This research report provides an overview of select topics in school philosophy from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools (NCA) membership in Kansas. The purpose was to examine a number of communities by attitude questionnaire to observe if stated school philosophy is a reality in school operation. Topics included philosophy and objectives, ways that needs are met, and communication among NCA members. School principals and community college presidents were surveyed, since they deal daily with a school's operation. Coded and tabulated responses constitute the major portion of the document. It is concluded that only a nebulous relationship is maintained between declared ideals written in philosophy statements and daily treatment given to students in most  public schools. The epilogue contains an examination of the responses, subjective observation of practices at many schools, and suggestions for solutions to this dilemma. (ND)",

By examining a local policy issue, transportation planning in Tallahassee, it was hoped to identify the variety of citizen participation skills needed to cope with such issues, and to see which skills were used, were effective, or were found wanting in this situation. Speakers compared the &quot;Open Society&quot; dream with realities of citizen access to policymaking, discussed  Tallahassee's planning issues as a case study, and identified numerous citizen participation skills. &quot;Awareness--Action--Persistence&quot; represents the combination of skills recognized to be essential in achieving effective citizen input.

Emphasis was on underlining the role of ethical questions and human aspirations, as well as empirical inquiry, in environmental quality decisions. The two-day program in Tallahassee, Florida, involved public officials, community leaders, environmental educators, and humanities scholars. They focused on definitions of \"environmental quality\" and \"quality of life\" in light of the role of humanities in helping redefine our values such that demands on ecosystems might decrease although population and urbanization increase. It was agreed that formal and nonformal ongoing environmental education programs are helping to direct human aspirations in ways which foster  justice and environmental quality. However, there is still a need to develop policymakers who view problems and shape trends in a holistic, interrelated manner. (AV)",

The publication discusses the philosophy behind the program and the nature of the training conferences conducted for teachers and administrators; provides sample exercises, objectives, and activities of the curriculum used; and presents an analysis of the formative evaluation. The project planners believe that humanization of elementary schools might be increased if the individual child's self-concept were enhanced through improved ability to communicate. With this idea in mind, teachers choose as the basis for their curriculum the Human Development Program of Harold Bessell and Uvaldo Palomares and use many of the communication  skill development ideas of Nicholas J. Anastasiow. Children participate in the &quot;Magic Circle&quot; and express themselves through bodily movement, art activities, and dramatics. Formative evaluation results are positive and show that participating children have become increasingly outgoing, considerate of others, and able to perform in the presence of strangers. Teachers indicate that program participation enabled them to see children as &quot;whole people&quot; and increased their understanding of children's problems and their consciousness of their own nonverbal behavior.

He describes his tours of the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs, and a factory where 1300 workers spend eight hours a day, six days a week, producing the famed cloisonne, works of jade, ivory, and filigree. During a visit to the May 7 School located near Peking, the author talks to students (most of whom are in their thirties and  forties) about their six-month course which involves them in both hard physical labor--laying brick and farming--and studying. Also described is a visit to the Shenyang factory which produces transformers for the electric power system and for export, and an interview with Teng Hsiao-p'ing, 70-year-old vice-premier of China.

Over 100 scholars and teachers reviewed 306 social studies texts in use in the 50 states in 1974-75 to discover what is being taught about Asia at each grade level. The textbooks were designated as either contributing to an understanding of Asia or distorting Asian reality. This booklet describes various textbook approaches to Asia: the Asia-centered approach, the Western-centered approach, the inscrutable Asian approach, the case studies approach, and the ethnocentric approach which treats Asian cultural achievement in a negative manner. Specific shortcomings noted in the textbooks include failure to provide Asian sources,  specific factual errors, sexism, and extreme ethnocentrism. Overall ratings and qualifications of authors and consultants are presented. Also summarized are the Asia Society's own conclusions and recommendations for action as a result of their findings. Appendices include references, textbook evaluation guidelines, and a list of the readers. (Author/DB)",

Conducted by a task force on elementary school textbooks, the study evaluated 172 texts, 65 supplements, and 24 study-print sets for sex stereotyping and sexism. Sex roles depicted for both children and adults were examined. It was found that materials not only reinforce sexism but also limit girls' aspirations and lower their self-esteem. Boy-centered stories outnumber girl-centered stories by five to one, and illustrations and content material with males outnumber those with females by more than three to one. The adults described in textbooks are as sex-stereotyped as the children. Adult males are portrayed in almost every  conceivable occupation while adult females are seen working only at traditional female jobs, and it is assumed that girls will follow the tradition. In general, women are shown to be dependent, incompetent, passive, and lacking ingenuity. Also, real-life situations are distorted or not described.

The guide is arranged by educational area. Information accompanying each objective includes the person responsible for implementation, completion date if any, and how accomplishment will be measured. For example, one  objective of music education is eliminating the type of sex stereotyping which suggests \"Boys play brass instruments, girls play woodwind instruments.\" The music coordinator is responsible for implementation of the ongoing objective. The objective is evaluated by the principal and the music coordinator who periodically review the progress. Guidelines for the evaluation of print and nonprint materials; for a positive, nonstereotyped portrayal of human roles in media center materials; and for evaluating minority group materials are included.

Intended for use in the public schools of Virginia, the publication was prepared to assist educators in developing topics of study relating to Virginia's role in the American Revolution and to help students develop deeper appreciation for their rich heritage. The study is divided into five parts. Part I, &quot;1763: The Aftermath of Victory,&quot; relates Virginia's political philosophy and tells of Britain's difficulties in meeting the costs of victory over other contenders for influence in North America. Part II, &quot;From Revolution to Independence,&quot; chronicles the decaying political relations between Britain and the colonies between 1763 and 1775. Part III, &quot;From Revolution to Independence,&quot; describes the First Virginia  Convention and the First Continental Congress and gives an account of Virginia's position as a free and independent state. Part IV, &quot;The Commonwealth of Virginia,&quot; describes military and economic activities from 1776-1782. Part V, &quot;The War For Independence,&quot; includes information on the continental army, the Indian wars, the invasion of Virginia, and Virginia's participation in the siege at Yorktown.

Four art production exercises, each calling for pencil drawing responses, were administered during 1974-1975 to a sampling of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds. Four scoring systems were developed. To be considered valid each dimension within a scoring system had to be made mutually exclusive and constant across age groups, cover the variety of responses generated by different ages, and be sufficiently replicable to be useful for assessing changes in performance. Persons of high academic ability who had previous experience in judging and codifying  written test responses were selected as scorers. None of them had any art training. Two additional persons with advance training in art were selected to train the scorers. Results show that the four scoring systems met the conditions necessary for their adequacy. Careful attention to scoring system exercise development and scorer selection and training makes it possible to test art achievement. The study includes one sample exercise and a scoring guide. Appendices include scored sample responses. (Author/RM) Primary type of information provided by report: Procedures (Scoring); Results (Respondent Examples).",

Both speakers maintain that the case method developed in law school is the most useful approach to law-related subjects because most legal cases involve \"little\" people, whose  lives and problems quite closely resemble those of the students who will study them.

Response data were weighted in order to adjust the sample to represent all students in the population and to adjust for student nonresponse. Specific questions were analyzed in cases where (1) there were empirical reasons to expect  differences between the responses of men and women and (2) the questions seemed important for engineering education as a whole. The greatest differences appeared in items concerning most important reason for selecting an engineering curriculum, field within the curriculum, immediate career plans, reading interests, and attitude toward the role of women.

The conference, which focused upon the sociology of the school and schooling at the elementary and secondary levels, was structured around three objectives: (1) provide sociologists of education an opportunity to review past work in their field, (2) explore current educational problems and policy, and (3) move toward an agenda for future research. The six papers presented are followed by comments from discussants. The first paper, by Charles E. Bidwell, \"The Sociology of Schooling,\" laid the groundwork upon which subsequent speakers were able to build. Burton R. Clark, in \"Adolescents and School Reform,\" briefed the conference participants on federal recommendations regarding  the future of secondary education. William G. Spady, in \"Authority and Empathy in the Classroom,\" presented a deductive model of teacher behavior. An alternative inductive approach was presented by Hugh Mehan in \"Ethnomethodology and Education,\" in which he showed how a teacher is likely to interact with students in ways that help construct and sustain the teacher's definition of social reality. Elizabeth G. Cohen, in \"An Experimental Approach to School Effects,\" focused on the problem of research methodology. The overriding conference issue revolved around the balance between \"large-scale organizational\" and \"micro,\" or \"person,\" oriented research perspectives. (Author/DB)",

The house and artifacts, used in the mid-1700s, were abandoned about the time the Russians first came to the Aleutian Islands. The following information is given for the different types of artifacts: actual-size illustration, whenever possible; description of how archaeologists think they were used, based on Russian accounts and contemporary use of similar objects; materials they were made of; and in what part of the site they were found. Location and material of manufacture tell a lot about the uses of the objects and resources which were available to the Aleuts. Most artifacts are made of natural substances, such as bone, ivory, and  stone. Objects made of plant material or shells probably have decomposed. Cross-sectional diagrams of the house site as it was found and as archaeologists believe it to have appeared originally are included. This handbook is intended to be used as part of the social studies unit, The Aleuts of the Eighteenth Century. (AV)",

Seventeen plants are illustrated and identified by their common names and, for many, the Latin names are mentioned, also. The plants represent a variety of habitats that include sandy areas; shaded damp areas; and exposed, windy dry areas. Students are encouraged to do individual research on each plant's habitat to gain a more complete picture of the Aleutian environment. The uses of the plants are varied: beach grass was used in weaving baskets and mats; poison extracted from roots of the monkshood was used in whale hunting; leaves of the flowering ragwort were placed on cuts and boils to help them drain; and salmonberries were  picked and eaten raw in the fall. This booklet is to be used as supplementary reading material for the social studies unit, The Aleuts of the Eighteenth Century. (Author/AV)",

The purpose of the series is to provide a better understanding of the educational process and the relation of education to human welfare. Chapters one and two examine women and schools by discussing the function of education for women and the educational attainment of women in the United States today. Chapters three, four, and five provide an historical perspective by examining the education of women in classical and medieval times, the strictures imposed on women by the British and French in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the education of women in colonial United States until the Civil War. Discrimination, sex roles, socialization, and male dominance in  school leadership are discussed in Chapters six, seven, and eight. Chapters nine through 12 deal with the work roles of women by examining vocational education, job and manpower training, and how women are faring at the academic level. Chapters 13 and 14 deal respectively with the law, and how it provides equal protection, and with political and policy studies for and about women. Appendix A contains a statistical table on Bachelor, Master, and Doctoral degrees conferred by institutions of higher education by sex of student and by field of study in the United States from 1970-71.

The activities can form the basis of a minicourse or can be used to supplement courses in sociology, psychology, U.S. history, world history, language arts, or community studies. Section One activities examine perceptions, how they are formed and how they can be misleading, and introduce students to the concept of stereotypes. Section Two activities help students to verbalize stereotypic images they may have of the Chinese and of China, and expose them to information that challenges their stereotypes. Students list things that come to mind when they think of China, list stereotypes of the Chinese while viewing a series of  contemporary greeting cards of the Chinese, and draw stick figures of the Chinese. Students then check their own images of the Chinese by examining drawings which Chinese artists have made of the Chinese, reading stories which illustrate the dominant values of the Chinese people, and looking at slides which show Chinese customs and the diversity of geography and life-styles. In Section Three students study a satirical essay which illustrates how misperceptions can become part of the context about China, look at stereotyping in a news article, examine bias in U.S. textbooks, and study the perception that their own community has of Chinese.

        "description":"In two experimental studies, the effectiveness of teaching skills are examined in the context of: (1) a specific teaching method linked to (2) specific curriculum objectives and (3) specific curriculum materials; the method and materials used are by (4) specific teachers and (5) specific students in a (6) specific instructional setting; finally, (7) tests are created that are responsive to the idiosyncratic outcomes of the teaching skills and curriculum objectives. Problems and possible solutions involved in creating such a context for studying teaching skills are examined. By referring to these experiments on how the questioning skills of sixth-grade teachers affect student learning outcomes, an example is provided of how methodological requirements are met with respect to each  of the seven context variables. Each context variable is considered separately, and the three following methodological requirements are satisfied: (1) ecological validity, the creation of each aspect of the experimental context so that it reflects real classroom teaching; (2) fidelity of treatment, a close correspondence between intended context and what actually occurs experimentally; and (3) achievement of experimental control, either by holding context variables constant or by allowing them to vary randomly. A major problem cited is the expense of conducting the experiment since resources were not already available to design and run teaching skills experiments on this scale. It was decided that in the future research costs can be reduced by designing experiments that use instructional  context developed in previous studies. (MM)",

        "description":"It has been found that student teacher attitudes toward pupil control change from relatively humanistic to relatively custodial during their student teaching experience. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the use of T-groups as an intervention for modifying teacher attitudes toward classroom control. An underlying assumption of the T-group method is that understanding and developing skills in participation can best be learned immediately through the process of group continuum to humanism on the other end. The pupil control ideology of student teachers is influenced by the role of the teacher in the schools in which they do their student teaching. A prepost test with treatment and control design was adminstered to 48 student teachers to elicit their pupil control  ideology. During the period between the two tests, the students participated in four different T-group sessions. The results of the study indicate that ongoing T-group training can work as an effective intervention in the socialization of student teachers' pupil control ideology. The results further suggest that encounter groups can be a significant force when direct application of new attitudes can be made concurrent with T-group participation. Implications for using T-groups as a means of developing more humanistic climates in secondary schools is suggested by this study. (SK)",

However, while an attempt to redress some of the worst excesses in these  areas may be essential, it is important to understand that the overall changes required are more fundamental. The requisite bureaucratic and institutional reorganization will not be achieved quickly. Strategies designed to effect change in large systems will not be uniformly accepted nor uncritically adopted. Results will not be achieved overnight. While professionals, laymen, and parents alike must certainly begin by defining problems and by being prepared to confront them, while they must be willing to examine attitudes, risk mistakes, and nurture individual strengths; they must also understand the full implication of the undertaking. A well-organized and long-term effort will be required if the ultimate goal is to affect the quality of life in the society. (DMT)",

        "description":"This monograph is one of a continuing series initiated to provide materials for teachers, parents, school administrators, and governmental decision-makers that might encourage reexamination of a range of evaluation issues and perspectives about schools and schooling. This monograph suggests a radical departure from the approaches to educational reform typical of the past two decades which represented programmatic changes reflective of specific models-- learning models; curriculum models; reading models; or program models. This essay contends that the model approach to school reform has inherent weaknesses and that the continued vitality and evolution of far reaching reform movements depend upon articulation of a methodology congruent with their philosophic orientation that will  explicate and validate their undertakings. The essay contains five chapters and a bibliography: (1) A History and Critique of Models; (2) Two Forms of Inquiry: A Comparison of Method, Logic, and Description Charts; (3) Descriptive Research; (4) The Importance of the Philosophic Outlook; and (5) Reform and Change in Education: Implications of the Logical-Technological and the Phenomenological Orientations.

The study evaluates the impact of the conceptual guide and discovery approach upon teachers, pupils, and pupils' associates. The subjects of the study are pilot teachers, the pupils in physical education classes, and the &quot;contact group&quot; of selected pupils (i.e., parents, friends, other teachers). Opinions were also solicited from curriculum specialists concerned with the methodology under study. The four major problems examined in detail in this report are: (1) the nature of the learning; (2) the nature of the student-teacher  interaction; (3) the attitude of students towards lessons; and (4) opinions and experiences of teachers. The remaining portion of the study examines a support study in relationship to this study, a product development theory and curriculum guide, and recommendations regarding the curriculum guide. The investigators found that conceptual approach lessons are characterized by substantial student cognitive behavior including ability to conceptualize, an indirect and supportive style of interaction by teachers, and positive attitude indications from students.

        "description":"Presently student teaching is an accepted practice in every school district within the United States; however, the legal status of student teachers, their liabilities, responsibilities, and rights are in many instances poorly described or even nonexistent. An examination is made of current statutory law, case law, attorney general's opinions, and agency rules and regulations regarding the legal status of student teaching in each of the fifty states. The information gathered is presented state by state addressing only what is current without attempting to present historical background. Although little has been written in the last few years on the legal status of student teachers, the recent literature is surveyed. The information is summarized in a chart that gives an overview of  the complexity on which the status of student teaching is based. It shows which of the following pertain to each state's student teaching legal guidelines: statutes, attorney general's opinions, case law, no legal guidelines, student teacher certificate issued, guided by administrative rule. As is shown, each state is somewhat unique in its view. Many states have clear statutes; other states have neither statutes, attorney general's opinions, nor case laws to follow. Three states have a system of student teaching certificates clearly providing legal status to student teachers. In those states in which the legal status is not clearly defined, some interesting questions may be raised. It would seem that without statutes, opinions, or case laws, much would have to be decided under common  law. In many instances, the student teacher could conceivably stand in a more vulnerable position than the certified teacher. It is recommended that states that have no legal guidelines should move towards enacting statutes that provide legal status for student teachers, that future research should be undertaken to examine the status of undergraduate pre-student teaching programs, and that an examination be made into the possible requirement of an undergraduate law course for student teachers.

The following three survey instruments, designed as questionnaires, were administered: (1) &quot;Unit Evaluation,&quot; INTRODUCTION TO INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION; (2) &quot;HOW WELL IS INSTRUCTION BEING INDIVIDUALIZED&quot;; and (3) &quot;Interest Finder,&quot; INTRODUCTION TO INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION. Instrument 1 was used to assess teacher knowledge about individualized instruction. The questionnaire consisted of 30 vocabulary words, which the respondents were requested to define. Instrument 2 was used to  assess the degree of classroom implementation of individualized instructional techniques by the teacher. Participants responded to various degrees of application of 20 descriptive classroom items including room organization, material usage, teaching strategies, and evaluation techniques. Instrument 3 was used to assess teacher interest in individualized instruction. The teachers were asked to select five topics about which they desired more information. The topics were selected from a list of classroom teaching methods. This survey revealed that classroom teachers are interested in using individualized instruction as a method of teaching and that teachers do desire leadership and direction in implementing this method.

        "description":"One reaction to Title IX's basic requirement for equal opportunity for physical activity and sports, regardless of sex, was the widespread reevaluation of separate programs in physical education, intramurals, and athletics. To insure that all individuals would have equal opportunity in a given physical activity program, many administrators ordered that the separate programs for men and women initiate merger plans. The Iowa State University Physical Education Departments were merged in fall 1974 and the intramural programs in fall 1975. The merging of the two programs did not create a problem. Both programs had similar operating policies and eligibility rules, and administration of co-rec sports was handled and facilitated by both programs before the merger took place. The merger  has had a positive effect and has led to an improved program in the following areas: centralized intramural office; better utilization of staff; expansion of sports offerings; one large group of participants rather than two smaller groups; equipment needs combined thereby avoiding duplication; coordination of space needs with other programs; combining of intramural meet activities to make more economical use of officials and other personnel; consistency in program policies and eligibility rules; and consolidated publicity efforts.

The service was provided so that advisory teachers would visit primary schools on invitation of the principal and help teachers with new methods and materials, teaching techniques, curriculum interpretation, and application of recent research. Data on the service was obtained from school personnel comprised of principals, deputy principals, senior mistresses, and teachers. Two questionnaires were prepared: one was administered to school personnel; the second was administered to advisory teachers. The purpose was to obtain information on issues where  distinct discrepancies might exist between the views expressed by school personnel and advisory teachers. The advisory teacher questionnaire sought information about job satisfaction and ways, if any, in which changes in operation might occur. Data collected from the questionnaires is presented in tabular form following the introduction to the document. Appendixes contain copies of the questionnaires and principal components analyses of advisory teacher role items and reactions to advisory teachers by school personnel. (DMT)",

On the basis of the findings and within the limitations posed, it is concluded that: (1) the presence of the oral lesions does not appear to be significantly related to hemoglobin levels, which fall well within the generally accepted normal limits; (2) although hemoglobin levels may fall within the generally accepted normal limits, ferrous gluconate supplements have a profound effect upon  reversal of established oral lesions and the prevention of recurrences; (3) hemoglobin levels that are at the lower limits or below the recognized minimum normal range seem to accompany or promote the occurrence of oral lesions; (4) females appear to have a tendency toward occurence of iron deficiency more often than males, and therefore show more frequent manifestations of oral lesions apparently related to the hemoglobin level in the blood; (5)when ferrous gluconate supplements are prescribed for the management of oral lesions, subjects show an increase in hemoglobin determinations, and the majority show marked improvement in the oral conditions following treatment; (6) when ferrous glutonate supplements are not prescribed for the management of lesions, subjects show no improvement; and  (7) although the regular intake of iron supplements is not recommended, some subjects require daily supplements.

The minicourses were developed primarily through consultation with experts in the field of educational media and administrators at Trenton State College. In addition to the consultations, an analysis of introductory courses in educational media was made. This analysis involved (1) the division of the introductory course objectives into minicourses, (2) the identification of specific educational media competencies, (3) the activities required of the student for developing the competencies, (4) the teaching strategies to be employed, and (5) the methods of evaluation. Three minicourses were developed through  this study, each involving 15 classroom contact hours and one semester hour of course credit: (1) Instructional Materials Production and Utilization; (2) Utilization of Projection Equipment; and (3) Utilization of Recording Equipment. Each minicourse was developed according to the course outline format required by the college for the development of all new courses: course description, specific objectives, outline of course, teaching methods, bibliography, basic requirements, evaluation of course, and new course data sheet. The planned procedures for instructional implementation of the minicourses were determined thorough an analysis, a detailed outline for each minicourse, that divides the course into competency modules with specific objectives, activities, and methods of evaluation was  developed. Outlines and competency modules are given for the three minicourses. (DMT)",

The paper includes: (1) a summary review of the types of teacher characteristics found to be correlated with student achievement and attitude; (2) a summary of the research done using the Flanders Interaction Analysis Index; and (3) a final summary and conclusions section followed by an extensive list of references. The review of available research makes it clear that good experimental research in the area of student-teacher interaction has been relatively sparse. There are a number of problems with existing studies: primarily, nearly all studies to date have been correlational in nature. Many have used scales designed for use with all  grade levels with no allowances made. Consequently, findings have been inconsistent across grade levels. A third problem is that many studies and systems of observations do not include reliability data nor is the rating scale specific to the subject matter. Probably the most important shortcoming of research in this area is that few scales take into account which students are interacting with the teacher and most use a total class mean as opposed to individual evaluations in determining academic achievement. Two final problems are that studies use a relatively low number of teachers and an inadequate number of observations of each teacher to obtain significant data. (DMT)",

Using a variety of techniques drawn from anthropology and psychology, the investigator elicited a cognitive map of school activities from intermediate grade pupils. This taxonomy of activities was then used to describe the school from the pupils' point of view. The taxonomy was refined and validated through the use of a similarities judgment instrument, and several analytical schemes were applied to this data. Finally, the intermediate grade pupils were each observed in a variety of school settings, and their behavior was coded on a scale that was derived from the  activities taxonomy. The results of this observation scale are presented and discussed in terms of the relative frequencies of the activities over settings and over pupils. The summary lists five conclusions: (1) it is indeed possible to study a school anthropologically; (2) by focusing on beliefs or what is in peoples heads it is also possible to obtain a reasonable picture of the culture of interest; (3) while elementary school students think as a group, their behavior does not always conform to the group behavior; (4) open-ended, loosely structured interviews with a few individuals can indeed provide cultural information about a group; and (5) our collective ignorance of schools is such that it is possible for a researcher to enter a school with a very open agenda and come out with  some discoveries.

        "description":"The major purpose of this study was to determine if a functional relationship existed between internship teaching performance and academic grades for Career Opportunities Program trainees who interned in three local education agency schools and attended three cooperating institutions of higher education in Alabama. Another aim of the study was to determine if there were functional relationships among internship teaching performance and self-concept or academic grades and self-concept. The Pearson product-moment coefficent of correlation was used to determine relationships. The correlation coefficent between internship teaching performance and academic grades was not significant. The data for COP trainees in one school system indicating the relationship between internship teaching  performance and self-concept (as revealed by Edward's fifteen personality variables) showed abasement to be significant. The data for trainees in the second school system indicated the relationship between internship and teaching performance and self-concept to be not significant. The data further indicated the relationship between academic grades and self-concept to be not significant. For the third group of trainees, the data showed the relationship between internship teaching performance and self-concept to be not significant excepting heterosexuality. The data further revealed the relationship between grade-point average and self-concept to be not significant excepting abasement and achievement. The data collected in this investigation sustained the hypothesis that there is no  relationship between internship teaching performance and academic grades, and rejected the five variables of the hypothesis that there is no relationship between internship teaching performance and self-concept or academic grades and self-concept.

        "author":["Whitmore, Paul G.",
          "And Others"],
        "description":"During the summers of 1970 and 1971, the Human Resources Research Organization presented a special inservice training program to elementary teachers of the River Rouge, Michigan, School District. This report evaluates the effects of this training program and focuses on the determination of gains in student achievement that may be attributed to the program. The training program--a series of workshops plus immediate follow-on efforts--sought to increase achievement in students by changing instructional practices used by teachers. The workshops focused on the following educational practices: (1) development and use of instructional objectives; (2) implementation of concepts of learning modules and mastery tests; and (3) employment of contingency management techniques in the  classroom. For grades 2-7, students of program teachers gained almost twice as much on a standardized achievement test as did students of non-program teachers; differences in mean gain scores in reading and mathematics were both highly significant. For grades K-1, students of program teachers tended to have higher gain scores than students taught by non-program teachers, but the differences were small. No single factor appears to account for the enhanced student gains produced by program teachers. They were apparently due to the integration of workshop training, trial implementation, classroom observation, availability of teacher aides, and frequent guidance and assistance provided to teachers. (Appendices include: teacher performance objectives; program coordinator performance  objectives; inferred achievement test objectives with sample test items; teacher questionnaire; administrator questionnaire; and agreement between project teachers and program coordinator.)

Getting started requires a number of key decisions: (1) on what basis should team members be selected? (2) what should be the size of the team? (3) what areas should teams coordinate? (4) how much time should be allotted for planning, and when should time be scheduled? and (5) what support personnel are needed? Team meetings can be made productive by following a few simple procedures; one team member should be selected at each meeting to prepare and circulate the agenda for the next meeting; the agenda should be short so that all items are discussed, or a standard agenda may be used; all  information and materials needed to accomplish the goals of the agenda should be a gathered and distributed at the meeting by the person selected to organize the agenda; all tasks should be specifically assigned with a completion date set; and a list of decisions, tasks, etc., can prevent misunderstandings. Finally it is acknowledged that staff resistance, personality clashes, unequal participation, poor attendance, and community/parent resistance are few of the problems that may be encountered. (DMT)",

It is clear that many elementary and secondary school teachers are becoming increasingly aware of the need for this kind of law-related education in the schools. It is also apparent that many teachers feel they lack both sufficient substantive knowledge of the law, legal issues, and legal systems, as well as the appropriate methodology for teaching law-related issues in the classroom. This pamphlet is predicated on a belief that law-related education is eminently well-suited to and needed at the  elementary school level, and is a result of a desire to aid the elementary school teacher in developing appropriate classroom materials. The lessons included are intended to serve as models to illustrate a range of approaches that can be used at the elementary school level. Techniques described are: (1) checklist; (2) open-ended statement; (3) poll; (4) continuum; (5) rank order; (6) forced choice; (7) pictures/cartoons; and (8) simulation/role play. Each sample lesson should be regarded as part of a larger unit of study, and sequenced to build upon the information, judgment, insight, and skills derived from previous lessons. (MM)",

The simplest and most common example is the teacher's evaluation of a student's answer as being either correct or incorrect. Teachers also plan subsequent activities based upon this analysis. This analytic approach adapts the instruction or practice to match the student's particular learning style or level of development. The analysis may be derived from a single response of a student in a teaching-learning situation or a synthesis of a number of observed behaviors of the student. This collection of case study materials is the product of a professional staff development project sponsored by two neighboring school districts. The concept of analytic teaching was developed to give teachers a  comprehensive, widely applicable construct, which they could readily share. The accounts relate the teachers' approaches to analysis and adaptation with editor's comments regarding the teaching techniques used; the exploration of the student's abilities; and the use of analytic teaching.

        "description":"The Indiana College-Level Manpower Study is being conducted by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education to provide manpower information of value to planning at the postsecondary level. Factors involving both manpower supply and demand are being investigated, and educational and occupational areas in which major supply/demand imbalances exist will be identified. This report deals with the supply/demand situation for elementary and secondary school teachers in Indiana's public schools. Because Indiana has a number of public and independent colleges and universities heavily involved in the preparation of teachers, the commission felt it important that an assessment be made of future employment opportunities for teachers in the state. Students, as well as institutions, will be  better able to develop plans for the future when they are able to take into account discernible trends rather than reactions to current problems. One section of this report deals with teachers employed in Indiana from 1970-71 to 1974-75. This information was included to make clear the changes that have taken place over a mere five-year period, primarily as a result of a decline or leveling in enrollments in the state's elementary and secondary public schools. Another section reports on a survey of all the school corporation superintendents in Indiana, conducted to determine their views toward the current employment situation for teachers in various teaching areas. Projections of the future demand for inexperienced teachers in Indiana's public schools are also discussed, and the  methodology upon which the projections are based is explained. The report concludes that although there will be a shortage of available teaching postitions at the secondary level, this does not mean that there will be no jobs available. There are some teaching specialty areas, particularly in the industrial arts, vocational and agricultural areas, and some areas of mathematics and advanced science, where the prospects for job applicants will be good. Combinations of two or more proficiency areas will also aid teaching aspirants in their search for employment. (MM)",

        "description":"Competency based teacher performance and competency based teacher education represent an attempt to marry scientific methodology with instruction. This is not the first time that such a union has been attempted--programed learning and behavioral objective centered learning were both designed to minimize the error factor contributed by individual teachers. The teacher error factor is an acknowledgment of the fact that teachers vary in their abilities to effectively provide education. Programed learning removed the teacher as the sole source of information and insured that all students, using identical materials, were exposed to identical opportunities. Behavioral objectives were intended to redirect the often whimsical priorities of teachers. Competency based education is a direct  outgrowth of behavioral objectives. The competency approach is more extreme than the behavioral approach because it not only attempts to reduce the influence of the teacher error factor, but it tries to supplant individual teacher intuitions with an objective model of learning. However, complete objective models of learning upon which to base the competencies do not exist. Teachers, therefore, must fall back upon their intuitions to designate a model from which to draw competencies, a situation that parallels the problem competency based teacher performance was intended to resolve.

        "description":"There may be many social psychological variables that influence or are influenced by children's behavior in organized sports. The major variable discussed in this paper is the child's motivation to participate. One cognitive theory--the attribution theory-- offers insights into the child's view of his motivation, and the effects upon this motivation of rewards, authority figures, and winning and losing. In particular, the &quot;overjustification&quot; hypothesis of attribution theory may have implications for the physical education and athletic programs of children. Judging by their entrance into the gymnasium or onto sport's fields and playing areas, most children come to these activities with high intrinsic motivation. It is possible that through our grading and awards system we decrease  the strength of this intrinsic motivation while we strengthen the need for external rewards, extrinsic motivation. It is also possible that our entire athletic system is designed to cause a shift in the intrinsic motivation to play to the extrinsic motive of playing for the reward. Many people have suggested external rewards for all who participate. If the overjustification hypothesis is correct, this might be the worst possible thing to do. The point is not the size of the reward, but simply that when a reward is offered it results in a logical reason to which the child can attribute his motive for playing, an extrinsic rather than intrinsic motivation. Other theories and principles discussed here that shed additional light on the subject of children's motivation to participate in sports  activities are: self-perception theory; the discounting principle; the additive principle; and activation-arousal theory.

(4) Nearly all respondents (92%) conduct physical education activities either daily of 3 to 4 times a week. (5) More teachers are  spending longer (20 or more minutes) on their physical education activities. (6) Four out of five of the teachers now enjoy their physical education activities. (7) Nearly all pupils (95%) reportedly enjoy physical education. (8) A majority of teachers in both fall and spring feel that time given to physical education activities is not done at the expense of other subject areas. (9) Eighty-seven percent of the respondents did not experience any major difficulty with their physical activities program. (10) Three-quarters have observed positive effects on attitudes and/or performance of pupils as a result of their physical education program. (MM)",

This management report summarizes the work completed in the project, describes the differences in this project and that of the ATS, and presents recommendations and conclusions to the U.S. Office of Education. The tests involved included seven reading test batteries, each having one to three levels and two forms, and each having a vocabulary and comprehension subtest. There were 28 form-level combinations possible. Therefore, the concern was the simultaneous equating of 28 tests for each of vocabulary, comprehension, and total scores. The obvious difference between this project and the ATS is that this project used  Rasch Model test calibrations and equating methods while the ATS used a variety of equipercentile and linear model methods. Other important differences are outlined. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations relative to any future equating effort that might be undertaken are made. Topics discussed include technical issues as well as design and cost considerations. (RC)",

This book is designed to bring before the educational community the instruments used in these studies. The instruments are organized according to who supplies information about whom (about the teacher from the teacher, about the pupil from the teacher, about the teacher from an observer, etc.). The organizational format of the reviews includes: name of instrument, author, type of  measure, availability, description, illustration of sample items and response formats, psychometric characteristics, norms, administration and scoring, comments (evaluative remarks about the instrument's useability and psychometric adequacy), and major references. The description, reliability, validity, and comment sections constitute the major parts of each review. The descriptive and psychometric categories provide objective data from which the reader may draw his own conclusions about the adequacy of the measure, while a final, evaluative section presents the author's perception of the instrument's strengths and weaknesses.

This paper attempts to formulate a model to evaluate these diverse programs taking into consideration the primacy of personality development and attitudinal changes within the programs under study. A model is proposed with these desired outcomes: (1) collection of data on which to ground decision-making with  reasonable expenditure of resources; (2) documentation of evidence so that outside evaluators can make quasi-independent judgments and be persuaded by the statements of outsiders; and, (3) cooperation with program staff with regard to the development of evaluation design, self-evaluation, and report writing.

It is reasoned that such a model would furnish a bridge between task analysis and test selection, and also a bridge between test selection and test validation. Such a mechanism might answer some of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) criticisms of psychological testing because of the inherent content validity of the technique. In addition, the technique could be used to produce task analyses of both a job and training for that job. A comparison of the structural task analyses of the job and job training would expose discrepancies where abilities not required on the job are required for training. It might be then possible to modify training to  bring the abilities required for training more in line with those required for the job, thus ultimately providing a bridge between task analysis through selection to training.

The rationale presented in the later sections has led the authors to propose a set of criteria to assist administrators and evaluators as they think about whether to set up an evaluation contract and, if so, how to go about it. These criteria are summarized in this paper in the form of a checklist. The checklist contains seven sub-sections which deal respectively with the following types of criteria: (1)  Criteria for determining when to conduct an evaluation; (2) Criteria for determining whether to contract with an external contractor; (3) Criteria to consider when selecting an evaluator; (4) Criteria for selecting among procedural options for letting a contract; (5) Criteria to consider when using a Request for Proposals; (6) Criteria for use in negotiating the contract; and (7) Criteria for use in monitoring the contract.

Why do we need a basis for judging the adequacy of an evaluation design? Answers to these questions serve to underscore the importance of providing a consistent basis for judging evaluation designs. Secodd, a checklist of basic considerations important in judging evaluation designs is presented.  Each component of that checklist is briefly discussed.

        "description":"A method for developing statistically parallel tests based on the analysis of unique item variance was developed. A test population of 907 basic airmen trainees were required to estimate the angle at which an object in a photograph was viewed, selecting from eight possibilities. A FORTRAN program known as VARSEL was used to rank all the test items by unique variance. The item with the highest unique variance was put into a pool, then correlated against each of the remaining items. Next, the best weighted combination of items in the pool was correlated with each of the remaining items until all the items had been included in the pool, and were in order of uniqueness. Odd-numbered items were then allocated to the first test form, and even-numbered items to the second. The two forms  were then compared statistically for reliability and validity, and it was found that the means were equal, the variances were equal, and there was equal correlation with a criterion. In order to demonstrate that the technique's success was not a function of the nature of the angle estimation items, a replication on a right-wrong scored attitude measure was done, with similar results.

One hundred low income, Mexican American families were randomly assigned to program or control groups. The Bayley Infant Scales of Development were used at 12 and 24 months, and the Stanford-Binet at 36 months as measures of general intellectual functioning. Palmer's Concept Familiarity Index and a measure of bilingual development were also used. Along with HOME, the parent assessment battery included a long interview, several verbal-attitudinal measures, measures of second  language learning, and a videotaped, structured mother-child interaction situation. Results have shown significantly higher scores for the program group at the end of the program. However, the relationship of HOME scores to child cognitive scores was not clearly patterned. This may be partly due to the narrow range of scores, but the presence of some negative correlations suggests the possibility of cultural differences which alter the pattern of relationships between the family environment and child cognitive functioning.

This prediction complements findings by Locke and his colleagues that knowledge alone is not sufficient condition for effective performance. Also, it was suggested that the interaction of feedback, an environmental attribute, and self goals, an individual characteristic, be thought of in terms of an individual-environment interaction model. In that sense, it was hypothesized that feedback would facilitate the display of individual differences in self set goals and hence, the self set goals-performance relationship. Results supported the hypothesis by indicating that the individual differences in self goals were  significantly higher in the feedback group than in the no feedback group, and that it was in the feedback condition that the relationship between goals and performance was significantly higher than in the no feedback group.

Data from 1,000 subjects on two sets of five bivalued Law School Admission Test items, which were analyzed with latent trait methods of Bock and Lieberman and of Christoffersson in Psychometrika, were analyzed with an ordering-theoretic method to locate item hierarchies. Though one item set was unifactor and the other bifactor, both item sets showed no hierarchies even after 10 percent of the subjects responsible for low response pattern frequencies were deleted. Factor structure of a test appears to reveal nothing about the test's hierarchical structure. (Author)",

The findings suggest that although self-induced teacher expectations are generally well founded, and not negatively biased against minority students, males or females, when teachers hold higher versus lower expectations for similar students, the difference in the subsequent achievement can be as much as one standard deviation apart. This finding suggests that although the correlations between teacher expectations and subsequent student achievement are low, they should not be overlooked, as the impact on student achievement can be substantial.

        "description":"The thesis of this paper was to question the validity of a goal of integration achieved through the elimination of differences. In the course of structured interviews with mothers enrolling their children for the first time in Operation Exodus, a black administered and financed school busing program in Boston, a majority of respondents indicated they were busing their children out of the ghetto to obtain quality education, but not necessarily integrated education. In order to clarify the parents' position as to the value of quality and integrated education, the parents were re-interviewed at the beginning of the second year of busing for their children and asked if they would prefer that their children attend a quality school in their neighborhood if such a school could be  established. Although these parents still asserted that a desire for integrated education played in the decision to bus, they endorsed the concept of quality schooling within the black community to a greater degree than the parents of new enrollees in the bussing program. For many black parents, quality education and integrated education represented a conflict in values. In relation to this finding, the issue of matching environments to persons, the consequences of mismatch, and one example of a strategy based on awareness of mismatch are discussed. (Author/AM)",

The purpose of this paper is: (1) to give a definition and some dimensions of poverty in the United States of America; (2) to find out the scope and consequences of poverty in America to its black youths; (3) to review the already existing strategies to combat poverty; (4) to examine a number of the major characteristics of poverty; and, (5) to suggest other ways and means of alleviating and finally solving the poverty problems, especially in the black community. It is concluded that the different strategies can be conceived of as attempts to change environment, occupational  chances, the pattern of claims on income distributed outside the market, people, the distribution of power, as well as to change the performance of the economic system. Programs of new investments in human resources, although promising, cannot reach all families in poverty, and there will inevitably continue to be a considerable reliance on programs of income maintenance as well.

The first section briefly reviews selected literature about sensorimotor development in black children. The second section discusses the current use of medication. The last section discusses specific implications of selected knowledge acquisition patterns of black children. It is concluded that there seems to be four alternative courses of action which school personnel are likely to put into motion in dealing with black children who are too active to learn comfortably in the established school order. Rather than reexamine modes of teaching/learning styles for possible  modification, the education establishment prefers to (1) assign children to special learning centers where only minimal learning is expected, or (2) prescribe drugs to render children affectless, (3) completely separate children from their school environment by suspension, or (4) don't do anything; keep things the way they are. These courses of action are demanding and hurtful. The fifth is to apply a humanistic, open individualized learning situation for all students. (Author/JM)",

More than 50 million American children take at least three standardized tests a year, it is estimated. Of these an estimated ten percent are subjected to and are damaged by culturally inappropriate tests. Some researchers have utilized these dubious results to refute the educational validity of the multiracial classroom. Beyond ability grouping is the even more doubtful practice of prediction, using achievement test results. This paper highlights the impact that the testing industry has on curriculum development, especially during the early elementary grades. All of the points referred to above cluster  around the issue of test unfairness. There are really two separate issues involved: unfairness in the tests themselves and unfairness in the use of tests and test scores. In this paper, test bias is discussed in three parts: bias due to (1) content factors, (2) bias due to norming, and (3) bias due to the testing situation. Following this, the uses and abuses of tests are discussed along with the political and economic implications of misuse. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"It is easy to forget the continuous, slow, often difficult path that the May 17, 1954 Brown decision of the Supreme Court has taken and the many small--and often forgotten--problems that have been faced in the past 22 years. Delaware had some warning in 1952 that desegregation might occur and what it might involve. Most school districts received requests in 1954 that they immediately desegregate their schools. Prior to the court orders, all of Delaware maintained separate schools for white and blacks. Those people who expected something to happen in the fall of 1954 were wrong. The schools of Delaware proceeded almost as if the 1954 decision had not occurred. In September 1956 most schools in Delaware had still not begun any serious desegregation. However, most had submitted  tentative plans and were developing programs in their own communities for implementation. Finally, on October 16, 1958 the Supreme Court announced its refusal to grant a review of the desegregation cases. The State Board received the Order on November 19, 1958. Beginning with first grade, and moving on all other grades the following year, a voluntary registration was enacted. A considerable number of black parents accepted the opportunity to enroll their children in the previously all-white schools. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The success of the United States as a nation has depended on establishing a common language, loyalty, and culture. To achieve functional normalcy among our citizens there has been an ongoing process of single culture socialization carried out predominantly through systems of public schools. But whether it is necessary or desirable to establish a nonculturally differentiated mass by means of cultural conversion and absorption needs to be examined. In response to genuine cultural variety there is a new sense of pluralism which seeks to establish a condition of parity among ethnic groups. The assumption of the new pluralism is that people will be made aware of the multicultural characteristics of American life. This touches directly upon the role of the educational system of  facilitating intercultural communication. The goal of our schools must be to assist people in learning self and enable them to respect others by showing the richness inherent in the different cultural senses of reality. There is a need not only for ethnic studies programs but for an ethnicity in education through which an intercultural dimension pervades the entire curriculum. (Author/JM)",

The milestone targets, developed in 1973 for the following year, are targets over which the CDC would legitimately be expected to have some control. In addition to reporting the findings on CDC performance relative to these targets, qualitative factors which bear importantly on the meaningful analysis and evaluation of CDCs are discussed. The three programs evaluated are listed as follows: the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, the Woodlawn Organization, and the Zion Non-Profit Charitable Trust. Three case studies are also presented in order to  examine the performance of the CDCs in developing major housing complexes and shopping centers. The discussion also takes into account circumstances that bear on the success or failure of these projects. An additional purpose of the case studies is to illustrate some of the opportunities and constraints facing CDCs in pursuing their various program options, The final section of the paper comments on some key aspects of the context and problems faced by CDCs, based on the observations while carrying through the project.

The design may be used as a source of stimulation and information in working with parent groups. Section I discusses how to listen so that children will respond, to the \"language of acceptance\". The power of the language of acceptance lies in the fact that it opens children up and frees them to share their feelings and problems. Acceptance must be demonstrated either verbally or nonverbally. Communicating acceptance verbally is quite important. Most responses of parents fall into what is labeled as the typical twelve categories which are then listed. Reasons why parents should learn active listening, as well as  attitudes required for active listening are also included in this section. The section that follows presents a summary of investigations of impact of parent behavior on child personality. A listing of children's emotional needs and how they can best be met are discussed next. These ideas are only to be considered as suggestions that apply in general situations. Among the needs listed are the following: belonging, achievement, economic security, love and affection, and self-respect. Creative play activities such as college making, dramatic play, and miscellaneous sensory experiences are discussed next. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The history of the growth of public education for the black masses, including topics such as racial attitudes toward black education, the financial problems facing black schools, and the political pressures that led to the development of a system of education for blacks, is traced and discussed in this paper -- specifically as it concerns Savannah, Georgia blacks. The establishment of schools sets the stage for and creates an atmosphere out of which black professionals will develop. Generally professional classes begin to appear among blacks to a substantial degree after the Civil War. The appearance of a class of black professionals depends upon the presence of a permissive educational climate and the development of black educational institutions which evolve chiefly from  missionary and philanthropic efforts during the Reconstruction Period. A true class of black professionals does not exist in Savannah, Georgia prior to the 1880's. There had been black teachers, ministers, and physicians in Savannah before 1880, but they grow in number in this decade. In addition, during the 1880's those blacks in the professional classes are largely college graduates. They are conscientious and set the tone of the black community. These professionals often are not only successful at their professions, but also assume positions of leadership in civic affairs. (Author/AM)",

The introduction discusses two social movements that influence cultural pluralism in terms of the following: accrediting and licensing; management; data-gathering, and resource allocation; and, forming or reforming institutions. A redefinition of cultural pluralism is attempted in the first article, where it is noted that, as used and understood today, the concept is meaningless and dangerous. It is suggested that a redefinition will require renaming  it cultural social economic pluralism. The second article addresses traditional and alternative models in higher education and cultural pluralism. This study shows the broad range of approaches now in use in the pursuit of, or in the name of cultural pluralism in higher education and teacher training. Here, it is noted that the test of cultural pluralism is more directly dependent upon the reality of the position in society of subculture groups than on the state of mind of the majority population. The future of education and linguistic and cultural policy are addressed in the third article. The book concludes with a cultural pluralism bibliography. (Author/AM)",

This question is relevant to critical issues such as the political policy setting nature of social sciences, the economics of funding necessary to conduct the research that might have policy implications, and the conceptual and methodological structure of social science research. There are three general stances that are suggested for black psychology vis-a-vis social science. These are: political neutralizer and advocate, exemplary practitioner, and pioneering leader. Each of these three possible roles can be elaborated and clarified by juxtaposition with the view that social science in America is primarily a cultural phenomenon developed and guided by a  community of people who share in the same cultural beliefs. In the first half of the paper, an attempt is made to show how focused social science research has been with respect to a certain set of cultural principles. The second half discusses some ways in which issues, questions and strategies from the perspective of Black Psychology can be conceived that have as their pioneering change in popular conceptions of black people specifically, and human beings more generally.

More casual, spontaneous, and expressive people find it hard to understand the strict discipline of feelings and highly selective and controlled expressions such as the Chinese American may practice. This paper serves as a social introduction to the Chinese American. For brevity's sake, the term \"Chinese American\" is used in referring to Americans of Chinese ancestry and the term \"Chinese\" when referring to that cultural heritage or self identification. Among the issues that are addressed are the following: Chinatown, three Chinese American approaches to life (traditional, marginal, activist) and the cultural practices most often retained by the Chinese (foods, language, symbols, celebrations and  observances, religion, extended family bonds, personal and family pride, and perseverance). The Chinese American is no foreigner, as Chinese have been in Southern California for over a hundred years. Immigration was cut off from 1882 to 1943, and between 1943 and 1965 only 105 Chinese were allowed to enter the U.S. each year. In 1965, the strict quota was relaxed to match that of other countries. The ratio of foreign born to native born is now increasing. The stereotypes associated with the Chinese American--that of they \"have it made\", and \"they are all alike\"--are refuted. (Author/AM)",

Included are historical facts and also more personal statements. Among the minorities of the Los Angeles County, the Pilipino population is notable for its large proportion of new comers. There have been three waves of immigrants and presently they are immigrating in greater numbers than any other Asian group and will outnumber both Japanese Americans and Chinese Americans if the 1970 immigration rate continues. At the core of Pilipino social interactions is the maintenance of personal pride, dignity and esteem, and the avoidance of shame. Harmony among persons is also a fundamental value among Pilipinos. For Pilipinos,  the family is the center of personal commitment. It is an extended family including not only parents and children but also grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins. Although Spanish rule of the Philippines encouraged dominance by men, the position of Pilipino women has been one of strength. Among Pilipinos, respect is linked to age and not sex. Another cultural feature, one which governs relationships outside extended family circles, is the practice of reciprocity; a favor done by one member of a family puts all family members in good standing with the debtor. The family, as well as being the primary social unit is also the primary unit of economics. (Author/AM)",

Black, white, and Latin students in selected public schools were interviewed in the spring of 1974 and reinterviewed in the spring of 1975. Approach/avoidance and integration/separatism dimensions emerged from a factor analysis of racial attitude items. The dimensions indicate that student reactions to intergroup school experiences are complex. The social correlates of both dimensions are presented and the implications of the two dimensions for continued research on race and ethnic relations are discussed. Black students in all-black schools scored more on the avoidance end of the approach/avoidance dimension, while black students in  integrated schools scored on the approach end. However, the black students in the all-black schools tended to score on the integration end of the integration/separatism dimension, while the black students in the all-black schools tended to score on the separatism end. The attitudes of the students in the all-black schools changed towards those in the integrated schools during the year between interviews. Reasons for the changes are suggested and partially tested.

Ultimately, in 1970 the U.S. District Court ordered them to submit a plan for desegregating the Pasadena schools. The defendants did not appeal, and submitted the Pasadena Plan, which was approved by the District Court. In 1974, however, petitioner school officials filed a motion with the District Court seeking to modify the 1970 order. The District Court denied it. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals. A divided panel of that court affirmed the District Court. Because the case seemed to present issues of importance  regarding the extent of a District Court's authority in imposing a plan designed to achieve a unitary school system, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. It was held that, having adopted the Pasadena Plan in 1970 as establishing a racially neutral system of student assignment in the school system, the District Court exceeded its authority in enforcing its order so as to require annual readjustment of attendance zones so that there would not be a majority of any minority in any Pasadena public school.

There is evidence of two environmental dimensions which set the stage for the two dimensions of social-emotional competence. These dimensions were designated by Stern as anabolic press, which deals with growth-promoting characteristics, and catabolic press, which has to do with stimuli designed to maintain a basic orderliness to the social process. The dimensions of social-emotional competence consist of two components--a person-specific component, roughly gauged by the extent of cross-situational stability and longitudinal persistence, and a  situation-specific component, measured by the extent to which variations in the environment lead to increases or decreases in the specific dimensions of social-emotional competence. Interest/Participation versus Apathy/Withdrawal is shown to be related to cognitive functioning and school achievement. School systems and teachers foster high social-emotional competence and at the same time create classroom settings which are optimal for learning. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"For some years, groups like the Council on Interracial Books for Children (CIBC) have been urging librarians to take a second look at children's books previously regarded as classics and to evaluate them in the light of the new consciousness which acknowledges the oppression of Third World peoples and women. On January 29, 1973, the Board of Directors of the American Library Association (ALA) Children's Services Division unanimously passed a resolution calling for the re-evaluation of library materials for childrens collections. However others--particularly ALA's Intellectual Freedom Committee (IFC)--actively challenged the resolution. On February 2, 1973, the ALA Council adopted an IFC counter-resolution, setting forth the concept that sexism, racism, and other isms are ideas  which should not be censored. Furthermore, the Library Bill of Rights was cited as prohibiting children's librarians from assuming functions different from those assigned to adult librarians. The CIBC then published a position paper entitled Censorship and Racism: A Dilemma for Librarians. On January 21, 1976, the IFC adopted a statement in the form of a reply to that position paper, giving reasons for their opposition. Comments on the IFC's most recent statement are given here.

In this framework, the characteristics of the schools children attend are emphasized. The objective is to suggest a framework for the evaluation of research on school effects and a point of departure for new research on the impact of schools' instructional resources and the environments they provide on the amount that students will learn. Some findings of an investigation using this framework are presented, but the inadequacy of existing data available for the analysis make these findings suggestive. The main emphasis is on the conceptual issues underlying the model and the methodological problems that the proposed model presents. The objective is to propose a model  that can ascertain school effects, if there are any. It should focus on learning that takes place as a result of students' exposure to school activities, i.e., exposure to classrooms, teachers, and textbooks. Further, it should focus on learning that is relevant for a student's further educational and, perhaps, occupational career, for the question that ultimately generates the interest in school effects is whether it makes a difference to a child's future attainment which school he or she attends.

Weaknesses in the early black sex roles research are outlined, and insights from recent studies are cited. Several statements are made about sex role development in black families, as this has been described in the contemporary literature: (1) the attitudes of blacks toward the roles of husband, father, wife, and mother are unclear; however, the role of parent is a significant indicator of one's adulthood, masculinity, and femininity; (2) the concept of power and those indicators of this concept are defined differently in the black community; the variables used in white society cannot be used to measure power in black families; (3) there are  available black male role models in the community; many of these men are integral, supportive members of families, yet not visible members of households, and, (4) socialization of black children into sexual and sex role behavior begins at an early age. There is some evidence which supports the notion that there is less differential treatment of male and female children among blacks. A list of research priorities is provided. (Author/JM)",

A number of questions associated with development and the stability of self concept were examined. These include: (1) the extent to which self concept differs as a function of socioeconomic level, an individual's perception of significant others, and the interaction of cultural level and an individual's perception of significant others; (2) the extent to which self concept of an individual varies as a function of his perception of significant others; (3) how the self concept of an individual varies as a function of his sex, age, and the interactions of his  significant other and sex and age; and, (4) how self concept varies as a function of the absence of one parent. The subjects for this study were 458 students in grades, 4, 8, and 12 selected at random from two school districts in central Pennsylvania. Two measuring instruments, the Referent Questionnaire and the Student Opinion Poll, were administered. An analysis of variance of self concept data was completed using three factorial designs. That school age subjects tend to have the most positive self concepts when they are (1) socioeconomically advantaged and have parents as chosen significant others or (2) socioeconomically disadvantaged and have peers as the chosen significant others was among the major findings.

Based upon the results of these analyses, it is concluded that there is not conclusive evidence pointing toward an excessive alteration in the racial balance of the public schools due to the implementation of a desegregation plan. The inconclusive evidence of such a negative effect must be seen being vastly overshadowed by the ongoing exodus of white students from the central region encompassing Waverly, East Lansing, Lansing Parochial, and Lansing Public schools. The fact that Lansing shows the greatest tendency towards a reduction in the percent of white in its schools is probably due more to the differential impact of  economic factors on white and minority groups than for any other reason. The implementation of the cluster desegregation program has certainly not adversely affected the situation from the standpoint of racial balance in Lansing public schools as a whole. In fact, trends from the last four years even offer some hope for a stabilization of the racial compositions of the schools in the near future. (Author/JM)",

Information is given on the students' backgrounds and on how the students have been affected by the transitional state of their neighborhood. A search of the literature on prior successful school improvement programs was made. Use was made of representative committees, individualized curriculum programs, public relations techniques, and the effective use of community resources as the core of the program. Findings from the needs  assessment surveys administered in January 1975 are summarized. A comprehensive listing of the planned objectives, activities, and evaluative criteria necessary to execute the program successfully is included. The principal of the Clara Barton public school describes how the author instituted processes that caused others to resolve the problems that affected them.

It is designed to meet a variety of needs through diagnostic prescriptive instructional systems grounded at every level in proven principles of learning theory. It includes diagnosis of teacher behavior, as well as student behavior (reading and mathematics and social skills). Thus, it zeroes in on both what skills teachers must acquire to improve learning  in the classroom and what skills students need. It then makes proven prescriptions. Finally, it includes the actual provision of the treatment recommended, and in the implementation of the entire model, ways to assure that the treatment is followed and its salutary effects maintained are built in.

It is based upon the fact that the Task Analysis program conducted by the Office of Manpower Utilization (OMU) involves purposive, systematic investigations and analyses in order to prepare reports of findings that will be useful and influential in Marine Corps planning, policy determination, and management. Guidelines are presented for the planning and design of OMU's projects so that they will justify proper respect and credibility and thereby achieve maximum impact and value. Principles and procedures are outlined so that each Task Analysis project can be planned, designed and conducted in a manner consistent with recognized criteria of dependable scientific research. The main emphasis of the report is upon research planning  and design. The main topics are statement of the research problem--hypothesis; contribution of theory; operationalizing the research; determining sample size; collecting the data; analyzing the data, with emphasis upon cluster analysis; and the research report.

The guide is designed to provide basic orientation to Task Analysis and detailed suggestions for carrying out the entire observation and interview phase of the Task Analysis process. The background of experience in job analysis is described in terms of the most common methods and their advantages and limitations. Special attention is directed to requirements of reliability and validity and to recommended procedures for meeting these requirements. To ensure the quality of findings in Task  Analysis studies of Marine Corps Occupational Fields, specific recommendations are given for all major steps in the data-gathering process including improving interviews by checking questions, building respondent motivation, developing listening ability, managing the interview, and improving both observation and the recording of information.

The present mission of OMU is viewed as a manpower research program to conduct task analysis of Marine Corps occupational fields. Purpose of the analyses is to improve the functional areas of classification, assignment, training, grade and military occupational specialty structure, job requirements, and job validation. Major topics in this report are purpose and scope of management auditing, overview of the management audit process, comparison of the management audit with task analysis, and implications of the management audit approach for OMU. The report suggests that significant advantages could be gained by expanding  the mission of the OMU so that its staff could offer management auditing service on an optional basis to occupational fields that request such assistance.

        "description":"This report explains why California should invest in the continued education of its adult citizens and recommends 17 steps as the most urgently needed investment now. The report has two main themes: First, California should increasingly conceive of providing accessible and diversified postsecondary learning alternatives to meet the educational needs of all its adult citizens. Secondly, California now has the opportunity to provide these alternatives. The introduction of the report explains the origins and progress of the Postsecondary Alternative Study which has led to the present document. Then, based on an analysis of the need for learning alternatives and an inventory of all currently existing California resources for meeting this need, Part I of the report identifies seven  major unmet needs: (1) Help in the location of educational opportunities; (2) Individual assessment, counseling, and career planning services; (3) Equity for part-time students in state and institutional policies; (4) Educational programs for groups with special needs; (5) Additional off-campus or &quot;external&quot; upper-division and graduate programs; (6) Individualized degree-oriented learning opportunities; and (7) Certification of academic and occupational competence without the need for formal instruction. The 17 recommendations offered in Part II of the report are addressed to these priority needs. The report concludes with an appendix containing cost estimates for the new services proposed in a section of Part II. (WL)",

From the 359 questionnaires distributed, responses were received from 216 institutions or branch campuses, a 60% return. Of these, 160 were from universities, 38 from colleges, and the remaining 18 from community colleges. Responses came from institutions in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Findings revealed that of those responding, 101, or 47%, already had adopted the CEU. The author assumes that over half of the institutions will be using the CEU during the 1975-76 academic year. Of those institutions located within the states included in the  Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, 86% have adopted the CEU. The summary of this report indicates that a steady increase in the adoption and use of the CEU by the member institutions of NUEA and ACHE can be readily documented by the responses to the questionnaire. While a projection of this trend would lead to the conclusion that nearly all institutions would be using the CEU within another five years, it must be noted that the institutions surveyed are those having significant continuing education or evening class programs and having full-time continuing education administrators. Thirty-four selected references on the CEU are included, and institutions awarding CEUs are listed. (WL)",

It is essential to recognize the need to conceptualize career education on a much broader basis than had been thought in the beginning--a department-wide implementation thrust as opposed to a program approach. An attempt at such a comprehensive approach with total department involvement would have failed completely seven years ago. The Georgia State Department of Education has been building a base and a climate of  understanding for the initiation of a much broader and more comprehensive approach to the implementation of the career education concept. Career education will continue to flourish as state program managers come to perceive career education as a part of their responsibilities. (Author/TA)",

        "description":"Statistical analysis of the process of labor market reentry through a Temporary Help Service (THS) can provide a better understanding of the dynamics of female labor market accommodation and an insight into the role played by a THS as a labor market institution, especially as it facilitates the successful reentrance of women into the work force. It was found that THS met the employment needs of women, particularly those with children, and enabled those who might otherwise not have found acceptable jobs to contribute to their household income. Of greater significance, however, were the contacts made with potential employers originally referred by THS. These contacts had a positive influence on long run adjustments to the world of work. In effect, THS is a clearinghouse where women  can fulfill their immediate employment needs. Findings suggested that agencies presently disseminating labor market information, such as the Employment Service, schools, and manpower training programs, should be alerted to the range of opportunities provided by THS, particularly for reentry level women. In addition, employers should be made aware that the THS industry can provide competently qualified employees to meet temporary needs. (Author/TA)",

After reviewing the three integrated research approaches (field studies of Naval monitoring and maintenance personnel, laboratory simulations of monitoring and maintenance jobs, and an extensive literature review), a discussion is presented. It was found that those individuals with the most ability who would ordinarily be selected by an organization because of their anticipated superior job performance, were also the individuals who would derive the  least satisfaction from the job and therefore would plan to leave the organization, unless an attempt were made to either place these individuals on jobs in which the intrinsic reward value is concomitant with their abilities and/or values, or redesign the job to fit their preferences for job structural attributes. Overall, the report concluded that more work is required in specifying the individual and job attributes which will meet both individual and organizational needs. (Author/TA)",

The report concludes with recommendations for the kit's use and discusses improvements. The author indicates that the Region 3 method of selecting concepts and choosing a mini-unit technique for its matrix design for kindergarten through secondary and post-secondary levels can serve as a model by others in  planning similar career education programs. The matrix format described uses the kindergarten through post-secondary grade levels as the vertical dimension, and mini-units under learning concept headings of self awareness, career awareness, appreciations and attitudes, and decision-making skills form the horizontal dimension of the matrix. Appendix A presents the Project GROW sequential delivery system for career education matrix design. Appendix B develops the four learning concepts in career development. Appendix C outlines four mini-units in self awareness. Appendix D contains the mini-unit evaluation sheet. A list of references is included. (Author/TA)",

Although the school had been operating only five years, there was considerable interest in looking at the school's contribution to girls' education in Uganda because it represented one of three large-scale, diversified secondary schools set up jointly by American and African governments during the 1960s. Specific goals of the study involved looking at the backgrounds of girls in the sample population admitted to secondary schools, and at characteristics produced by these schools. Within this general setting the study focused on the specialized curricula  and guidance program at Tororo, and also took into consideration the variables of: Girls' expectations for further education, occupational aspirations, desired employment, and conditions and attitudes toward future and work roles. The results of this study demonstrate clearly the need for changes and at the same time report on one approach which meets many of the needed goals and has been successful in the short time it has been operating.

        "description":"The fact that career education and vocational education must rely on each other will not prevent conflicting views, due in part to their different genesis, goals, and types of persons served. Educators and evaluators of education should recognize that career education is now faced with a dilemma which many vocational educators have been unwilling to recognize: That it is extremely difficult to prepare workers who are both conformists and change agents, i.e., the question of job conformity versus job reform as goals of education. Even modest programs of career awareness, exploration, and preparation are likely to afford both blue- and white-collar workers new ways of looking at work as well as new opportunities for mobility. Career education and vocational education share the goal  of making work possible, meaningful, and satisfying for everyone. (Author/TA)",

        "description":"The views of thirty corporate executives were examined and analyzed on the role and usefulness of various types of formal, informal, and continuing educational experiences as preparation for successful careers in business management. Personal interviews were conducted with each executive, with similarities of attitudes and recommendations statistically summarized in the data analysis. The lack of meaningful correlative indices among the variables which related educational background and experience to senior executive achievement lent support to the premise that there is not necessarily a predictable cause/effect relationship. As a group, the respondents favored an undergraduate liberal arts orientation for executive career preparation. Respondents from scientific or technically  oriented companies tended to advise those interested in a specific technology to pursue that course, and then add a Master's degree in Business Administration, and broaden their education later. However, educational background was clearly not held to be an important factor in the evaluation of candidates for top management. What appeared to count most at that level was the person's over-all ability, work record, future promise, and the extent to which they are sensitive toward, and can work with and through other people.

The general approach adopted was that of collaborative appraisal by local program staff members and by outside persons with demonstrated expertise in adult education. Within the study emphasis was put on (l) self-study by those evaluated, (2) gathering  useful data only, (3) putting data into usable form, (4) disseminating the findings to Illinois program directors, (5) helping adult-education personnel develop evaluative skills, and (6) demonstrating the pay off for evaluation. General findings are presented with summary, recommendations, and questionnaire responses under the eight criteria selected for appraisal: (1) Curriculum and Instruction, (2) Intra-Institutional Relationships, (3) Extra-Institutional Relationships, (4) Professionalism, (5) Evaluation and Follow-Up, (6) Physical Facilities, (7) Efficiency and Accountability, and (8) Supporting Services.

Three kinds of education--formal, informal, and non-formal--are defined and described in relation to the need for non-restrictive educational settings and attitudes which would enhance and support lifelong education. Two things are cited that career education should impart to adults: first, it should provide each individual those skills required for him or her to take maximum advantage of every occupational and educational opportunity; and second, it should develop in each person a predeliction toward continuing to learn throughout his/her life. In reference to adults, the facts remain that: (1) Large  numbers of adults already express dissatisfaction with the three arbitrary stages of life (youth, adulthood, and old age), which assign educational activities to youth, (2) a large number of adults suggest that they have been conditioned to believe that education is for youth, (3) access to continuing education has been eased by advances in technology, increased leisure time, and other situations, and (4) there is no clearly formulated policy framework for adult activities and educational opportunities. Suggestions are made for ways of establishing lifelong learning attitudes and how such attitudes are significant. References are included. (WL)",

Any displacement of this integration of self causes a blocking of personality often expressing itself in neurotic behavior. The one obvious factor presenting itself in the counselor's office is neurotic behavior. The therapeutic fields of bioenergetics and gestalt have contributed to helping human beings by bringing to awareness these blockings. Specifically, the trauma of growth leaves its mark in the blocked musculature of the body. This blocking of energetic movement inhibits us from self-actualizing. To be of value to the total person, these factors must be dealt with. The counselor who is able to recognize energetically deprived people can render service to such people in much more depth. The author discusses a  workshop which experientially investigates energy systems within the gestalt context. Participants have a chance to understand theory as well as release their blocked energy in a low-risk situation. (Author)",

Results of these approaches, each conducted by Counseling Center paraprofessionals, are presented and their significant implications for consultation are discussed. The paper focuses on the integration of environmental assessment with consultation activities which result in environmental design. Essentially, we address the relevant question, &quot;How are data translated to action?&quot; Specific environmental design procedures are described with concrete examples drawn from our experience.

        "description":"This paper examines the values of society's basic institutions such as the family, the school, religion, business and government from the psychotherapist's point of view. Dr. Donald J. Tyrell states the problem: \"the person suffers harm from the institution; he seeks help from the psychotherapist to undo the damage; he returns to the institutional setting and the hard-won psychological gains are gradually eroded so that he again returns to the therapist or gives up.\" In an effort to determine if and why the stated values of an institution are generally inoperative, the author invited one representative from several major institutions, and asked each the following questions: (1) What are the core positive values that you try to promote in your institution? (2) Has your work  necessitated an actual shift in priority with regard to the interpretation and implementation of these values?; and (3) What are the negative values operative within your institution? The author concludes that the vicious circle described does not originate from the basic value structure of the institutions but from failure of the leaders and members of these institutions to realize them authentically and responsibly.

The course format consisted of four major components: information sessions, group counseling sessions, individual appraisal and counseling, and on-the-job field work experiences. Course evaluation indicated that the 86 participants generally agreed that the course had either helped them make a career  decision or provided skills to assist in making a decision at a later date.

The research in this area has been heavily sociological. Socio-economic background, family size, community origins, availability of educational facilities, birth order, sex, language, ethnicity, significant others, and information access were generally used as independent or background variables with students' aspirations and expectations as dependent variables. The relationships are now quite clear. For instance, statistical comparisons show that a lower-class student from a rural background has less chance of aspiring or expecting to enter university  than his rich, urban counterpart. Females have less chance than males. So do students from large families, especially lower-class families. While these variables do interact, the general relationships hold even when mental ability is controlled. However, we do not have a full understanding of the relative influence of students' financial ability or value orientation. While some believe that money matters, a significant portion of the relevant research, at least tentatively, suggests that attitudinal factors are as important as financial considerations. We also do not have a clear understanding of some of the psychological variables which may mediate between students' sociological conditions and their post-secondary plans. Some suggestions are made for further research and the school's  role. (Author)",

Statistical analysis of cell means indicated that the community-based group scored significantly higher (p &lt; .05) on both the mechanical and scientific interest scales. Further, the community-based group scored consistently lower (p &lt; .10) than the institutionalized group on the time perspective scale, which is an indication of more realistic vocational interests for mentally retarded persons.

The purpose of the program is that of early detection of the variety of difficulties that might impede the learning process and to recommend the most appropriate educational placement for each pupil who has an identified problem. Approximately 30,000 students were screened during the 1974-75 school year. Another aspect of this comprehensive approach is the Early Childhood Preventive Curriculum, (ECPC). This is a preventive program  focusing on students in the first grade. The emphasis is on the early correction of problems which may cause learning disabilities as the child matures. The ECPC program was awarded an Educational Pacesetter Award by the President's National Advisory Council on Supplementary Centers and Services. This program brings to the attention of pupil personnel workers the availability of a systematically organized approach to the identification and remediation of student learning needs. Pupil personnel workers can be effective instruments for educational change. (Author)",

Social-emotional behaviors related on six scales of reliabilities ranging from .90 to .74. The scales included depression, social interaction, cognitive functioning, physical hostility, verbal hostility and high hospitalization risk. Correlational analysis revealed that physical disability was significantly related to cognitive functioning, social interaction, and messy behavior. Another finding was that place of living prior to entry into the nursing home significantly related to behavioral problems. This finding has implications for creating various types  of programs at the time of entry into the nursing home for the new residents. Interestingly, age related significantly to cognitive functioning and social interaction, and had no significant relationship with verbal hostility, physical hostility, psychotic behavior and messiness. It is of interest that depression had a significant negative correlation with age. These findings have implications for testing preventive psycho-social approaches for different types of residents in nursing homes. (Author)",

Sampling procedures consisted of proportional allocation by systematic random method. Three groups were chosen; (1) program participants surveyed at Time II; (2) non-participants surveyed at Time I; and (3) non-participants never surveyed. An analysis of covariance was run to determine if any of the independent variables had a significant effect on life satisfaction.  Findings support Cutler's thesis (1973) that the effects of status and health lead to a weak relationship between voluntary association membership and life satisfaction. Apparently voluntary associations include participants in good health who are financially able to participate. Implications are discussed to improve program participation by developing alternative strategies to involve low income groups in good health. (Author)",

Moreover, a clearer understanding of them aids one's research with and comprehension of nostalgia. Human action can be studied from the experiential, behavioral and expressive perspectives. These perspectives are as much statements about attitudes toward action as they are about human action itself. Human action is the dialectic behaved-experience, experenced-behavior, and as such, this dialectic possesses a lateral depth. Experience and behavior are maximally visible from the attitudes of the actor and the observer, respectively. Differing attitudes indicate differing approaches toward nostalgia, and these methodological  considerations are discussed. From the perspective of experience the world of nostalgia reveals the faces of betrayal and fulfillment. The behavioral perspective shows that behavior lends ground for the figural experience of nostalgia. Behavior situates nostalgia in relation to the norms of the body, history, and the situation of action. Expression unfolds the distance of the actor from these norms and the actors' intentionality. Methodologically, expression concerns the intentional meanings of nostalgia; behavior gives the normative conditions of nostalgia; and experience reveals the structural meanings of the world of nostalgia.

Part of the reason for this has to do with the inherent complexity and difficulty of the task of assessing human abilities, emotions and achievements. But beyond this basic issue, an overlay of befuddlement has been provided by diverse ideological conflicts and resultant, largely unsuccessful attempts at resolution. As a specialized concern of the general discipline of psychology, the evolution of psychological testing is best considered within the historical context of the evolution of psychology, particularly in the United States. A brief sketch of this evolutionary development serves to illuminate the important sources  of the contemporary controversy and suggests ways in which the controversy can best be resolved. (Author)",

Hence, it has been proposed by various factions in the professional as well as the lay community that a moratorium on testing be instituted, or that testing be abolished forthwith. Every component practitioner who is well versed in the theoretical concepts of measurement acknowledges the limitations and strengths of test instruments. These instruments are neither an elixir nor illusionary in nature. They are the best of what is available, given our present state of knowledge.

This program allows counselor trainees to work with disadvantaged youth in schools and other community agencies. The emphasis of this program is on the development of skills counselors can use with minority students while concurrently fulfilling certification requirements. Students and faculty are selected according to interest and cultural background for the two-semester project. Students spend 12-16 hours per week as comnunity interns and six to eight additional hours in practicum supervision and critique. The program attempts to provide experiences in: (1) building a learning community, (2) responding to real life needs, (3) understanding the  pluralism of society, (4) using a diversity of learning methods, and (5) giving continuous feedback as to the success of the project. There is little systematic evaluation of the program, but its strengths are identified as the emphasis on cultural pluralism, the curricular flexibility, the emphasis on the practical and the experiential, and the opportunities for students to assume responsibility for their own training.

In previous studies, anger had not actually been employed as the intervening variable in a provocation/aggressive cue-aggression model. The results indicate a strong relationship between provocation and aggression which may be affected by the presence or absence of aggressive cues. However, the provocation-aggression relationship was not affected by the presence or absence of anger measured by systolic blood pressure. A separate analysis of the rate of aggression by number of acts versus the duration of aggressive acts suggests that in the presence of aggressive cues, when aggression may be expressed covertly, young men may return  aggressive acts beyond reciprocity.

Penis envy is viewed as a psychological phenomenon rather than a biological phenomenon characterized as the &quot;bedrock of feminity.&quot; Based on his experiences as a psychoanalyst, the author states that penis envy involves the child's early identifications with the mother, the resolution of the oedipal conflict, and that which is unresolved in the oedipal conflict. The concepts of internalization and object representation lead to a modified understanding of psychosexual development in both sexes. How much a child is loved by the mother at each stage of development basically determines the extent of love of self in later life. This concept is neglected in Freud's work with the early mother/child  relationship. The author praises the feminist movement for its negation of the concept of gender superiority and suggests psychoanalysis as a means for personal growth and discovery. (HLM)",

Teachers of six experimental groups received six hours of training and instructed students twice a week for three weeks. The six control teachers received no training and conducted guidance activities in the homeroom periods. Using the dependent variables of the pre- to posttest change scores on the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale and the pre- to posttest change scores on the Adult Scale of the TA Ego State Scale, a one-way analysis of variance was applied to determine if there were  significant differences between the change scores of the experimental and control groups. No significant results were obtained on either of the dependent variables. However, significant results were obtained on the Rebel Child Scale and on the Nurturing Parent Scale of the TA Ego State Scale as a consequence of the treatment. The study concluded with recommendations for further investigation of transactional analysis as a psychological curriculum for public schools to meet students needs for affective education.

This program, The System of Interactive Guidance Information (SIGI), is the focus of a co-operative filed study between Educational Testing Service and the Illinois State University Student Counseling Center (ISU SCC). The first article deals with the implementation of the SIGI system at the ISU SCC and the use of SIGI in academic courses and individual and group counseling. The second article descusses the ISU SCC's approach to counseling as it relates to the use of SIGI. The Center's belief in personal growth as an interactive process permits the use of SIGI as a self-help tool at varying levels for the students. The third article presents the development of SIGI's  Prediction program as an attempt to help students evaluate their chances for success in academic majors at ISU. The fourth article explains the preparation of planning displays in SIGI, designed to coordinate information about majors and programs at ISU with occupations listed in SIGI. Academic advisors, counselors, and departmental chairpersons are given instructional manuals to assist students in the use of SIGI. The fifth article presents research on the effectiveness of SIGI, indicating that SIGI is effective over a time period of ten days to two weeks, and that students find SIGI to be helpful and interesting.

The original objectives of the project, as stated in the Human Interaction Research Institute (HIRI) contract proposal, were: (1) to review and analyze studies concerning the participation of women in the labor market; (2) to derive the career counseling implication of these findings for women; and (3) to develop the information and conclusions into formats readily usable by both counselors and women who are making career decisions. During the course of the study, research investigations in the subject area published during the past 10 years and studies currently underway were identified and screened for acceptability based on the methodological and  statistical soundness of their design. Studies passing the initial screening were classified under one of three general areas: (1) women's participation in the labor force; (2) women's educational and training opportunities; and (3) issues relating to sex differences which affect women's participation in the labor force. Each classified group of documents was analyzed to yield both current and trend data, highlighting differences prior to and after recent federal legislation. The subsequent analysis of the literature highlighted findings as they varied for several subpopulations of women. Finally, the findings derived were synthesized and evaluated to yield information of practical utility to counselors and to women making career decisions. This document is one of the study products  developed to contain these findings. (Author)",

Eighth-grade students attending a predominantly Spanish private bilingual school were administered a questionnaire, and participated in a group interaction process. The questionnaire covered the areas of cultural values in school and home. Comments from the group interaction process are also listed. The study concludes that students: (1) like the atmosphere of the bicultural school; (2) accept their parents' Latin-American values; (3) feel free to incorporate American cultural elements into their lifestyles; (4) have a high concept of the Cuban lifestyle;  and (5) are optimistic about their expectations and futures. The study recommends: (1) a re-testing of the same students in 1979; (2) an expansion of the same study to include older students; (3) a study of Latin-American students attending American schools; and (4) the appropriation of federal funds to establish counseling/research centers to study adjustment problems in Cuban youths.

The four major trends found in this study are: (1) a dramatic increase in cigarette smoking among females; (2) an intellectual awareness of the dangers of smoking; (3) belief in an all-pervasive smoking environment; and (4) growth and acceptance of the &quot;New Values&quot; generated by college students of the 1960's. In its efforts to break down the myth of an extensive smoking society and to utilize the positive elements of the &quot;New Values,&quot; the study presents the following list of findings which can be used in an antismoking campaign: (1) Teen-age smokers are more sophisticated than  nonsmokers; (2) Smoking is not identified with rebelliousness; (3) Peer relationships are a dominant factor in smoking; (4) Antismoking education needs to begin at an earlier grade level than supposed; (4) Young women smokers express a high need for independence; (5) Working women smoke less than housewives; (6) Identification with the women's movement does not encourage smoking; (7) Pregnancy only causes a cutback in smoking; (8) Children are less militant than formerly in their efforts to curb smoking among their parents; and (9) Light smokers can quit more easily than heavy smokers. The study indicates there is a definite potential for getting females to quit, but more emphasis must be placed on the nonaddictive qualities of smoking in antismoking campaigns. (HLM)",

It is shown that, to the extent that misinformation rather than ignorance causes examinees to miss multiple-choice items, higher item discrimination coefficients and lower difficulty indices may be expected. Data were collected which partially confirmed the prevalence of these outcomes in typical college classroom testing situations involving six tests and 210 examinees. The implications of the findings are discussed with respect to commonly used test construction procedures.

While much concern has been expressed about the content of tests or the atmosphere in which they are given, it is more important to focus on how tests are used in making decisions about people. Four models of test use are defined: regression model, constant ratio model, conditional probability model, and the equal probability model. The writer feels that, rather than asking if tests are biased, one should ask if the society is biased, since tests are always employed in a cultural context. The answer to eliminating test bias is to eliminate racism and sexism in society. A six-stage model to eliminate racism and sexism is presented: (1) Cultural, Racial and Sexual Differences; (2) How Racism  Operates; (3) Examining Racial and Sexual Attitudes; (4) Sources of Racial Attitudes; (5) Changing Behavior: What Can Be Done?; and (6) Changing Behavior: How It Can Be Done.

Fourteen civilian counselors supervised by a police lieutenant function as a diversion unit for arrested juveniles between the ages of 10 and 16. Juveniles that are referred to the Youth Services Program are placed in one of two specific sub-programs. The first sub-program consists of two nightly lectures covering such aspects of the law as juvenile law and the juvenile justice system for first offender misdemeanants. The second sub-program is set up for more difficult juveniles who have had prior arrests and/or are also felons. They undergo a systematic program whereby they are trained on  Carkhuff's HRD skills technology on physical, emotional, and intellectual skills which they can apply to home, school, and community problem areas. Parents also receive skills training. The program has been in operation for approximately two years. Statistics show that the program is having a significant impact upon recidivism. The program has also had a significant effect on the juveniles functioning in certain home, school, and community problem areas. (Author/NG)",

The counselor will serve broadly within the institution as a facilitator and even goader of desirable change. Because institutions (schools, colleges, agencies, prisons, hospitals, old age residences, etc.) may not welcome such internal subversives on their staffs, counselors may have to be employed by semi-autonomous \"authorities\" such as those that operate public transportation facilities. To function at that level, counselors will be prepared in selective, full-time, two-year programs that include a real internship. On the job they will participate in weekly staff conferences and monthly workshops or other inservice training  activities. The counselor of the future will be undergirded by a much more useful body of research than now exists. Instead of microscopic laboratory studies of little or no practical significance, there will be field studies with less stress on precision and more on meaningful information and insights. Finally, conventions, publications, and the governance of associations will change drastically in the direction of making better use of what is known about effective communications and effective decision-making.

The PCSD believes that achievement motivation can be retained and increased through the development of a positive self concept. The PCSD uses a three-dimensional model of academic, counseling, and group living concerns as its model. This model is developing in its later phases as a two-dimensional approach of affective and academic focus and social and personal life adjustment. Developmental programs designed to remove fears of rejection and feelings of lack of personal control are combined with residential hall programs,  psychological support systems, social activities, and workshops for the college bound minority students. The PCSD objectives are to : (1) decrease the attrition rate; (2) increase the grade point average; (3) expand knowledge about vocational choices; (4) increase social awareness and involvement in campus activities; (5) decrease the number of intergroup conflicts in the dormitories and classrooms; and (6) increase the number of graduates.

The sample included all of the 1974 Semi-Finalists from South Carolina in the National Merit Scholarship Competition, as well as the 58 students who competed as semi-finalists for one of USC's Carolina Scholars Awards. Two different questionnaires were employed, one for students attending USC, and the other for students who chose to attend other colleges and universities. Data suggest that USC's appeal to academically talented students is not strong. Such students who considered USC but elected to go elsewhere cite the academic reputation of the college or university as the  major reason, although the availability of the Carolina Scholars Program is certainly a major influence for some. Based on student recommendations, USC could enhance its appeal to these students by taking steps to strengthen its undergraduate academic reputation, by promoting its newly created medical school by expanding existing honors and study abroad programs, and by offering additional scholarships awarded on merit.

Information about exact events leading to dissatisfaction, coping mechansims and possible remedies was gathered from those students reporting stress on the ESQ. Three primary areas of stress for CSU students were identified as finincial support, educational-vocational planning, and personal growth and development. Comparisons by sex,  class and college were also presented. Specific recommendations included the creation of a campus environmental assessment-design center, further analysis of the data, greater student orientation to university resources, and greater administrative awareness of and response to student needs.

A second experiment was then designed to determine if the information processing of FD students could be enhanced by providing stimulus aids in accordance with their cognitive style characteristics.

The scope and foci of environmental cognition are largely defined by its practitioners--investigators who come from diverse disciplines (e.g., psychology, geography, city planning) and who have diverse scientific and social agendae. In one sense environmental cognition is applied cognitive psychology; in another, it is applied social psychology; in a third sense cognitive and social psychology can be subsumed by environmental cognition. The major part of the presentation is concerned with the specification of a number of major conceptual and  research issues which, when considered jointly, seem to differentiate environmental cognition from other subdisciplines of psychology.

        "description":"The purpose of this report is to explore a student's change in major as it relates to the ongoing developmental process of occupational choice. College students changing their declared major were asked to specify what job or career they were \"headed for\" in both their old major and in their new major choice. Consistent with vocational development theory, a significant number were able to be more specific about their probable career choice within their previous major. But contrary to theory, the proportion of students able to be specific in job choices declined significantly across the college class years. This downward trend holds for the degree of specificity in probable job choice in both the previous and the newly selected major. The results are interpreted as a paradoxical  example of both continuity and discontinuity in the development of career choice among college students. Implications for vocational theory and for career guidance during the college years are stated. (Author/MPJ)",

Materials were chosen to represent each of the following propaganda techniques: glittering generalities, name calling, transfer, testimonial, bandwagon, and card stacking. Students in two undergraduate reading classes were randomly assigned to three modes of presentation: group one studied six sets of materials; group two studied the brochures which advertised the materials; and group three studied only the content of the brochures, in mimeographed form. The materials were then rated on a four-point scale. No significant differences were revealed among the three modes of presentation, between the two classes, or in the  interaction of modes and classes. Significant differences were apparent in the rating of the six sets of materials and in the interaction of the modes of presentation and the materials. While the interaction of classes and materials was significant, the interaction of modes of presentation, classes, and materials was not. (Author/KS)",

The primary goals of the reading program were to improve and upgrade word recognition and reading skills and to improve pupils' attitudes. The remedial systems utilized were eclectic: individual teachers developed techniques which were most successful in their specific situations. Although participants ranged in level from grades one to nine, a special effort was made to provide instruction in the primary grades. Discussions of the educational context in which remediation occurred, of personnel utilization, of diagnostic techniques, and of evaluation of program success are  included in the program description. Assessment of data revealed that from 54% to 73% of the students achieved at least one month's gain for each month of instruction, according to three evaluation measures. Recommendations urged that the corrective reading program be continued. (KS)",

Subjects were 239 control and 261 experimental students, matched in basic demographic characteristics and in IQ scores, from grades four through six. Twelve control and 12 experimental teachers each taught reading to approximately 25 students. All teachers received inservice training one hour a week, with the experimental teachers receiving an additional three hours of inservice training each week in the diagnostic/prescriptive approach. Pretests and posttests were administered to the students, while the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Test measured teachers' attitudes toward their  students. Findings show that inservice teacher training produces higher levels of student spelling ability, that the same may be true of student reading ability, and that teachers' attitudes directly influence student progress. Tables of findings are included. (JM)",

The quality of educational materials may be ensured in many ways: by analysis of sales, through firsthand investigation, and by employing a system of evaluators within the school system. Two case studies are described, one detailing the failure of a product designed to aid in word recognition, the other outlining the use of an independent research group to predict teacher and student acceptance of a flexible instructional packet. While the analysis of educational needs and the pretesting of instructional materials may increase production costs, they can also prevent the proliferation of  irrelevant products. (KS)",

However, a recent study of the content of these books shows that both the text and the illustrations portray female characters as subordinate to the other sex, as the one who fails, as the caretaker of the home, as the nurturer of the family, and as the character seen most often in the home environment and least often in business and the professions.

Although these theories provide the basis for the most frequently used reading instruction programs, they fail to account for intention, selectivity, prediction, and comprehension in reading. \"Inside-out\" approaches, on the other hand, argue that children learn to read by making sense of written language from inferred meaning and prior knowledge, in much the same manner that they acquire language skills. Although these theories do not  offer prescriptions for methodology or provide direct translations into practice, their assumptions often appeal to the intuitions of experienced teachers. Since the skill of reading is imbedded in the complex functions of the brain, educators need to focus their attention on the internal, as well as external, processes of learning. (KS)",
