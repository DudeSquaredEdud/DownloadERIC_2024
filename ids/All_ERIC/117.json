        "description":"RESULTS ARE REPORTED FOR THE FIRST PHASE OF A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF APPROXIMATELY 1,600 STUDENTS SEEKING TO TRANSFER IN 1964 FROM SEVEN PUBLIC AND EIGHT PRIVATE JUNIOR COLLEGES. WHILE A 2-YEAR PATTERN OF EDUCATION IS MOST COMMON, ONE-THIRD OF THE STUDENTS SURVEYED ARE SEEKING EARLIER TRANSFER. OVER 90 PERCENT PROPOSE TO TRANSFER TO A SENIOR PUBLIC INSTITUTION. SAT SCORES ARE SIMILAR FOR TRANSFER-SEEKING STUDENTS AT BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE JUNIOR COLLEGES AND DO NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE OF ALL ENTERING JUNIOR COLLEGE STUDENTS IN 1962. HOWEVER, BOTH SAT VERBAL AND MATH SCORES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THOSE OF STUDENTS ENTERING PUBLIC SENIOR INSTITUTIONS AS FRESHMEN. WHILE THE HIGH SCHOOL GPA IS A BETTER PREDICTOR OF GRADES IN PUBLIC JUNIOR COLLEGES THAN IN PRIVATE  JUNIOR COLLEGES--MEAN HIGH SCHOOL GRADE AVERAGES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AT THE .01 LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE--COMPARATIVE DATA ON COLLEGE GRADE AVERAGES ARE LESS CLEAR. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE SENIOR COLLEGE FRESHMAN HAS AN INITIAL ADVANTAGE OVER THE JUNIOR COLLEGE FRESHMAN AND THAT IN FOLLOWUP STUDIES ADEQUATE CONTROLS MUST BE INCLUDED FOR THE PROPOSED COMPARISON OF TRANSFER PERFORMANCE WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTINUING STUDENTS IN SENIOR INSTITUTIONS. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE GEORGIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES (GEORGIA CENTER OF CONTINUING EDUCATION, AUGUST 24, 1966). (AL)",

HOWEVER, IT WAS FURTHER FOUND THAT STUDENTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE WRONG ASPECTS OF SCHOOL LIFE (THAT  IS, GETTING GOOD GRADES) INSTEAD OF HAVING MEANINGFUL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES AND THAT THEY LOOK ON HIGH SCHOOL AS A MEANS TO AN END (THAT IS COLLEGE OR A GOOD JOB). AN EXPLANATION OF THE STUDENTS NONALIENATION, DESPITE THE TRIVIALITY OF THEIR WORK AND THE POWERLESSNESS OF THEIR ROLE, IS THAT THEY BELIEVE THE WORK IS BENEFITING THEM BECAUSE THEY PERCEIVE THE SCHOOL STAFF AS BENEVOLENT AND COMPETENT FIGURES WHO WOULD DO NOTHING TO HARM THEM.

        "description":"ONE OF A SERIES OF PUBLICATIONS DERIVED FROM THE CHILD REARING STUDY (CRS) OF LOW-INCOME FAMILIES IN WASHINGTON, D.C., THIS PAMPHLET ATTEMPTS TO REFUTE THE POPULAR MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE POOR. CRS FINDINGS SHOW THAT SUCH FAMILIES DO NOT NEGLECT THEIR CHILDREN BUT RATHER ARE FORCED BY THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES TO TRAIN THEM TO BE INDEPENDENT. POOR FAMILIES CARE DEEPLY ABOUT EDUCATION AND OTHER MIDDLE-CLASS VALUES BUT LACK THE MONEY AND KNOWLEDGE TO REALIZE THESE ASPIRATIONS. ALTHOUGH ACCUSED OF PROMISCUITY, IN FACT THE CRS SAMPLE ARE PRUDISH AND INHIBITED ABOUT GIVING SEX INFORMATION TO THEIR CHILDREN, AND PLACE GREAT VALUE ON THE LEGITIMACY OF OFFSPRING. FATHERS DESERT THEIR FAMILIES MAINLY BECAUSE OF UNEMPLOYMENT OR LOW PAYING JOBS. URBANIZATION AND SOCIOECONOMIC DEPRIVATION, RATHER  THAN A BACKGROUND OF SLAVERY, ARE THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE CHARACTER OF NEGRO FAMILY LIFE. MEASURES TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THESE FAMILIES MUST BE BASED ON A CLINICAL APPROACH WHICH ATTENDS TO SUCH BACKGROUND FACTORS AS UNEMPLOYMENT, HOUSING, EDUCATION, AND SEGREGATION, WHICH HAVE LEAD TO ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR. POSITIVE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION MUST RECOGNIZE THE DIVERSITY OF LOW-INCOME LIFE STYLES AND REQUIRES A NONJUDGMENTAL ATTITUDE ON THE PART OF PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK WITH THE POOR.

THE SUBJECTS (SS) WERE TWO MATCHED GROUPS OF FIVE 16- TO 21-YEAR-OLD GIRLS WHO WERE SCHOOL DROPOUTS EMPLOYED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD YOUTH CORPS (NYC) PROGRAM. A CLASSROOM GROUP WAS GIVEN A BASIC EDUCATION PROGRAM WITH TOKEN REINFORCEMENT AND THE NYC JOB PLACEMENT, WHILE A JOB GROUP RECEIVED ONLY THE NYC PLACEMENT. BOTH GROUPS WERE PAID ACCORDING TO THE REGULAR NYC PAYMENT PRACTICES. THE REINFORCEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE CLASSROOM GROUP USED A POINT SCALE TO CORRECT ANSWERS (89 PERCENT CORRECT CRITERION) TO INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS WHICH WOULD DETERMINE THE GIRLS' SALARIES AND A POSSIBLE REWARD OF COMMODITIES. THE GIRLS WORKED INDIVIDUALLY ON THE  COMMERCIAL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND PACED THEMSELVES. THE POINT VALUES WERE SHIFTED TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF THE SS' WORKING MORE INTENSIVELY IN THE AREAS OF GREATER DEFICIENCIES. A COMPARISON OF PRETEST AND POST-TEST CALIFORNIA ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES SHOWED A MEDIAN INCREASE OF 1.3 YEARS FOR THE CLASSROOM GROUP AND 0.2 YEARS FOR THE JOB GROUP. THE OVERALL REMEDIAL PROGRAM INCREASED THE ACADEMIC SKILLS OF THE GIRLS IN A RELATIVELY BRIEF PERIOD, AND THE TOKEN SYSTEM SEEMED TO BE FUNCTIONAL BECAUSE THE CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF POINTS WHICH COULD BE EARNED IN CERTAIN WORKBOOKS MODIFIED THE STUDENTS CHOICE OF MATERIALS.

THE JOB CORPS EMPHASIZES PLACEMENT RATHER THAN THE CREATION OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, WHILE THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOUTH CORPS IS NOW MOVING AWAY FROM A PRIMARY CONCERN WITH SHORT-TERM EMPLOYMENT TO AN INTEREST IN TRAINING AND REMEDIATION FOR THE YOUTH. EVALUATIONS OF THE OUTCOMES OF  YOUTH EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS ARE UNSATISFACTORY BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY IN COLLECTING DATA, BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS WHETHER THESE PROGRAMS, EVEN PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED, CAN ALLEVIATE YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT. IN FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS A FUNCTION OF THE AVAILABILITY OF JOBS, AND IN CONCENTRATING ON JOB TRAINING, THESE PROGRAMS DEAL WITH THE SYMPTOMS OF JOBLESSNESS RATHER THAN ITS CAUSES. TO RELIEVE THE CAUSES THESE YOUTH SHOULD BE OFFERED GREATER EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH NEW JOBS OR THE RESTRUCTURING OF EXISTING ONES. A BIBLIOGRAPHY ON YOUTH EMPLOYMENT FOLLOWS THE DISCUSSION. THIS ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED IN THE &quot;IRCD BULLETIN,&quot; VOLUME 2, NUMBER 1, JANUARY 1966. (EF)",

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES WERE USED IN ANALYZING DATA, AND FACTOR ANALYSIS WAS USED TO GROUP COMPETENCIES. OF 184 OCCUPATIONS, 125 WERE NONPROFESSIONAL AND MOST REQUIRED ON-THE-JOB TRAINING. A RURAL BACKGROUND WAS PREFERRED FOR BEGINNING EMPLOYEES. PERSONALITY, ABILITY TO GET ALONG WITH OTHERS, AND COMMUNICATIVE ABILITY WERE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN EMPLOYEE SELECTION, AS WELL AS HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION.

RESPONDENTS TO A FORCED-CHOICE QUESTIONNAIRE WERE 310 MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN 25 TO 45 YEARS OF AGE. THEY WERE CLASSIFIED BY ONE OF FIVE CAREER INTEREST CATEGORIES--NEGATIVE WORKERS, POSITIVE WORKERS, CAREER-ORIENTED HOUSEWIVES, SATISFIED HOUSEWIVES, AND AMBIVALENT HOUSEWIVES. THESE CATEGORIES WERE CONSTRUCTED FROM ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING CURRENT WORK STATUS, IMPORTANCE OF CAREER, STATUS SEEN AS MOST SATISFACTORY NOW AND IN 10 YEARS, AND CURRENT DEGREE OF SATISFACTION.  SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS EXISTED BETWEEN CAREER INTERESTS AND TYPE OF COLLEGE ATTENDED, ACADEMIC DISTINCTION AS AN UNDERGRADUATE, CAREER PLANS AS A SENIOR, POSSESSION OF GRADUATE DEGREE, MARITAL STATUS, AGE, AND COMPARISON OF OWN WITH HUSBAND'S SELF-FULFILLMENT. BOTH PART-TIME AND FULL-TIME RESUMPTION OF EMPLOYMENT WAS POPULAR AS A DESIRED PROJECTED STATUS BUT NOT IN THE HIGHEST PROFESSIONS. MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONS, COLLEGE TEACHING, AND EDUCATIONAL SPECIALTIES WERE POPULAR AS &quot;UP-GRADING&quot; CHOICES AND ARTS-GLAMOUR-SERVICE AS IDEAL FIELDS.

THE STATUS OF BRAILLE READING INSTRUCTION WAS DETERMINED FROM QUESTIONNAIRES FILLED OUT BY 520 TEACHERS. NO CONSISTENTLY DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF INSTRUCTION WERE FOUND. IN THE SECOND PART OF THE STUDY. TESTS FOR DETERMINING READING RATE AND READING COMPREHENSION OF BRAILLE READERS WERE GIVEN TO 50 FOURTH GRADERS AND 50 EIGHTH GRADERS FROM LOCAL SCHOOLS AND AN EQUAL NUMBER FROM THE SAME GRADES IN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH MEASURES OF THE SAME  ABILITIES IN VISUAL READERS. RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT AGE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BLIND AND SEEING CHILDREN, AS GRADE-LEVEL GROUPS, WERE FAR LESS THAN REPORTED IN THE PAST. FOURTH-GRADE BLIND CHILDREN WERE 1.2 YEARS OVER AGE, AND PRACTICALLY NO DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND FOR EIGHTH GRADERS. INTELLIGENCE LEVELS OF FOURTH-GRADE STUDENTS WERE CLOSE TO AVERAGE, AND EIGHTH GRADERS WERE ABOVE NORMAL. READING COMPREHENSION OF THE BLIND CHILDREN WAS EQUAL TO THAT OF THE SEEING CHILDREN IN THE FOURTH GRADE, BUT WAS SUPERIOR TO THE COMPREHENSION OF SEEING CHILDREN IN THE EIGHTH GRADE. MOST STUDENTS WITH HIGH COMPREHENSION WERE FAST READERS, AND THOSE WITH LOW COMPREHENSION WERE SLOW READERS. READING BEHAVIORS FOUND TO BE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SLOW AND FAST READERS WERE DESCRIBED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR READING INSTRUCTION WERE GIVEN. (AL)",

THE RESULTS SEEMED TO FAVOR THE ALTERNATION GROUP WHICH DID NOT HAVE THE EXTENDED AUDITORY  COMPREHENSION PRACTICE.

IN THIS STUDY, THE HISTORICAL ROOTS OF PRIMARILY NEGRO SPEECH PATTERNS ARE FOUND IN  THE CREOLE AND PIDGIN ENGLISH SPOKEN BY NEGRO SLAVES AND RECORDED IN LITERATURE OF THE ERA. EVEN AFTER THE CIVIL WAR, WHEN THE FIELD-HAND CREOLE ENGLISH BEGAN TO TAKE ON MORE FEATURES OF LOCAL WHITE DIALECTS AND THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE, CERTAIN DIALECT FEATURES REMAINED PECULIAR TO NEGRO SPEECH.

FOR EXAMPLE, THIS RELATIONSHIP IS SIGNALED IN ENGLISH BY RELATIVE STRESS, IN TURKISH BY WORD ORDER, AND IN JAPANESE BY SEPARATE MORPHEMES. OF THE SEVERAL WAYS OF ANALYZING THIS  PHENOMENON, ONE (THE TAGMEMIC APPROACH) IS TO ALLOW THE DEEP STRUCTURE TO DEVELOP BOTH A TOPIC-COMMENT STRUCTURE AND AN INDEPENDENT PHRASE STRUCTURE.

TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, AN EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED WITH 25 MONOLINGUAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. A SERIES OF CHI-SQUARE TESTS WAS MADE TO INVESTIGATE ANY CORRELATION BETWEEN SYLLABLE ASSIGNMENTS MADE BY THE SUBJECTS AND THE VARIABLES OF STRESS, GEMINATION, AND VOICING.

PARENT-COUNSELOR CONTACT IN THE UNIVERSITY SETTING IS INCIDENTAL TO THE RESOLUTION OF THE STUDENT'S DEPENDENCY-INDEPENDENCY DIFFICULTIES. LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS AREA ALTHOUGH SOME DATA INDICATE THAT THE QUALITY OF THE PARENT-CHILD RELATION IS SEEN IN THE CHILD'S LATER BEHAVIOR AND ATTITUDES. (WR)",

THE HANDICAPPED BECOME PRODUCTIVE, LEARN WORK SKILLS, AND COLLECT VOCATIONAL INFORMATION THROUGH JOB SAMPLING. THE CONTRIBUTING EMPLOYERS PROVIDE GUIDANCE, SUPERVISION, AND EVALUATION REGARDING THE CLIENT'S POTENTIAL FOR THE WORK BEING SAMPLED. THE COVE PROCESS IS BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE LONG-TERM, DEPENDENT HANDICAPPED WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE NO PLACE IN COMPETITIVE SOCIETY. THEIR DEPENDENCY REQUIREMENTS ARE SO GREAT THAT COVE ESTABLISHED SHELTERED LIVING SITUATIONS SUPERVISED BY COUNSELOR-AIDES. IN ADDITION TO VOCATIONAL EXPLORATION, THE HANDICAPPED ARE ASSISTED IN DEVELOPING SKILLS IN  SOCIAL LIVING. AFTER THE CLIENT HAS MADE A REALISTIC VOCATIONAL CHOICE AND HAS SALABLE SKILLS, THE STAFF ASSISTS HIM IN SECURING EMPLOYMENT AND A SUITABLE LIVING SITUATION. FEEDBACK INFORMATION TO CONTRIBUTING EMPLOYERS IS A VITAL FACTOR IN THE PROGRAM. EMPLOYERS BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT THE HANDICAPPED ARE REAL PEOPLE AND NOT FACELESS STATISTICS. THE COMMUNITY OFFERS MOST OF THEIR SERVICES WITHOUT CHARGE, MAKING THE EFFORTS OF THIS REHABILITATION PROGRAM COST LESS THAN MOST.

IN THE PUPIL PERSONNEL DEPARTMENT, THE PSYCHIATRIST COULD OFFER PROBLEM-CENTERED CONSULTATION. IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM, HE COULD OFFER DIRECT PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION. IN CHILD STUDY, HE COULD FUNCTION AS A MEMBER OF AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM TO CONDUCT PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES IN DEPTH. HE COULD AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH PROGRAMS, PROVIDE CLINICAL SERVICES, AND SERVE AS A CONSULTANT TO THE TEACHER. TWO IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS SHAPING THE ROLE OF THE PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTANT ARE  HIS ROLE AS IMAGINED BY HIMSELF AND HIS ROLE AS SEEN BY THE SCHOOL PERSONNEL. THE PSYCHIATRIST TENDS TO VISUALIZE HIS ROLE IN TERMS OF A NUMBER OF SERVICES, WHILE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM TENDS TO SEE HIM AS AN OUTSIDER, ONE WHO IS NOT A PART OF THE TOTAL SCHOOL SITUATION.

FACET ANALYSIS ENABLES THE VALIDITY OF AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ORDERING PROCESS TO BE TESTED. THE LOGIC OF FACET DESIGN AND ANALYSIS IS BASED UPON SYSTEMATIC DELINEATION OF THE IMPORTANT VARIABLES PRIOR TO DATA COLLECTION AND THE EVALUATION OF THEIR EFFECT IN A SPECIFIC RESEARCH DOMAIN. THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS THE APPLICATION OF HIS DESCRIPTION OF FACET DESIGN AND ANALYSIS IN FOUR SPECIFIC RESEARCH CASES AND SHOWS, IN EACH CASE, HOW THE PROBLEM UNDER CONSIDERATION CAN BE SPECIFIED MORE PRECISELY, HOW RELEVANT HYPOTHESES EVOLVE FROM THE FACET DESIGN, AND HOW THE VALIDITY OF FACETS CAN BE COHERENTLY CHECKED. THE RESEARCH PROCESS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO FIVE PHASES--(1) CHOOSING THE  DOMAIN OF INVESTIGATION, (2) RECORDING OBSERVATIONS MADE WITHIN THE DOMAIN, (3) CONVERTING OBSERVATIONS INTO DATA, (4) CLASSIFYING THE DATA, AND (5) SEEKING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG VARIABLES. THE THEORY OF DATA CONCERNS PHASES 3 AND 4. A SCHEME PROPOSED BY COOMBS IS CITED WHICH ENCOMPASSES ALL OF THE FACETS ENCOUNTERED WHEN OBSERVATIONS ARE CONVERTED INTO DATA AND DATA INTO VARIABLES. COOMBS PRESENTS A &quot;SEARCHINGNESS STRUCTURE&quot; WHICH ENABLES A RESEARCHER TO LAY OUT AN ENTIRE GRID OF METHODS FOR COLLECTING DATA. HIS CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE FIELD CAN PROVIDE MEANS OF INVENTING NEW METHODS OF COLLECTING DATA AND OF CHOOSING APPROPRIATE WAYS TO ANALYZE THE GATHERED DATA.

THE TWO COLLEGES WERE SIMILAR IN EVERY RESPECT EXCEPT FOR THEIR ADVANCEMENT SYSTEM. THE MERIT COLLEGE (MC) USED FACULTY ACADEMIC TITLES AND PROMOTED FACULTY MEMBERS ON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM HIGHER ECHELON FACULTY MEMBERS BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S PERFORMANCE OF DUTY. THE NONMERIT COLLEGE (NMC) LABELED EVERYONE &quot;INSTRUCTOR,&quot; USED AUTOMATIC ANNUAL SALARY INCREMENTS, AND HAD NO FORMALLY INSTITUTIONALIZED ALLOCATION OF REWARDS AND PENALTIES. BOTH COLLEGES HAD TWO BASIC INSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIVES--(1) COUNSELING STUDENTS AND (2) PROVIDING CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR THE COMMUNITY. THE  RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT (1) 67 PERCENT OF THE MC'S STAFF PARTICIPATED IN COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES, WHEREAS ONLY 54 PERCENT OF NMC'S STAFF DID SO, (2) &quot;MOONLIGHTING&quot; WAS DONE BY 75 PERCENT IN NMC AND BY ONLY 46 PERCENT IN MC, AND (3) STUDENT COUNSELING WAS NAMED AS A REGULAR WEEKLY ACTIVITY BY 41 PERCENT OF THE MC STAFF AND BY ONLY 10 PERCENT OF THE NMC STAFF.

FIVE FEATURES ARE CENTRAL TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SCHOOL--ITS CHILDREN-CHANGING EMPHASIS, LOCAL CONTROL, NONVOLUNTARY NATURE, RELATIVE ISOLATION FROM OTHER SOCIALIZING AGENCIES IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY, AND COMPLEX LINKAGE WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS IN THE LARGER SOCIETY. FOUR ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF SCHOOLS AS SYSTEMS INCLUDE--(1) DIVERSITY AND CONFLICT IN GOAL SPECIFICATION, (2) MECHANISMS FOR TASK ACCOMPLISHMENT, (3) INTERNAL INTEGRATION, COORDINATION, AND INTERDEPENDENCE, AND (4) MUTUAL ADAPTATION OF SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY. PROBLEMS RELATED TO EACH OF THESE PROPERTIES ARE  SYMPTOMATIC OF THE SCHOOL IN INTERACTION WITH CURRENT DEMANDS. IMPLICATIONS OF THE ANALYSIS FOR RESEARCH AND ACTION INCLUDE THE RECOGNITION OF SCHOOL SYSTEM PROPERTIES HAVING CURRENT UTILITY, FOCUS OF EFFORTS ON MODIFYING ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES RATHER THAN ATTACKING SYMPTOMS, CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE GAINING OF SANCTIONS FOR CHANGE AGENT RECOMMENDATIONS, DETERMINATION OF THE CLIENT SYSTEM WITH WHICH THE CHANGE AGENT IS WORKING, AND FORMULATION OF MAJOR CHANGE GOALS FOR SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND STRATEGIES FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF CHANGE.

THEY ARE FACED WITH A LACK OF OPERATIONAL SOCIALIZATION GOALS AND THE NEED TO LINK THE PERSONAL GOALS OF YOUTH TO THE VALUES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE LARGER SOCIETY. SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF CHANGE INCLUDE THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE LINKAGE BETWEEN BASIC RESEARCH AND AGENTS OF CHANGE, LIMITED DIFFUSION OF CREATIVE SOCIALIZATION DEVELOPMENTS, MINIMAL FEEDBACK TO  FOSTER IMPROVED PRACTICES, AND INHERENT RESISTANCE TO CHANGE. THE SOCIALIZATION AGENT STRIVES FOR AN INTERNALIZED SELF-DIRECTION IN THE SOCIALIZEE, WITH INITIATIVE FOR SELF-CONTROL AND CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT.

RESEARCH GENERALIZATIONS INDICATING CONDITIONS WHICH INFLUENCE LEARNING ARE CITED AS A BASIS FOR A CONCEPTUAL MODEL. FROM THIS MODEL, SOME ORGANIZATIONAL FUNCTIONS WHICH NEED TO BE DEVELOPED WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM ARE DERIVED. FIVE LEVELS OF HUMAN PHENOMENA ARE CITED THAT CONDITION THE PROCESS OF RESOURCE UTILIZATION IN FULFILLING THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE OF THE CHILD--THE PUPIL AS SELF, THE CLASSROOM PEER GROUP, DIRECT WORKERS WHO CREATE LEARNING EXPERIENCES (TEACHERS), THOSE WHO INFLUENCE THE DIRECT WORKERS (PRINCIPALS), AND INFLUENCERS OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AS AN ORGANIZATION. IF THESE CONDITIONS ARE TO BE MAXIMIZED, A CLEAR CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF THE LEARNING PROCESS IS  ESSENTIAL. ELEMENTS OF SUCH A MODEL WOULD INCLUDE (1) LEARNING THROUGH INQUIRY, (2) INDIVIDUALIZATION OF LEARNING, (3) DEVELOPMENT OF PUPIL PURPOSE AND SELF-CONCEPT, (4) PUPIL INVOLVEMENT IN CURRICULUM PLANNING, (5) USE OF A WIDE VARIETY OF RESOURCES, AND (6) CROSS-ABILITY AND CROSS-AGE HELPING. TO INITIATE SUCH CONCEPTS, THE MICHIGAN REGION COOPERATIVE PROJECT FOR EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (COPED) STRATEGY FOR PLANNED CHANGE INVOLVES (1) ORGANIZATION OF MATERIALS CONCEPTUALIZING PLANNED CHANGE IN A FORM APPROPRIATE FOR SHARING WITH SCHOOL SYSTEM REPRESENTATIVES, (2) INTERUNIVERSITY COLLABORATION, AND (3) UNIVERSITY TEAM RELATIONSHIPS WITH SELECTED SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN ITS REGION. TWENTY-FIVE REPRESENTATIVES OF SYSTEMS IN THE MICHIGAN REGION WERE INVITED TO A CONFERENCE EXPLAINING THE PURPOSES  AND PROCEDURES OF COPED. STEPS WERE OUTLINED FOR BECOMING AN ACTION-RESEARCH COLLABORATION SYSTEM AND FOR IDENTIFYING CHANGE EFFORTS AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. THE PROGRAM SHOULD ACHIEVE (1) INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE CHANGE PROCEDURES, (2) SYSTEM ADOPTION OF DESIRABLE CHANGE EFFORTS, AND (3) DOCUMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF THE PROCESS TO PERMIT DISSEMINATION OF THIS CHANGE MODEL TO OTHER SYSTEMS.

IT RESULTS FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD BE VALUABLE FOR THE SYSTEM TO HAVE A ROLE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE PHENOMENA OF CHANGE. THE CHANGE AGENT IS REFERRED TO AS A TRAINER ROLE, SINCE TRAINED BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUALS CAN INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR PLANNED, PURPOSEFUL CHANGE. IT IS HELPFUL TO THINK OF THE TRAINER-CHANGE AGENT ROLE AS PROVIDING LINKAGES TO SUCH GAPS AS THOSE BETWEEN A GROUP OF TEACHERS AND THE VARIOUS KINDS OF RESOURCES THAT COULD HELP THEM PERFORM THEIR JOBS MORE EFFECTIVELY. LINKAGES COULD ALSO BE PROVIDED BETWEEN ADMINISTRATORS, SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS, AND CUSTODIANS AND THEIR ROLE EFFECTIVENESS. FOUR CONCEPTUAL MODELS ARE CITED WITHIN WHICH TRAINER ROLE LINKAGE IS UTILIZED TO  PERMIT CHANGE ANALYSIS AT BOTH MICRO- AND MACRO-LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE LINKAGE OF PEOPLE TO RESOURCES, THE TRAINER-CHANGE AGENT WOULD HAVE TO POSSESS PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS, INTERPERSONAL SKILLS OF RELATING, AND INNERPERSONAL LEARNING. SUCH SKILLS COULD BE IDEALLY DEVELOPED THROUGH A PLANNED ORIENTATION PERIOD. THE BEST POSSIBLE SOURCES OF CHANGE AGENTS WOULD BE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS, PSYCHOLOGISTS OR SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGISTS, OR PRACTITIONERS OF PERSONNEL TRAINING. THEIR ROLE WITHIN THE SYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE (1) UPPER ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY, (2) AUTONOMY IN RESPONDING TO AND DEVELOPING TRAINING EXPERIENCE OF PERSONNEL WITHIN THE SYSTEM, (3) ACTIVE COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE SYSTEM, (4) TEAM-WORK RELATIONSHIPS WITH EVALUATORS AND RESEARCHERS OF THE SYSTEM,  AND (5) SOURCES OF CONSULTATION REFERRAL OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM.

GRADE OF BEGINNING THERAPY AND NUMBER OF SESSIONS WOULD BE VARIED. RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH WOULD SHOW WHETHER THERAPY WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN VICARIOUS LEARNING AND, IF SO, WHEN AND HOW THERAPY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. NOTING THAT THIS EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM WAS NARROW IN SCOPE, THE AUTHORS FELT A NEW, MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH WAS NEEDED. PLANS FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM WERE SET ASIDE, AND THE AUTHORS  DEVELOPED A MODEL FOR A RESEARCH CENTER FOR SCHOOL SPEECH THERAPISTS. EIGHT PROJECTS WERE UNDERTAKEN TO TEST THE PLAN TO DETERMINE IF IT COULD EVOLVE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR DETERMINING STANDARDS FOR SCHOOL SPEECH AND HEARING PROGRAMS. PROJECTS INVOLVED SCHOOL EXPERIENCE AND PREPARATION IN TEST ADMINISTRATION FOR STUDENT SPEECH THERAPISTS, CHARACTERISTICS OF PUPILS RECEIVING SPEECH AND HEARING THERAPY, ASSESSING ORAL COMMUNICATION SKILLS, PROSPECTUSES (FOR STUDIES OF STUTTERING, EFFECTS OF THERAPY, REMISSION OF &quot;R&quot; ERRORS, AND REMISSION OF &quot;S&quot; ERRORS), COORDINATED RESEARCH, AND TEACHERS' RANKING OF CHILDREN'S PARTICIPATION IN DISCUSSIONS.

THE TMT-CAT CONTAINS 131 TEST ITEMS WHICH ARE PICTURES IN FORCED-CHOICE-PAIR COMPARISONS. THE CHILD MUST INDICATE PLACEMENT OF A STIMULUS PICTURE IN ONE PICTURE OF THE PAIR. PAIRED PICTURES REPRESENT THREE CATEGORIES--SUPERORDINATE, FUNCTIONAL, AND ASSOCIATIVE. THIS INSTRUMENT, ALONG WITH THE STANFORD ACHIEVEMENT READING TEST, WAS ADMINISTERED TO 313 HEARING CHILDREN, 225 TYPICALLY DEAF CHILDREN, AND 27 SPECIAL CLASS DEAF CHILDREN, TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEAF EXHIBIT SIMILAR MODES AT THE SAME DEVELOPMENTAL LEVELS AS HEARING CHILDREN. MODES OF CATEGORIZATION WERE STUDIED AT DIFFERENT  ACHIEVEMENT LEVELS OF DEAF AND HEARING CHILDREN TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE MODES CONTRIBUTE TO DIFFERENTIAL SCHOLASTIC ACHIEVEMENT. CATEOGRIZATION SCORES OF ALL CHILDREN WERE ANALYZED BY FACTORIAL ANALYSES OF VARIANCE AND THROUGH CORRELATION ANALYSIS. DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTAL PATTERNS WERE OBSERVED IN THE CATEGORIZATION MODES OF DEAF AND HEARING CHILDREN. WITH INCREASING AGE, SUPERORDINATE AND ASSOCIATIVE RESPONDING DECREASED, WHILE FUNCTIONAL RESPONDING INCREASED IN DEAF CHILDREN. WITH INCREASES IN GRADE AVERAGE, SIMILAR RESULTS WERE OBTAINED. FOR HEARING CHILDREN, INCREASING AGE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASED SUPERORDINATE RESPONDING, DECREASED ASSOCIATIVE RESPONDING, AND STABLE FUNCTIONAL RESPONDING. THIS SAME PATTERN EMERGED FOR GRADE AVERAGE AND MODES OF CATEGORIZATION. WHEN DEAF AND  HEARING CHILDREN WERE MATCHED EXACTLY ON READING ACHIEVEMENT SCORES, ALL DIFFERENCES IN CATEGORIZATION BEHAVIOR DISAPPEARED BETWEEN THESE GROUPS. SIMILARLY, WHEN SPECIAL CLASS DEAF CHILDREN WERE MATCHED WITH THEIR READING ACHIEVEMENT COUNTERPARTS IN THE REGULAR CLASSROOMS, NO DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE CATEGORIZATION BEHAVIOR OF THESE GROUPS. VYGOTSKY'S MODEL WAS PARTIALLY CONFIRMED BY THE RESULTS. THE RESULTS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT DIFICIENCIES IN CATEGORIZATION BEHAVIOR MAY CONTRIBUTE TO DEFICIENT LANGUAGE PERFORMANCE IN THE DEAF CHILD.

ECONOMIC STABILITY AND PROGRESS, AND NATIONAL SECURITY, ARE BASED ON EDUCATION. SUPPORT FOR MANY JUNIOR COLLEGES NOW COMES FROM THREE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. ALTHOUGH THE NATIONAL INCOME OF THE COUNTRY HAS RISEN, THERE HAS BEEN NO COMPARABLE INCREASE IN LOCAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR JUNIOR COLLEGES. FEDERAL FUNDS IN FLORIDA INCREASED 1,000  PERCENT FROM 1963 TO 1966. THIS HAS HAD BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS. FACILITIES, CURRICULUM, AND COUNSELING HAVE IMPROVED, BUT COLLEGES IN THE SAME STATE ARE FORCED TO COMPLETE FOR THE FUNDS. FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE CAUSED A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SEGREGATED SCHOOLS, ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF INFERIOR NEGRO SCHOOLS ARE BEING KEPT OPEN BY THESE FUNDS.

BECAUSE THE DEMAND FOR FACULTY HAS FAR OUTSTRIPPED SUPPLY, THE COMMISSION MAKES SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS--(1) SALARIES SHOULD BE INCREASED TO QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, (2) GREATER NUMBERS OF QUALIFIED FACULTY MEMBERS CAN BE PRODUCED BY INCREASING GRADUATE PROGRAMS, (3) UNDERGRADUATES SHOULD BE DIVERTED TO 2-YEAR INSTITUTIONS, THEREBY REDUCING UNIVERSITY RESOURCES  DEVOTED TO LOWER DIVISION INSTRUCTION, (4) INSTRUCTORS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO TEACH MORE CLASSES, AND (5) NEW TECHNIQUES OF INSTRUCTION SHOULD BE DEVELOPED.

A PILOT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO COMPARE THE INSTRUMENTAL AND VOCAL ENSEMBLES' EFFECTS ON STUDENTS IN URBAN SCHOOLS WITH STUDENTS IN RURAL SCHOOLS. OBSERVATIONS, QUESTIONNAIRES, PRE- AND POST-TESTING, AND TAPE RECORDED INTERVIEWS LED TO CONCLUSIONS THAT (1) LIVE MUSICAL PERFORMANCES CAN PRODUCE SPECIFIC FACTUAL OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF LEARNING ABOUT MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, HOW THEY ARE PLAYED, AND FACTS RELATED TO THE PERFORMERS, (2) POSITIVE ATTITUDINAL OUTCOMES (ATTENDING FUTURE PERFORMANCES, POSSIBLE FUTURE STUDY ON THE INSTRUMENT PLAYED, AND HEARING SIMILAR  MUSIC AGAIN) ACCRUE FROM LIVE PERFORMANCES, AND (3) LIVE MUSICAL PERFORMANCES HAVE A REAL POTENTIAL IN ACCULTURATION AND SELF-CONCEPT IMPROVEMENT OF CULTURALLY DISADVANTAGED AND CULTURALLY ISOLATED CHILDREN. YOUTH CONCERTS OF NEW MEXICO REPORTED 165 MUSICAL EVENTS PRESENTED TO 42,127 STUDENTS IN 17 SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE 13 PERFORMING UNITS INCLUDED SMALL INSTRUMENTAL GROUPS, DANCE SOLOISTS, AND VOICE SOLOISTS AND ENSEMBLES, APPENDIXES PRESENT DESCRIPTIONS OF PERFORMANCES, PROGRAMS, TEACHER GUIDES, AND FOLLOWUP TESTS.

THE ONE FACTOR WHICH HAS IMPEDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES HAS BEEN POPULATION CONCENTRATION. SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH SPARSE POPULATION HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS OF SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES.

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

THE  STANFORD CURRICULUM IN CAI IN BEGINNING READING IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING SEVEN PSYCHOLINGUISTIC TENETS--(1) TEACHING SPELLING AND READING INDEPENDENTLY, (2) INITIATING READING WITH A DECODING STAGE, (3) ASSOCIATING SIGHT TO SOUND BETWEEN LETTER PATTERNS AND VOCALIC CENTER GROUPS (VCG), (4) SCALING THE DIFFICULTY OF THE VCG UNITS FOR PRESENTATION, (5) PRESENTING GRAPHIC PATTERNS AS MEMBERS OF A RHYME AND ALLITERATION SET IN A MATIX FORMAT, (6) PRESENTING WORD ITEMS IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS, EMPHASIZING THE MORPHOLOGICAL, SYNTACTIC, AND SEMANTIC FUNCTIONS, AND (7) PRESENTING WORDS IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS IN WHICH PRONUNICATION, GRAMMAR, AND MEANING CONVEY THE WRITER'S INTENT. THESE TENETS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF CONTEMPORARY PEDAGOGICAL OPINION, RELATED EMPIRICAL RESEARCH, EXPERIMENAL  INVESTIGATIONS BY THE STANFORD GROUP, AND PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES IN CURRICULUM MATERIALS.

TEN HIGH VERBAL AND 10 LOW VERBAL GIRLS WERE SELECTED FOR STUDY ON THE BASIS OF SCORES ON THE GATES READING SURVEY AND ON THE LORGE-THORNDIKE INTELLIGENCE TEST. ONE-TAILED T TESTS WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. MOTHERS OF HIGH VERBAL GIRLS EXHIBITED MORE POSITIVE SCORES ON SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL REACTIONS AND TOTAL WARMTH. THE PURPOSES OF THE SECOND STUDY WERE TO SHOW THE EFFECT OF A PARENT TRAINING PROGRAM ON SILENT AND ORAL READING AND TO CORRELATE MOTHERS' ATTITUDES WITH SILENT AND ORAL READING. SUBJECTS WERE 13 EXPERIMENTAL AND 16  CONTROL STUDENTS IN GRADES 3 TO 6. PUPIL PRE- AND POST-MEASURES WERE THE CALIFORNIA TEST AND THE GILMORE ORAL READING TEST. THE PARENT MEASURE WAS THE PARENTAL ATTITUDE RESEARCH INSTRUMENT. FOURTEEN WEEKLY SESSIONS WERE HELD WITH EXPERIMENTAL PARENTS. MEAN SCORES, DIFFERENCE SCORES, AND T TESTS WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. THE TREATMENT HAD A GREATER EFFECT ON ORAL THAN ON SILENT READING.

RESPONDENTS CITED STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE SYSTEM WITH REGARD TO THE TRAINING OF OBSERVERS, THE ADEQUACY OF THE CATEGORIES USED, AND THE REACTIONS OF THOSE  LEARNING THE SYSTEM. MAJOR WEAKNESSES WERE FELT TO BE THE USE OF A NUMBER TO REPRESENT A TEACHING BEHAVIOR, AND THE (TO SOME) THREATENING PROSPECT OF HAVING TO ANALYZE ONE'S OWN TEACHING BEHAVIOR. MAJOR STRENGTHS WERE ADDED INSIGHTS AND THE OPERATIONALIZING OF METHODS AND THEORY.

RESPONSES WERE ON A NINE-STEP, NEGATIVE-TO-POSITIVE SCALE TO SUCH QUESTIONS AS (1) WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO FACULTY MEETINGS, (2) DO YOU FEEL FREE TO EXPRESS YOURSELF, AND (3) WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OTHER FACULTY MEMBERS.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RESPONSES OF TEACHERS AND OF PRINCIPALS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. ALSO, ON FOUR OF THE SIX ITEMS,  TEACHERS' RESPONSES WERE MORE VARIABLE, WHEREAS FOR PRINCIPALS, THERE WAS A &quot;TYPICAL&quot; REACTION. RESULTS WERE INTERPRETED AS SHOWING THAT TEACHERS WERE CONCERNED WITH THE CLASSROOM, BUT PRINCIPALS WITH THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

CANONICAL ANALYSIS OF THE THREE SETS OF DATA SHOWED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM.

THE QUASIMYSTICAL VIEW OF TEACHING AS AN &quot;ART&quot; WAS PUT IN DOUBT BY THE WORK OF ALLEN (AND OTHERS) IN MICROTEACHING, WHICH USED STUDENT RATINGS OF TEACHERS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT TEACHERS TRAINED WITH ACCESS TO STUDENT APPRAISAL IMPROVED MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THAN THOSE WITHOUT, AND THAT STUDENT RATINGS WERE THE MOST STABLE AND RELIABLE MEASURE (MORE RELIABLE THAN RATINGS OF SUPERVISORS). CLERICAL WORK IN SOLICITING  STUDENT EVALUATIONS COULD BE DIMINISHED BY THE USE OF DATA-PROCESSABLE FORMS (EXAMPLES INCLUDED) BY PROFESSORS AND TEACHERS. GATHERING THIS INFORMATION OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS WOULD YIELD VALUABLE NORMATIVE DATA.

THE FORMER EMPHASIZES THE PATHOLOGICAL IN NEGRO FAMILY LIFE, THE LATTER THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS WHICH AFFECT THE FAMILY. STUDENTS OF THE NEGRO FAMILY HAVE NOTED THAT THE PARTICULAR PATTERN OF FAMILY INSTABILITY WHICH THE REPORT STRESSES MAY BE THE BEST ADAPTATION POSSIBLE UNDER CONDITIONS OF SOCIOECONOMIC DEPRIVATION. THEY ALSO SAY THAT LOW-INCOME NEGRO FAMILIES HAVE MANY STRENGTHS AND THAT 75 PERCENT ARE INTACT. THE REPORT STATES THAT THE HIGH RATE OF ILLEGITIMACY AMONG NEGROES IS A FACTOR IN FAMILY INSTABILITY, BUT CRITICS POINT OUT THAT THIS SOCIAL PROBLEM HAS TO BE STUDIED MORE THOROUGHLY TO ESTABLISH ITS ETIOLOGY AND  ACTUAL RELATIONSHIP TO INSTABILITY. SUCH FACTORS AS DIVERGENT CLASS VALUES ABOUT LEGITIMACY AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN INCOME LEVEL AND CONTRACEPTION MUST BE CONSIDERED. THE REPORT, IN SHORT, ATTRIBUTES THE &quot;PATHOLOGY&quot; IN THE NEGRO FAMILY TO RACIAL AND HISTORICAL VARIABLES RATHER THAN SOCIOECONOMIC ONES.

IN THIS SYSTEM, AT ABOUT THE EIGHTH GRADE, STUDENTS IN ITALIAN SCHOOLS ARE CAREFULLY ADVISED BY PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED VOCATIONAL COUNSELORS AND SUBSEQUENTLY PLACED IN CENTERS WHERE THEY ARE TAUGHT SKILLS FOR JOBS WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THEM. HENCE, THEY ARE VIRTUALLY GUARANTEED GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. THE EMPHASIS IN THIS TRAINING PROGRAM IS ON  TEACHING THE STUDENT SPECIFIC SKILLS RATHER THAN ON COMPENSATING FOR HIS CULTURAL BACKGROUND. IF THE UNITED STATES WERE TO FOLLOW ITALY'S EXAMPLE IN ALLOWING PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO PARTICIPATE MORE IN SUCH TRAINING PROGRAMS, CRUCIAL NEEDS OF THE WORKER, AND ALSO THE MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS OF AN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY, MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVELY MET.

HOWEVER, THE DATA ON THE INFLUENCE OF THESE ATTITUDES ARE NOT SO CLEAR AS ON OTHER FACTORS. RESEARCH ON TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS POINTS TO THEIR FAILURE IN TEACHING THE SKILLS OF BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS AND IN PROVIDING THE MEANS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF THE DISADVANTAGED CHILD. (NH)",

ATTENTION MUST ALSO BE GIVEN TO SELECTION OF  TEACHERS AND TEACHER CANDIDATES, AS THE TEACHERS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE A STUDENT'S ATTITUDES. IT IS FELT THAT THE CONFERENCE OVERLOOKED THE IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL INTEGRATION IN EDUCATING THE DISADVANTAGED. THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS MUST ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR DESEGREGATION, AND SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION MUST INSTILL A COMMITMENT TO INTEGRATION IN THE SCHOOLS AND IN SOCIETY.

THE STUDY FOCUSED ON (1) THE EXTENT OF RACIAL SEGREGATION IN THE SCHOOLS AND THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT OF NEGRO AND WHITE SCHOOL CHILDREN, (2) FACTORS WHICH INTENSIFY AND PERPETUATE SEGREGATION, (3) THE EFFECTS OF SEGREGATED SCHOOLING ON CHILDREN'S EDUCATION, ATTITUDES, AND INTERRACIAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND (4) PROGRAMS TO REMEDY EDUCATIONAL DISADVANTAGE AND RELIEVE SEGREGATION. ALONG WITH THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY OF THESE CONCERNS, THE REPORT DISCUSSES THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF SCHOOL SEGREGATION--THE ROLE OF THE STATES, JUDICAL DECISIONS, AND CONGRESSIONAL ACTION. ALTHOUGH DATA FOR THIS STUDY WERE GATHERED IN MORE THAN 100 COMMUNITIES OF VARYING SIZE AND RACIAL COMPOSITION, GREATEST  ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO SCHOOL SEGREGATION IN METROPOLITAN AREAS. IN GENERAL, THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT NEGRO CHILDREN HAVE LOWER ACHIEVEMENT, ASPIRATIONS, AND SELF-ESTEEM THAN WHITES, AND FACE GREATER BARRIERS IN BEING UNDERSTOOD IN SCHOOL AND IN THE COMMUNITY. IMMEDIATE ACTION IS RECOMMENDED FOR NEW LEGISLATION (1) TO REMOVE RACIAL IMBALANCE IN THE SCHOOLS, (2) TO ESTABLISH A UNIFORM STANDARD OF RACIAL BALANCE FOR EACH STATE, AND (3) TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL HELP FOR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY. FAIR HOUSING LEGISLATION AND APPROPRIATIONS FOR LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME HOUSING UNITS WHICH WOULD BE LOCATED SO AS TO REDUCE SCHOOL SEGREGATION ARE ALSO RECOMMENDED.

OF THE 61.8 PERCENT WHO HAD NOT COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL, 30.1 PERCENT DROPPED OUT DURING GRADES 9-11, AND THE REMAINDER HAD 8 YEARS OR LESS OF EDUCATION. SOME ATTEMPTS TO RELIEVE THE UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE MICHIGAN EMPLOYMENT SECURITY COMMISSION, THE MOTT FOUNDATION RETRAINING PROGRAM IN FLINT, UNION-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS, AND FEDERAL LEGISLATION. THE LOW RESPONSE OF THE UNEMPLOYED TO RETRAINING PROGRAMS CLEARLY INDICATED A MOTIVATION PROBLEM. MOST OF THE UNEMPLOYED CONTACTED ABOUT A RETRAINING PROGRAM IN WEST VIRGINIA WERE NOT INTERESTED, EXPECTED TO BE CALLED BACK TO WORK SOON, OR FELT THEY WERE TOO OLD TO BE  STARTING OVER AGAIN. THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS MUST BE EFFECTIVELY USED TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE PRESENT UNEMPLOYMENT EMERGENCY. TRAINING MUST BE UNDERTAKEN WITH THE COOPERATIVE EFFORTS OF THE SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY. SCHOOLS MUST BE REORGANIZED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF BOTH STUDENTS AND SOCIETY AT LARGE. (PS)",

THE PROPOSED SYSTEM WOULD BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN EDUCATIONAL ACCOUNTING AND COMPREHENSIVE NATIONWIDE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. DURING THE COURSE OF DESIGNING THE SYSTEM, NUMEROUS CONFERENCES WERE HELD WITH FEDERAL AND STATE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PERSONNEL TO DEFINE THE BASIC DATA NEEDED TO MEET IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, A TOUR OF SEVEN STATES WAS MADE TO SURVEY  EXISTING VOCATIONAL EDUCATION REPORT SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES, PROCESSING TECHNIQUES, AND PROBLEMS RELATED TO DATA COLLECTION AND RETRIEVAL. AFTER THE BASIC DATA WAS DEFINED, A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND DEMONSTRATED IN A FIELD TEST. ALTHOUGH ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS WERE WRITTEN FOR THE DEMONSTRATION, THE RESULTS WERE DETAILED ENOUGH TO REFINE THE PROTOTYPE DESIGN FOR APPLICATION TO A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM.

THE TRAPPERS SELECTED WERE CREE OF JAMES BAY, LIVING IN ONTARIO. THE HORTICULTURISTS SELECTED WERE THE MAYANS OF YUCATAN, AND THE INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY STUDIED WAS CHICAGO. THE SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED AND INTERVIEWED. VALUES WERE MEASURED ON THE BASIS OF THE SUBJECTS' RESPONSES TO VERBALLY PRESENTED ITEMS, ADMINISTERED ORALLY TO THE TRADITIONAL GROUPS  (TRAPPERS AND HORTICULTURISTS). NEED-FOR-ACHIEVEMENT WAS MEASURED BY SUBJECT'S RESPONSE TO SIX PICTORIAL STIMULI. NEED-FOR-AUTHORITY WAS MEASURED BY LIKERT SCALES. OF THE SEVERAL HYPOTHESES FORMED CONCERNING \"VALUES,\"\"MOTIVES,\" AND \"SOCIALIZATION,\" SOME WERE CONFIRMED AND SOME WERE NOT. ANALYSIS OF THE REASONS WHY SOME PREDICTIONS WERE NOT CONFIRMED LED TO FURTHER ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS THAT COULD BE OF VALUE IN FUTURE CROSS-CULTURAL STUDIES.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH WAS COMBINED INTO A TENTATIVE THEORY OF TRANSFER WHICH WAS TESTED AND ASSESSED BY FOCUSING ON BOTH TRIALS-TO-CRITERION AND VERBAL REPORTS AS MEASURES OF TRANSFER. THE THEORY INVESTIGATED WAS--WHEN A RULE HAS BEEN LEARNED, IT EXISTS IN SOME FORM IN THE LEARNER'S MEMORY. THIS LEARNING WILL HAVE INFLUENCE ON LEARNING IN A NEW SITUATION ONLY IF A TRANSFER HYPOTHESIS AND A TRANSFER INTENTION ARE FORMED. TWO TASKS WERE PRESENTED. IN THE FIRST TASK, A RULE WAS LEARNED AS APPLIED TO ONE SET OF STIMULI. IN THE SECOND TASK, THE SAME RULE WAS PRESENTED ALONG WITH ALTERNATIVE RULES AS POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS  TO THE TASK. FINDINGS BASED ON THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF ERRORS MADE BY THE GROUP TAUGHT RULE 1 AND THE GROUP TAUGHT RULE 2 INDICATED THAT THE SECOND RULE WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO LEARN AND USE. IN ADDITION, ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE OF TWO TIME-MEASURES FOR THE TRAINING TASK SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT RULE 2 WAS THE MORE DIFFICULT. WHEN TRIALS-TO-CRITERION ALONE WAS USED AS THE CRITERION OF TRANSFER, IT APPEARED THAT THERE WERE NO TRANSFER-WITHOUT-AWARENESS EFFECTS AND THAT TRANSFER OF A SPECIFIC RULE COULD BE EXPLAINED SOLELY IN TERMS OF POSITIVE TRANSFER HYPOTHESES AND TRANSFER INTENTIONS. USING TYPE-OF-SOLUTION AS A FURTHER CRITERION OF TRANSFER DID NOT CHANGE THIS GENERAL CONCLUSION. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT MEASURES OF THE LEARNING PROCESS SEEMED TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL CRITERIA FOR  DETECTING TRANSFER EFFECTS. (GD)",

A CONTROL GROUP PERFORMED ONLY THE CRITERION TASK. THE ENTIRE EXPERIMENT WAS CARRIED OUT TWICE, ONCE USING LARGE GROUP TESTING PROCEDURES AND ONCE WITH GROUPS OF EITHER SEVEN OR 14 AT A TIME. ERROR SCORES WERE USED AS A MEASURE OF RATE OF LEARNING. THE INVESTIGATOR ATTRIBUTED THE GREATEST TRANSFER EFFECT TO WARM-UP, AND THE NEXT LARGEST TO LEARNING-TO-LEARN EFFECTS.

THE FRAMEWORK WILL BE IN THE FORM OF A MATHEMATICAL MODEL THAT WILL PROVIDE A METHOD FOR THE ANALYSIS OF BENEFITS DERIVED FROM THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT (ESEA), TITLE I PROGRAM. THE MODEL IS BASED ON A CONCEPT OF EDUCATION AS AN INDUSTRY THAT TAKES CHILDREN WITH CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS AND EMBODIES HUMAN CAPITAL (KNOWLEDGE) IN THEM. FROM THIS CONCEPT, TWO FACTORS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT WERE CONSIDERED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS--(1) THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CHILDREN AND (2) THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SCHOOL INPUTS. ESEA PROJECTS WERE AIMED AT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS TO DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN, THAT IS, THOSE FROM  LOW-INCOME FAMILIES, AND WERE REPORTED TO HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS--(1) INCREASED THE LEARNING CAPACITY OF THE CHILDREN AND THUS INCREASED THEIR EARNING CAPACITY, AND (2) THE INCREASED LEARNING CAPACITY ALSO INCREASED PROBABILITY OF STAYING IN SCHOOL, INCREASED PROBABILITY OF GRADUATING AND GOING ON TO HIGHER EDUCATION, AND REDUCED THE PROBABILITY OF BECOMING JUVENILE DELINQUENTS. IN THIS STUDY, THE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM THE PROGRAMS WERE ANALYZED IN TERMS OF INCREASE IN PERSONAL INCOME FROM GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND FROM GOING TO COLLEGE, REDUCTION OF UNEMPLOYMENT, REDUCTION OF JUVENILE CRIME, INTERGENERATION EFFECTS, AND INCREASED LABOR FORCE MOBILITY. THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL BEING DEVELOPED WILL PROVIDE A MEANS OF EVALUATING THE MONETARY BENEFITS FROM TITLE I PROGRAMS BY  DETERMINING THE MONETARY BENEFITS LESS THE COSTS OF THE PROGRAM. (AL)",

THE PRESENT ROLE OF CSLEA IS MAINLY OPERATIONAL, MORE&quot;NON-LIBERAL,&quot; AND MORE PREOCCUPIED WITH THE INSTRUMENTS OF HIGHER ADULT EDUCATION SUCH AS THE NEGRO COLLEGE PROJECT. AN ATTEMPT IS BEING MADE TO ACHIEVE A NEW BALANCE BETWEEN THE REFLECTIVE AND OPERATIONAL ROLES.

OBSTACLES TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PROJECT WERE FELT TO BE THE SHORTNESS OF THE TWO AND ONE-HALF YEAR PERIOD, A LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN CONSULTANTS AND COUNTY AGENTS, AND LACK OF ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM.

AFTER A DISCUSSION OF CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING SOCIETY, EDUCATION PROVIDED BY THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, BY CORPORATIONS, AND UNIONS WAS OUTLINED. A MODEL OF A NEW TEACHING METHOD (CASE STUDY) WAS PRESENTED. BUSINESS MEN ARE ATTENTIVE TO PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY AFFAIRS AND CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY BUT PROBLEMS IN CORPORATE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS REVOLVE AROUND SELF-INTEREST VS CITIZENSHIP RESPONSIBILITY, LIBERTY AMONG EMPLOYEES, AND THE PRESSURES OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS REVOLUTION. IN LABOR UNIONS, THERE  IS PRESSURE FOR CONFORMITY, ALSO, AND A WIDE GAP BETWEEN VIEWS OF TOP UNION SPOKESMEN AND THOSE OF LOCAL LEADERS. LABOR EDUCATION, WHICH HAS BEEN IN ESSENCE LEADERSHIP TRAINING TO BUILD UP ORGANIZATIONAL STRENGTH, IS NOW PROVIDING SOME EDUCATION IN THE AREA OF TOTAL SOCIETY, INCLUDING CIVIL RIGHTS. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES INVOLVED IN AMERICAN LIBERTIES STEM FROM THE SACREDNESS OF HUMAN LIFE AND DEVELOPMENT IN PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, AND AUTONOMOUS FREEDOM. THE CONFERENCE WAS CONCLUDED WITH DISCUSSIONS OF PRESENT TEACHING OF AMERICAN LIBERTIES AND WHAT THE CENTER MIGHT DO TO IMPROVE IT. (EB)",

THE TEACHER INSTITUTE, SUBDIVIDED INTO ELEMENTARY EDUCATION OR ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE INTEREST GROUPS, FEATURED LECTURE-DISCUSSIONS AND SMALL GROUP ACTIVITIES IN WHICH INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS AND MATERIALS, EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING TECHNIQUES, AND METHODS OF EVALUATION AND MEASUREMENT WERE STUDIED. IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE INSTITUTE, DIVIDED INTO NINE PROJECT GROUPS, EACH PARTICIPANT  DEVELOPED A PROJECT TO BE USED IN HIS COMMUNITY. FOUR EVENINGS A WEEK PARTICIPANTS IN BOTH INSTITUTES OBSERVED AND TAUGHT IN ABE CLASSES IN LOS ANGELES. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORKSHOPS WERE--CONDUCT SEPARATE WORKSHOPS FOR RURAL AND METROPOLITAN ABE PROGRAMS, PROVIDE FOR A MORE CONSISTENT METHOD OF PARTICIPANT SELECTION, SELECT STAFF ASSOCIATES FROM PREVIOUS INSTITUTE PARTICIPANTS, AND SEPARATE ADMINISTRATOR AND TEACHER INSTITUTES.

ADOPTION SCORES WERE USED TO CLASSIFY THE FARMERS AND STAGES OF ADOPTION (AWARENESS, INTEREST, EVALUATION, TRIAL, ADOPTION).

CHARACTERISTICS NEGATIVELY RELATED INCLUDED LONG DAIRYING EXPERIENCE, LARGE FAMILIES, AND LONG TENURE ON THE PRESENT FARM. AWARENESS CAME LARGELY BY MASS MEDIA, BUT PERSONAL CONTACTS WERE DOMINANT AT LATER STAGES OF ADOPTION.

THE EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS--FIFTH, SEVENTH, AND EIGHTH GRADE CHILDREN, AND COLLEGE SOPHOMORES--JUDGED THE MOST APPROPRIATE REFERENT IN EACH SENTENCE. RESULTS FROM THE SOPHOMORE GROUP  CONCLUSIVELY DEMONSTRATED THAT SUBJECTS COULD RESOLVE AN AMBIGUITY IN A SENTENCE BY REDUCING THE MEANING OF A KEY WORD FROM TWO TO ONE. EIGHTH GRADE SUBJECTS DEMONSTRATED THEY COULD LARGELY RESOLVE THE PRONOMINAL REFERENT WHEN REAL VERBS WERE USED (AS OPPOSED TO NONSENSE VERBS).

TWO PUBLIC SCHOOLS, ONE IN A POVERTY AREA AND ONE IN A MIDDLE CLASS AREA, WERE CHOSEN FOR THE STUDY. EFFORTS WERE MADE TO CHOOSE SIX KINDERGARTEN AND SIX FIRST GRADE CLASSES COMPOSED OF EQUAL NUMBERS OF NEGRO, SPANISH-SPEAKING, AND &quot;OTHER&quot; CHILDREN. GENERAL ABILITY AND INTELLIGENCE WERE NOT CONSIDERED. EVERY DAY FOR 15 MINUTES A TEACHER BILINGUAL IN SPANISH AND ENGLISH VISITED THE CLASSROOMS AND PRESENTED SPECIALLY PREPARED MATERIALS USING SPANISH ABOUT 65 PERCENT OF THE LESSON TIME. THE CHILDREN WERE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND IN BOTH LANGUAGES AND THE SPANISH-SPEAKING CHILDREN WERE ALSO ENCOURAGED TO PARTICIPATE AS &quot;INFORMANTS&quot; AND TO ACT OUT  STORIES IN SPANISH. THE CURRICULUM STRESSED VERBAL INTERACTION AND STIMULATION IN BOTH LANGUAGES. STORIES, SONGS, GAMES, DANCES, AND AUDIO-VISUAL AIDS (PUPPETS, REALIA, ETC.) WERE USED EXTENSIVELY. THE REGULAR CLASSROOM TEACHER WAS SHOWN HOW MATERIAL PRESENTED IN THE &quot;BILINGUAL&quot; CLASS COULD BE COORDINATED WITH REGULAR CLASSWORK. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATED THAT THERE WAS GREATER ACCEPTANCE BY THE CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS OF SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNING. THE SPANISH-SPEAKING CHILDREN ACQUIRED GREATER SELF-CONFIDENCE AND CULTURAL AWARENESS. APPENDED TO THIS REPORT ARE NUMEROUS SAMPLE LESSONS AND LESSON PLANS. (JD)",

THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF INTERDEPENDENCY RELATIONSHIPS, VARIOUS DEEP- AND SURFACE-STRUCTURE FEATURES ARE DISTINGUISHED CONCERNING TRANSITIVE VERBS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THEIR LEXICAL/SEMANTIC ENVIRONMENTS. TWO TYPES OF VERBS--\"SURPRISE\" AND \"TELL\"--ARE TREATED IN DETAIL. IT IS FOUND THAT \"SURPRISE\" VERBS MAY APPEAR WITH ANIMATE SURFACE-STRUCTURE OBJECTS, BUT REQUIRE ANIMATE DEEP-STRUCTURE SUBJECTS, AND ARE INTERPRETED AS EITHER \"INTENTIONAL\" OR \"ACCIDENTAL.\" MODAL ENVIRONMENTS SEEM TO BE INSTRUMENTAL IN DETERMINING THIS MEANING, AND APPARENTLY THE CONDITIONS THAT GOVERN THE INTENTIONAL-ACCIDENTAL DICHOTOMY  ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE GOVERNING \"FLIP\" TRANSFORMATIONS (REVERSAL OF SUBJECT AND OBJECT) IN \"SURPRISE\" VERBS. \"TELL\" VERBS HAVE MORE NUANCES OF SEMANTIC INTERPRETATION, BUT GENERALLY MEAN EITHER \"NOTIFY\" OR \"COMMAND.\" THEY REQUIRE ANIMATE SURFACE-STRUCTURE OBJECTS, AND DO NOT UNDERGO \"FLIP\" TRANSFORMATIONS. ONE GENERAL CONCLUSION IS THAT IF A VERB REQUIRES AN ANIMATE NOUN AS THE OBJECT IN DEEP-STRUCTURE, THE SUBJECT MUST ALSO BE ANIMATE.

THIS REPORT IS BASED ON RESPONSES TO QUESTIONNAIRES FILLED OUT BY 303 OF THE STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR EXPOSURE TO JAPANESE AT HOME, THEIR BIRTHPLACE, AND THEIR SELF-EVALUATION OF PROFICIENCY IN READING, SPEAKING, LEARNING VOCABULARY, AND UNDERSTANDING GRAMMAR. FIVE GROUPS WERE ESTABLISHED RANGING FROM THOSE WITH DAILY EXPOSURE TO JAPANESE (157 STUDENTS) TO STUDENTS WITHOUT ANY CONTACT WITH THE LANGUAGE OUTSIDE OF CLASS (37). IT WAS FOUND THAT THOSE GROUPS WITH GREATER EXPOSURE TO JAPANESE RATED GRAMMAR MORE DIFFICULT THAN VOCABULARY OR &quot;HEARING.&quot; STUDENTS WITHOUT FREQUENT EXPOSURE  TO THE TARGET LANGUAGE HAD MORE DIFFICULTY WITH &quot;HEARING&quot; THAN WITH GRAMMAR. THE TEACHERS OF THESE CLASSES COMMENTED THAT READING ABILITY AND GRAMMAR LEARNING SEEM LEAST AFFECTED BY OUTSIDE EXPOSURE TO JAPANESE, WHILE THERE IS A MARKED DIFFERENCE AMONG THE GROUPS IN RATE OF LEARNING VOCABULARY AND SPEAKING ABILITY.

THE FILMS WERE ANALYZED TO NOTE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PHYSICAL MOVEMENT AND THE ACTUAL CONTENT OF THE CONVERSATION. THE FRAMES OF THE FILM WERE SEQUENTIALLY NUMBERED TO CORRELATE THEM TO THE NEAREST FRAME WITH THE SOUND RECORDING. SOME RESEARCH TOOK NOTE OF A SINGLE PERSON'S MOVEMENTS DURING THE MOVIES AND OTHER WORK WAS DONE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO INTERACTORS' MOVEMENTS (INCLUDING BODY CONSONANCE OR CONGRUENCE). INCIDENTAL STUDIES INVOLVED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOVEMENT AND CERTAIN WORDS OR PHONEMES. IT WAS NOTED THAT IN EACH MOVIE THERE WERE AT LEAST A FEW TIMES WHEN TWO INTERACTORS MOVED THE SAME PART OF THEIR BODIES IN THE SAME WAY AT THE SAME  TIME. THIS TANDEM MOVEMENT WAS CALLED SYNCHRONY. SYNCHRONY WAS LATER FOUND TO OCCUR BETWEEN DIFFERING ELEMENTS--THE SPEAKER'S CIGARETTE AND THE LISTENER'S HEAD, FOR EXAMPLE. ANOTHER STUDY BROUGHT UP THE QUESTION OF WHETHER INTERACTORS CHANGE POSTURE AS THE NARRATIVE CHANGES FROM SHARED TO NON-SHARED EXPERIENCES.

THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY AN EQUAL NUMBER OF BOYS AND GIRLS IN EACH GROUP. THE TEST REQUIRED THE CHILDREN TO APPLY A BASIC GRAMMATICAL RULE (THE FORMATION OF PLURALS, DIMINUTIVES, AGENTIVES, VERB FORMS, OR  POSSESSIVES) TO A NONSENSE WORD. THE PROCESS OF INTERNALIZATION WAS WELL UNDER WAY IN THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN AND CONTINUED AT A SIGNIFICANT RATE SO THAT THE 11-12 AGE GROUP DEMONSTRATED A COMMAND OF MOST OF THE GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES TESTED. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS IN THE ACQUISITION OF THESE RULES.

COASTAL DIALECTS BELONG TO THE IJO GROUP OF LANGUAGES WHILE THE HINTERLAND DIALECTS ARE OF ANOTHER LANGUAGE FAMILY. DURING THE 19TH CENTURY THE HINTERLAND PEOPLES WERE POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DOMINATED BY THE COASTAL PEOPLE AND THE LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY THE VARIOUS GROUPS DEMONSTRATED (1) A HIGH INCIDENCE OF BILINGUALISM IN THE HINTERLAND NOT PARALLELED BY SIMILAR BILINGUALISM ON THE COAST, (2) A HIGH INCIDENCE OF COASTAL PERSONAL AND PLACE NAMES IN THE HINTERLAND, AND (3) THE FREQUENT USE OF COASTAL LANGUAGES IN EVERYDAY AFFAIRS IN HINTERLAND COMMUNITIES. THE CESSATION OF THE OIL RIVERS TRADE,  THE COLONIAL REGIME, AND NIGERIAN NATIONALISM AND INDEPENDENCE HAVE CAUSED NOT ONLY SOCIAL-ECONOMIC CHANGES BUT LINGUISTIC CHANGES AS WELL. A GROWING SENSE OF ETHNIC IDENTITY AMONG THE MINORITY HINTERLAND GROUPS IS SEEN IN A SHIFT AWAY FROM USE OF COASTAL DIALECTS AS SECOND LANGUAGES AND A CONSCIOUS DESIRE TO REPLACE &quot;FOREIGN&quot; USAGE WITH THE VERNACULAR. THE CHANGE IN THE LANGUAGE SITUATION, THEN, ILLUSTRATES THE SOCIAL-ECONOMIC TREND AWAY FROM NATIONAL AND REGIONAL UNITY TOWARD DIVERSITY AND PARTICULARISM.

THE DATA FOR THE STUDY WAS FURNISHED BY TWO AMERICAN COLLEGE SURVEYS. STUDENTS FROM TWO NATIONWIDE SAMPLES OF 28 COLLEGES WERE POLLED FOR THEIR VOCATIONAL CHOICES AND WERE GIVEN THE SIXTH REVISION OF THE VOCATIONAL PREFERENCE INVENTORY. EIGHT MONTHS OR A YEAR LATER, THEY WERE POLLED AGAIN FOR THEIR VOCATIONAL CHOICES. VOCATIONAL CHOICES WERE CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO A SIX CATEGORY CLASSIFICATION SCHEME WHICH CODED 99 VOCATIONS INTO THESE CLASSES--REALISTIC, INTELLECTUAL, SOCIAL, CONVENTIONAL, ENTERPRISING, AND ARTISTIC. RESULTS INDICATE THAT ASKING THE STUDENT ABOUT HIS VOCATIONAL CHOICES OR ASKING HIM ABOUT HIS  VOCATIONAL INTENTIONS AND ROLE ARE ALMOST TWICE AS EFFICIENT AS THE VOCATIONAL PREFERENCE INVENTORY IN PREDICTING VOCATIONAL CHOICE. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT INTEREST INVENTORIES SHOULD BE USED WITH GREATER DISCRIMINATION. (WR)",

THE IMPLICIT ASSUMPTION THAT COUNSELORS ALREADY KNOW HOW TO COUNSEL SHOULD BE QUESTIONED. THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE SHOULD BE CLIENT, NOT COUNSELOR BEHAVIOR.

RESEARCH SHOULD GAIN THE RESPECT OF OTHER DISCIPLINES. THE TEST OF RELEVANCE SHOULD BE APPLIED IN PLANNING COUNSELING RESEARCH. OUTCOME CRITERIA OF COUNSELING RESEARCH SHOULD BE TAILORED TO THE BEHAVIOR CHANGES DESIRED BY THE CLIENTS AND COUNSELORS INVOLVED. THE CRITERION FOR EACH CLIENT SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE. GROSS CRITERION  MEASURES, SUCH AS GRADE POINT AVERAGE, HAVE DANGEROUS WEAKNESSES. CRITERION BEHAVIOR EXTERNAL TO THE COUNSELING SITUATION ITSELF IS IRRELEVANT.

THE KPR WAS ADMINISTERED BOTH BEFORE  AND AFTER THE TOURS TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND A CONTROL GROUP. THE EXPERIMENT (1) DID NOT AUGMENT STUDENT AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF ACADEMIC PURSUITS, (2) DID NOT MOTIVATE STUDENTS TO PERFORM SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IN CITIZENSHIP OR IN CLASSROOM BEHAVIOR, (3) DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THE NUMBER OF UNEXCUSED ABSENCES, AND (4) DID NOT UNCOVER SIGNIFICANT INTEREST CHANGES.

STUDIES WHICH TESTED ROE'S HYPOTHESIS THAT CHOICE OF OCCUPATION BY PERSON OR NONPERSON ORIENTATION IS AFFECTED BY FAMILY PATTERNS SHOWED NEGATIVE RESULT.

THE AESTHETIC CONCEPT INCLUDES AWARENESS OF A SHARED RELATIONSHIP, A RECIPROCITY OF EMOTIONS BETWEEN COUNSELEE AND COUNSELOR. EMOTIONAL INTERACTION DIFFERENTIATES EMPATHY FROM SYMPATHY. IN EMPATHY, THE COUNSELOR'S EMOTIONAL ASSOCIATION IS IN TERMS OF THE CLIENT'S FRAME OF REFERENCE. IN SYMPATHY, IT IS IN TERMS OF HIS OWN FRAME OF REFERENCE.

THE THREE HIERARCHICAL GROUPINGS SHOWN ARE BASED ON (1) 10 USOE CATEGORIES OF INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, (2) 14 INPUT AND ORIENTATION VARIABLES, AND (3) 36 COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT AN INCREASE IN EITHER THE NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS OR THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES MAY RESULT IN MORE GROUPS BEING DEFINED AT THE CRITERION LEVEL.

IT PROPOSES THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, AS ALL SOCIAL SYSTEMS, HAS MEANS OF MAKING AUTHORITATIVE DECISIONS GOVERNING THE BEHAVIOR OF SYSTEM MEMBERS. DAVID EASTON'S INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL IS CITED AS USEFUL IN STUDYING THE POLITICAL ACTIVITY OF VARIOUS SUBSYSTEMS IN THE GREATER SOCIAL SYSTEM. WITHIN THIS MODEL, THE SCHOOL SYSTEM CAN BE VIEWED AS A SYSTEM LOCATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR TWO-DIMENSIONAL ENVIRONMENT--(1) THE INTRASOCIETAL ENVIRONMENT (THE ENVIRONMENT FOR WHICH POLITICAL DECISIONS ARE MADE), AND (2) THE EXTRASOCIETAL ENVIRONMENT (THE GREATER SOCIETY). IN THESE TERMS, THE SCHOOL SYSTEM ENGAGES IN A NUMBER OF EXCHANGES WITH ITS ENVIRONMENT WHICH  INCLUDE INPUTS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUTPUTS FROM THE SYSTEM. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY DEVELOPED A COURSE WHICH PERMITTED FOCUS UPON BEHAVIOR, PROCESSES, STRATEGIES, AND INTERACTION. THIS ALLOWED INVESTIGATION INTO THREE NEW PERSPECTIVES IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM--(1) THE SYSTEMS VIEW OF POLICY DEVELOPMENT, (2) THE NATURE OF POLITICAL BEHAVIOR, AND (3) THE DYNAMICS OF INSTITUTIONAL ROLES IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. COURSE OBJECTIVES RECOGNIZE THAT EDUCATORS HAVE A DUTY TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL ACTIVITY FOR FULFILLING EDUCATIONALLY PRODUCTIVE ENDS AND TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN THE DETERMINATION OF EDUCATIONAL POLICY AND THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES RELATED TO EDUCATION.

IN 1963, STAFF DISTRIBUTION CONSISTED OF 55,160 IN ADMINISTRATION, 284,698 IN ACADEMIC FIELDS, AND 9078 IN TECHNICAL AND SEMIPROFESSIONAL FIELDS. IN 1963, 40.3 PERCENT  OF THE DEGREES EARNED WERE DOCTORATES, 41.4 PERCENT MASTER'S, AND 18.3 PERCENT BACCALAUREATE.

THIS DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION, IS MARKED AT BOTH STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS BY COMPETITION BETWEEN UNIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS FOR DOMINANCE IN THE BARGAINING PROCESS ON BEHALF OF TEACHERS. THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION (NEA) IS APPROACHING THE POLICY ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS (AFT) SUPPORTING STRIKES WHEN ITS AFFILIATES HAVE FAILED TO GAIN A SETTLEMENT AFTER GOOD FAITH BARGAINING. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING SHOULD BE CLARIFIED. SPECIAL ISSUES REQUIRING CONSIDERATION INCLUDE THE ROLE OF MANAGEMENT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANAGEMENT EXPERTS WITHIN EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS, THE DETERMINATION OF THE PURPOSES  FOR WHICH LEADERS OF EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS WIELD THEIR POWER, AND THE FORMULATION OF ETHICAL POLITICAL PRACTICES FOR ATTAINING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GOALS.

PITTSBURGH'S SUCCESS IN IMPROVING ITS FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WAS ACHIEVED BY AN  APPOINTED BOARD OF EDUCATION WHICH ENJOYED BROAD PUBLIC SUPPORT OF CITY BUSINESS, MINORITY, AND INTELLECTUAL COMMUNITIES. BOTH A MORE REALISTIC PERCEPTION OF THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL IN THE COMMUNITY AND A SYSTEMATIC COORDINATION OF ALL POSSIBLE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. SEVEN NEW APPROACHES TO OLD PROBLEMS ARE MADE, INCLUDING (1) CONSORTIUMS WITH OPEN ENROLLMENT FOR JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, (2) INDIVIDUAL SCHEDULING FOR ACHIEVING AS WELL AS NONACHIEVING STUDENTS, AND (3) INVOLVEMENT OF PARENTS AS AIDES AND PARTICIPANTS IN THE SCHOOL'S DECISIONMAKING PROCESS. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE URBAN SCHOOLS CONFERENCE (WASHINGTON, D.C., SEPTEMBER 22, 1967). (JK)",

THE PROGRAM COMPRISED 13 SEQUENCES OF ACTIVITIES INCLUDING REPRODUCING (FROM A MODEL OR A PICTURE) PATTERNS OF BLOCKS WITH VARYING COLOR CONTRAST AND IN A HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL ARRANGEMENT, ASSEMBLING PUZZLES, MATCHING BY  SHAPE, COLOR, AND/OR FOR CONFIGURATION, AND DETECTING EMBEDDED FIGURES. THE WISC AND THE NEBRASKA TEST WERE ADMINISTERED TO BOTH GROUPS BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR TRAINING PERIODS. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT GAINS WERE MADE BETWEEN PRE- AND POSTTESTING. SUBTESTS WITH GREATEST GAINS WERE COLORED OBJECTS FROM THE NEBRASKA TEST AND PICTURE COMPLETION AND CODING FROM THE WISC. ALTHOUGH BOTH GROUPS SHOWED GAINS ON THE VISUAL PERCEPTION TESTS, GROUP TWO OBTAINED LOWER SCORES ON BOTH TESTS. MEANS FOR THE ENTIRE GROUP WERE CLOSE TO THE MEANS ACHIEVED BY OLDER CHILDREN WITH ONE YEAR OF SCHOOL EXPERIENCE WHO WERE ALSO TESTED. EXPERIENCED PERSONS WORKING WITH THE CHILDREN FELT THE CHILDREN USED VISUAL CUES MORE MEANINGFULLY AFTER THE TRAINING PROGRAM. INITIAL RESULTS INDICATE INCREASED ALERTNESS TO  VISUAL CUES IN OBJECTIVE MEASURES WHICH SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN CLASSROOM ACHIEVEMENT. FURTHER TESTING IS PLANNED TO DETERMINE IF GAINS ARE SUSTAINED. INCLUDED ARE A 42-ITEM BIBLIOGRAPHY AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADMINISTERING EACH OF THE 13 TRAINING SEQUENCES. (MY)",

COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS OF THE DEAF BLIND ARE RELATED TO OTHER CONCEPTS OF COMMUNICATION. VERBAL SYMBOLS AND NONVERBAL SOUNDS IN COMMUNICATIVE PERCEPTION AND THE COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE ROLES OF THE LANGUAGE OF SOUND IN RELATION TO ACTIVITIES ARE EXPLORED. IN RELATING THESE CONCEPTS TO PROBLEMS OF DEAFNESS, DISCRIMINATION MUST BE MADE BETWEEN COMMUNICATIVE BEHAVIOR AND COMMUNICATIVE SKILLS. THE DISADVANTAGED ENVIRONMENT OF DEAFNESS OR BLINDNESS INDUCES SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL CONSEQUENCES. THUS, THE GOAL OF DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT MUST BE THE IMPROVEMENT OF TOTAL BEHAVIOR. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COGNITION AND SEEING AND HEARING, THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL ISOLATION ON  LEARNING, AND THE ROLE OF LANGUAGE AND VISUAL STIMULI IN THE LEARNING PROCESS NEED FURTHER INVESTIGATION. WITHDRAWAL AND AVOIDANCE MANIFESTATIONS IN BOTH DEAF BLIND PERSONS AND THEIR SEEING AND HEARING ASSOCIATES SUGGEST THAT HEIGHTENED LIFE INTEREST AND INCREASED INVOLVEMENT OF DEAF BLIND PERSONS IN EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES MIGHT ELICIT POSITIVE RESPONSES FROM ASSOCIATES WHICH WOULD INFLUENCE TENURE OF SERVICE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF VOLUNTEERS AND STAFF. AN ANALYSIS OF THE LANGUAGE STRUCTURE OF THE DEAF BLIND IS NEEDED IN DEVELOPING AN IMPROVED LANGUAGE AS WELL AS A NEW NONLANGUAGE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM TO BETTER PROVIDE DEAF BLIND PERSONS WITH ESSENTIAL INFORMATION. THE USE OF AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE FOR FACILITATING DEAF BLIND INTERACTION SHOULD BE EXPLORED. EXPERIMENTS NEED TO BE DESIGNED TO  RAISE THE EXPECTATIONS OF SOCIETY REGARDING THE DEAF BLIND.

THE INITIAL STUDY EMPLOYED 50 COLLEGE STUDENTS, 34 GRADE SCHOOL STUDENTS, AND 24 MENTALLY RETARDED CHILDREN (AGES 9-16) AS SUBJECTS. THE SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE A BINARY CLASSIFICATION OF 400 PICTURES IN WHICH THREE STIMULUS CUES WERE SHOWN THROUGH 20 VARIATIONS. THE VARIATIONS WERE RELATED TO THE CLASSIFICATIONS IN A PROBABILISTIC MANNER. IN THE SECOND STUDY, 128 HIGH SCHOOL, 89 GRADE SCHOOL, AND 110 MENTALLY RETARDED SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE A SIMILAR CLASSIFICATION OF 400 PICTURES IN WHICH FOUR STIMULUS CUES WERE PRESENT. SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO PLACE A WAGER  ON WHETHER A PICTURE BELONGED TO ONE OR OTHER OF THE TWO CLASSIFICATIONS. SUBJECTS WERE ALLOWED TO VARY THE AMOUNT WAGERED. IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE AMOUNT WAS A QUANTITATIVE INDEX OF THE SUBJECT'S DEGREE OF CERTAINTY OF THE CLASSIFICATION. IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT AS MENTAL AGE INCREASES THERE IS A GREATER TENDENCY FOR HIGH AND LOW PROBABILITY EVENTS TO INFLUENCE THE EVOLUTION OF A PERCEPT. ALSO NOTED WAS A MORE PROMISCUOUS IRRADIATION OF THE EFFECT OF REINFORCEMENT (STIMULUS GENERALIZATION) FOR SUBJECTS OF LOW INTELLIGENCE.

THIS PARTICULAR PRONUNCIATION PROBLEM WAS SELECTED BECAUSE THE GERMAN AND ENGLISH SOUNDS ARE UNIFORMLY OPPOSITE. THE STUDENTS WERE GIVEN A LIST OF 60 GERMAN WORDS TO RECORD ON TAPE, AND IT WAS EXPECTED THAT FOUR POSSIBLE TYPES OF PRONUNCIATION ERRORS WOULD RESULT. HOWEVER, NONE OF THESE ERRORS TOOK PLACE.

THE USE OF ANY PARTICULAR TYPE DEPENDS ON THE PURPOSE TO WHICH THE DRILL IS PUT.

THE WRITER OF ORAL PATTERN PRACTICE DRILLS SHOULD APPROACH HIS TASK IN MUCH THE SAME FASHION AS THE WRITER OF A PROGRAMED TEXTBOOK BUILT ON THE MODEL OF A SKINNERIAN LINEAR PROGRAM WOULD APPROACH HIS. THE STRUCTURAL LINGUISTS HAVE GENERALLY USED CONTRASTIVE ANALYSIS AS A GUIDE FOR ORDERING THE MATERIAL FOR DRILLS. THE  TRANSFORMATIONIST WOULD USE A LOGICAL ORDERING FOLLOWING THE ORDERING OF A THEORETICAL GRAMMAR. MOST AUDIOLINGUAL DRILLS HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE TASK OF LEARNING A LANGUAGE A MECHANICAL TASK, AND THEY ARE DEATHLY BORING. ALTHOUGH THE FIRST OF THESE CRITICISMS MIGHT NOT BE READILY MET WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE AUDIOLINGUAL TEACHING PROCEDURE, THE SECOND OF THESE CAN BE MET BY CUEING DRILLS TO LITERARY MATERIALS.

AMONG CURRENT RESEARCH, TWO BASIC TYPES ARE DISTINGUISHABLE--THOSE CONCERNED WITH BROAD-SCALE COMPARISONS OF TWO METHODS OR SYSTEMS OF TEACHING, AND THOSE WHICH CONCENTRATE ON A SPECIFIC LIMITED PROBLEM. THE SAME DICHOTOMY IS EVIDENT IN THE RESEARCH UNDERTAKEN TO DETERMINE THE SPECIAL ROLE OF THE LANGUAGE LABORATORY IN TEACHING. AN ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE SOVIET UNION, FRANCE, AND GERMANY UNDERLINES THE ADVANTAGES TO BE GAINED FROM AN INTIMATE COLLABORATION AMONG  RESEARCHERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC. MANY EXTREMELY PROMISING RESEARCH PROBLEMS ARE IN NEED OF A CONCERTED AND INTERDISCIPLINARY ATTACK, AIDED BY THE RICH TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES NOW AT OUR DISPOSAL. AMONG SEVERAL PROPOSED TARGETS OF INVESTIGATION ARE (1) A STUDY OF THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS AND ORDER OF EXPOSURE TO THE FOUR ACTIVITIES OF LISTENING, SPEAKING, READING, AND WRITING, (2) RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF VISUAL AIDS FOR SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF LEARNING, AND (3) INVESTIGATION OF NEEDS IN LEXICOGRAPHY IN ORDER TO STIMULATE THE PRODUCTION OF IMPROVED GLOSSARIES AND DICTIONARIES FOR STUDENT USE.

THE COUNCIL'S ACTIVITIES HAVE MOVED TOWARD 1) ACTIVE, RATHER THAN PASSIVE, SURVEILLANCE OF THE DIFFERENTIATED FUNCTIONS OF THE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS, 2) INCREASINGLY ACTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT, AND 3) STATE LEVEL ADMINISTRATION OF SEVERAL FEDERAL PROGRAMS IN AID TO HIGHER EDUCATION.

(3) THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF TREATMENT FOR NATIVE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES IN REQUIREMENTS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR TIMING OF CHANGES IN COURSES, PROGRAMS, AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS, AND FOR PROGRAMS OF ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT. (4) PROBLEMS OF TRANSFER STUDENTS DIFFER FROM THOSE OF FRESHMEN IN SUCH MATTERS AS COUNSELING, FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, AND PARTICIPATION IN COCURRICULAR ACTIVITIES.

        "description":"INDIVIDUALIZED PRESCRIBED INSTRUCTION (IPI), DESIGNED FOR GRADES 1-6, IS A SEQUENTIAL MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM IN WHICH EACH OBJECTIVE IS A DESCRIPTION OF SOMETHING A STUDENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO. EACH OBJECTIVE IS A PREREQUISITE TO THE LEARNING OF A LATER OBJECTIVE. STUDENTS ARE TESTED FOR MASTERY OF OBJECTIVES AND THEN PLACED SO THAT THEY ARE STUDYING SOMETHING NOT YET LEARNED BUT SOMETHING FOR WHICH THEY HAVE ALL THE PREREQUISITES. CONSIDERATIONS WHICH SHAPED THE SEQUENCE OF OBJECTIVES DISCUSSED ARE (1) THE COMMITMENT TO THE NEW MATHEMATICS, (2) THE NEED FOR AND THE STRENGTH OF OBJECTIVES, (3) THE EFFECT OF INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION UPON CURRICULUM PREPARATION, (4) SUBJECT MATTER ACCURACY AND LOGICAL PROGRESSION, (5) THE USE OF MEMORIZATION AND MASTERY IN THE MATH CURRICULUM,  (6) LEARNING THEORY AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERIMENTS, (7) TESTING REQUIREMENTS, (8) INTERACTION BETWEEN LESSON WRITERS AND THE NEW CURRICULUM, (9) THE EFFECT OF A DEVICE (A LANGUAGE MASTER) FOR COMMUNICATING WITH NON READERS. SOME CHILDREN MAY NOT BE ABLE TO LEARN AS WELL BY INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION AS IN A CONVENTIONAL CLASSROOM. ONE-DAY-A-WEEK, CLASS ACTIVITIES IN A MATHEMATICS SEMINAR WAS THE APPROACH USED TO OFFSET THIS POTENTIAL PROBLEM. ACHIEVEMENT RESULTS FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR 1964-1965 SHOW WIDE RANGES OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR INDIVIDUAL PUPILS. THE FIRST GRADE CLASS SEEMS TO HAVE MADE DOUBLE THE NORMALLY EXPECTED GROWTH. A SUGGESTION THAT HAS MANY POTENTIALS IS THE USE OF COMPUTER ASSISTED INSTRUCTION WITH INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION. (HH)",

THE FINDINGS INDICATED THE IMPORTANCE OF CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES TO THE ACQUISITION OF SPOKEN VIETNAMESE, FOR EXAMPLE, ISOLATION FROM OTHER ENGLISH SPEAKERS, GREATER LENGTH OF THE  ADVISOR'S TOUR OF DUTY, MORE FREQUENT ATTEMPTS TO SPEAK VIETNAMESE, WITNESSING OF COMBAT, AND THE VIETNAMESE COUNTERPARTS' ABILITY TO USE ENGLISH.

THE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF A REHABILITATION WORKSHOP, CONCOMITANT VOCATIONAL COUNSELING, AND GROUP VOCATIONAL ORIENTATION SERVICES. IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMING PRESENTED THE YOUNGSTERS WITH INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT VOCATIONAL SITUATIONS. CLOSE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE VOCATIONAL SERVICES AND THE THERAPEUTIC PLAN OF TREATMENT IN THE RESIDENTIAL CENTERS WAS EMPHASIZED. TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT WORK-FOCUSED VOCATIONAL PROGRAMING MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IF BEGUN IN EARLY ADOLESCENCE, AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (YOUNGSTERS 14 OR 15 YEARS OLD) AND A CONTROL GROUP (YOUNGSTERS BETWEEN 16 AND 18 YEARS OLD) WERE CHOSEN.  EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM WILL BE MADE BY COMPARING THE EXPERIMENTAL AND THE COMPARISON GROUPS ON THE MEASURES ADMINISTERED DURING THE PROGRAM AND ON VOCATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF THE TRAINEES IN THE COMMUNITY AFTER COMPLETING THE PROGRAM. ELEMENTS WHICH SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO A VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM ARE IDENTIFIED AND DESCRIBED. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE ASSOCIATION OF REHABILITATION CENTERS CONFERENCE (PHILADELPHIA, NOVEMBER 30, 1966). (PS)",

EXAMPLES OF THE MEANS BY WHICH THE ELEMENTARY  COUNSELOR'S ROLE AND GUIDANCE VIEWPOINT WERE CONVEYED TO LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS AND OTHER SCHOOL PERSONNEL WERE GIVEN. ONE STUDY WHICH WAS UNDERTAKEN DURING THE YEAR WAS ON READING TESTS WITH FIRST GRADERS. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOWED THE METROPOLITAN READING TESTS TO BE AN UNRELIABLE INSTRUMENT FOR USE WITH DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN. PLANS WERE MADE FOR FURTHER STUDY.

DATA AREAS UTILIZED WERE (1) EXTENT OF CURRICULAR OFFERINGS, (2) QUALITY OF INSTRUCTIONAL PERSONNEL, (3) TEACHING LOAD, AND (4) SCHOOL SIZE AND ORGANIZATIONAL PATTERN. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SUGGESTED THAT SCHOOLS WITH AN ENROLLMENT OF UNDER 500 OFFERED FEWER SUBJECT AREAS, FEWER COURSES PER SUBJECT AREA, AND FEWER TOTAL COURSES. TEACHERS IN SCHOOLS WITH AN ENROLLMENT GREATER THAN 500 WERE BETTER TRAINED AND THEIR TEACHING LOAD WAS MORE DESIRABLE. TEACHING EXPERIENCE WAS THE ONLY  CRITERION CONSIDERED WHICH DID NOT JUSTIFY THE SUPERIORITY OF LARGE SCHOOLS, SINCE LENGTH OF EXPERIENCE WAS NOT FOUND TO BE RELATED TO SCHOOL SIZE OR ORGANIZATIONAL PATTERN. FINALLY, SCHOOL SIZE AND ORGANIZATIONAL PATTERN WERE INVERSELY RELATED (AS SCHOOL SIZE INCREASED, THE GRADE SPAN OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL PATTERN DECREASED) AND INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM ADEQUACY WAS A FUNCTION OF BOTH.

SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF THE THEORY INCLUDE THE INITIATOR OR INNOVATOR, THE TARGET OR ADOPTER, THE LINKAGE BETWEEN THE TWO, AND THE PROCESS OF DIFFUSION BY WHICH AN INNOVATION IS INCORPORATED INTO A CONFIGURATION. ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCE UPON INNOVATION DIFFUSION  WILL DEPEND UPON WHETHER THE ENVIRONMENT IS PERSISTENT AND SUPPORTIVE, NEUTRAL, OR INHIBITING. CONFIGURATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE BROAD CATEGORIES--MOLECULAR, MOLAR-MOLECULAR, AND MOLAR--DEPENDING GENERALLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE TWO SOCIAL UNITS SERVING AS INITIATOR AND ADAPTER AND THE PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP'S AMENABILITY TO CONTROL.

THESE SKILLS CAN BE SEPARATED INTO SEVERAL AREAS FOR WHICH GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL OBJECTIVE TESTS CAN BE CONSTRUCTED. EXAMPLES OF GROUP TESTS ARE AURAL WORD-RECOGNITION TESTS AND TESTS OF LISTENING COMPREHENSION. TESTS WHICH MUST BE ADMINISTERED INDIVIDUALLY ARE THOSE DEALING WITH AURAL PERCEPTION OF DIFFICULT SOUNDS, ORAL PRODUCTION OF DIFFICULT SOUNDS, ORAL SELF-EXPRESSION BASED ON PICTORIAL STIMULI, AND ORAL INTERVIEWS WHICH COMBINE SOUND PRODUCTION, AURAL COMPREHENSION, AND ORAL EXPRESSION. THESE OBJECTIVE TESTS CAN BE USED BOTH AS ATTAINMENT TESTS TO ASSESS THE STANDARD ACHIEVEMENT AT CERTAIN MAIN POINTS OF THE COURSE AND AS DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENTS TO POINT UP DEFICIENCIES REQUIRING FURTHER  ATTENTION. OBJECTIVE TESTS MUST BE CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED, BUT CAN BE SCORED QUICKLY AND DO NOT REQUIRE THE TEACHER TO MAKE VALUE JUDGMENTS. IF THE TEACHER CAREFULLY PREPARES THE STUDENT ANSWER SHEETS AND HIS OWN SCORING SHEET FOR THE TESTS, THE ADMINISTRATION AND SCORING CAN BE DONE EFFICIENTLY.

THE DIFFICULTY IS ATTRIBUTABLE LARGELY TO THE FACT THAT RUSSIAN IS NEITHER A GERMANIC NOR A ROMANCE LANGUAGE, AND STUDENTS THUS FIND IT HARD TO RECOGNIZE COGNATES AND TO ACQUIRE AN ACTIVE VOCABULARY. NEW TEXTBOOKS AND METHODS, BOTH AUDIOLINGUAL AND GRAMMAR-TRANSLATION ARE NEEDED THAT WILL FACE THE VOCABULARY PROBLEM. INSTEAD OF REQUIRING AN ACTIVE COMMAND OF GRAMMAR AND VOCABULARY FROM THE OUTSET, TEACHERS SHOULD AIM AT DEVELOPING IN THEIR STUDENTS AN ACCURATE PRONUNCIATION, A THOROUGH BUT PASSIVE COMMAND OF GRAMMAR, AND A LARGE READING VOCABULARY. THESE SKILLS, ADMITTEDLY, ARE GAINED AT  THE EXPENSE OF A LIMITED AND DOUBTFUL ORAL FLUENCY. IN THE FIRST TERM OF COLLEGE WORK THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF GRAMMAR AND A 300-WORD VOCABULARY SHOULD BE COVERED. THE OTHER TERMS SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO DEVELOPING A LARGE PASSIVE VOCABULARY BY MEANS OF READERS WITH VISIBLE VOCABULARIES AND STIMULATING MATERIAL ON RUSSIAN CULTURE. AFTER 2 YEARS OF NONINTENSIVE COURSES THE STUDENT WILL HAVE A CORRECT PRONUNCIATION, A RELIABLE COMMAND OF GRAMMAR, UNUSUAL FLUENCY IN READING, INSIGHT INTO RUSSIAN CULTURE, AND THE DESIRE AS WELL AS THE SOLID BASIS FOR GOING ON TO ADVANCED COURSES.

FIRST A STUDENT MUST ACQUIRE A REALISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE TASK INVOLVED IN LEARNING RUSSIAN AND MUST ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPLYING HIMSELF TOWARD KNOWN OBJECTIVES RATHER THAN MERELY PUTTING IN TIME. IF A STUDENT IS TO HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF HIS GOALS HE COULD BE TOLD THAT ABOUT 1,000 CONTACT HOURS OF LISTENING AND SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN ARE NECESSARY FOR ACHIEVING A MEASURE OF COMMUNICATIVE SKILL. SECONDLY, A STUDENT MUST BE ABLE TO FEEL HIS PROGRESS AND ENJOY THE PROCESS, IF HE IS TO PUT IN THE NECESSARY, PROTRACTED EFFORT FOR MASTERY. HE MUST BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THE NUMBER OF SITUATIONS WITH WHICH HE IS ABLE TO COPE GRADUALLY INCREASES, AS DOES THE TIME HE IS ABLE TO SUSTAIN COMMUNICATION, AND THAT HE IS MAKING  PROGRESS IN ACQUIRING THE 300-WORD VOCABULARY THAT IS BECOMING ACCEPTED AS AN ADEQUATE BASE.

THE SPANISH-PRINTED WORDS WERE THE COMMON EQUIVALENT TRANSLATION OF THE ENGLISH WORDS. THE PICTURES WERE SIMPLE LINE DRAWINGS OF THE OBJECTS NAMED BY THE 35 PRINTED WORD STIMULI. EACH SUBJECT WAS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED THE ORDER OF PRESENTATION OF EACH OF THE FOUR CONDITIONS. THE RESULTS, CATEGORIZED INTO SENSE-IMPRESSION AND NON-SENSE-IMPRESSION RESPONSES, INDICATED THAT IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH THE PROPORTION OF SENSE-IMPRESSION RESPONSES DID NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY  ACROSS THE TWO STIMULUS MODES (WORDS AND PICTURES), NOR DID THE PROPORTION OF SENSE-IMPRESSION RESPONSES VARY SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS THE TWO LANGUAGES, WHETHER STIMULI WERE PRESENTED IN THE WORD OR PICTURE MODE.

THE AUTHOR PROPOSES THAT THE A, B, AND C GRADES BE MAINTAINED AS PARALLEL TO STATE COLLEGE STANDARDS. A GRADE OF D WOULD BE PASSING BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR TRANSFER TO A 4-YEAR COLLEGE, AND F WOULD CONTINUE TO MEAN FAILURE. A GRADE OF B SHOULD CONTINUE TO COMPENSATE FOR D IN COMPUTING GRADE POINT AVERAGE FOR TRANSFER ELIGIBILITY. A NEW GRADE  COULD INDICATE THAT THE STUDENT PROFITED, BUT NOT AT A LEVEL RECOMMENDING ADVANCEMENT TO THE NEXT COURSE OR INSTITUTION.

        "description":"THE FUNCTION OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION (TO INSURE AN APPROPRIATE EDUCATION FOR THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH OF THE STATE) IS EXAMINED IN SEVERAL AREAS. THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT TEACHER PREPARATION CAN BE IMPROVED NOT THROUGH MODIFYING CERTIFICATION REGULATIONS, BUT BY ACTUAL VISITS TO EACH CAMPUS, ANALYSIS OF THE TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THEIR IMPROVEMENT, CONSIDERING ADEQUACY OF PREPARATION, PROPRIETY OF ORGANIZATION TO OBJECTIVES, APPROPRIATENESS AND SUFFICIENCY OF RESOURCES (HUMAN AND OTHERWISE) AND FLEXIBILITY. THE AUTHORS FURTHER SUGGESTED THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD COORDINATE THE JOINT RESPONSIBILITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR BOTH PRESERVICE AND INSERVICE TEACHER EDUCATION SO THAT THE &quot;GAP&quot; BETWEEN THEORY AND PRACTICE CAN  BE REDUCED. IMPLEMENTATION WOULD REQUIRE A NEW KIND OF PROFESSIONAL, RESPONSIBLE FOR INDUCTING NOVICE TEACHERS INTO THE PROFESSION. HE MIGHT SERVE ON A JOINT APPOINTMENT WITH BOTH THE COLLEGE AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL OR EVEN AS A FULL-TIME MEMBER OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. ANOTHER METHOD FOR CLOSER TIES WOULD BE A JOINT AREA PROGRAM AND SERVICE CENTER TO ATTAIN SUCH MUTUAL OBJECTIVES AS IMPROVED CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION IN THE SCHOOLS AND, FOR HIGHER EDUCATION PERSONNEL, DATA TO TEST THEORIES AND HYPOTHESES. EXPERT SUPERVISORS COULD BE TRAINED IN THESE CENTERS. ALSO EMPHASIZED FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT ARE THE FUNDING, RESEARCH, AND RECRUITMENT FUNCTIONS.

IN THE FIRST, BOTH SUBSPECIES OF RATS WERE EXPOSED TO EITHER ENRICHED OR RESTRICTED ENVIRONMENTS TO ASSESS THEIR PROBLEM-SOLVING ABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS LEARNING CONDITIONS. THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT EARLY ENRICHED EXPERIENCES WILL HELP DEVELOP THE USEFUL CHARACTERISTICS THAT THE ORGANISM ORDINARILY EMPLOYS. WHEN THIS DEVELOPMENT IS INHIBITED, HIERARCHICALLY LOWER CHARACTERISTICS WILL EMERGE MORE PROMINENTLY. THE RESULTS REINFORCED THE IDEA OF GENETIC LIMITATION BUT SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE ORGANISM WHICH DEPENDS ON ITS EARLY LIFE EXPERIENCES. IN ONE OF THE REINFORCEMENT STUDIES ON YOUNG  CHILDREN, IN WHICH A &quot;SUPER- PLAYPEN&quot; ROOM WITH NINE SETS OF MANIPULANDA WAS USED, THE PERFORMANCE OF MIDDLE-CLASS 4-YEAR-OLDS WAS COMPARED TO THAT OF LOWER-CLASS NEGROES. BOTH GROUPS LEARNED THE DISCRIMINATIONS BUT THE MIDDLE-CLASS STUDENTS LEARNED FASTER AND MORE STABLY ALTHOUGH BY THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT THE LOWER CLASS GROUP HAD CAUGHT UP IN RATE AND LEVEL OF CORRECTNESS.

THE CULTURE OF THE PUERTO RICAN CAN BE DESCRIBED IN RELATION TO THREE CONCEPTS--DIGNIDAD (SELF-ESTEEM OR SELF-WORTH), RESPETO (UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE IN THE FAMILY AND SOCIETY), AND CARINO (AFFECTION). THESE CONCEPTS SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS INTERRELATED AND BASIC TO PUERTO RICAN TRADITION. THE EXTENDED FAMILY, WITH ITS CONCOMITANT SECURITY FOR THE CHILD, AND THE PATRIARCHAL PATTERN OF THE CULTURE ARE DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE TRADITION. WHEN THE PUERTO RICAN MIGRATES TO THE MAINLAND, THESE VALUES BECOME STRAINED AND BREAK DOWN BECAUSE OF THE MAINLAND STRESS ON  CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS AND EFFICIENT BEHAVIOR.

THE AUTHOR RECOMMENDS THAT MUCH OF THE WORK OF THE DIRECTOR BE DELEGATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL AND THAT MORE CAREFULLY SELECTED SPECIAL TEACHERS BE GIVEN INTENSIVE TRAINING IN REMEDIAL TECHNIQUES. HOWEVER, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PROJECT WAS RECEIVED  FAVORABLY BY THE STAFF, AND IT IS FELT THAT IT SHOULD BE CONTINUED. INCLUDED IN THE REPORT ARE DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDING MATERIALS, AND TEST DATA, AND DISCUSSIONS OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE PROGRAM WAS ACCEPTED BY THE PARENTS, TEACHERS, PRINCIPALS, AND CHILDREN.

QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO 130 SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS, 52 PRINCIPALS, AND 69 TEACHERS REPRESENTING 71 SCHOOLS.

PROGRAMS WERE OFFERED IN FOOD SERVICES, CLOTHING SERVICES, CHILD CARE SERVICES, FAMILY SERVICES, AND ASSISTANT HOMEMAKING SERVICES. THEY WERE SPONSORED BY THE FIVE STATE COLLEGES WITH TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS  IN HOME ECONOMICS. THE 101 TRAINEES WERE FROM 18 TO 61 YEARS OF AGE, AND INCLUDED PERSONS ALREADY EMPLOYED BUT WANTING TO UPGRADE THEIR SKILLS. CURRICULUM MATERIALS WERE DEVELOPED IN FOUR AREAS. THE PROJECTS INDICATED THAT THE PROGRAM MUST BE FLEXIBLE AND THAT QUALIFIED INSTRUCTORS MUST BE AVAILABLE. THE INVESTIGATOR RECOMMENDED THAT THE CLASSES BE CONTINUED WHERE NEEDED, JOB ANALYSIS SHOULD PRECEDE THE CLASSES, AND WORK EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE REQUIRED. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE AND GUIDELINES WERE ESTABLISHED. FORMS USED IN THE PROGRAM ARE INCLUDED. (MS)",

THE STATISTICAL STUDY INCLUDED RELIABILITY FINDINGS, COMPARISONS OF BOYS AND GIRLS, COMPARISONS OF TWO ABILITY TRACKS, AND COMPARISONS OF GRADES 7, 9, AND 11. FINDINGS SHOWED DIFFERENTIATION CORRELATING HIGHLY WITH ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITY AND INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE, AND MODERATELY WITH GRADES AND INTELLECTUAL ABILITY.

METHODS OF DESCRIBING NONSTANDARD ENGLISH IN TERMS OF ERRORS, CONTRAST, AND TRANSFORMATIONAL GRAMMAR WERE PRESENTED. THE AUTHOR STATED THAT BOTH SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITERIA ON THE DEFICIENCY OF NONSTANDARD ENGLISH EXISTS, BUT THAT THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE ON SOCIAL GROUNDS. HE OUTLINED SUCH MEDIATIONAL VARIABLES AS SOCIAL CLASS WHICH AFFECT LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. HE STATED THAT PHONOLOGY AND SENTENCE  STRUCTURE MAY OBSCURE SUCH MEDIATORS AS THE NONVERBAL CONTEXT (WHICH INCLUDES AFFECTIVE QUALITY AND WHETHER THE CHILD TALKS TO ADULTS OR CHILDREN), AND THAT LANGUAGE STIMULATION MAY VARY IN QUALITY AND QUANTITY.

THE SCHEME, PARTLY DERIVED FROM THE WORK OF VLADIMIR PROPP, IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE TESTABLE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE BOOKS AND STORIES CHILDREN PREFER. THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE COMMON DENOMINATORS WITHIN STORIES, SEQUENCES OF ACTION OR REACTION, THAT, NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE SUPERSTRUCTURE MAY VARY, ALWAYS REMAIN THE SAME. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THESE &quot;FUNCTIONS&quot; FOLLOW AN IDENTICAL SET SEQUENCE, THOUGHT IN ANY GIVEN TALE SOME FUNCTIONS MAY BE EXCLUDED. BY ASSIGNING SYMBOLS TO THESE FUNCTIONS ONE CAN OBTAIN AN OBJECTIVE COUNTERPART OF ONE DIMENSION OF A STORY. IT IS THEN POSSIBLE TO VARY ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS WHILE HOLDING THE OTHERS CONSTANT. SUCH STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS MIGHT ALSO SHOW  SIMILARITIES AMONG TALES NOT USUALLY CATEGORIZED TOGETHER. FOR EXAMPLE, &quot;PETER RABBIT&quot; (1) RECEIVES INSTRUCTIONS NOT TO DO SOMETHING, (2) VIOLATES THE INSTRUCTIONS, AND (3) IS RESCUED FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE VIOLATION. OTHER STORIES FOLLOWING THIS STRUCTURAL SEQUENCE ARE &quot;BABES IN THE WOODS,&quot;&quot;LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD,&quot; AND &quot;HANSEL AND GRETEL.&quot; IT MAY WELL BE THAT CERTAIN STRUCTURAL SEQUENCES APPEAL TO CHILDREN AT CERTAIN AGES, RATHER THAN THE BROAD GENERALIZATIONS OF ANIMAL OR ADVENTURE.

        "description":"THE AUTHOR TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THERE IS A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEGREE OF SEGREGATION AND THE ASPIRATION LEVEL OF NEGRO STUDENTS. THE STUDY WAS LIMITED TO NEGRO AND WHITE HIGH SCHOOL JUNIORS IN A NEW ENGLAND TOWN. ALTHOUGH HER FINDINGS SHOWED THAT NEGRO HIGH SCHOOL JUNIORS DO HAVE LOWER EDUCATIONAL ASPIRATIONS THAN WHITES, THEY FAILED TO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THIS FACT IS RELATED TO THE AVERAGE SCHOOL PERCENT NEGRO (ASPN) IN THE FIRST 9 SCHOOL YEARS. BEFORE CONCLUDING THAT THERE IS NO RELATION BETWEEN EARLY SEGREGATION EXPERIENCE AND ASPIRATION IN HIGH SCHOOL, THE AUTHOR CONSIDERED (1) GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENCES OF PRE-HIGH-SCHOOL SCHOOLS ATTENDED, (2) UNCONTROLLED DIFFERENCES OF PRE-HIGH-SCHOOL SCHOOLS ATTENDED, AND (3) SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENCES. THE  AUTHOR FOUND THAT &quot;SOUTHERN&quot; NEGROES DID HAVE CONSISTENTLY LOWER ASPIRATIONS THAN &quot;NORTHERN&quot; NEGROES, BUT WHEN THE SAMPLE WAS RESTRICTED TO NORTHERN EDUCATED NEGROES, THE HYPOTHESIS WAS STILL NOT SUPPORTED. THE AUTHOR FOUND, CONTRARY TO THE HYPOTHESIS, A TENDENCY TOWARD HIGHER ASPIRATIONS IN HIGH ASPN SCHOOLS THAN IN LOW ASPN SCHOOLS, BUT FOUND NO UNCONTROLLED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. NOR DID PARENTAL SOCIAL CLASS ACCOUNT FOR ASPIRATION DIFFERENCES, SINCE LOWER-CLASS WHITE STUDENTS HAD LOWER ASPIRATIONS REGARDLESS OF ASPN SCORE, WHILE NEGRO ASPIRATION SCORES VARIED POSITIVELY WITH THE ASPN SCORES REGARDLESS OF SOCIAL CLASS. THE AUTHOR SUGGESTED THAT IF THE SCHOOL'S ATMOSPHERE IS NEGATIVE, A NEGRO CHILD'S SELF-ESTEEM IS MORE THREATENED BY A DESEGREGATED SCHOOL  THAN BY A SEGREGATED SCHOOL.

THE AUTHOR EXAMINED THE ROUTES PATIENTS FOLLOW THROUGH THE HOSPITAL IN RELATION TO THERAPY AND THE PATIENT'S RETURN TO OUTSIDE LIFE. HE OBSERVED THAT THE PATIENT'S SOCIAL POSITIONS ARE DEFINED IN LARGE PART BY STATE LAW, AND THAT NEWLY ADMITTED PATIENTS MAY OCCUPY A COURT POSITION, A JUDICIALLY COMMITTED POSITION, A TEMPORARY OBSERVATION STATUS, OR A VOLUNTARY ONE. THE AUTHOR PROPOSED THAT AN ORGANIZATION'S STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE RELATED TO THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES CARRIED ON BY ITS MEMBERS. THE DYADIC PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP WAS EXAMINED IN TERMS OF THE OBJECT, OR ENTITY ACTED UPON, THE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIP INVOLVED, AND THE  NORMS EXPECTED IN PERFORMANCE. THE TREATMENT PROCESS WAS SEEN AS A SERIES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGES WHICH ARE INITIATED BY THE DOCTOR AND HIS PATIENT, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO EACH OTHER, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS DYAD AND THE ORGANIZATIONAL SETTING. THE PATIENT'S SOCIAL RELATIONSHIP, DETERMINED IN PART BY THE NATURE OF THE POSITION HE OCCUPIES, WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING SOMEWHAT CONDUCIVE TO ESTABLISHING TRUST, AND TO HELPING THE PATIENT ESCAPE HIS POTENTIALLY STRESSFUL DAILY LIFE AND RETURN TO THE OUTSIDE LATER THROUGH THE RESOURCES OF THE THERAPIST. A NEED WAS SEEN FOR CONCEPTUALIZING BOTH THE ELEMENTS OF ACTIVITIES AND THE PROPERTIES OF SOCIAL POSITIONS IN THEIR OWN RIGHTS RATHER THAN AS MERELY SLOTS IN A SOCIAL SYSTEM. THE AUTHOR SUGGESTED THAT FURTHER  PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ORGANIZATIONAL PROPERTIES OF TREATMENT SETTINGS AS WELL AS TRADITIONAL PSYCHODYNAMIC FORMULATIONS.

THE TWO ORGANIZATION TYPES STUDIED DIFFERED IN DEGREE OF SPECIALIZATION, EMPHASIS ON RULES AND REGULATIONS, AMOUNT OF WORK PRESSURE, NUMBER OF FORMAL ADMINISTRATIVE LEVELS, CLARITY OF GOALS, DIFFERENTIALS IN INFLUENCE-AUTHORITY-POWER, AND AMOUNT OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM. INITIALLY, THE TWO LABORATORY WORK ORGANIZATIONS HAD IDENTICAL STRUCTURES, BUT AFTER A SPECIFIED TIME, ONE OF THE STRUCTURES WAS EXPERIMENTALLY CHANGED TO A CONTRASTING TYPE. EACH LABORATORY UNIT EMPLOYED 10 PERSONS, ONE OF WHOM WAS DESIGNATED AS THE UNIT SUPERVISOR. TWO WORK TEAMS WERE  DEVELOPED WITHIN EACH OF THE TWO UNITS. THE LABORATORY EXPERIMENT LASTED FOR 20 WORKING DAYS. FOUR SOURCES OF DATA WERE USED--(1) QUESTIONNAIRES, (2) RECORDINGS MADE BY &quot;NAIVE&quot; OBSERVERS THROUGH A ONE-WAY MIRROR, (3) DAILY INTERVIEWS WITH PARTICIPANT OBSERVERS, AND (4) THE PROJECT DIRECTOR'S DAILY LOG OF HIS OBSERVATIONS. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT ROLE UNCERTAINTY AND ROLE DISPARITY WOULD BE MORE FREQUENT IN A RELATIVELY UNSTRUCTURED ORGANIZATION, WHILE ROLE INCOMPATIBILITY WOULD BE MORE FREQUENT IN A MORE HIGHLY STRUCTURED ORGANIZATION. SOME SUPPORT WAS FOUND FOR THESE HYPOTHESES. FURTHERMORE, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT EMPHASIS ON WORK RULES WAS MORE DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FREQUENCY OF ROLE INCOMPATIBILITY THAN ANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONAL FEATURE, AND THAT STRATIFICATION EMPHASIS AND TYPE  OF SUPERVISION WERE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE APPEARANCE OF EACH ROLE STRAIN.

THE METROPOLITAN COMMUNITIES WERE RANKED IN TERMS OF THEIR PRODUCTION OF HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS AND ILLITERATES. THE RANKING INVOLVED CONSIDERATIONS OF THE ECONOMIC, DEMOGRAPHIC, AND OTHER SOCIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CITIES. THE INVESTIGATORS SOUGHT TO ANSWER THREE RELATED QUESTIONS--(1) CAN INDICATORS OF THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF BIG CITIES WITH RESPECT TO DROPOUT AND LITERACY PATTERNS BE DEVISED, (2)  WHEN DIFFERENCES DUE TO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND CONDITIONS ARE HELD CONSTANT STATISTICALLY, WHAT ARE THE CORRELATES OF HIGH SCHOOL WITHDRAWAL AND ADULT FUNCTIONAL ILLITERACY, AND (3) HOW ARE EFFORTS TO DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL OR SOCIAL PROGRAMS RELATED TO COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS. THE INVESTIGATORS CONCLUDED THAT NATIONAL AND STATE ECONOMIC POLICIES, INCLUDING PROGRAMS OF SOCIAL INSURANCE, MAY BE OF SUBSTANTIAL IMPORTANCE IN FOSTERING INCREASED EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, WHILE SCHOOL AND WELFARE PROGRAMS THAT ATTEMPT TO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH DROPOUT PREVENTION OR LITERACY ARE IRRELEVANT, IF NOT FUTILE.

HE SEES URBANIZATION AS BEING DIFFERENT FROM, THOUGH RELATED TO, INDUSTRIALIZATION, AND HE SEES DISTINCT DIFFERENCES IN THE SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL RESPONSES NEEDED TO DEAL WITH THEM. WHILE INDUSTRIALIZATION, THE MAIN FOCUS OF OUR SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, REQUIRES TECHNOLOGICAL SKILLS FOR WORK, URBANIZATION REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SENSE OF COMMUNITY. THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT THE UNIVERSITY MUST SEEK TO EDUCATE LEADERS FROM AND FOR ALL LEVELS OF COMMUNITY, PARTLY BECAUSE ALL LEVELS OF COMMUNITY NEED LEADERS AND PARTLY BECAUSE TRUTH COMES ONLY FROM THE FUSION OF A NUMBER OF VIEWPOINTS, AND THAT UNIVERSITY EDUCATION MUST BECOME INVOLVED WITH  CURRENT CONTROVERSIAL COMMUNITY ISSUES. THE AUTHOR STATES THAT THE UNIVERSITY MUST TEACH ACTIVISTS THE BENEFITS OF REASONED THOUGHT, AND THINKERS THE METHODS AND TECHNIQUES OF EFFECTIVE ACTION.

THE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT IN THE 1964-65 SCHOOL YEAR WAS TO USE THE SCHOOL COUNSELING STAFF AND COMMUNITY CONSULTANTS IN A STUDY OF AREAS OF PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. IT WAS HOPED THAT STUDENTS IN SUCH A GROUP WOULD GAIN KNOWLEDGE IN BOY-GIRL RELATIONSHIPS AND SELF-UNDERSTANDING TO BETTER PREPARE THEM FOR ADULT LIFE. AFTER A SCHOOL-WIDE QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH SHOWED THAT 92 PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS FAVORED SUCH A PROGRAM, 29 BOYS AND GIRLS WERE SELECTED ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS. THE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSION SESSIONS ON (1) EMOTIONS, (2) THE FUNCTIONS AND NEEDS OF THE BODY, (3) DATING, (4) MARRIAGE, AND (5) MORAL AND SPIRITUAL  CODES IN BOY-GIRL RELATIONSHIPS. STUDY SHEETS OF QUESTIONS WERE GIVEN TO THE STUDENTS BEFORE EACH SESSION TO PROVIDE STIMULUS FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION. EXAMPLES OF THESE STUDY SHEETS AND THE STUDENTS' QUESTIONS ARE PRESENTED. AT A FINAL EVALUATION SESSION, 27 OF THE 29 STUDENTS INDICATED ON AN ANONYMOUS QUESTIONNAIRE THAT THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE OFFERED TO ALL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. (NS)",

THE CONCEPT OF SELF CONSISTS OF SELF-CONCEPTION, IMPRESSIONS WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES TO HIMSELF, AND SELF-CONSISTENCY, THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE PERSON'S IDEAL PICTURE OF HIMSELF AND THE PERCEPTION OF HIS REAL SELF. IN THE PROCESS OF THE ATTAINMENT OF IDENTITY BY MEANS OF CHOICE, A PERSON BECOMES MORE AWARE THAT HIS LINKAGE OF PREFERENCE AND GROUP MEMBERSHIP IS ACTUALLY EMBEDDED WITHIN THE FORMATION OF HIS SELF-CONCEPT. THROUGH MODIFICATION OF THE SELF-CONCEPT, A PERSON IS MADE PROGRESSIVELY AWARE OF HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHOICE. A SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE FOR THE COLLEGE AND THE STUDENT EXISTS WHEN DISCONTINUITIES INHERENT IN THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE BECOME INTEGRATED INTO  THE STUDENT'S PERSONALITY WITHOUT LOSS OF SELF-ESTEEM. THE CRITERION OF SELF-ESTEEM IN COLLEGIATE EDUCATION SHOULD BE MEASURED IN RELATION TO THE SELF-ESTEEM WHICH THE STUDENT CONTINUES TO MANIFEST DURING HIS EDUCATION. SUGGESTIONS FOR USING THE PREDICTIVE QUALITIES OF SELF-ESTEEM IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS ARE GIVEN. ELEMENTS OF THE TRANSPOSITION OF SELF-ESTEEM FROM THE PRECOLLEGE DISCONTINUITY TO THE COLLEGIATE CONTINUITY ARE KNOWLEDGE, PREPARATION, LEARNING CAPACITY, MOTIVATION, AND INITIATIVE.

A SCHEMA DEVELOPING THESE PHASES OF THE CHANGE CONTINUUM DEFINES SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES, CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION, AND RELATION TO CHANGE. RESEARCH ACTIVITY IS LIMITED TO INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENTATION. DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY INCLUDES THE INVENTION BASED ON RESEARCH AND THE DESIGN FOR INNOVATION OF THE INVENTION. TEACHER PARTICIPATION IN THIS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IS ENCOURAGED. DIFFUSION ACTIVITY INVOLVES THE CREATION OF AWARENESS OF THE INVENTION AMONG POTENTIAL USERS. ADOPTION ACTIVITY INCLUDES TRIAL OR TEST OF FEASIBILITY, INSTALLATION OF THE INNOVATION, AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION (PROCESS BY WHICH THE INNOVATION  BECOMES AN INTEGRATED AND ACCEPTED COMPONENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM). AN ILLUSTRATIVE CRITIQUE OF THE ILLINOIS PLAN FOR PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT FOR GIFTED CHILDREN IS INCLUDED WHICH ASSESSES THE PLAN IN RELATION TO THE FOUR MAJOR TAXONOMIC PHASES.

        "description":"THIS STUDY OF STRATEGIES FOR EDUCATIONAL CHANGE CONCLUDES THAT THE AEXPERIMENTAL, OBSERVATIONAL, OR FIELD STUDY APPROACH IS PREFERRED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL OR LABORATORY APPROACH, BOTH FOR CHANGE RESEARCH, WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF CHANGE, AND FOR EVALUATION, WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH THE ASSESSMENT OF SINGLE PHASES OF CHANGE. EXPERIMENTAL STRATEGY INQUIRES INTO POSSIBILITIES, WHEREAS AEXPERIMENTAL STRATEGY INQUIRES INTO ACTUALITIES. OTHER DISTINCTIONS INCLUDE SETTING, LEVEL OF CONTROL, SCOPE, NUMBER OF VARIABLES, TREATMENT, AND CONTEXT. EDUCATIONAL CHANGE IS A PROCESS INVOLVING FOUR STAGES, EACH WITH A PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE--(1) RESEARCH IS RESTRICTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF BASIC KNOWLEDGE, (2) DEVELOPMENT FORMULATES AN INVENTION OR SOLUTION TO AN ACTION PROBLEM  AND PREPARES THE DESIGN FOR ITS INSTITUTIONAL USE, (3) DIFFUSION DISSEMINATES INFORMATION ABOUT THE INVENTION AND DEMONSTRATES ITS UTILITY, AND (4) ADOPTION ESTABLISHES AN INVENTION AS PART OF AN ONGOING PROGRAM. A NUMBER OF FIELD STUDY TECHNIQUES ARE DESCRIBED--(1) A SYSTEMATIZED DEVELOPMENT OF OBJECTIVES, DEFINED AS A PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH, WITH AN ORDERED ACTION TAXONOMY TO DEPICT, RELATE, CONCEPTUALIZE, AND TEST, (2) THE CONDUCT OF INQUIRY WITHIN AN EXPLICIT THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, (3) A PHENOMENOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR WITH THE ACTUAL FIELD OF HIS STUDY RATHER THAN WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION, (4) REPLICATION AND RECYCLING OF INQUIRY, DEFINED AS THE TACTIC OF ACCUMULATIVE EVIDENCE, AND (5) THE ANALYSIS OF PATHOLOGIES TO GAIN INSIGHTS INTO NATURAL SITUATIONS.

        "description":"THE RAPID EXPANSION OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY THE FEELING THAT A CONNECTIVE LINK MUST BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE AREAS OF RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE. THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF RESEARCH FUNDS NECESSITATES REFORMULATION AND CONCEPTUALIZATION OF SUITABLE MECHANISMS AND AGENCIES CAPABLE OF BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER AND PRACTITIONER. TO FILL THIS NEED, A TAXONOMY IS FORMULATED FOR A CHANGE CONTINUUM FROM RESEARCH TO ACTION. RESEARCH, THE FIRST ACTIVITY, ADVANCES KNOWLEDGE BY A CRITERION OF VALIDITY. THE SECOND ACTIVITY, DEVELOPMENT, FORMULATES A SOLUTION TO AN ACTION PROBLEM AND RENDERS THE FORMULATED SOLUTION INTO AN ACCEPTABLE, ADAPTABLE FORM. DIFFUSION INFORMS THE PRACTITIONER OF THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE  SUBACTIVITIES OF DISSEMINATION AND DEMONSTRATION. ADOPTION, THE FINAL STAGE, INCORPORATES AN INNOVATION INTO A FUNCTIONING SCHOOL SYSTEM. ADOPTION IS REALIZED THROUGH THE PROCESSES OF INSTALLATION (ADAPTING THE INNOVATION TO AN ADOPTING SCHOOL) AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION (REGULARIZING THE INNOVATION). IN ADDITION TO THE CONNECTIVE TAXONOMY, THE FACULTY OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF EDUCATION HAS ESTABLISHED SPECIFIC AGENCIES (DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, EVALUATION CENTER, PROJECT DISCOVERY) TO COPE WITH PROBLEMS OF THE RESEARCH-ACTION CONTINUUM. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE SUMMER LECTURE SERIES (KENT STATE UNIVERSITY, JULY 19, 1965). (GB)",

        "description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

TRADITIONAL LEGAL AUTHORITY OF LOCAL BOARDS OF EDUCATION TO MAKE UNILATERAL POLICY DECISIONS IS GIVING WAY TO A DIVERSE SET OF NEGOTIATION PROCEDURES BASED MORE UPON DISCRETIONARY ACTION OF LOCAL BONDS THAN UPON LEGISLATION. BOARDS OF EDUCATION WILL ENGAGE MORE FREQUENTLY IN COLLECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS, BOTH BY VOLUNTARY ACTION AND BY PRESSURES EXERTED AGAINST THEM. ALTHOUGH TEACHERS MAY NOT LEGALLY STRIKE IN ANY STATE, TEACHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONTINUING TO BROADEN THE AREA OPEN TO NEGOTIATION. UNRESOLVED ISSUES INCLUDE  WHETHER STATE LEGISLATION SHOULD BE ENACTED TO ASSURE COLLECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS BY TEACHERS AND WHETHER SUCH LEGISLATION SHOULD APPLY TO ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OR WHETHER PUBLIC SCHOOL PERSONNEL SHOULD BE TREATED AS A SPECIAL CATEGORY. LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS CONCERNING COLLECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS BY PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS WILL BE ESPECIALLY INFLUENCED BY INDIVIDUAL AND CONCERTED ACTION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND BOARDS OF EDUCATION.

THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR MAY SERVE AS NEGOTIATOR FOR THE BOARD, SPOKESMAN FOR THE TEACHERS, MEDIATOR FOR BOTH, OR MAY BE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT. A STUDY OF 98 SUPERINTENDENTS IN 469 SCHOOLS IN SEVEN MIDWESTERN STATES REVEALED THAT 87 PERCENT REGARDED THEIR ROLE AS CHANGED BY NEGOTIATIONS. THERE WAS LITTLE AGREEMENT ON THIS NEW ROLE FUNCTION IN RELATION TO TEACHERS AND BOARDS. INCREASED PROFESSIONALISM OF TEACHERS HAS BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN CHANGING THE ADMINISTRATOR ROLE. TEACHERS SEEK MORE CONTROL OVER DECISIONS WHICH AFFECT THEM. BECAUSE SCHOOLS OPERATE BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY IN A POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, WITH A WIDE RANGE OF LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL  INVOLVEMENTS, THE PROSPECTIVE ADMINISTRATOR NEEDS A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICAL POWER DYNAMICS, COMMUNITY POWER STRUCTURES, AND POLITICAL ASPECTS OF MASS MEDIA, ECONOMIC GOODS, AND SERVICES. AN INTERDISCIPLINARY SEMINAR APPROACH IN NEGOTIATING TECHNIQUES IS RECOMMENDED AS PART OF GRADUATE SCHOOL PREPARATION FOR ADMINISTRATORS, ACCOMPANIED BY A CONTINUOUS INSERVICE TRAINING PROGRAM OF CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS FOR THOSE ALREADY ENGAGED IN ADMINISTRATION.

PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS WERE UNIVERSITIES, MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, COMMERCIAL SCHOOLS, A U.S. GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN CENTER, AND A PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. COURSE DENSITY FOR THESE PROGRAMS WAS DETERMINED BY DIVIDING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WORDS TO BE TAUGHT IN A COURSE BY THE NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL HOURS REQUIRED. THESE WERE CONSIDERED ONLY AS GROSS MEASURES, SINCE THEY DID NOT REFLECT THE DEGREE OF GRAMMATICAL AND PHONOLOGICAL CONTROL TO BE ATTAINED BY THE  STUDENTS. STUDENTS WERE ASKED AT TWO TIMES DURING THE COURSE TO RATE THE PACE OF INSTRUCTION.

CONSCIOUSNESS OF GRAMMATICAL PHENOMENA IS INDISPENSABLE FOR RAPID MASTERY OF SPOKEN RUSSIAN. THE TEACHING OF GRAMMAR BY PATTERNS, ADVANTAGEOUS AS THE METHOD MAY BE IN TEACHING SPEAKING IN ANALYTICAL LANGUAGES, IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR RUSSIAN, WHERE ANY LINGUISTIC PATTERN MUST BE SUPPLEMENTED BY RULES OF FORM PRODUCTION. TRAINING IN SPEECH DEVELOPMENT IS PRIMARILY THE FORMING OF HABITS OF DIFFERENTIATION AMONG LINGUISTIC PHENOMENA, FOR WHICH THERE CAN BE NO PURELY MECHANICAL TRAINING. CONSTANT, THOUGHTFUL ACTIVITY AT MOMENTS OF SPEAKING IS  ESSENTIAL. HABITS, ONCE FORMED CONSCIOUSLY, ARE INCLUDED IN THE FORMATION OF OTHER CONSCIOUSLY FORMED HABITS UNTIL A COMPLEX OF PHENOMENA EMERGES IN THE MIND OF THE STUDENT. LEXICAL PHENOMENA MUST BE INTERWOVEN WITH GRAMMATICAL PHENOMENA FOR AN ORGANIZED MERGER IN THE MIND OF THE LEARNER. A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES ELABORATE THE SYSTEM--THE USUAL AUDIOLINGUAL METHODS, LISTENING TO TAPES TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSION, NATURAL CLASSROOM DIALOGS, &quot;SHORT-MEMORY&quot; TRAINING, CREATION OF LIFE SITUATIONS, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, AND SPEAKING FROM PICTURES.

        "description":"TRADITIONALISTS FREQUENTLY MAINTAIN THAT AUDIOLINGUAL TECHNIQUES, IN THEIR DEEMPHASIS OF GRAMMATICAL THEORY, TEND TO BE SUPERFICIAL AND UNSCHOLARLY. ADVOCATES OF THE NEWER METHODOLOGIES COUNTER BY INSISTING UPON THE NECESSITY OF WELL-CONSTRUCTED DRILL MATERIAL IN ABUNDANCE AT THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE APPROACHES DERIVES FROM TWO COMPETING THEORIES OF LANGUAGE ACQUISITION. THE TRADITIONALISTS FOCUS UPON THE ROLE OF THE INTELLECT IN THIS TASK. AFTER THE GRAMMATICAL RULES AND PARADIGMS HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED CLEARLY IN CLASS, THE STUDENT MUST STRIVE TO UNDERSTAND THEM SO THAT HE CAN PROCEED TO THE READING OF GRADED TEXTS. AUDIOLINGUAL TEACHERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, BELIEVE THAT LANGUAGE LEARNING IS BASICALLY A MATTER OF HABIT FORMING. NEW SKILLS ARE TO BE MASTERED AND  THIS SIMPLY REQUIRES PRACTICE. THE KEY TO A RECONCILIATION OF THE TWO METHODOLOGIES IS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF ALL THAT IS INVOLVED IN THE TERM GRAMMAR. LINGUISTIC DESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN BY THE LINGUISTS ARE GRAMMARS, BUT SO IS THE TOTAL KNOWLEDGE THAT THE NATIVE SPEAKER POSSESSES OF HIS LANGUAGE, A KNOWLEDGE THAT ENABLES HIM TO RECOGNIZE AND PRODUCE ON HIS OWN WELL-FORMED SENTENCES. THE AUDIOLINGUAL METHODOLOGY THEREFORE DOES TEACH GRAMMAR SINCE THE STUDENT WHO MASTERS A PARTICULAR LINGUISTIC PATTERN HAS IN EFFECT CONSTRUCTED FOR HIMSELF THE APPOSITE RULE. A BRIEF PRESENTATION OF SUCH RULES BY THE TEACHER WILL SERVE THE PURPOSE OF GIVING THE STUDENT A THEORETICAL ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE IS TRYING TO LEARN PRACTICALLY.

THE SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO CONTROL, MOTIVATIONAL, AND FACTUAL GROUPS. ALL SUBJECTS WERE PRETESTED WITH THE ROBINSON-HALL CANADIAN HISTORY TEST AND A QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT READING HABITS AND ATTITUDES. THE MOTIVATIONAL GROUP READ A HANDOUT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF RAPID READING BEFORE RETURNING TO TAKE THE POST-TEST BATTERY. THE FACTUAL GROUP RECEIVED SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING READING SPEED. THE CONTROL GROUP  RECEIVED NO INSTRUCTION OR SUGGESTIONS. SEVEN DAYS LATER THE ROBINSON-HALL ART AND RUSSIAN HISTORY TESTS AND A POST-QUESTIONNAIRE WERE ADMINISTERED. A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS MADE OF PRE- AND POST-TEST SCORES, QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSES, AND SCHOLASTIC ABILITY FOR EACH GROUP.

SIXTY-FOUR SOPHOMORES AT CAMPBELL COLLEGE WERE ASSIGNED RANDOMLY TO FOUR CONDITIONS, TWO EXPERIMENTAL AND TWO CONTROL. THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS WERE ENCODING--A GROUP OF SUBJECTS PRODUCED WRITTEN STORIES IN RESPONSE TO TWO THEMATIC APPERCEPTION TEST (TAT) CARDS, AND DECODING--A GROUP OF SUBJECTS READ PRODUCTIONS OF THE ENCODING GROUP. ONE CONTROL GROUP WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF PRODUCING STORIES, AND THIS GROUP (IRRELEVANT  ENCODERS-DECODERS) WAS GIVEN THE STORIES OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP TO READ. THE OTHER CONTROL GROUP (NAIVE DECODERS) WAS GIVEN RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TAT STORIES TO READ. THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE WAS CLOZE TESTS. AN ORTHOGONAL COMPARISON OF MEANS WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA.

QUESTIONNAIRES SENT TO THE PRINCIPALS OF A RANDOM SAMPLE OF SCHOOLS WHICH INCLUDED GRADES 7, 8, AND 9 WERE USED TO OBTAIN INFORMATION. CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION INCLUDED (1) ENROLLMENT AND ORGANIZATION, (2) INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES, (3) BUDGET, (4) SCIENCE CLUBS AND FAIRS, (5) INSERVICE TEACHER EDUCATION, AND (6) CONSULTANT SERVICE. FOR ANALYSIS OF DATA, SCHOOLS WERE CLASSIFIED AS SMALL, MIDDLE-SIZED, OR LARGE. ALL SCHOOLS OFFERED SCIENCE COURSES AT SOME GRADE LEVEL, BUT NOT ALL SCHOOLS OFFERED THEM AT EACH GRADE LEVEL. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS OFFERING SCIENCE AS THE GRADE LEVEL INCREASED. GENERAL  SCIENCE WAS THE MOST COMMON SCIENCE COURSE. THE LARGEST SCHOOLS HAD PROPORTIONATELY FEWER SCIENCE TEACHERS THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. NEARLY ALL SCHOOLS USED SCIENCE TEXTBOOKS, BUT ONLY 80 PERCENT USED THEM AT ALL THREE GRADE LEVELS. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS WERE USED PROGRESSIVELY MORE AT HIGHER GRADE LEVELS. COMBINATION CLASSROOM LABORATORIES WERE THE MOST COMMON FACILITY. MORE THAN 25 PERCENT OF THE SCHOOLS, HOWEVER, DID NOT PROVIDE ANY TYPE OF LABORATORY. OVER 80 PERCENT OF THE SCHOOLS USED NATIONAL DEFIENSE EDUCATION ACT (NDEA) FUNDS TO PURCHASE SCIENCE EQUIPMENT, AND APPROXIMATELY 33 PERCENT OF THE SCHOOLS USED NDEA FUNDS FOR REMODELING BUILDINGS. ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE SCHOOLS SPONSORED SCIENCE CLUBS AND SCIENCE FAIRS.

ANOTHER SECTION DISCUSSES THE SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL ILLS OF SEGREGATION, THE TECHNIQUES OF TOKEN DESEGREGATION IN THE SOUTH, AND VARIOUS REASONS FOR WHITE NORTHERN RESISTANCE TO DESEGREGATION. SOME COURT CASES INVOLVING DE FACTO SEGREGATION ARE DETAILED AND INTERPRETED IN A THIRD SECTION. A FOURTH DESCRIBES VARIOUS METHODS OF ABOLISHING DE FACTO SCHOOL SEGREGATION WHERE THERE IS RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION--DIVISION BY GRADES (PRINCETON PLAN), REZONING SCHOOL BOUNDARIES AND SCHOOL  RELOCATION, AND VOLUNTARY AND COMPULSORY TRANSFERS. THE FINAL CHAPTER DEALS WITH EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE DE FACTO SEGREGATION, THROUGH BOYCOTTS AND PROTESTS, SCHOOL BOARD POLICIES, STATE LAWS AGAINST RACIALLY UNBALANCED SCHOOLS, AND COMPENSATORY AND ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT DESPITE THE VARIETY OF MANIPULATIONS USED TO ACHIEVE SCHOOL DESEGREGATION THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION DEPENDS UPON RESIDENTIAL DESEGREGATION, WHICH IS AT THE HEART OF THE NATIONAL SEGREGATION PROBLEM.

A TEAM OF EDUCATORS AND CONTENT SPECIALISTS EXAMINED THE MATERIAL WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF SPECIALLY PREPARED GUIDELINES AND THE PREVIOUSLY STATED OBJECTIVES FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLS--TO DEVELOP THE INSIGHTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, AND APPRECIATIONS NECESSARY FOR THE UNDERPRIVILEGED CHILD TO LIVE COMPETENTLY IN A LARGE CITY AND TO PLAN EFFECTIVE CURRICULUMS IN MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, FOREIGN LANGUAGES, TYPEWRITING, ENGLISH, LANGUAGE ARTS, HISTORY, SOCIAL SCIENCES, ART, MUSIC, URBAN LIVING, INDUSTRIAL ARTS, AND HEALTH EDUCATION. IN ADDITION, THE CURRICULUMS ARE APPRAISED IN RELATION TO THE IDEAS AND PRACTICES OF FIVE SELECTED, DESEGREGATED NEW YORK CITY  SCHOOLS WHICH SERVE DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN AND ARE MEETING MIDDLE SCHOOL OBJECTIVES SUCCESSFULLY. COMPARISONS ARE MADE ALSO WITH CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENTS IN LOS ANGELES, CHICAGO, AND PHILADELPHIA. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE CURRICULUM PROJECT AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MIDDLE SCHOOL CONCEPT ARE INCLUDED. THE APPENDIXES CONTAIN A STUDY OF THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF THE PUPILS IN THE FIVE INTEGRATED SCHOOLS, THE SUGGESTED GUIDELINES FOR USE BY SPECIALISTS IN DEVELOPING THE NEW CURRICULUMS, AND THE ACTUAL EVALUATIONS OF THE AVAILABLE TASK FORCE REPORTS.

FIRST, IT INCREASES THE VOCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE SLUM DWELLER AND PROVIDES HIM WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT OF A SATISFYING JOB. SECOND, THE LOW INCOME NONPROFESSIONAL AS A &quot;SOCIAL CLASS MEDIATOR&quot; FACILITATES EASIER COMMUNICATION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE GREATER INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER URBAN SLUM RESIDENTS IN A SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAM. MOBILIZATION FOR YOUTH (MFY) IN NEW YORK CITY EMPLOYS NONPROFESSIONALS IN THREE PROGRAMS--THE PARENT EDUCATION AIDE UNIT, THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, AND THE VISITING HOMEMAKER SERVICE. MFY'S CRITERIA IN HIRING NONPROFESSIONALS ARE (1) EXPERTISE IN THE ACTIVITIES OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM, (2) IDENTIFICATION  WITH OTHER LOWER CLASS PEOPLE, AND (3) AN ACTION-ORIENTATION, THAT IS, A BELIEF IN GROUP SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS OF MINORITY GROUP STATUS AND POVERTY. SHARING MUTUAL INTERESTS WITH THE CLIENTS, AND UNENCUMBERED BY PROFESSIONAL ROLES, THE NONPROFESSIONAL TENDS TO BE MORE DIRECT AND REALISTIC IN DEALING WITH CLIENTS THAN THE PROFESSIONAL. CAREFUL ORGANIZATION CAN MINIMIZE THE COMPETITION BETWEEN THE NONPROFESSIONAL AND HIS HIGHER STATUS COLLEAGUES AND CAN DISCOURAGE THE FORMER FROM BECOMING POOR COPIES OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL SUPERVISORS. ALTHOUGH INSTITUTIONAL RIGIDITIES HAVE SOMETIMES LIMITED THEIR USEFULNESS, NONPROFESSIONALS HAVE CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIALLY TO MFY PROGRAMS. (TD)",

THERE EXISTS AMONG PUERTO RICANS A SENSE OF ETHNIC IDENTIFICATION AND UNITY WHICH AFFECTS THEIR BEHAVIOR WITHIN THE LARGER COMMUNITY. ONE FACTOR WHICH FIGURES IMPORTANTLY IN NEW YORK CITY PUERTO RICAN CULTURE IS THE PROBLEM OF CULTURAL DUALITIES, WHICH ARE A RESULT OF THE STRESS OF ADAPTATION FROM THE ISLAND TO THE MAINLAND CULTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, ALTHOUGH THE FAMILY RELATIONSHIP STILL IS A STRONGLY EXTENDED NETWORK OF KINSHIP WHICH OFFERS A SENSE OF MUTUAL OBLIGATION, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SEXES HAS BECOME MORE EQUALITARIAN, AND CONFLICT HAS ARISEN BETWEEN THE ELDER'S CULTURALLY ROOTED BELIEF IN HIS OWN  SELF-WORTH, DESPITE HIS REALISTIC AWARENESS OF HIS DISADVANTAGED POSITION, AND THE ADOLESCENT'S FEELING OF POWER IN THE FAMILY BECAUSE OF HIS BETTER EDUCATION. AN ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PUERTO RICAN'S BEHAVIOR, ESPECIALLY IN HIS FEELINGS ABOUT DISCRIMINATION, IS HIS COMPLEX RACIAL ATTITUDE. IF PUERTO RICANS CAN BE MADE TO FEEL THAT THEIR CULTURE IS RECOGNIZED AND AFFIRMED, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP TO BRING ABOUT THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO REMOVE THE EFFECTS OF POVERTY IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

ONE MODEL REPRESENTED PARENTAL ENCOURAGEMENT AS AN INTERVENING VARIABLE BETWEEN EDUCATIONAL EXPECTATIONS AND THE FACTORS OF EDUCATION OF FATHER, OCCUPATION OF FATHER, AND EDUCATION OF MOTHER. IN THE SECOND MODEL, PARENTAL ENCOURAGEMENT AND THE OTHER THREE FACTORS WERE DEPICTED AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES INTERACTING WITH EDUCATIONAL EXPECTATIONS. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED TO GATHER DATA FROM 6,000 SOPHOMORE STUDENTS IN PUBLIC AND PAROCHIAL SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN SIX MIDDLE-SIZE PENNSYLVANIA CITIES. THE HOLLINGSHEAD SEVEN CATEGORY  OCCUPATIONAL RATING SCALE WAS USED TO MEASURE OCCUPATION OF FATHER AND THE HOLLINGSHEAD SEVEN CATEGORY EDUCATIONAL RATING SCALE WAS USED TO MEASURE EDUCATION OF FATHER AND EDUCATION OF MOTHER. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY FACTORS IN THE MODELS. A CRITICAL TEST WAS THEN MADE FOR AN INTERVENING VARIABLE. RESULTS OF THE TEST WERE NOT CONSIDERED TO ADEQUATELY ESTABLISH PARENTAL ENCOURAGEMENT AS AN INTERVENING VARIABLE. TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THIS STUDY AND EARLIER STUDIES, SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS WERE MADE THAT LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT PARENTAL ENCOURAGEMENT ACTS AS AN INDEPENDENT VARIABLE.

THE PROGRAM HAD BEEN DEVELOPED AS A PART OF &quot;PROJECT LITERACY,&quot; A BASIC RESEARCH AND CURRICULUM-DEVELOPMENT EFFORT IN AREAS OF EDUCATION RELEVANT TO THE ACQUISITION OF LITERACY SKILLS. THE EVALUATION WAS CONDUCTED IN A FIRST-GRADE CLASSROOM CONTAINING A HETEROGENEOUS GROUP OF 23 CHILDREN. CHILDREN'S OWN STORIES, TEACHER'S SENTENCES, TRADE BOOKS, TEXTBOOKS, MESSAGES FROM ONE CHILD TO ANOTHER, BULLETIN-BOARD TITLES, WORKSHEETS, RIDDLES, CROSSWORD PUZZLES, AND STORIES COMPOSED BY THE &quot;PROJECT LITERACY&quot; STAFF WERE USED TO ALLOW THE CHILD THE FULL RANGE OF SAMPLING NECESSARY FOR READING IN VARIOUS SITUATIONS. A LETTER PHONICS PROGRAM WAS INTEGRATED WITH THE READING INSTRUCTION  FOR THE SLOWER-MOVING READERS. TO CREATE A LITERATE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WAS THE PROGRAM'S FIRST OBJECTIVE, SUCH ITEMS AS A MESSAGE BOARD, A TAPE RECORDER, AND AN ELECTRIC TYPEWRITER WERE PROVIDED. NO SHARP DEMARCATION WAS MADE AMONG THE ACTIVITIES OF READING, LISTENING, AND WRITING. DURING EACH OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL PERIODS, THESE ACTIVITIES WERE INTERSPERSED AMONG SUBGROUPS OF CHILDREN. ALL OF THE PARTICIPATING CHILDREN LEARNED TO READ. EVEN THE SLOWER READERS WERE READING COMFORTABLY AT A FIRST-GRADE LEVEL AT THE YEAR'S END, AND MOST WERE READING ABOVE GRADE LEVEL. A SECOND-YEAR PROGRAM WITH TWO FIRST-GRADE CLASSROOMS WAS PLANNED. A RELATED REPORT IS AA 000 022. (JH)",

THE LABORATORY APPROACH TO THE LEADERSHIP TRAINING OF INSTRUCTIONAL STAFF MEMBERS PRESENTED THREE ILLUSTRATIVE EXERCISES THAT DEALT WITH EVALUATING PUPILS' WORK, GROUPING PRACTICES, AND THE USE OF INBASKET ITEMS AS TRAINING MATERIALS FOR PRINCIPALS. A TRAINING APPROACH, THAT WAS PLANNED TO HELP TEACHERS IMPLEMENT INNOVATIONS IN INSTRUCTION INTO THEIR CLASSROOMS, PROVIDES TEACHER TRAINING THROUGH  SIMULATION OF DIRECT EXPERIENCES WITH STUDENTS AND BY OBSERVING AND ANALYZING STUDENT CLASSROOM WORK. THIS APPROACH REQUIRES RELEASE TIME FOR OBSERVATION OF DEMONSTRATION CLASSES. A DISCUSSION OF THE THIRD APPROACH, THE TEACHING DEMONSTRATION MODEL, DESCRIBED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORMAL DEMONSTRATION INTO A CAREFULLY PLANNED INSERVICE TECHNIQUE.

THE INVESTIGATOR FOUND THAT THE FIRST- AND SECOND-GRADE CHILDREN HAD NOT BEEN TESTED BEFORE IN ANY WAY. THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND DIRECTIONS. INSTRUCTIONS TO CIRCLE THE CORRECT ANSWERS CONFUSED THEM, AND THEY COULD NOT FOLLOW THE QUESTIONS WHEN SPOKEN IN ENGLISH. FOR THE FIRST TWO GRADES, QUESTIONS HAD TO BE READ FIRST IN ENGLISH AND THEN IN SPANISH. SOME WORDS AND CONCEPTS USED IN THE TEST APPEARED TO BE TOO ADVANCED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE  STUDENTS TESTED IN GRADES 1-6. THE INVESTIGATOR CONCLUDED THAT (1) READING QUESTIONS IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH MAY HELP AT ALL GRADE LEVELS AND (2) SPANISH-SPEAKING PERSONS CAN ELICIT MORE COOPERATION FROM THE PUPILS, AND, PERHAPS, MORE HONESTY IN THE ANSWERS THAN AN ANGLO.

THE CULTURAL FACTORS RELATED TO THIS SYMBOLISM WERE OBSERVED BY THE AUTHOR IN THE COURSE OF CONDUCTING TWO DIFFERENT ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDIES OF THE SOCIAL LIFE OF AMERICANS OF MEXICAN DESCENT IN SOUTH TEXAS. THE RESULTS OF THESE STUDIES WERE ALSO RELATED TO A STUDY OF THE MEXICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY OF TUCSON. POPULATION GROWTHS OF BOTH MEXICANS AND ANGLOS IN THE TWO AREAS WERE OBSERVED TO BE COMPARABLE. THE ANGLOS WERE PRINCIPALLY OF MIDDLE- AND UPPER-CLASS BACKGROUNDS AND ECONOMICALLY SUCCESSFUL, WHILE MOST OF THE MEXICANS WERE UNSKILLED, UNDEREDUCATED, POVERTY-STRIKEN IMMIGRANTS FROM RURAL MEXICO. THE AUTHOR ASSERTS THAT THE SOCIAL IDEOLOGY GUIDING INTERGROUP RELATIONS IN  THE SOUTHWEST AFFIRMS THIS TO BE AN OPEN-CLASS SOCIETY IN WHICH SPANISH-SPEAKING AMERICANS FORM AS MUCH A PART AS THE ANGLOS. IN CONTRAST, MEXICAN-AMERICANS MUST ACQUIRE ANGLO TRAITS OF BEHAVIOR TO BETTER THEIR WELFARE AND SOCIAL STATUS. IN THIS SITUATION, THE MEXICAN AMERICANS ACCEPT THE NEED TO ACQUIRE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE SKILLS, BUT SEE NO ADVANTAGE IN ADOPTING OTHER ANGLO CULTURAL TRAITS. THEY REGARD THOSE WHO GIVE UP SPANISH AS TURNING THEIR BACKS ON THEIR PEOPLE. THEY SEE THE PROHIBITION OF THE USE OF SPANISH ON THE SCHOOL GROUNDS AS DEGRADING THEIR ENTIRE TRADITIONAL WAY OF LIFE. THE RETENTION OF SPANISH IDENTIFIES A SEPARATE CULTURAL GROUP, WHILE THE USE OF ENGLISH LESSENS THE IDENTIFICATION OF THESE PEOPLE WITH MEXICO AND THEIR MEXICAN CULTURAL HERITAGE. (AL)",

ANOTHER LYCEUM AT CONCORD, MASSACHUSETTS CAME INTO BEING IN 1829, AND IN THAT AREA THERE LIVED MANY LITERARY, POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, AND HUMANITARIAN LEADERS. AS YEARS WENT BY, THE LYCEUM BECAME A SCHEDULED SERIES OF LECTURES AND ENTERTAINMENT. THOREAU, WHO WAS UNHAPPY TO SEE THE LYCEUM LOSING THE INTERACTIN OF FREE MEN, BECAME SECRETARY AND CURATOR OF THE CONCORD LYCEUM. ONE OF HIS CENTRAL CONCERNS WAS THE PROPER RELATIONSHIP OF  MEN TO ONE ANOTHER. THOREAU FELT MAN HAD MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS BUT THE KEY IDEA WAS VOLUNTARY ASSENT. THE LYCEUM WAS A PLACE WHERE THOUGHTFUL MEN COULD MEET TOGETHER TO EDUCATE EACH OTHER AND IT WAS ONE FORM OF TOLERABLE GROUP ASSOCIATION. HOULE CONCLUDED HIS SPEECH BY SAYING THAT CHANCELLOR TOLLEY'S CONCERN FOR ADULT EDUCATION AND HIS INTEREST IN THE HISTORY OF IDEAS FOUND A COMMON MEETING PLACE IN THOREAU'S THOUGHTS.

THE PROBLEM WAS TO SEE HOW THE DEAN OF MEN'S OFFICE (DMO) SELECTIONS COMPARED WITH THE PEER-IDENTIFIED LEADERS (PIL). THE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION WAS DESCRIPTIVE, AND THE TOOLS OF MEASUREMENT WERE THE QUESTIONNAIRE, THE INTERVIEW, AND THE CANDIDATE'S APPLICATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS. THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 800 SOPHOMORES AND JUNIORS ENROLLED AT HOLY CROSS COLLEGE FULL TIME. THREE HUNDRED OF THESE STUDENTS WERE VYING FOR 60 RA POSITIONS. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE HIGHER THE STUDENT RATES ON THE SOCIOMETRIC PART OF THE SELECTION PROCESS, THE MORE LIKELY  HE WILL BE CHOSEN AS A RA.

DATA FROM 50 STATES WERE SUBJECTED TO SIMPLE, PARTIAL, AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE VARIABLES ON EDUCATIONAL POLICY OUTCOMES. SIMPLE CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS COMPUTED FOR ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL VARIABLES AND EDUCATIONAL POLICY  OUTCOMES INDICATED THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. NO MEANINGFUL SIMPLE CORRELATIONS EXIST, HOWEVER, BETWEEN PARTICULAR POLITICAL VARIABLES AND EDUCATIONAL POLICY OUTCOMES. MULTIPLE CORRELATION ANALYSIS CORRELATING ALL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL VARIABLES AND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPLAINS MOST VARIATION AMONG THE 50 STATES IN IMPORTANT POLICY OUTCOMES. THROUGH THE USE OF MULTIPLE-PARTIAL CORRELATION A COMPARISON OF THE INDIVIDUAL EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL VARIABLES CAN BE MADE. THE DATA ILLUSTRATE THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT VARIABLES ARE MORE INFLUENTIAL THAN POLITICAL SYSTEM VARIABLES IN SHAPING POLICY OUTCOMES. (GB)",

THE CURRENT POLITICAL SOCIALIZATION PROCESS SERVES TO REINFORCE TRADITIONAL MIDDLE-CLASS VALUES RATHER THAN TO EXPAND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND CONSCIOUSNESS AMONG THE PREVIOUSLY APOLITICAL STRATA. TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS OF DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION REQUIRES DIRECT ACTION UPON THE EXISTING EDUCATIONAL STRUCTURES. OTHERWISE CURRENT PROCESSES WILL CONTINUE TO FOSTER DEPENDENCE UPON AUTHORITY SYSTEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACQUIRING SHARED POWER AND INTERPERSONAL COMPETENCE WILL BE RESTRICTED. SCHOOLS ARE ONE OF THE FEW INSTITUTIONS WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY REACH INTO THE LIVES OF LOWER  STATUS CHILDREN AND WHICH HAVE THE BEHAVIORAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY. A RESTRUCTURING OF EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES WILL PROVIDE THE CONDITIONS WHICH ARE CLOSELY CORRELATED WITH HIGH EDUCATIONAL AND POLITICAL PERFORMANCE.

POLICY MAKERS INCLUDE THE BOARD OF EDUCATION, 31 LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS, THE SUPERINTENDENT, THE HEAD OFFICE STAFF, THE FIELD STAFF (PRINCIPALS, ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS, DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS, AND DEPARTMENT CHAIRMEN), A HEADQUARTERS SUPERVISORY GROUP, LOCAL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS, SUPERVISORY ASSOCIATIONS, THE TEACHERS' UNION, LOCAL CIVIC AND INTEREST GROUPS, AND THE CITY'S PRESS. AS POLICY-FORMULATION FOR AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX SCHOOL SYSTEM HAS DEMANDED MORE SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE, POWER HAS SHIFTED FROM THE BOARD TO PROFESSIONALS IN THE SYSTEM AND TO SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS. CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND  BUDGETING ARE ALMOST COMPLETELY CONTROLLED BY THE HEADQUARTERS SUPERVISORY BUREAUCRACY. IN THE SELECTION OF THE SUPERINTENDENT, THE BOARD OF EDUCATION PLAYS A PRIMARY ROLE. THE DETERMINERS OF SALARY POLICY INCLUDE THE MAYOR AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AS PARTICIPANTS. PROBLEMS CONCERNING INTEGRATION HAVE PROMPTED THE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT OF SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, FURTHER BREAKING THE MONOPOLY OF POWER VESTED IN THE SMALL CORE OF SUPERINTENDENTS, BOARDS, AND SCHOOL BUREAUCRACIES. SUGGESTIONS FOR DECENTRALIZING THE SYSTEM INCLUDE (1) DEVELOPING EDUCATIONAL PARKS, (2) STRENGTHENING LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS, (3) DECENTRALIZING ECONOMIC ADMINISTRATION INTO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AND (4) REPLACING THE PRESENT SINGLE DISTRICT WITH SEVERAL COORDINATED SMALLER DISTRICTS.

NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA, AND FLORIDA WERE FOUND TO OPERATE SOME SCHOOLS ON A YEAR-ROUND BASIS. THREE OF SEVEN OUTLINED PLANS WERE SELECTED FOR SPECIAL ANALYSIS--REGULAR YEAR PLUS SUMMER ATTENDANCE, STAGGERED FOUR QUARTERS, AND THE TRIMESTER PLAN. UNDER THE QUARTER SYSTEM, A POLK COUNTY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WOULD REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF 540 PUPILS TO OPERATE AT LOWER COST THAN THE PRESENT SYSTEM ALLOWS BECAUSE INSTRUCTIONAL SALARIES AMOUNT TO 80 PERCENT OF ALL CURRENT EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES IN POLK COUNTY. UNDER THE TRIMESTER SYSTEM, THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WOULD REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF 432 PUPILS TO  OPERATE WITH A LOWER TOTAL INSTRUCTIONAL SALARIES COST. JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS WOULD REQUIRE MORE TEACHERS AND HIGHER SALARIES FOR BOTH THE QUARTER AND TRIMESTER SYSTEMS BECAUSE THEY MUST OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS REQUIRING A LARGER PROPORTIONATE TEACHING STAFF THAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. OTHER COST DIFFERENTIALS INCLUDE ADMINISTRATION, PLANT OPERATION, AUXILIARY CHARGES, FIXED CHARGES, AND CAPITAL OUTLAY. SPECIAL PROBLEMS INCLUDE ADMINISTRATION, PLANT MAINTENANCE, TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION, CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, PUPIL REASSIGNMENT, AND PUBLIC RELATIONS. PUBLIC REACTION FROM 4,210 RESPONDENTS (2,477 PARENTS, 487 TEACHERS, AND 1,246 STUDENTS) FAVORED THE REGULAR SCHOOL YEAR PLUS SUMMER PROGRAM OPERATED WITHOUT COST TO PARENTS BUT WITH ATTENDANCE COMPULSORY FOR STUDENTS  NOT PROMOTED AND VOLUNTARY FOR OTHERS. AN EIGHTH PLAN PROVIDING 210 DAYS OF CONTINUOUS STUDY FOR ALL PUPILS IS RECOMMENDED AS THE BEST MEANS OF INCREASING THE EDUCATIONAL QUALITY LEVEL AND OBTAINING THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL RETURN PER DOLLAR INVESTED IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

OF PRIMARY CONCERN ARE THE PURPOSE OF FEDERAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ADMINISTRATIVE RELATIONS FOR SOUND FEDERAL-STATE-LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND THE COMBINED EFFECT OF ALL FEDERAL PROGRAMS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADEQUATE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN ALL STATES. GOALS INCLUDE PROVISION OF SPECIAL PURPOSE GRANTS FOR EDUCATING DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN, COMPENSATION FOR DEFICIENCIES IN THE SCHOOL TAX BASE RESULTING FROM THE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF FEDERAL PROPERTY, AND FINANCING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAMS FOR EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENT. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT FEDERAL PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE COORDINATED WITH STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS THROUGH STATE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION. AS FEDERAL CATEGORICAL AID BECOME OPERATIVE, PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE FOR THE STATE TO ADJUST ITS GRANT PROGRAM TO LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO REALIZE OPTIMUM ALLOCATION OF TOTAL FUNDING. DISCRETIONARY ALLOCATION OF FEDERAL PROGRAM FUNDS SHOULD BE MINIMIZED BY THE APPLICATION OF OBJECTIVE FORMULAS.

FOUR ASPECTS OF THIS EMERGENT ROLE ARE OUTLINED--(1) THE ADMINISTRATOR WILL BECOME STRONGER AND MORE INFLUENTIAL IN BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEADERSHIP DIMENSIONS OF HIS ROLE, (2) ADMINISTRATIVE VALUES AND BEHAVIOR WILL BECOME MORE DEMOCRATIC, (3) THE ADMINISTRATOR'S ROLE WILL BECOME MORE POLITICAL IN CHARACTER, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO POLICY FORMULATION AND THE SECURING OF SUFFICIENT PUBLIC SUPPORT, AND (4) THE FOSTERING OF INNOVATION WILL BE AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. IMPLICATIONS OF THIS DEVELOPING ADMINISTRATOR ROLE INCLUDE (1) INCREASED TEACHER INVOLVEMENT IN EDUCATIONAL DECISION MAKING, (2) ADMINISTRATIVE ASSUMPTION  OF A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN RELATIONSHIPS WITH TEACHER GROUPS, (3) INCREASED FOCUS OF TEACHER-ADMINISTRATOR RELATIONSHIPS UPON COOPERATIVE GOAL ESTABLISHMENT, AND (4) REPLACEMENT OF ORTHODOX ADMINISTRATIVE IDEOLOGY IN TEACHER-ADMINISTRATOR RELATIONSHIPS WITH A MORE DEMOCRATIC IDEOLOGY.

BOTH NEA AND AFT REGARD COMMITMENT TO MUTUAL AGREEMENT AS A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN A NEGOTIATING RELATIONSHIP. OF 419 WRITTEN POLICY AGREEMENTS ANALYZED, ONLY 36 (8.5 PERCENT) WERE JOINTLY SIGNED. THE REMAINING 383 WERE PRODUCTS OF UNILATERAL BOARD POLICY. SUBJECTS FOR NEGOTIATION HAVE INCLUDED CURRICULUMS, METHODS OF INSTRUCTION, SCHOOL CALENDAR, INSURANCE, DISMISSAL OF CLASSES, AND RELATED NONSALARY ISSUES. COMMUNITY FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF  EDUCATION, BUDGETING ALLOTMENT PRIORITIES, ACADEMIC TRAINING AS A DETERMINANT FOR TEACHER-ADVANCEMENT, AND ROTATION OF TEACHING WITH NONTEACHING ASSIGNMENTS HAVE BEEN SPECIAL AREAS OF CONFLICT. WHILE THE TEACHER STRIKE IS CURRENTLY REGARDED AS A UNILATERAL IMPASSE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE, COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS RAPIDLY BECOMING A SYSTEM OF BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN PUBLIC EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS. THE AFT, CENTERING ITS ORGANIZATIONAL WORK IN A NUMBER OF THE NATION'S LARGEST CITIES, IS MORE INCLINED TO CONSIDER CONFLICT IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM INEVITABLE THAN IS THE NEA.

THE COMMISSION DISCOVERED THAT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM LAY IN THE STRUCTURE AND SUBSTANCE OF THE URBAN SOCIETY ITSELF. SINCE 1950, THERE HAS BEEN A RAPID MOVEMENT OF MIDDLE AND UPPER-MIDDLE CLASS WHITES TO THE SUBURBS AND A LARGE IMMIGRATION OF LOW-INCOME NEGROES INTO THE CENTER CITY. BUSINESSES HAVE MOVED TO THE SUBURBS, AND THE LOWERED TAX BASE AND PROPERTY VALUE HAVE RESULTED IN A LACK OF TAX FUNDS FOR THE FINANCING OF CENTER CITY EDUCATION. IN CONSEQUENCE, THERE IS AN INSUFFICIENCY OF  CLASSROOM SPACE AND QUALIFIED TEACHERS, EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEACHER TURNOVER, COMMUNICATION FAILURE BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND TEACHING STAFF AND BETWEEN SCHOOL SYSTEM AND ECONOMICALLY DISSADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES, DE FACTO SEGREGATION, AND AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN LOW-INCOME AREA SCHOOLS AND MIDDLE- AND UPPER-INCOME AREA SCHOOLS. THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTER CITY IN THE AREAS OF (1) FISCAL REFORM, (2) TEACHER PREPARATION, (3) URBAN PLANNING, (4) DE FACTO SEGREGATION, (5) HIGHER EDUCATION, AND (6) PUBLIC RELATIONS.

THE SECOND LEVEL OF FOCUS INVOLVES THE INFORMAL INFLUENCES AND CONTROLS,  ORIGINATING FROM THE FORCES, AGENCIES, AND INTERACTIONS OF THE TOTAL SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS LEVEL OF INFLUENCE AND CONTROL IS A RESULT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INDIGENOUS TO A PARTICULAR SCHOOL SYSTEM.

THE PREDOMINANT FEATURE OF THE PROGRAM WAS A MATCHING-TO-SAMPLE TECHNIQUE UTILIZING A TEACHING MACHINE AND CARDS. THE MAJOR PROGRAMING PRINCIPLE WAS TO DIFFERENTIALLY REINFORCE THE STUDENTS BEHAVIOR AS HE WAS PRESENTED WITH SIMPLE OR MIXED TEXTUAL, PICTORIAL, AND AUDITORY STIMULI. REINFORCEMENT OCCURRED IN THE FORM OF IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK INDICATING THE CORRECTNESS OF THE RESPONSE. THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE EXPERIMENT WAS THAT AN EXTENSIVE REPERTOIRE AS A LISTENER AND READER WOULD PROVIDE THE BASIC PERFORMANCE FROM WHICH SPEAKING AND WRITING COULD EMERGE. IT  WAS ASSUMED THAT THE STUDENT WOULD REINFORCE AND SHAPE HIS OWN BEHAVIOR AS HE HEARD DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HIS OWN SPEECH AND THAT OF THE NATIVE MODEL. ANOTHER FEATURE OF THIS LARGELY AUTODIDACTIC PROGRAM WAS THE BRIEF TEST GIVEN THE STUDENT AFTER EACH LESSON WHICH MEASURED HIS TOTAL PERFORMANCE TO DATE. ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT SUPPORTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SPEAKING AND WRITING SKILLS CAN BE TAUGHT THROUGH AUDITORY AND TEXTUAL MATERIALS, THAT PROCEDURE WAS NOT RECOMMENDED AS THE SOLE TEACHING METHOD.

THREE GROUPS OF UNDERGRADUATES WITH NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IN FRENCH RECEIVED TREATMENTS CONTAINING VARYING PROPORTIONS OF DISCRIMINATION TRAINING AND PRONUNCIATION PRACTICE. WHEN TESTED, THE GROUPS WHICH HAD RECEIVED THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF DISCRIMINATION TRAINING PERFORMED DISCRIMINATION TASKS MORE ACCURATELY AND MIMICKED THE PRONUNCIATION OF FRENCH WORDS BETTER THAN THE GROUPS WITH HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF PRONUNCIATION PRACTICE. THERE WAS NO OVERALL  DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF ERRORS IN SELF-EVALUATION THOUGH THE GROUP WHICH HAD RECEIVED THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF DISCRIMINATION TRAINING TENDED TO BE MORE SEVERE IN ITS EVALUATION THAN THE OTHER GROUPS. IT APPEARS THAT DISCRIMINATION TRAINING IS AN EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE IN THE TEACHING OF THE PRONUNCIATION OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES SINCE IT RESULTS IN BETTER PRONUNCIATION AND STRICTER SELF-EVALUATION.

IN LATE SPRING, AN INVITATIONAL LETTER WAS SENT TO PARENTS OF CHILDREN WHO WOULD BE IN THE THIRD TO SIXTH GRADES IN TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND WHOSE READING ABILITY WAS 1 OR MORE YEARS BELOW GRADE LEVEL. THERE WERE 13 EXPERIMENTALS AND 16 CONTROLS IN THE FINAL GROUP. THE CALIFORNIA READING TEST AND THE GILMORE ORAL READING TEST WERE ADMINISTERED TO THE PUPILS AS THE PRE- AND POST-TESTS. THE EXPERIMENTAL PARENT GROUP WAS TAKEN  THROUGH THE PARENT-TRAINING PROGRAM. AFTER THE POST-TESTING OF ALL PUPILS IN READING, THE CONTROL GROUP PARENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE TRAINING PROGRAM. IN READING COMPREHENSION, THE CONTROL GROUP GAINS WERE GREATER THAN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP GAINS. THE PARENT TRAINING PROGRAM ACCOUNTED FOR 16 PERCENT OF VARIANCE IN ORAL READING ACCURACY AND FOR 25 PERCENT OF THE VARIANCE IN ORAL READING COMPREHENSION. TABLES AND SCATTER PLOTS ARE INCLUDED.

TWELVE CLASSES, TWO AT EACH OF THE SIX ELEMENTARY GRADE LEVELS, WERE GIVEN TRAINING IN CRITICAL READING WHILE 12 CLASSES WERE INSTRUCTED IN LITERATURE. TEACHER QUESTIONS AND STUDENT RESPONSES WERE THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE STUDY. AN INSTRUMENT WAS DEVISED FOR OBSERVING VERBAL BEHAVIOR. EIGHT CATEGORIES OF TEACHER QUESTIONS WERE INFLUENCED BY BLOOM'S APPROACH, AND FIVE PUPIL CATEGORIES, REPRESENTING LEVELS OF THOUGHT, WERE INFLUENCED BY GUILFORD'S STRUCTURE. TEACHERS WERE INFORMED OF FORTHCOMING CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS WHICH TOTALED SIX IN NUMBER  AND LASTED FOR 25 MINUTES. CHI-SQUARE WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. THE INCLUDED RESULTS INDICATED THAT--(1) THERE IS A DEFINITE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEACHER QUESTIONS AND QUALITY OF PUPIL RESPONSES, (2) TEACHERS IMPROVED IN THEIR ABILITY TO ASK QUESTIONS, (3) TRAINING OF TEACHERS AND SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS INFLUENCED VERBAL BEHAVIOR, (4) LIMITED GRADE LEVEL TRENDS WERE DISCERNABLE IN TEACHERS QUESTIONS, AND (5) DEVELOPMENTAL TRENDS IN PUPIL RESPONSES WERE IDENTIFIABLE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP.

THE TPQI REQUIRES A 30-MINUTE CLASSROOM OBSERVATION DIVIDED INTO ALTERNATING 5-MINUTE PERIODS. EACH QUESTION ASKED BY THE TEACHER OR PUPIL IS CLASSIFIED INTO ONE OF NINE CATEGORIES--MEMORY, INTERPRETATION, TRANSLATION (OR TRANSFORMATION), APPLICATION, ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, EVALUATION, AFFECTIVITY, AND PROCEDURE. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS ASKED MORE &quot;MEMORY&quot; QUESTIONS THAN ALL OTHERS COMBINED. NEXT IN FREQUENCY WERE &quot;INTERPRETATION&quot; AND &quot;TRANSLATION&quot; QUESTIONS. THESE TWO CATEGORIES CAN BE  COMBINED INTO ONE, &quot;COMPREHENSION,&quot; DESCRIBED BY BLOOM (1965) AS THE LOWEST FORM OF INTELLECTUAL ACIVITY. THEREFORE, THE INTELLECTUAL ATMOSPHERE OF THESE CLASSES CAN BEST BE CHARACTERIZED AS MEAGER.

THREE CATEGORIES APPLY TO EACH OF THE FOUR PAIRS OF LOCATIONS ON THESE DIMENSIONS. BEHAVIOR THAT IS BOTH ENCOURAGING AND TEACHER INITIATED SHOWS (1) CONGRUITY BETWEEN VERBAL INTENT AND NONVERBAL REFERENTS, (2) RESPONSIVENESS TO FEEDBACK, AND (3) POSITIVE AFFECTIVITY. AN ENCOURAGING TEACHER RESPONSE IS (1) ATTENTIVE AND LISTENS TO OTHERS, (2) FACILITATIVE BY BEING RECEPTIVE TO OTHERS, AND (3) SUPPORTIVE OF PUPILS OR PUPIL BEHAVIOR. INHIBITING  TEACHER-INITIATED BEHAVIOR SHOWS (1) DISCREPANCY BETWEEN VERBAL INTENT AND NONVERBAL REFERENTS, (2) UNRESPONSIVENESS TO FEEDBACK, AND (3) NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY. INHIBITING RESPONSE BEHAVIOR IS (1) INATTENTIVE TO OTHERS, (2) UNRECEPTIVE TO OTHERS, AND (3) DISAPPROVING OF PUPIL BEHAVIOR.

        "description":"TWO POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DISENGAGEMENT FROM THE POOR BY PRIVATE SOCIAL WORK AGENCIES ARE THE CONCERN THE SOCIAL WORK PROFESSION FOR ITS OWN STATUS, WHICH HAS LED IT TO SEEK A MORE PRESTIGIOUS CLIENTELE, AND THE FEELING THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGY OF SOCIAL WORK IS MORE AMENABLE TO MIDDLE-CLASS THAN TO LOWER-CLASS SOCIALIZATION. ONE \"CONSERVATIVE\" EXPLANATION FOR THE PROBLEMS OF THE POOR IS THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARISE OUT OF PERSONAL RATHER THAN INSTITUTIONAL DEFICIENCIES. THE CONSERVATIVES THUS SAY THAT THE POOR CANNOT BE HELPED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE CAUSES OF THEIR PROBLEMS. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT CONFLICT HAS ARISEN BETWEEN THE AGENCIES AND THE POOR BECAUSE THE POOR SEE THEIR PROBLEMS AS CONCRETE AND WANT DIRECT SERVICE WHEREAS THE  SOLIDLY MIDDLE-CLASS AGENCY IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY ORIENTED AND IS PREPARED ONLY TO TALK, NOT TO PROVIDE PHYSICAL SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS. THE RESULT IS THAT PRIVATE AGENCIES RELIEVE THEMSELVES OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HELPING THE POOR BY REFERRING THEM TO ALREADY OVERBURDENED PUBLIC AGENCIES.

IT WAS FOUND THAT IN GENERAL BASIC PRIORITIES IN THE FAMILY WERE GIVEN TO FOOD, CLOTHING, AND RENT, AND THESE PRIORITIES AFFECTED THE MOTHER'S PERCEPTION OF HER CHILD'S NEEDS. THE MOTHERS SAW THEMSELVES AS DOING MORE FOR THEIR CHILDREN THAN HAD BEEN DONE FOR THEM. MORE SPECIFICALLY, A NUMBER OF PARENTS EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR &quot;SETTING AN EXAMPLE&quot; FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR. PHYSICAL CARE, TEACHING HER CHILDREN PROPER BEHAVIOR, AND THE ABILITY TO DO HOUSEHOLD WORK WERE FELT TO BE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD MOTHER. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD FATHER AND HUSBAND INCLUDED HAVING A JOB, TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY, AND HELPING CARE FOR  THE CHILDREN. MANY PARENTS EXPRESSED THE NEED TO CONTROL THE WHEREABOUTS AND ASSOCIATES OF THEIR CHILDREN TO PROTECT THEM FROM EXTRA-FAMILY INFLUENCES. THREE OUT OF FOUR MOTHERS SAID THAT PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT WAS AN ACCEPTED PRACTICE. CONTRARY TO OTHER REPORTS, THIS OBSERVER FOUND THAT MOTHERS IN ONE-PARENT FAMILIES WOULD PREFER TO BE MARRIED. (JL)",

CONVINCED THAT THE SCHOOL WOULD PROVIDE NEITHER INTEGRATION NOR QUALITY EDUCATION, SOME GHETTO PARENTS SOUGHT &quot;QUALITY SEGREGATED EDUCATION,&quot; BASIC TO WHICH WAS COMMUNITY CONTROL OVER EDUCATIONAL POLICY. JOINT RESPONSIBILITY WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION FOR ALL ASPECTS OF SCHOOL POLICY WOULD, THEY MAINTAINED, GIVE GHETTO PARENTS POWER COMPARABLE TO THAT OF WHITE MIDDLE CLASS PARENTS. SUCH POWER, PROBABLY NOT EXERCISED BY ANY URBAN PARENTS, WOULD NOT JEOPARDIZE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS BECAUSE THE BOARD WOULD RETAIN JOINT AUTHORITY, AND THE PRESSURES OF FUNDING AND ACCREDITATION AGENCIES WOULD PERSIST.  OPPOSED BY NEARLY ALL CITY-WIDE EDUCATIONAL POWER GROUPS, THE DISSIDENTS BECAME A NEIGHBORHOOD PRESSURE GROUP AND PRESSED THEIR DEMAND--UNCONTROVERSIAL PER SE--FOR A BLACK PRINCIPAL AFTER A COMPETENT WHITE PRINCIPAL HAD BEEN APPOINTED. DEFEATED IN AN INITIAL BOYCOTT, THE GROUP SEEMS TO BE GENERALIZING ITS PROTEST TO OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS TO COMPETE WITH THE CITY-WIDE GROUPS WHICH DEFEATED THEM. FRAUGHT WITH DANGERS (CHIEFLY THOSE WHICH WEAKEN THE PRESSURE FOR INTEGRATION), THE STRATEGY OF QUALITY SEGREGATED EDUCATION THROUGH COMMUNITY CONTROL REPRESENTS &quot;ONE SOUND ALTERNATIVE&quot; TO SOME BASIC PROBLEMS IN URBAN EDUCATION.

THE  QUALITY RANKINGS OF THE RESPONDENTS, THEIR SATISFACTION WITH VOCATIONAL EDUCATION, AND THE TYPE OF VARIABLE MOST INFLUENTIAL IN THEIR DECISION TO ENTER VOCATIONAL EDUCATION WERE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP. SIGNIFICANT UNIFORMITY EXISTED WITHIN TEACHER AND STUDENT GROUPS. FOR EACH, THE PREDISPOSING VARIABLE OF SCHOOL ATMOSPHERE WAS MOST IMPORTANT.

ANSWERS WERE SOUGHT FOR TWO QUESTIONS--(1) DO TEACHERS REACT DIFFERENTLY TO BOYS AND GIRLS, AND (2) IF SO, WHAT EFFECT MAY THIS HAVE ON THE INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOYS AND GIRLS CONCERNED. A QUESTIONNAIRE USED TO OBTAIN TEACHERS OPINIONS ON WHETHER THEY BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY WHEN INTERACTING WITH BOYS OR WITH GIRLS REVEALED THAT (1) ABOUT HALF OF THE SAMPLE, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, FELT THEY DID MAKE SOME DIFFERENTIATION AND (2) A MAJORITY DID NOT THINK THEIR TEACHING AIMS DIFFERED FOR BOYS OR GIRLS. THE AUTHORS ALSO PRESENTED FINDINGS FROM A SURVEY OF LITERATURE UNDER THE HEADINGS OF (1)  DIRECT MEASURES OF TEACHER BEHAVIOR WITH RESPECT TO SEX OF CHILD, (2) INDIRECT MEASURES (SUBJECTIVE REPORT, GRADES, SATISFACTION MEASURES), AND (3) TEACHER BEHAVIOR IN RELATION TO SEX OF TEACHER. IN EACH OF THESE AREAS EVIDENCE WAS FOUND SHOWING SEX DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOR. SEX OF CHILD WAS FOUND TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN SEX OF TEACHER IN THE FINDINGS. THIS WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE ASSIGNMENT OF GRADES. GIRLS RECEIVED HIGHER GRADES THAN BOYS, BUT THIS WAS NOT MORE TRUE WHEN A CHILD HAD A MALE TEACHER RATHER THAN A FEMALE. IN PRESENTING THEIR CONCLUSIONS, THE AUTHORS SUGGESTED THAT MAXIMUM INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING MAY BE ACHIEVED BY GIVING GREATER EMPHASIS TO DEVELOPING SENSITIVITY AND RESPONSIVENESS IN BOYS, AND TO TEACHING GIRLS TO BE TOUGHER IN THEIR THINKING AND TO HAVE MORE  CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.

THE AUTHOR PRESENTED A BASIC DISTINCTION BETWEEN RESEARCH ON LEARNING, WHICH HE TERMED AS &quot;THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH A CHANGE OF BEHAVIOR DUE TO EXPERIENCE TAKES PLACE,&quot; AND RESEARCH ON TEACHING WHICH DEALS WITH THE CONDITIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE TEACHER UNDER WHICH LEARNING OCCURS IN THE PUPIL. THE FAILURE OF PAST RESEARCH ON TEACHING TO YIELD SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WAS CITED AS EVIDENCE OF A NEED FOR SOME MORE PRODUCTIVE APPROACH. THE NEW APPROACH DEVELOPED AT STANFORD REPLACES THE  CONCEPT OF A SINGLE CRITERION OF TEACHER-EFFECTIVENESS BY AN ANALYSIS OF THE TEACHING PROCESS INTO TECHNICAL SKILLS, THE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES THAT A TEACHER MAY USE IN THE CLASSROOM. BY THIS APPROACH, THE AUTHOR SAID MORE SATISFACTORY RESEARCH CAN BE DONE ON TEACHER EDUCATION AND TEACHER EFFECTS BY MEASURING INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT VARIABLES AND CONDUCTING TRUE EXPERIMENTS.

THIS COURSE WOULD TRANSCEND THE SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF ANY GIVEN SUBJECT MATTER OR GRADE LEVEL AND SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR DERIVING THE SPECIAL METHODS OF TEACHING THAT WOULD APPLY TO ANY PARTICULAR GRADE LEVEL OR SUBJECT MATTER. UNDERLYING THE DISCUSSION WAS THE PROPOSITION THAT DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS ARE LEARNED BY DIFFERENT BASIC PROCESSES, AND THE CORRESPONDING CONCEPTIONS OF TEACHING MUST DIFFER ACCORDINGLY. THE AUTHOR PROPOSES THAT TEACHING SHOULD BE VIEWED AS THE EXERTION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FORCE. HE ALSO ARGUED THAT THE MAJOR LEARNING THEORIES DESCRIBE THREE KINDS OF FORCE A TEACHER CAN EXERT, THAT IS, TEACHING CAN BE DONE BY (1) CONDITIONING THE LEARNER, (2)  PROVIDING MODELS TO BE IMITATED BY THE LEARNER, AND (3) BY CHANGING THE COGNITIVE STRUCTURE OF THE LEARNER. THE CONCEPT OF TEACHING FORCE WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE FORMULATION OF WARMTH AND COGNITIVE VALIDITY AS DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF TEACHERS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE DEMANDS OF COGNITIVE VALIDITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES CAN BE MET BY PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF TEACHING-LEARNING SITUATIONS.

THE TEST WAS RECOMMENDED AS AN EXTENSION OF PRESENT TEACHER EVALUATION TESTS, BASED ON MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION STANDARDS OF TEACHER QUALIFICATIONS, THAT ARE NOW USED TO MEASURE THE PREPARATION OF TEACHERS BUT NOT THEIR PERFORMANCE.

THE TIME THEY TOOK TO GIVE A VERBAL RESPONSE TO THE WORD AFTER ITS EXPOSURE WAS MEASURED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT CHILDREN ARE HIGHLY CONSISTENT IN THEIR BEHAVIOR ACROSS TRIALS AND BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF WORDS WITHIN TRIALS. YOUNGER CHILDREN TOOK LONGER TO READ REAL WORDS THAN OLDER CHILDREN, LATENCIES DECREASED OVER TRIALS, AND IT TOOK LONGER TO READ PSEUDOWORDS THAN REAL WORDS. WHILE MORE ERRORS WERE MADE IN READING PSEUDOWORDS RATHER THAN REAL WORDS, YOUNGER CHILDREN MADE MORE ERRORS THAN DID OLDER ONES. WHEN FREQUENCY OF ERRORS WAS CONTROLLED, THERE  WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN THE LATENCIES OF REAL AND NONSENSE WORDS READ INCORRECTLY, BUT FOR CORRECT RESPONSES, REAL WORDS WERE READ MORE QUICKLY. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THE USEFULNESS OF RESPONSE LATENCY AS A MEASURE OF READING. (GD)",

TO COMPARE THE RESPONSE LATENCIES AND THE ERRORS MADE WHEN READING THREE INTERMIXED LISTS OF 12 WORDS EACH, THE CHILDREN WERE ASKED TO READ ALOUD EACH WORD AS IT WAS PRESENTED ON THE SCREEN. THE FIRST LIST CONTAINED WORDS BEGINNING WITH &quot;C,&quot;&quot;G,&quot; OR &quot;K&quot; IN SOME OF THEIR LESS COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS. THE SECOND LIST CONTAINED WORDS BEGINNING WITH THE SAME LETTERS, BUT IN THEIR MORE COMMON PRONUNCIATIONS. THE THIRD LIST CONTAINED WORDS DIFFERING FROM THE FIRST LIST ONLY IN HAVING INITIAL LETTERS WITH INVARIANT SPELLING-TO-SOUND CORRESPONDENCES. THE ORAL RESPONSES TO EACH PRESENTED WORD WERE TAPE RECORDED, AND THE  INTERVAL BETWEEN PRESENTATION OF THE WORD ON THE SCREEN AND THE SUBJECTS RESPONSE CONSTITUTED THE VERBAL REACTION TIME. ERRORS WERE ANALYZED FROM A TRANSCRIPT OF THE TAPE. LONGER LATENCIES AND MORE ERRORS WERE FOUND IN USING THE FIRST LIST, BUT NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO LISTS WERE OBSERVED. RESULTS WERE MOST CLEAR-CUT FOR FOURTH GRADERS. ANALYSIS OF THE ERRORS SHOWED THAT MOST OF THE ERRORS MADE ON THE FIRST LIST CONSISTED OF GIVING THE MORE COMMON PRONUNCIATION OF THE FIRST LETTER. THE AUTHOR'S INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS WAS THAT THE CHILDREN RESPONDED TO THE SINGLE PRONUNCIATION PATTERN THEY HAD LEARNED, THE COMMON ONE, AND HAD DIFFICULTY WITH PATTERNS WITH WHICH THEY HAD LITTLE EXPERIENCE.

TEN SUBJECTS FROM GRADES 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, AND ADULTS WERE TESTED WITH FOUR TYPES OF SENTENCES. THE EVS WAS MEASURED AT VARIOUS POINTS BY TURNING OUT THE LIGHT AT SOME POINT IN THE READER'S DELIVERY AND SEEING HOW FAR HE CAN CONTINUE READING WHEN THE PRINT IS NO LONGER VISIBLE. TWO SIMILAR SETS OF SENTENCES WERE PREPARED, ONE USING THE VOCABULARY OF A SECOND  GRADER AND THE OTHER WITH A VOCABULARY OF A SIXTH GRADER. THE SENTENCES WERE CONSTRUCTED WITH PHRASE UNITS OF TWO, THREE, AND FOUR WORDS AND WERE ALL LONG ENOUGH TO PROVIDE AT LEAST 10 WORDS BEYOND A &quot;LIGHT-OUT&quot; EYE POSITION. RESULTS OF THE STUDY SUPPORTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SUBJECTS TEND TO READ IN PHRASE UNITS. OLDER READERS READ TO PHRASE BOUNDARIES MORE OFTEN THAN BEGINNING READERS. FAST OR GOOD READERS READ TO THE END OF PHRASE BOUNDARIES MORE OFTEN THAN THE SLOW OR POOR READERS DID.

THE  ACCEPTANCE OF NEW EDUCATIONAL DEVICES WAS REGARDED BY THE AUTHORS AS AN INSTANCE OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF CHANGE IN OCCUPATIONAL EXPERTISE, AND THE AUTHORS SUGGESTED THAT THE DEFINITION OF EXPERTISE IN THE TEACHING PROFESSION IS DETERMINED WITHIN THE SCHOOL ORGANIZATION RATHER THAN BY THE INDIVIDUAL TEACHER. IN THIS CONNECTION, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE TEACHER DOES NOT PERCEIVE HER ROLE AS SOMEONE WHO SHOULD OR CAN MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT EDUCATIONAL INNOVATIONS. FINDINGS SHOWED THAT MOST TEACHERS SEE ACCEPTANCE OF A SPECIFIC CHANGE AS SOMETHING CONTINGENT CHIEFLY UPON THE RELEVANT POLICIES OF THEIR ADMINISTRATION, AND TEND TO SEE THEIR OWN ROLE PRIMARILY AS THE ACT OF TEACHING, SUBJECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGE.

A TOTAL OF 59 STATISTICAL TESTS OF SIGNIFICANCE WERE CONDUCTED TO COMPARE OUTCOMES FOR EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL STUDENTS ON VARIABLES RELATED TO THE OBJECTIVES OF THE NEW CURRICULUM. OF THE 59 TESTS, 12 YIELDED SIGNIFICANT RESULTS FAVORING THE NEW CURRICULUM. ONLY ONE OF THE ANALYSES, A STUDY OF A PREFERENCE OBJECTIVE, YIELDED A SIGNIFICANT OUTCOME IN FAVOR OF THE CONTROL  CLASSES. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE NEW PROGRAM IS IN MANY WAYS SUPERIOR TO THE PROGRAMS WITH WHICH IT WAS COMPARED. THE WEAKEST COMPONENT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM, JUDGED FROM THE STATISTICAL RESULTS, WAS THE COMPOSITION PROGRAM.

ACROSS-GROUP MATCHINGS WERE MADE, AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, ON ESTABLISHED ABILITY LEVELS, DISTANCES OF  RESIDENCE FROM COLLEGE, MAJOR CURRICULUM GROUPINGS, AND SEX. A SPECIAL QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED TO GATHER DATA ON SUCH MATTERS AS ATTENDANCE AT CULTURAL EVENTS, EDUCATIONAL GOALS, MEMBERSHIP AND PARTICIPATION IN STUDENT GROUPS AND ACTIVITIES, FRIENDSHIP AND DATING PATTERNS, HOURS OF WORK, INCOME, AND EXPENDITURES. DATA ON GRADES AND CREDITS WERE GATHERED FROM COLLEGE RECORDS. THE FINDINGS SHOWED SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE COMMUTING FRESHMEN, PARTICULARLY IF HE ATTENDS A LARGE RESIDENT INSTITUTION, MAY BE SLOW IN HIS SOCIAL CONTACT WITH OTHER STUDENTS. A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE COMMUTERS EXPRESSED NO DISAPPOINTMENT IN COLLEGE, MAKING NO COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS WHEN INVITED TO DO SO.

THUS, A CHILD LEARNS TO SPEAK BY DEVELOPING HIS OWN THEORIES OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS LANGUAGE. STUDIES OF RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH CHILD LANGUAGE ACQUISITION SHOW THAT THE PROCESS OF MAKING THESE RULES IS QUITE SIMILAR, IN SPITE OF THE IMPORTANT STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO LANGUAGES. IN BOTH LANGUAGES, FOR EXAMPLE, THE UNMARKED FORMS OF LEXICAL ITEMS ARE LEARNED FIRST, SIMPLE SENTENCES NEXT, AND MORPHOLOGY LAST. BOTH RUSSIAN AND ENGLISH CHILDREN LEARN THIS WAY, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT WORD ORDER IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN INFLECTION IN  RUSSIAN. IT WOULD SEEM THEN THAT EVERY CHILD'S BUILT-IN &quot;LANGUAGE ACQUISITION DEVICE&quot; FAVORS BEGINNING LANGUAGE WITH ORDERED UNMARKED CLASSES, REGARDLESS OF THE DEGREE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF SUCH A SYSTEM WITH THE INPUT LANGUAGE. SIMILAR PATTERNS OF GENERALIZATION, OVERGENERALIZATION, AND LEARNING OF GRAMMATICAL DISTINCTIONS CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN ENGLISH AND RUSSIAN LANGUAGE ACQUISITION. THESE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT A GREAT DEAL MAY BE LEARNED ABOUT GENERAL CHILD LANGUAGE ACQUISITION THROUGH COMPARING RESULTS OF STUDIES DONE IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGE FAMILIES.

        "description":"A LINGUISTIC FIELD SURVEY OF THE ENGLISH SPOKEN IN THE CULTURAL-GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF APPALACHIA SHOWS THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO MAJOR NONSTANDARD DIALECTS IN CURRENT USE. THE DIALECT FAMILY MOST COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPALACHIAN REGION IS MOUNTAIN SPEECH. ALTHOUGH WELL STRUCTURED AND EXPRESSIVE IN ITS OWN RIGHT, IT HAS COME TO BE CONSIDERED INFERIOR, UNGRAMMATICAL, AND OF LOW SOCIAL STATURE. THE NEGRO DIALECT SPOKEN IN APPALACHIA HAS EVEN LESS SOCIAL STATUS AND IS OFTEN MISTAKENLY IDENTIFIED WITH MOUNTAIN SPEECH. PROGRAMS FOR TEACHING STANDARD ENGLISH IN THIS AREA SHOULD BE BASED ON A UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH ETHNIC AND CULTURAL GROUPS USE THESE DIALECTS, HOW EACH OF THE DIALECTS CONTRASTS WITH STANDARD ENGLISH, AND THE SPECIAL LINGUISTIC TECHNIQUES WHICH HAVE BEEN  DEVELOPED FOR TEACHING STANDARD ENGLISH TO SPEAKERS OF NONSTANDARD DIALECTS. THE AUTHOR BRIEFLY OUTLINES A WIDE RANGE OF RESEARCH, MATERIALS, AND ACTION PROGRAMS WHICH COULD BE UNDERTAKEN BY THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL LABORATORY TO IMPROVE LANGUAGE TEACHING. HE ALSO APPENDS A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ARTICLES, BOOKS, AND PAMPHLETS CONCERNED WITH LANGUAGE AND LANGUAGE-RELATED SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN APPALACHIA.

THE PROJECT USED EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS COMPARING TWO SYSTEMS OF INSTRUCTION--(1) THE ASSIGNMENT AND CORRECTION OF COMPOSITIONS, AND (2) A STRUCTURED SYSTEM OF STAGE-BY-STAGE INSTRUCTION IN A PREDETERMINED PLAN. A SECONDARY AIM WAS TO NOTE IF THE SYSTEMATIZED TEACHING OF COMPOSITION SKILLS WOULD LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN GENERAL LINGUISTIC ACHIEVEMENT. STAGE A OF THE PROJECT CONSISTED OF ADMINISTERING STRUCTURED EXERCISES ON THE PARAGRAPH--ORGANIZATION, CONTENT, AND KEY SENTENCES. STAGE B WAS CONCERNED WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF LINGUISTIC FAILURES DETECTED FROM STUDENT COMPOSITIONS PREPARED DURING STAGE A.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE-TYPE QUESTIONS REQUIRED TWO TYPES OF ANSWERS--THE VARIOUS COUNSELOR CHARACTERISTICS CONSIDERED OR REQUIRED IN EVALUATIONS AND HOW IMPORTANT SUCH CHARACTERISTICS WERE THOUGHT TO BE. NINETY-SEVEN PERCENT OF THE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE RETURNED. FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THE GENERAL EVALUATION PRACTICES OF THESE AGENCIES USUALLY FOLLOWED STANDARD PERSONNEL PRACTICES, EXCEPT THAT ALMOST HALF OF THE AGENCIES LACK A STANDARD COUNSELOR EVALUATION FORM. THE 29 COUNSELOR CHARACTERISTICS WHICH WERE RATED ON IMPORTANCE, REQUIREDNESS, AND METHOD OF ASSESSMENT  WERE CLUSTERED INTO THREE CATEGORIES--PERSONAL, PERFORMANCE, AND ABILITY-KNOWLEDGE. OF THE THREE CLASSES, ABILITY-KNOWLEDGE QUALITIES ARE MORE OFTEN REQUIRED BY ALL TYPES AND SIZES OF AGENCIES. TWO APPROACHES TO MEASURING THE CONGRUENCE BETWEEN REQUIREDNESS AND IMPORTANCE OF COUNSELOR CHARACTERISTICS FOR LARGE, MEDIUM, AND SMALL AGENCIES SUGGEST THAT MEDIUM-SIZED AGENCIES ARE LESS CONGRUENT THAN OTHERS.

HIGHLY RATIONALIZED MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES, CYBERNATION, SOCIAL ENGINEERING, AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING CAN POTENTIALLY AFFECT THIS PLANNING. SOCIAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS INTERACTING WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES WILL INFLUENCE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF WORK, LEISURE, EDUCATION, VALUES, AND DECISION MAKING. VALUES AND BEHAVIOR THAT EMPHASIZE COMMITMENT TO TASK, FLEXIBILITY IN LEARNING, AND EFFECTIVE USE OF INCREASED LEISURE MUST BE LEARNED IN CHILDHOOD AND MODIFIED THROUGHOUT LIFE. DEALING WITH SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND UTILIZING THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH TECHNOLOGIES AND SOCIAL GROWTH AFFORD WILL REQUIRE THAT PRIORITIES BE ASSIGNED, AND THAT MORE EFFECTIVE CRITERIA  FOR CHOICE BE DEVELOPED. THE INCREASING OLDER POPULATION WILL EXERT POLITICAL PRESSURES TO PROTECT IT AGAINST MATERIAL, IDEOLOGICAL, AND EMOTIONAL DISPOSSESSION. BELIEF IN MAN AS BEING UNIQUE IN HIMSELF AND IN HIS RELATION TO THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE WILL BE INCREASINGLY CHALLENGED IN MANY OF THE INFLUENTIAL AND POLICY-PLANNING LEVELS OF SOCIETY. THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL HAVE TO LEARN IS HOW TO CHANGE RAPIDLY AND FREQUENTLY.

THE MEASURES OF SOCIAL MATURITY OF THE ADOLESCENT HAVE BEEN LARGELY BASED UPON THE MIDDLE-CLASS, WHITE, AMERICAN POPULATION WITH LITTLE EMPHASIS UPON CONTRASTS BETWEEN URBAN, RURAL, AND SMALL-TOWN ADOLESCENTS BY SOCIAL CLASSES. THE METHODS OF STUDYING ADOLESCENCE HAVE BEEN RATING TECHNIQUES (INVENTORIES, QUESTIONNAIRES, AND SCALES), SELF-REPORTING TECHNIQUES, ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDIES, CLINICAL STUDIES, AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS. BEFORE THIS AREA OF ADOLESCENT SOCIAL MATURITY CAN BE  FURTHER EXPLORED, WE MUST KNOW MORE ABOUT ADOLESCENT SOCIAL BEHAVIOR, INTERESTS, PROBLEMS, AND DEVELOPMENTS.

MOST EFFORTS AT CENTRALIZED PLANNING ARE PREDICATED ON TWO CONCEPTS--MANPOWER NEEDS AND PROJECTING CURRENT TRENDS. THE CONCEPT OF MANPOWER NEEDS IS THE MORE LOGICAL, BUT IS ALSO MORE DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT. PLANNING IS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH PREDICTION, AND THERE ARE LIMITATIONS AND FALLACIES IN CURRENT PLANNING METHODS. THREE MAJOR ISSUES IN PLANNING EMERGE--(1) CERTAIN GOALS AND OBJECTIVES IN PLANNING MAY CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER, (2) THERE MAY BE A FAILURE TO DISTINGUISH THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF PLANNING NEEDED, AND (3) UNDERSTANDING OF CHANGE AS A PROCESS MAY BE LACKING. FOUR CRITERIA FOR ESTABLISHING PLANNING PRIORITIES ARE DISCUSSED--(1) POPULATION, (2) IMITATION OF  ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF OTHER STATES, (3) CRITERION OF COMPLEMENTARITY, AND (4) COST OF INSTITUTIONS AND PROGRAMS AND PRESSURE POLITICS. SEVEN GUIDELINES FOR IMPROVED EDUCATIONAL PLANNING ARE PRESENTED--(1) USE OF SPECIALIZED PROFESSIONAL PLANNERS, (2) DIFFERENTIATION OF PLANNING AND ADMINISTERING, (3) CAUTIOUS USE OF POPULATION TRENDS, (4) PROVISION OF AN ADEQUATE PLANNING STAFF WITH A CLEARLY DELINEATED ROLE, (5) DISTINCTION BETWEEN SPECIAL AND LONG-RANGE PLANNING, (6) CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN PLANNING FOR A STATE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND FOR INSTITUTIONAL GROWTH, AND (7) PLANNING AS A FORM OF LEADERSHIP.

THE BEST ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM OF INSTRUCTIONAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS NEEDED FOR CAI PROGRAMS IS COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE DATA. TRAINING EDUCATORS, USING COMPUTER SPECIALISTS, AND DEVELOPING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS FOR COMPUTERS ARE MEANS OF HELPING EDUCATORS TO WORK WITH COMPUTERS. COSTS MAY BE REDUCED BY USING NEWER AND LESS EXPENSIVE COMPUTERS, BY PURCHASING LESS EXPENSIVE INPUT-OUTPUT UNITS, AND BY USING TIME-SHARING AND LESS EXPENSIVE TRANSMISSION FACILITIES. INTEGRATION OF CAI PROGRAMS INTO OTHER SCHOOL FUNCTIONS IS AIDED BY PREPLANNING AND THE INCLUSION OF DATA  PROCESSING INTO THE COMPUTER PROGRAM. GRADUAL PROGRAM BUILDUP, ADEQUATE STAFF TRAINING, AND SELF-EVIDENT RESULTS CAN OVERCOME THE PROBLEM OF GAINING SCHOOL STAFF ACCEPTANCE OF A COMPUTER PROGRAM.

AFTER CONSIDERING THESE FACTORS, THE EVALUATION RESEARCHER CAN INTRODUCE, FOR EXAMPLE, TWO DIFFERENT  MATHEMATICS CURRICULUMS INTO SEVERAL SCHOOLS AT RANDOM. ANALYSIS CAN THEN BE MADE BETWEEN THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES (INSTRUCTIONAL AND CONTEXTUAL) AND THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES (THE EFFECTS OF INSTRUCTION).

RESPONSES FROM 167 SMALL TOWN AND RURAL TEACHERS WERE COMPARED WITH RESPONSES FROM 151 MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATION (AERA). QUESTIONNAIRE ITEMS REFERRED TO METHODS OF SAMPLING AND DATA GATHERING, RELIABILITY, VALIDITY, AND DATA ANALYSIS. AERA MEMBERS WERE MORE INCLINED TO INDICATE THAT THERE WAS &quot;INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION&quot; UPON  WHICH TO BASE A RESPONSE. TEACHERS WERE MORE INCLINED NOT TO RESPOND TO CERTAIN ITEMS. ON ALL QUESTIONS THERE WAS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF EDUCATORS RESPONDING &quot;DO NOT UNDERSTAND.&quot; CHI SQUARE FINDINGS FOR THE 41 QUESTIONNAIRE ITEMS INDICATED THAT THERE WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EDUCATORS AND RESEARCHERS IN ATTITUDES TOWARD AND COMPREHENSION OF VARIOUS RESEARCH PROCEDURES AND TERMINOLOGY.

A SURVEY OF 533  TEACHERS INDICATED THAT (1) THE MAJORITY OF TEAMS WORK WITH PUPILS AT A SINGLE GRADE LEVEL, USUALLY ELEMENTARY, (2) TEACHER SPECIALIZATION IN TEACHING AND PREPARATION OF CURRICULAR MATERIALS IS THE USUAL PATTERN, AND (3) THE MORE PREDOMINANT STRUCTURE HAS NO OFFICIAL LEADER OR LITTLE OR NO ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY. PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS SURVEYED REPORTED THAT THE TEACHER CHARACTERISTICS NEEDED FOR TEAM TEACHING ARE FLEXIBILITY, ABILITY TO COOPERATE AND WORK EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER ADULTS, ORGANIZATIONAL SKILL, CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS, AND ABILITY TO ACCEPT CONVENTIONAL CRITICISM.

LIMITATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY WERE DISCUSSED, AND SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH WERE OFFERED. A MAJOR FINDING WAS THAT SELECTION METHODS IN MOST SCHOOL SYSTEMS FOCUS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE OVERT, PERIPHERAL ASPECTS OF THEIR TEACHER CANDIDATES, AND NOT ON COVERT, DYNAMIC PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS. IT APPEARED,  THEREFORE, THAT MOST SELECTION PROCEDURES ARE DETERMINED BY WHAT IS EASILY OBTAINED RATHER THAN ON WHAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT TO ASSESS, INCLUDING THE MENTAL HEALTH OF PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS.

THE RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF TRIAL INTERVIEWS IN PART ONE DID NOT  WARRANT ANALYSIS NOR GENERALIZATION, BUT THERE WERE SOME VISIBLE IMPLICATIONS. IT SEEMS POSSIBLE THAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AVAILABLE SAMPLES OF PERSISTERS AND NONPERSISTERS WILL NOT BE FOUND BECAUSE MOST NONPERSISTERS PLANNED TO RETURN TO TEACHING WHEN THEIR CHILDREN WERE OLDER. NEVERTHELESS, FUTURE INTERVIEWS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE HOLDING POWER OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION. (GD)",

FOURTEEN TEACHERS COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGNED TO DISTINGUISH TWO BASIC KINDS OF BEGINNING READING INSTRUCTION EMPHASIS--(1) &quot;DECODING&quot; (ORAL READING AND SOUND-SYMBOL) OR (2) &quot;MEANING&quot; (SILENT READING AND INTERPRETATION). EQUAL NUMBERS OF MEANING AND SOUND-SYMBOL EMPHASIS TEACHERS WERE REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE, AS WELL AS EXPERIENCED AND INEXPERIENCED TEACHERS WITHIN EACH EMPHASIS. THEIR ACTIVITIES WERE THEN STUDIED IN 12 CLASSES FOR ONE SCHOOL YEAR, FOLLOWING THE READING PROGRAMS EACH HAD USED PREVIOUSLY. PRINCIPAL DATA WERE  COLLECTED FROM RATINGS OF TEACHER CHARACTERISTICS AND PRACTICES IN THE CLASSROOM AND FROM BATTERIES OF READINESS AND ACHIEVEMENT TESTS GIVEN TO PUPILS AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. THE STUDY SUPPORTED IN A PRELIMINARY WAY (BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED SAMPLE AND AMOUNT OF ANALYSIS) THE OBSERVATION THAT TEACHER CHARACTERISTICS AND THE WAYS IN WHICH TEACHERS IMPLEMENT A GIVEN METHOD DO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE READING ACHIEVEMENT OF THEIR PUPILS. THERE WAS ALSO SOME EVIDENCE THAT A THINKING APPROACH TO LEARNING, A SOUND-SYMBOL EMPHASIS WITHIN A BASAL READER APPROACH, THE USE OF THE APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY LEVEL OF LESSONS RELATE POSITIVELY TO READING ACHIEVEMENT.

THE TWO APPROACHES STUDIED WERE MONOLINGUAL AND BILINGUAL. THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE MONOLINGUAL APPROACH SUGGESTS THAT IT IS MORE EFFICIENT TO TEACH IN THE NATIONAL LANGUAGE. THE BILINGUAL HYPOTHESIS SUGGESTS IT IS MORE EFFICIENT TO TEACH STUDENTS USING A PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED LANGUAGE. THESE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED ON AN INDIAN POPULATION IN THE CHIAPAS MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWESTERN MEXICO. OPPORTUNITIES ARE AFFORDED TO OBSERVE AND STUDY THE MONOLINGUAL APPROACH IN LOCAL FEDERAL AND STATE SCHOOLS WHICH TEACH IN SPANISH AND THE NATIONAL INDIAN INSTITUTE SCHOOLS WHICH TEACH IN TRIBAL LANGUAGES TZOTZIL AND TZELTAL PRIOR TO TEACHING IN SPANISH. INSTRUCTIONAL  MATERIALS, CONTENT, AND TESTS VALIDATED FOR THE GROUPS STUDIED WERE PREPARED, PRESENTED, AND EVALUATED. IT WAS FOUND THAT STUDENTS TAUGHT WITH THE BILINGUAL APPROACH SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON THE SPANISH READING COMPREHENSION TEST. FURTHERMORE THE PERCENTAGE OF PUPILS DESIGNATED AS LITERATE IN SPANISH BY THEIR TEACHERS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOR THE BILINGUAL STUDIES. THE HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF LITERACY AND THE HIGHER LEVELS OF READING COMPREHENSION POINT TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE BILINGUAL APPROACH. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE THEORY THAT MEANING IS ESSENTIAL TO READING COMPREHENSION. THE FINDINGS WERE CONCLUDED TO BE SPECIFICALLY RELEVANT FOR THE GROUPS STUDIED WITH POSSIBLE APPLICATION FOR THE BILINGUAL APPROACH IN OTHER LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENTS. CAUSAL FACTORS  CONTRIBUTING TO THE STUDY RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH. (WN)",

Achnowledging Mexico's rich, unexhausted, and unexplored natural resources, Mexico is described as a poverty-stricken, hungry nation, with high degrees of malnutrition, deprivation, and illiteracy heavily concentrated in rural areas. Present forms of land tenure (which result from social and technological struggles and developments of the past four decades) are explained. Influence of the government on rural evolution and resultant social attitudes is detailed. Emphasizing the precarious condition of approximately 30 million rural &quot;campesinos&quot; (the peasant class), the narrative discusses the developing conflict between capitalistic expansion  initiated by the Mexican government and the desires of the campesinos for their economic liberty. Advantages and disadvantages are weighed for potential options afforded the two groups in settling this dilemma of land ownership and development. It is noted that some resolution of this conflict is deemed necessary if Mexico is to provide solutions to present rural problems. (JD)",

These concerns were: landownership, control and tenancy; barriers to entering and leaving farming; production efficiency, size of farms, and the role of technology; Government programs; tax and credit policies; the farm input-supply system; the farm product-marketing system; present and future energy supplies; environmental concerns, including conservation and use of soil and water; returns to farmers; costs to consumers; and the quality of life in rural areas. Prior to the meetings, participants were given an explanation and discussion paper on the above concerns.  At the meetings, Secretary Bergland focused the dialogue between himself, the panelists, and other speakers through a set of questions that drew on his personal concerns and his responsibilities as Secretary. The summaries included in this document reflect the issues, personal concerns, values, and beliefs presented by the public at each meeting. Separate sections are included on 2,500 mailed comments.

First, youth employment problems and opportunities are unevenly distributed. Without a bold new initiative, the 1980's are likely to exacerbate these inequities. Second, many of our young people may not have the basic reading, writing and arithmetical skills necessary to get and hold a decent job. Third, employers use resumes to sort out applicants and most young people have no resumes/work experience. Basic skills development must be combined with work opportunity development. Fourth, federal employment and training programs must be made simpler and more flexible with less  red tape. Fifth, young people need reliable job information and support and assistance from community networks during the transition from school to work. Sixth, community-based and voluntary organizations are particularly well suited to working with those groups of youth who have serious employment problems and are considered to be hard to serve. Seventh, a partnership of businesses, schools, labor unions, community-based organizations, and government is needed to serve our young people. These seven key findings are explored in depth, form the basis of seven recommendations, and are embodied in the Carter Administration's Youth Employment Legislation. (Author/AN)",

Facts emerging from the classification and processing of materials are: the information is diverse and primarily descriptive, publishing dates are mostly between 1970 and 1972, very few studies are based on objective research, and few studies deal with migrants from specific ethnic groups. However, this review does provide a profile of  migrant life and a summary of educational programs that have been described to date. Reviewed in depth are the following categories: background characteristics of migrant culture, characteristics of migrant children as related to educational programs and achievement levels, general descriptions of education and noneducation migrant programs, characteristics of Elementary Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title I migrant programs, and evaluations of the Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS).

Twelve papers presented by activists and researchers at the conference dealt with: the lack of political involvement of Hispanic women; Hispanic women in education in New York and Chicago; Puerto Rican women in higher education; impediments to organizing Hispanic women; the cult of virginity; guidance and counseling of Hispanic girls; an overview of La Chicana and Chicana identity; relevant social issues; approaches to education for the Hispanic woman; and the Hispanic  woman's marginal status. Participants identified four major issues: the lack of accurate research on Hispanic women; the identification of barriers to organizing Hispanic women; the identification of factors contributing to heavy employment of Hispanic women in low level positions; and the impact of existing equal rights legislation on Hispanic women. Participants came to the conference from varied Hispanic backgrounds but achieved a unity independent of geographical differences which was reflected in a philosophical statement of purpose and in a series of detailed recommendations regarding policy and research.

        "description":"Twenty-one American Indian women, selected from state and federal government agencies, professional and research organizations, and academic institutions, began by discussing 10 background papers (presented here in revised form) dealing with: the employment and educational status of American Indian women; the interaction of sex roles and culture in schools; the impact of boarding schools; the effect of tribal-to-urban transition; health problems and the role of American Indian women in health care; foster care and adoption of American Indian children; organizing American Indian women; and factors involved in determining educational needs. Three main issues evolved from the discussions: the lack of accurate research information on American Indian women; the impact of the  federal-Indian relationship on the socialization, education, and occupational choices of American Indian women; and the need for more realistic assessment of the educational and occupational needs of American Indian women and of programs to address those needs. Participants reached consensus on 21 recommendations regarding: research topics and methodology; educational policy, programs, and finance; federal hiring practices; and strengthening family structure. Many of these recommendations, still current after four years, are beyond the scope of the National Institute of Education, hence the publication of the proceedings for wider distribution. (SB)",

Migrant students need to experience acceptance and success. They need a good language foundation as the basis for reading and for all academic learning. They also need parent backing for attendance and achievement. Priorities for migrant education programs need to be (1) physical growth and development; (2) language development and reading; and (3) development of mathematics skills. This fastback discusses migrancy as a way of life; the plight of the illegal  migrant, federal legislative directions, goals in migrant education, identification and recruitment of the migrant child, emotional growth and school success, and infant and early childhood education programs. Additionally it offers suggested teacher behaviors and classroom experiences that may be helpful in meeting the needs and developing the skills of migrant children, and lists readers and reading kits which have been used with good results in migrant classrooms.

The background and setting of the substate regional movement is traced, from its inception in 1954 when federal aid for regional planning began, through present federal programs in the fields of economic development, employment, health, law enforcement, and transportation. The role of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, one of the federal agencies supporting multicounty substate regional activities, is described, and its leadership in promoting regional solutions to problems of rural development and natural resources  conservation is acknowledged. Differences in problems and functional focuses of regional councils in nonmetropolitan areas (from those in urban regions) are discussed. Thirty-nine federal programs which supported substate regional activities during 1977-1979 are described, including both the &quot;generalist&quot;, multipurpose areawide units and the multicounty single-purpose areawide units.

The first chapter describes several successful ways in which CETA funds have been used to support reservation economic development. The second chapter provides a comprehensive account of two excellent examples of CETA participation in economic development, the activities of the Moapa Band of Southern Paiutes of Nevada  and their CETA consortium grantee (the Intertribal Council of Nevada) and the activities of the Manpower Division of the Tlingit-Haida Community Council. Chapter three focuses on suggestions to meet the challenges of the 1980's, e.g. hire a planner, institute a planning process, coordinate and cooperate with other tribal departments, become better informed, form a private industry council to compete for Title VII funds, and involve the community.

Between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas there were considerable variations in outlays to programs in seven functional areas. Non-metropolitan areas received $195 more per capita for agriculture, energy, and the environment; $42 more for targeted economic development; and $20 more for tansfer payments. Metropolitan areas received $300 more per capita for defense and space programs; $90 more for human resources; $29 more for physical investments; and $66 more for other federal functions. Overall, metropolitan areas received an average of $2,007 per  capita, 9% more than the $1,845 per capita for non-metropolitan areas. The 20% of the U.S. population living in counties with the lowest outlays received only 11% of federal funds while the 20% living in counties with the highest outlays received 37%. Within metropolitan areas, core counties often received higher per capita outlays than did fringe counties. Within non-metropolitan areas, very rural counties received substantially higher outlays than other counties. Southern and Western non-metropolitan areas received more outlays for most functions but Northeastern non-metropolitan areas received less per capita than metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas in other regions.

Also included is an examination of the problems caused by the failure to plan and integrate development resources, especially CETA, and of the benefits to be gained when tribes set up some type of planning system. The experiences of three exemplary planning efforts (by the Spokane tribes, Fort Peck tribes, and Pima and Maricopa tribes), ranging from the simple to the more complex, are presented together with some suggested approaches to planning and resource coordination. The suggestions presented on how to  improve the use of CETA to support tribal economic development focus on two types of activities: developing a CETA planning capacity and creating linkages between CETA and other economic development bodies, both on and off-reservation. It is emphasized that these suggestions must start with a commitment to planning and its coordination. The information presented should prove useful to reservation consortium planners, CETA staff, and tribal administrators interested in a better use of their development resources. (AN)",

They felt there was a need to evaluate children's progress in mathematics in order to diagnose the causes of individual failures, and they discovered there was no readily available information on either what or how to test. A committee was appointed to investigate and rectify the situation. Goals selected were a massive list of learning objectives, and approximately five test items per objective were constructed. This document consists of instructions and information on testing, selected notes and comments, the tests, an appendix on trialling, and sample student response sheet forms, the product of several years of work. The tests  are devised for administering to individual elementary school pupils in grades K-4 with the object of observing the responses of those pupils. The tests are set out in continuous form without age or grade labels, and are organized within three broad categories of number, shape, and measurement. (MP)",

        "description":"This study investigated the relationships between Piagetian logical reasoning abilities with an information processing capacity, and first-grade children's performance on verbal addition and subtraction problems. An analysis of simple arithmetic problems indicated that several reasoning abilities identified by Piaget are needed to achieve operational understanding of addition and subtraction. The abilities studied were number conservation, class inclusion, and transitive inference. The arithmetic problems used were varied systematically in semantic structure, number size, and the availability of objects to aid the solution process. Statistically significant differences between the developmental groups were found for some of the cognitive variables on some problem types. However,  no clear pattern emerged to suggest that a particular cognitive ability was especially important for solving a specific problem type or using a specific solution strategy. None of the cognitive abilities was absolutely required to solve any of the problem types or to use a given strategy. The report indicates that the use of these studied cognitive tasks as readiness variables for arithmetic instruction should be questioned. The study also suggests that mathematics problem solving ability may need to be reassessed for each instructional topic. (MP)",

With the aid of an infrared camera system, researchers documented heat losses that were not evident to the naked eye. Each infrared thermogram obtained showed one or more types of heat loss and identified the specific sections of the building where the problems occurred. Results demonstrated thermographic inspection to be an effective analytical technique for appraising a building's thermal efficiency. These analyses of heat loss, together with concurrent studies of the facility's heating system and roof moisture, are presented in this report and form the basis for energy conservation recommendations. Offered are low, moderate, and high cost options for reducing heating costs.  (Author/WB)",

The seven hypotheses investigated related to determinants of leisure behavior, attitudinal consequences of this behavior, and the relationships among group membership, attitudes, and pro-environmental behavior. These hypotheses were tested using data from two samples of students from a large state university: (1) members of a class in social problems, and (2) members of the hiking division of an outdoor recreation club. Likert scales were employed to measure two attitudinal and two behavioral variables. Correlational analyses showed that membership in a scouting organization and parental education level are significant predictors of leisure  behavior. In addition, appreciative leisure behavior was associated with nature appreciation, and nature appreciation was associated with environmental concern. Membership in the recreation club correlated with both nature appreciation and environmental concern. Regression analysis revealed that of nine independent variables, only environmental concern and appreciative leisure participation were significant predictors of pro-environmental behavior.

        "description":"Results of a study of a fifth grade social studies curriculum &quot;Man: A Course of Study&quot; (MACOS) are reported. MACOS is a process oriented curriculum which emphasizes the development of highly generalizable thinking and feeling skills. The sample consisted of 242 classrooms randomly selected across the United States. MACOS was compared with another process curriculum &quot;House of Ancient Greece&quot; (HOAG) and with conventional social studies curricula. Teachers were measured according to their value positions with respect to traditional or process-oriented approaches, attitudes concerning human relations, functional approach to pupil control in the classroom, and knowledge and application of process education methodology. Student measurements included involvement in process education  learning patterns, activities, and roles; degree of expressional fluency; and degree of enthusiasm and positive regard for social studies. Results indicate that students in MACOS classrooms adopt more active and self-directed learning roles, exhibit more positive attitudes about social studies, and are more fluent and enthusiastic about social studies than children in conventional classrooms. Teachers in MACOS classrooms adopt more facilitative roles which support inquiry behavior and encourage greater intrinsic motivation on the part of students. The conclusion is that MACOS and HOAG, which also tested out favorably, can do much to show teachers, pupils, parents, and communities how to carry out quality instruction. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"This monograph describes the experience of Israeli curriculum developers as they wrote textbooks of regional geography for the primary and junior high school levels. There are three parts to the paper. Part I discusses the reform of the geography curriculum in Israeli schools in the 1960s. The new curriculum emphasized three areas: geography of Israel; world regional geography; and systematic geography. The content of regional geography was seen as the most important with roughly one-half of the total instructional hours available allocated to it. Part II of the paper deals with considerations in writing textbooks for regional geography. Any given region may be approached from one of a number of viewpoints. For example, one may approach a region through an analysis of a number of  major problems or through an analysis of its central area as compared with its margin. The content of the text can also be achieved through a variety of techniques. For example, one text might consist of reading matter and a second of exercises. The third part of the paper describes how the Israeli team wrote one book dealing with the regional geography of West Africa taking into consideration all the issues described above. The major lessons drawn from their experience are: 1) in order to cover a large number of topics rather than the in depth study of one topic, one must be able to prioritize; 2) the most important material--in this case principles of systematic and regional geography--should be introduced into the text in a hidden manner; and 3) the best format is a text constructed of  a combination of reading material, illustrative matter, and exercises with each supporting the other.

The Harvard Report &quot;General Education in a Free Society,&quot; 1945, tried to restore the liberal arts in a time of egalitarian vocationalism. &quot;The Process of Education (Bruner, 1960) urged the restoration of math, biology, and physics, ostensibly for the majority but in practice for the gifted. &quot;Equality of Educational Opportunity&quot; (Coleman, 1966) was the nation's 10-year report on school desegregation. &quot;The Irony of Early School Reform&quot; (Katz, 1968) was the first of several radical revisionist interpretations of U.S. educational history. &quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot; (Skinner, 1971) justified  manipulation and control of U.S. schools and society.

        "description":"The paper examines the extent to which national identification changed among 91 Americans who immigrated to Australia from 1974 to 1978. The objective was to gain a deeper understanding of the bonds between individuals and nations by examining the decisions and decision processes of people who had actually been confronted with and taken advantage of a viable alternative to their native American citizenship. Survey data were gathered for 290 American migrants. Of these, 91 (all adults who had migrated and adopted Australian citizenship between 1974 and 1978) were selected for further analysis. A major area of investigation centered around reasons for the citizenship change. Responses given most frequently were a desire to participate in the Australian political process and a  chance for career advancement. Findings indicated that people who changed citizenship because of career advancement reasons were more likely to express conflicts and regrets concerning their citizenship decisions than were people who changed for political obligation reasons and that those who had had a longer time to reconcile their new legal citizenship status with prior national identification expressed less inner conflict over their decisions. The conclusions are that because national identification is such a deep-seated part of individual self-concept, changes in citizenship are difficult and costly for many people, earlier values and attitudes are likely to intrude in the form of continuing conflict and regret, and some people are unable to change their subjective national  self-identification to the country to which they perceive they owe their political obligation.

        "author":["Walters, Pamela Barnhouse"],
        "description":"This paper reviews major theories related to the role of education in economic development and presents results of several empirical cross-national studies that have analyzed this relationship. Most research on the role of education in developing nations has concluded that modernization of national educational systems will facilitate national economic growth, although recommendations diverge concerning whether the modernization should be based on a western model or a nationalistic model. As an alternative to these schools of thought, this research offers an interpretation of the role of education and development based on dependency theory. Dependency theory maintains that because all aspects of society in developing nations are influenced by economic dependence on industrialized  nations, modernization in one sector such as education will not necessarily facilitate national economic growth. Dependency theorists argue that the failure of developing nations to modernize is due to dependency ties to developed nations and to an economic base that is insufficient to support the modernization which has been grafted onto it. A series of empirical cross-national longitudinal analyses of the relationship between educational and economic expansion was performed to test this dependency theory interpretation. The specific focus of the studies was the impact of educational enrollment levels at primary and secondary school levels in 1955 and economic development for 1955 to 1970. Findings indicated that educational expansion did not seem to facilitate national economic growth  during this time period. The conclusion is that the dependency theory interpretation comes closer to explaining the relationship between education and economic development than either a western or a nationalistic development perspective.

The conference was one in a series of international meetings (14 have been held to date) to consider how to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations during the 1980s. The objective of the report was to stimulate study, research, and education with respect to the role of the United Nations in achieving international peace and prosperity. Participants included diplomats, scholars, and energy experts from 17 nations. Conference deliberations focused on petroleum resources, price, and supply; electrical power generation; new and renewable sources of energy; conservation; national energy planning; and the role of  the United Nations with regard to energy management. While there were differences in how participants viewed the nature and seriousness of the energy situation, there was broad consensus on many issues including that the era of cheap energy has ended, people must make a transition from petroleum to renewable energy sources, energy conservation is essential, major capital investment is essential to deal with the energy problem and to develop energy sources, and the role of the UN system should be to assist national governments and private sector organizations in planning for and implementing solutions to the energy problem.

        "description":"This study guide on military history is intended for use with the young officer just entering upon a military career. There are four major sections to the guide. Part one discusses the scope and value of military history, presents a perspective on military history, and examines essentials of a study program. The study of military history has both an educational and a utilitarian value. It allows soldiers to look upon war as a whole and relate its activities to the periods of peace from which it rises and to which it returns. Military history also helps in developing a professional frame of mind and, in the leadership arena, it shows the great importance of character and integrity. In talking about a study program, the guide says that reading biographies of leading soldiers or  statesmen is a good way to begin the study of military history. The best way to keep a study program current is to consult some of the many scholarly historical periodicals such as the \"American Historical Review\" or the \"Journal of Modern History.\" Part two, which comprises almost half the guide, contains a bibliographical essay on military history, including great military historians and philosophers, world military history, and U.S. military history. Part three describes various army programs. The guide concludes with part four which examines military history outside the U.S. army, military history in the department of defense, official programs abroad, and military history and the academic world.

The program emphasizes concepts from each of the social science disciplines. Included among these are learning; family; social processes of customs, cooperation, competition, and conflict; rules and laws; voting; location and direction; transportation, regions, and regionalism; needs and wants; goods and services; money; resources; archaeology; invention; symbols; and time. The program also emphasizes skills of information acquiring, reading, organization, communication, citizenship education, geography, and time relationships. Each lesson contains a concept question, skill, student competency, suggested activity, and materials needed.  The lesson activities are many and varied. For example, in one of the lessons on the concept of learning which also teaches the skill of information acquiring, students use magazine pictures to make a collage of children and adults in various learning situations. The students mount the pictures on heavy oaklag and discuss each situation. It is suggested that teachers stress the idea that all age groups can learn. Another example is a lesson on rules and laws in which students learn the skill of reading for comprehension. Students make a class book entitled \"Rules Help Us Live Together.\" Each child draws a picture illustrating a law or rule of the community. Depending on the grade level, sentences may be written to tell the rule that is illustrated. The completed class book is to be kept  in a prominent place in the classroom and the children are allowed to read it during their free time. Because the activities utilize materials found in most classrooms, they can easily be used by all elementary teachers. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"These conference papers address the issues of educational and occupational equality for women and identify factors contributing to the underrepresentation of minority women in education and work. The conferences, sponsored by the National Institute of Education (NIE), were held between 1975 and 1978 to solicit the views of black, Hispanic-American, Asian-Pacific-American, American Indian, and white ethnic women. Other ethnic groups who participated include Italian, Finnish, German, Slavic, Jewish, and Greek-Americans. Included in the paper are policy, research, social, and humanitarian concerns, much of whose implementation fall beyond the mission, purview, and resources of NIE and the Department of Education. Therefore, NIE is now making them available to a wider audience.  Recommendations made by the participants summarize the spirit of the conference. Federal agencies should communicate with each other with regard to the concerns of ethnic women. Their policies and practices should be reviewed in congressional/committee/agency hearings for their effect on the needs and development of ethnic women. Ethnic organizations should be examined, their history surveyed, and the status of women in those organizations analyzed. Research is needed on mixed ethnic settings where intergroup tensions exist so one ethnic group will not victimize another. Women who are sensitive to ethnic needs should be placed in leadership positions in federal agencies and programs. The Department of Housing and Urban Development should conduct research on women's housing needs. NIE  should convene a conference with representatives from all five minority women's conferences to stress the commonalities. (Author/RM)",

The United States officially recognized the People's Republic of China (PRC) on January 1, 1979. Chinese leaders view international trade as an important factor in transforming China into a modern industrial state as well as an instrument to foster the overall political and economic goals of making China a strong unified nation capable of exercising leadership in Asia and the world. China now has trading relations with more than 150 countries. Prior to approaching the Chinese foreign trade corporations (FTCs), many firms may want to assess the potential PRC market for their goods and services. Various groups in the United States attempt to survey Chinese industries  and to assess the potential for American goods and services. Some of these may be found as sectoral reports in the &quot;China Business Review&quot; published by the National Council for United States-China Trade. The Commerce Department also has an ongoing effort to develop further market information. The publication lists Chinese FTCs describing the commodities handled by each. Specific steps for establishing contact with FTCs are discussed. The document then goes on to describe other trade related entities of the People's Republic of China. In China, end-users play a major role in deciding what commodities are to be procured. One excellent way to contact end-users in an attempt to influence their decisions is by exhibiting equipment where engineers and other representatives of consuming entities  have an opportunity to observe and ask questions. Various Chinese fairs are described. Other topics discussed in the publication include currency, shipping and insurance, United States regulations governing trade with the PRC, trademarks, inventions and copyrights, and travel to China. United States domestic exports and imports are listed in the appendices. (Author/RM)",

Included in the report is a discussion of the project's background, recruitment, staffing, the program, and evaluation results. The project has three major objectives: (1) to improve the skills of teachers in the African humanities by teaching them to diversify approaches to the study of Africa, to develop curriculum units, and to produce and use appropriate teaching aids; (2) to introduce teachers to new curriculum resources; and (3) to further their understanding of African heritage. Elementary and secondary teachers from selected school districts in the three states attended four-week summer workshops conducted at the  University of Illinois. Workshop participants listened to lectures; previewed, read, and discussed materials on Africa; and developed curriculum units. Teachers developed units, most of which require from three to four weeks to implement, for use in social studies, art, music, language arts, math, science, and home economics. The sample units in the report include \"The Akan of Ghana\" (grade 4); \"The Cycle of Life in the African Family\" (Grade 10-12); \"Introducing Africa in the Classroom\" (Grade 7); \"African Art and Culture for High School Students of Art\" (Grade 10-12). The evaluations revealed a strong positive response to the workshop program on the part of teachers.

        "description":"This monograph discusses world population problems, examines the underlying concepts and issues in population education, and looks at the future. The monograph begins by describing an attempt at population education in a village of India. Eight guiding concepts that are considered to be essential for population educators are then discussed. These are: (1) all exponential progressions have limits; (2) it is impossible to do nothing; (3) everything is connected to everything else and rarely can problems be solved in isolation; (4) the issue in population is not how many the planet earth can support, but how long any size populations can persist; (5) everything must go somewhere; (6) one cannot get something for nothing; (7) often good intentions do not lead us to where we would  like to go; and (8) growth in the moral and aesthetic aspects of life is possible without growth in population or economic production. Many issues concerning the scope, audience, and teaching methods in population education are sensitive and often controversial. For example, should an educational program emphasizing fertility limitation be directed toward adults, teenagers, or both? Another issue is the degree to which sex education and population education should be related. A brief survey of population education in Third World countries shows that some efforts have been made to develop curriculum in the schools, but the major emphasis has been to reach the child-bearing age group with both sophisticated and primitive forms of media. To date China is the only large non-Western country  with a predominantly rural population that has achieved a low birthrate. Children's futures from various countries are compared. Sources of material for the population educator are cited. (Author/RM)",

Findings indicated that 68 percent of persons 25 years old and older were high school graduates in March 1979; the proportions of persons who completed at least one year of college and four or more years of college were greater for men than women in 1979; the proportion of persons who were high school graduates increased more for blacks than  for whites--although white youths were still more likely than black youths to be high school graduates as of 1979; people residing in metropolitan areas were more likely to be either high school graduates or college graduates in 1979 than those living in nonmetropolitan areas; the West consistently has had the largest proportion of adults who were either high school or college graduates; the educational level of the American worker has increased substantially throughout the years; and the proportion of male laborers who were high school graduates increased dramatically since 1960. The document concludes with appendices which present information on definitions, explanations, sources of the data, and reliability of the estimates. (DB)",

        "description":"This model unit, intended for elementary and intermediate level students, inventories Alaska's historic sites and examines the values of preservation. The unit can easily be adapted for use by teachers in other parts of the country. The objective is to introduce an awareness of the architecture and structural aesthetics of our man-made past and a sensitivity and value of preservation for present and future generations. The unit is comprised of three parts. In Part I, which comprises over half of the unit, actual Alaskan sites are listed and briefly described. Suggestions for discussion/research activities follow the descriptions. The activities are many and varied. For example, students are given a definition of the term &quot;historical site&quot; and are then asked to list ten&quot;historical sites&quot; in their own life (e.g. the first tree they climbed) and to explain the significance and location of each site or structure. In many activities students are asked to do research on and to discuss topics such as why did people who built log cabins use green wood or what is saddle-corner construction? Throughout the unit students keep a journal. Part Two of the unit provides a behind-the-scenes look at the type of people involved in historic preservation. The role of funding agencies, foundations, and the federal government in historic preservation and the technical preservation process are discussed. The third part of the unit is designed for higher level students who are capable of conducting an actual survey or doing an inventory of local or regionally significant  historical sites. Step by step directions are provided. A bibliography of student and teacher resources is included. (Author/RM)",

Major objectives of the handbook are to identify social studies concepts which are within the realm of experience for primary school pupils, identify cognitive skills associated with learning about those concepts, and suggest activities which help pupils explore the concepts. Three approaches are stressed--conceptual framework development (derived from the social science disciplines), modified inquiry (carried out through structured questions), and skill development (including information acquisition, reading, organizing, communicating,  citizenship, geographic location and map and globe skills, and time relationship skills). Activities are presented in six categories, representing the major social science disciplines--sociology, political science, geography, economics, anthropology, and history. Students are involved in a variety of activities including making collages, analyzing short stories, working with maps and globes, reading about celebrations in other cultures, filling in blanks, role playing, and writing paragraphs about the activities of political officials. For each activity, information is presented on a question to reinforce the major concept, skill, objective, process, and materials. A brief overview of teaching strategies is included in the document. (DB)",

The document includes a copy of the exercise, complete documentation about administration and scoring procedures, and the national percentage results. The exercises are classified according to the three broad areas of attitudes, knowledges, and skills. They are either multiple choice, short answer (one or two words up to several sentences), or longer answers (paragraph or more). In the 1971-72 assessment of social studies, 9-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 17-year-olds and young  adults aged 26-35 were asked a variety of questions designed to measure achievement of five broad educational objectives in social studies. These objectives are (1) that Americans should have curiosity about human affairs; (2) that they should use analytic-scientific procedures effectively; (3) that they should be sensitive to creative-intuitive methods of explaining the human condition; (4) that they should have knowledge relevant to the major ideas and concerns of social scientists; and (5) that they should have a reasoned commitment to the values that sustain a free society.

        "description":"This paper analyzes an instructional approach based on a student-designed and constructed model of a city and describes how this approach was used in a college-level sociology class on ethnic relations in the city. The approach is called 'City Building.' The major objective of this approach is to bring social life into the classroom. Students using this approach are directed to solve futuristic and complex problems using the objects in the model environment. The responsibility of the instructor using the City Building approach is mainly to play a facilitative role as consultant. Advantages of this approach are that it enables students to experiment with the concept of physical space so that it becomes relevant to their needs and experiences, become involved with architectural  planning, understand the influence of physical space on human behavior, gain appreciation of both man-made and natural objects in the environment, and gain a concrete understanding of the social world upon which sociological abstractions regarding urban life are based. Features of the sociology course based on City Building included a contract specifying grading criteria, class participation, activities, assignments, and responsibilities of students and teachers; fieldtrips to different types of communities; and simulations to encourage group solidarity and consensus regarding the type of community which would be built. Student evaluations of the course based on the City Building approach revealed a high degree of interest and appreciation that there was an actual representation of  sociological concepts which are generally only relayed verbally.

However, several authors have noted differences between the instructional styles used in classrooms and those used in nonacademic instruction. Nine-year-old teachers use more nonverbal than verbal instruction, and refer more frequently to specific instances or items, than to general concepts. Adult teachers use more verbal than nonverbal instruction, and provide more concept or category information than information specific to instances. Learners taught by adult teachers perform better on tests of memory and generalization than do those taught by child teachers. Task differences in instructional strategies are also evident. Both child and adult  teachers provide more verbal information, particularly category information, in the school than in the home task. More nonverbal information is also provided in the school than in the home task. Adults and children utilize different instructional strategies which vary in effectiveness. The choice of instructional strategies is influenced by the context in which the instruction occurs. (Author/JD)",

Few, however, would dispute that the core of student teaching is that unique relationship which occurs between two persons--the student teacher and the cooperating teacher. This relationship may be explored by examining two alternative models for matching student teachers and cooperating teachers. The first model aims at some predetermined change by arranging a match based on a specified degree of disparity between two persons whereas the second model suggests a match which seeks congruency in a relationship. Based upon these two models, the alternative of mutual-choice placement is recommended. In addition to providing the opportunity for model synthesis or selection, mutual-choice placement  maximizes the decision making process for those persons most involved--the student teacher and the cooperating teacher.

(4) What are the psychological effects and ramifications of participation at a young age in any organized sport? and (5) What are children's norms, and how far can they drive themselves or be driven by others? The emphasis, organization, and long term benefits of much that constitutes organized children's sports today are questioned.

Reasons for this change include: (1) declining Centre enrollment; (2) decreased need for the Centre, which was originally established when opportunity for inservice study was limited; (3) ability of existing education institutions to offer more appropriate courses; and (4) limited geographic  applicability of Centre courses. The Commission recommends that the Teachers Centre for Continuing Education be phased out over a three year period. This phasing out must be well publicized.

First, a small teams/big team design focused on changes for the elementary program. Second, support activities were organized to extend project efforts beyond the elementary program and generate new teacher education materials. The organizing structure featured a series of small mainstreaming development teams. Each team was comprised of  a faculty member from special education, two from general education, and a graduate assistant. Each team was responsible for the design, development, and field evaluation of a series of learning activities to be incorporated directly into the present preservice elementary teacher education program. These teams, together with other key personnel, combined to form an overall project team for curriculum planning and development. The teaming arrangement provided a useful mechanism for general and special education faculty to learn from each other.

Much diversity exists in all three areas among effective teachers, a phenomenon which confounds the problem of precise description of desirable teaching behaviors. In spite of the large amount of process-product research, the current status of research on teacher effectiveness is not impressive by reason of its sparsity and inconsistent results. Results of previous research studies indicate that problems with research on teacher effectiveness include: (1) Research does not measure the teaching process; (2) Records on teacher performance are not kept; (3) Actual  classroom behaviors are not monitored; (4) Teacher performance criteria are not specifically denoted and evaluated accordingly; and (5) Improved research methodology and designs in the area of teacher effectiveness are needed.

The responses of 24 former participants indicate the impact of the program on the participants, their work, in the schools, and at the university. The area of attitudes, traditionally considered the most difficult to change, was the central area of impact for most of the participants. Differences that participants brought to schools and children were: an openness to divergence, flexibility, self-confidence, concern for the individual, and willingness to work in teams and groups. At the university, the undergraduate and graduate teacher education  programs remained unchanged. The experimental program and its faculty were not integrated into the curricula. The project seems to have made a difference in the training and the later work of participants, but has made no difference at the university. (CJ)",

A sample of 581 Title I students was administered the test. Using Bartlett's test, it was determined that the item intercorrelation matrices were worth factor analyzing. The CTBS did not have a strong factor structure. Rather than being unidimensional, the test results appeared to be multidimensional. This study suggests that the results from testing Title I students with standardized tests should be interpreted cautiously.

The students in the four experimental conditions were required to depress three buttons in proper senquence. Following a correct response, the proper sequence systematically changed. The task was to discover the rule which determined how the sequence changed. Criterion was three consecutive correct responses. A two-way analysis of variance demonstrated significant main effects for both the temporal reinforcement delay and response contingency condition, and for the interaction effect. Immediate reinforcement facilitated acquisition better than reinforcement that was delayed  30-seconds. Acquisition was also better facilitated when the subject had knowledge of the response contingency. The interaction effect demonstrated that the difference between acquisition rates for immediate and delayed reinforcement increased when the subject was unaware of the response contingency. The results affirmed the findings of research supporting the use of immediate and contingent reinforcement for acquisition. (Author/GK)",

To explore sources of developmental differences in analogical reasoning, subjects were included from two age levels, grades 4 and 5 and college. To allow the investigation of individual differences in reasoning ability, the children were selected to represent two general aptitude levels, average IQ and high IQ. The experimental number analogies correlated highly with the number analogies portion of a standardized intelligence test: the Analysis of Learning Potential. In each group a combination of domain-specific and general procedural knowledge factors accounted for more than 70% of the variance in item solution difficulty. The most  critical processing demand affecting successful performance was the amount of solution-related information to be assembled and managed in working memory. Domain-specific and general procedural knowledge factors differentiated adults from children, while only specific, factual knowledge competencies seemed to differentiate between IQ levels in children.

Black students were divided into quintiles on the basis of their estimated theta's. Average standardized difference scores were computed within each quintile as well as across all black students. Some items were identified as biased in favor of black students because their actual performance is systematically better than expected while some were considered biased against black students relative to  other items on the math test. Finally, items were classified by content categories and compared in terms of their average standardized difference score. Questions about the metric system, those involving definitions, and those based upon graphs and figures stood out as ones on which black students did worse than expected from the latent trait model. Story problems involving money, those involving unknown symbol substitution stood out in the other direction. Recommendations are made for test revision and for a line of inquiry into what is now labeled as item bias. (Author)",

The data reported come from three instruments: the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), the reading and math components of the California Achievement Tests, and the System of Multicultural Pluralistic Assessment (SOMPA) Sociocultural Modalities Scales. Four modalities (family size/structure, socioeconomic status, and urban acculturaltion) were used for establishing the ELP from the WISC-R data. The sample was drawn from three racial-ethnic groups and two social classes in grades 1 through 8. Results show the common tendency for middle class children to outperform the lower class on IQ and achievement, as well as the relative ranking of the racial-ethnic groups on IQ  and achievement data. The IQ correlations for reading and math tend to be stronger for lower class children within each racial-ethnic group. The concurrent prediction of reading and math achievement is accomplished more accurately with IQs than ELPs. Compared to WISC-R IQs, the adjustment of IQs to form an estimated learning potential tends to decrease the test's effectiveness to predict current and later achievement. (GK)",

        "description":"From 1974 through 1978, three methods of assessing Scottish high school students' (O level) English achievement were studied: (1) Ordinary (O level) examinations; (2) assessment of writing skills (folio assessment); and (3) criterion referenced tests developed by the Scottish Council for Research in Education (SCRE) to measure the objectives of the Ordinary grade English course. Ten schools supplied complete data, and one school supplied partial data. General conclusions of the research favored the O-grade English examination because it is a well-tried method; it is used nationwide, ensuring comparability of standards; and teachers are satisfied with it. Problems with the O-grade examination include intermarker inconsistency and lack of fine discrimination among large numbers of  average students. Although folio assessment could be more directly related to particular courses, inservice education in grading practices would be necessary, marker inconsistency would be present, and some teachers would be reluctant to take on the work involved. The criterion assessment would serve as an independent criterion with which to compare folio and O-grade evaluations. However, the study did not include an assessment of interpretation demanded by this method. Various appendices are attached, including some of the criterion tests and the teacher attitude questionnaire. (MH)",

Evaluation methods feasible for objectives at each level of the model are listed and divided into suggested and other approaches. Example priority objectives, evaluation questions, and resulting evalution products  taken from ongoing evaluations illustrate the use of the levels of program objectives model and its associated methods.

Student-centered assessment begins with the assumption that the aim of education is to shift effective planning and control of students' choices to the students. Two applications of this approach are assessment in the classroom and in the guidance process. Classroom assessment emphasizes immediate feedback to both student and teacher; is used to improve learning rather than to keep score; and deals with an immediate follow-up to an observed condition, rather than focusing on long-term prediction which may unfairly label children and ignore their capabilities for rapid change and development.  In guidance assessment, the goal should be to help students plan each successive educational step, preserving for them as many options as possible. Development of appropriate measures should focus on helping students assess their own interests, values, and aspirations. In general, measurement should focus on formative evaluation, diagnosis, and planning instead of summative evaluation or certification. (MH)",

        "description":"The issues of treatment assignment is ordinarily dealt with within the framework of testing aptitude treatment interaction (ATI) hypothesis. ATI research mostly uses linear regression techniques, and an ATI exists when the aptitude treatment (AT) regression lines cross each other within the relevant interval of the aptitude variable. Consistent with this approach is the use of the points of interaction of AT regression lines as treatment-assignment rule. The replacement of such rules by monotone, nonrandomized (Bayes) rules is proposed. Both continuous and dichotomous criteria for treatment success are considered. An example of the latter is evaluated using a mastery test. Solutions are given based on linear, normal ogive, and threshold utility functions. Some modifications of  these functions are discussed which are believed to be more realistic in the context of individualized instruction, but for which no optimal monotone assignment rules are available yet.

        "description":"Behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS), a new quantitative method of employee performance evaluation, is advocated for teacher evaluation. Development of a BARS consists generally of five steps: a representative sample of potential raters generates the scales; the group identifies the broad qualities to be evaluated; the group formulates general statements representing various levels of performance for each quality and lists examples of behaviors at each level; a second group, representing the ratees, receives lists of the broad dimensions and of the specific behaviors and assigns the behaviors to the dimensions; raters then assign unused behaviors to describe satisfactory and unsatisfactory employees across several dimensions. A discrimination index is computed for each  behavior and point values assigned to each behavior within the dimensions. Items above a criterion level of point variability are eliminated. Problems may arise with the raters' predictive acumen or possibly with the permanent assignment of values for specific behaviors. As an example of a BARS used in education, the scale developed by Marianne Price for evaluating special education teachers in the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, Intermediate Unit, is appended. This scale measures professional growth, communications skills, rapport with students, planning, instructional skills, recordkeeping, behavior management, and interstaff relationships. (MH)",

The work looks at the problems of establishing a new institution in the late 1920s and traces its varying fortunes through 50 years to 1980. It is more, however, than an institutional history. It analyses early contributions to educational research, its subsequent growth in importance, and efforts made in the 1960s and 1970s to provide an adequate support for it. The task of critic and educational reformer has never been a comfortable one, and the book examines the up-hill efforts by the ACER and its overseas visitors from the 1930s to the 1970s to evaluate Australian education and stir the conscience of its educators. Throughout the book there are a number of interesting biographical sketches of important  Australian educators, such as Tate, Cunningham, Radford, and Dunn, who had strong connections with the ACER.

A competency is a complex capability applicable in real life situations, and can be used as program objectives in a competency-based, criterion-referenced program. In such a program, applied performance testing is used to measure the mastery of the required competencies. Government at all levels has attempted to control proficiency standards, and 27 states now have mandated proficiency testing. Many local districts have also initiated competency tests. New tests are being developed to meet these demands. Two approaches are being taken: individual schools are writing items, and existing item pools are being tapped. The NASSP Task  Force on Graduation Requirements holds that the diploma should certify that the graduate possesses the baseline skills and knowledge essential to effective adult citizenship. The current interest in competency tests as graduation requirements faces two problems: at which grade level the test should be administered, and the status of students who do not qualify for a competency-based diploma. The appendices include sample items from 15 competency tests, and a summary of school district and state competency requirements. (BW)",

The methodology employed was a confirmatory factor analysis using the COFAMM computer program. Data from 822 students who had taken both batteries were used to test a hypothesized four-factor model (Reading, Sentences, Mathematics, and Mosaic Comparisons). This model was found to fit the data; that is, subtests with the same names measured the same skills. Basic  Skills subtests, Mosaic Comparisons, Year 2000, and Letter Groups, however, each measured something uniquely different from Reading, Sentences, and Mathematics. Although technically complex, this methodology is easily and inexpensively applied to this type of problem. It can be particularly useful in criterion-referenced test development for testing whether a priori subscales are actually measuring different skills. (Author/CP)",

Five important areas were of concern in the development of the battery: (a) basis on which target skills would be selected for inclusion; (b) facilitation of error analysis by creating categorical distractors; (c) ease and efficiency of test administration; (d) independence of the test battery from published materals to lessen the likelihood of teachers teaching to the tests; and (e) establishment of flexible standards for skills mastery based on a  global measure of comprehension, rather than on arbitrary cutoff scores. The battery is comprised of five subtests within two major skill areas, phonics and structural analysis. The battery is a valid reliable instrument, and is easy to administer.

Five elementary school teachers participated in the study. Each was observed, for 24 hours, in the classroom setting. Eighty categories were devised as a result of the observations. These categories were grouped under 10 general headings. Field  notes were coded by category and total tallies were determined. A chi-square statistic was computed on tallies for all headings. Final results showed significant differences in the categories of Teacher is Directive, Analytical, Critic, Nurture, and as Manager. These results suggest several contrasts in the ways field-dependent and field-independent teachers tend to operate in their classrooms, but are not intended to prove the existence of such differences; rather, to suggest useful areas for subsequent empirical research.

It was found that by far the greater part of the research relating to writing assessment was concerned with the completed essay, and with how to evaluate it reliably. Only a relatively few researchers in the national testing services and at universities have concerned themselves in a systematic fashion with the effects of variations in essay topics on student writing performance. Specifications to be followed in producing fair topics should: (1) supply essential rhetorical specifications via simulations or role-playing  scenarios; (2) call for types and levels of discourse that approximate those which teachers are likely to have to use in the discharge of their professional duties; (3) deal specifically with educational situations; and (4) are presented in at least two variations, one suited to primary and elementary teachers, another to middle and high school teachers.

In addition, topics for use on the initial administrations of the Florida Teacher Competency Examination's writing subtest were developed and validated. Six essay topics selected by a panel of validators were cast in three different presentation modes according to degree of specification of rhetorical context, or &quot;informational load (IL).&quot; A low IL presented the topic in a brief phrase leaving the writer free to make decisions about audience, purpose, form, and tone without guidance. A moderate IL gave the writer an orientation to the task without  including specifications. A high IL gave a full rhetorical context. The six topics in the three modes, 18 combinations in all, were administered randomly to a sample of college education majors. Evidence gathered in statistical and rhetorical analyses points clearly at the moderate IL as the presentation mode most likely to stimulate the best writing of large number of examinees. (RL)",

This assumption was tested by (1) investigating the extent to which attitude attributions made after observing the behavior differed from prior estimates of attitude and (2) assessing the diagnosticity of the behavior setting through examination of the Bayesian likelihood ratio. After measuring estimates of the distribution of favorable and unfavorable attitudes toward seatbelts, observers read either a pro- or anti-seatbelt essay that had supposedly been written under high or low choice conditions. Results  supported the fundamental attribution error interpretation of overattribution since observers, rather than relying on prior estimates of attitudes and discounting coerced behavior, continued to assume that attitudes matched behavior even under low choice conditions.

Approximately 1,600 college-bound high school seniors (study 1) and 2,000 college seniors (study 2) completed both the ACT Interest Inventory (ACT-IV) and the new Unisex Edition of the ACT-IV (UNIACT), which contains sex-balanced items. In both studies, each participant was placed in one of six criterion groups based on the correspondence of expressed occupational choice (study 1) and actual college major (study 2) to Holland types. Comparable levels of criterion-related validity were obtained with the unisex scales,  sex-restrictive scales, and with sex-balanced scores obtained by the traditional procedure of using same-sex norms. Study results and the results of previous research indicate that psychometrically sound interest inventories can be constructed with sex-balanced items, and that counselors may use inventories which provide sex-balanced score reports without sacrificing validity.

The author contends that if either step is invalid, the use of the general linear model (GLM) after tests are scored would invalidate its results. Based on a series of studies, evidence is presented to indicate that the scoring procedures are incorrect. Invalidation on psychological grounds is based on the observation that wrong answer selection is caused by item interpretation which may lead to considering logically correct answers to be wrong. Statistical invalidation is based on the development of new procedures for  interpreting contingency tables. It is suggested that present scoring procedures are not applicable for higher-order multiple choice tests and that even with low-level skills, these scoring procedures may be misapplied when the discrimination level of the test and the performance levels of the learners do not match. When systematic curvi-linearity is found, current scoring procedures are inappropriate until valid transformations for the data have been found and can be applied. (Author/MH)",

The proposed criteria, like the 1948 version and unlike those of 1952, 1969, and 1974, spell out specific requirements which accrediting agencies must look for in institutional or program accreditation. Over the years the number and types of accredited institutions and programs have greatly increased. Five major concerns of the public have dominated the last decade in accreditation: (1) accountability of the process; (2) consumer protection as evidenced by the inclusion of the criterion on ethical  practices regarding recruitment, admission, and tuition refund policies; (3) responsiveness of the process to national and state needs and objectives; (4) flexibility of the process to accommodate new forms of educational enterprises; and (5) reexamination of the validity and reliability of the accrediting standards and techniques used in order to avoid inadequately supported, overly subjective, or biased decisions.

The group test consisted of two forms of a 36-item, multiple-choice test comprised of words at various difficulty levels. Subjects received one form of the test as a reading test and the other as a listening test in a counterbalanced fashion. The interviews required subjects to give two meanings for words in isolation, identify two meanings of words presented in two contexts, and distinguish between the meanings of closely related words. An analysis of variance on the group  test indicated significant differences due to grade, ability, mode, and word difficulty. However, the difference due to mode was small for both good and poor readers. On the interviews, students did best at identifying multiple meanings in context, and giving multiple meanings for isolated words best distinguished good and poor readers.

This discriminatory basis has caused resistance to school desegregation economically, politically, and socially. Statistics demonstrate that reluctant integration has resulted in a loss of role models and leadership positions within schools for black students. Change will be effected only if the underlying assumption that differences imply superior and inferior groups is abandoned. Americans should reaffirm their respect for human dignity and recommit themselves to American principles of the equality and inalienable  rights of all human beings. (MK)",

Data indicate that assistance to persons residing in counties with the highest infant mortality rate and counties with the lowest per capita income rose since 1967. Assistance to counties with lower infant mortality rates and higher income levels also rose, but at a slower rate. Bonus food stamps programs had a significant effect on retail food sales per person, most obviously in counties with high infant mortality rates. Food assistance distributed through the National School Lunch Program and the Commodity Distribution Program did not result in observable increases in food retail sales, with the exception of having a slight effect in poorest rural counties.  In general, data show that progress has been made in providing food to poor people. Tables of data are appended to the report. (Author/MK)",

Observers also coded characteristics of observed students' interactive behaviors: the tone (positive, negative, or neutral), the form (physical or other), the source (the subject, interactant, or both), and the task orientation (whether or not the behavior was related to academic tasks). Students interacted primarily with others of their own race and sex although gender aggregation was less pronounced among blacks than among whites. Boys interacted more across racial lines than did girls. Blacks were almost twice as likely as whites to  be the source of cross-racial interactions. Students' interracial behavior was generally not different in quality from intraracial behavior, although some potentially important differences between black and white children's behavior styles were observed. These conclusions were reinforced by a parallel study of sociometric choice conducted in the same school. (Author/MK)",

Two types of studies are considered, the first concerning the racial/ethnic mix of pupils, and the second concerning resource allocation among schools. The section on analyzing the racial/ethnic mix of pupils begins with a description of the kinds of data needed and presents analytical methods for describing racial/ethnic distribution for biracial and triracial/ethnic districts. The problems of defining a segregated school are then identified and discussed. These problems include setting realistic standards, designing a definition that fits the  multiracial/ethnic character of many large urban systems, establishing desegregation priorities, and evaluating progress toward desegregation. The section on analyzing resource allocation begins with a description of data sources and stresses the importance of understanding the allocation mechanism. Several allocation criteria are reviewed, including legal principles regarding allocation and equity considerations. Expenditure per pupil, the allocation of teachers, and the distribution of teacher experience and training are then examined as ways of analyzing allocation outcomes. The review concludes with a discussion of problems encountered in removing resource disparities. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"This work includes a discussion of multicultural education and a bibliography of nearly 1000 curriculum guides and supplementary and instructional aids designed for multicultural instruction at the elementary and secondary levels. First, various definitions of multicultural education are examined and common elements of the definitions are identified. The definitions reviewed are: (1) reject the melting pot thesis, (2) advocate cultural diversity, and (3) propose that schools be used to effect a transformation to a culturally pluralistic society. Another common element of the definitions reviewed is the mention of cognitive and affective modes and the areas of competencies and skills in relation to multicultural education. A number of guidelines are then presented for the  evaluation of multicultural materials for potential classroom use. This is followed by a bibliography that was compiled through a computer search of the ERIC system. The bibliography is arranged in alphabetical order. Each citation is coded as to whether it is primarily curricular or instructional, its focus on affect, cognition, or skills/competencies, and the grade level(s) to which it refers or for which it is intended. ERIC document (ED) or journal article (EJ) numbers are also provided. (GC)",

Employment data come from census, payroll, report, and survey information. Section 1 considers male-female employment profiles (1970, 1975) for the whole economy. Section 2 compares the corporate sector to all other sectors, including comparative employment patterns of men and women by sector; women's share of jobs by occupation and sector in 1970, 1972, 1975; and changes in male-female employment patterns in the corporate sector (1970, 1975). The final section deals with what has been happening to women within the corporate sector. The 1970 (or 1972) and 1975 male-female employment and occupational patterns  are examined from three perspectives: (1) within broad industry categories based on goods or services being produced (manufacturing; public utilities; trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; mining and construction), (2) within male-intensive versus female-intensive industries, and (3) for certain nontraditional jobs by women. Three sets of charts are presented whenever possible in this section so that the same kinds of information can be considered for companies of different sizes. (YLB)",

        "description":"Finnish research in adult education falls into three categories: philosophical, historical, and empirical. (Philosophical research involves the analysis of the concept of adult education and its relationship to other levels of education. Empirical research embraces the psychological and sociological study of students, teachers, institutions, and pedagogic theory.) Until recently, philosophical and historical research predominated. Empirical research has been primarily sociologically oriented and has placed teaching problems in minor position. Other empirical research includes descriptive and participation studies. Since 1975, when adult education was first defined as part of the Finnish educational system, the need to train adult educators has been stressed. A need for research  was identified in the following areas: adult education needs in society, obstacles preventing the poor from participating in adult education, the possibilities and means for active recruitment, teaching methods that meet the special needs of the adult learner, and the professional image of adult educators. Comparative studies on the organization and structure of adult education in Nordic countries are also needed. Research in the areas of educational planning, matching the needs of learners with delivery systems, and the potential for computer-assisted instruction is also necessary. (References are appended.)

        "description":"The movement to train and counsel displaced homemakers began in 1975. State legislation for funding was followed by vocational educational and Comprehensive Employment Training Act funding. The Department of Labor has estimated that there are at least 4.13 million displaced homemakers. A total of 354 displaced homemaker programs have been located. Most offer counseling rather than job-specific training. Displaced homemakers need greater support while in training and more training and employment in nontraditional occupations. Most exmployers who have hired displaced homemakers have found them dependable and highly motivated. The term displaced homemaker should be more clearly defined with program focus on middle-aged and older women. More effective outreach to rural and minority  women, multiple sources of funding, and training of counselors and instructors in the special needs of displaced homemakers are needed. Criteria for program evaluation should include funding, outreach, and services. (A seventy-page bibliography concludes the report, and appendixes constituting half the document include information on local, state, and federal displaced homemaker legislation and programs, lists of resources, and directory of educational institutions with displaced homemaker programs.)

Data for the use study were collected from sixty in-depth personal interviews with randomly selected cooperative extension advisors and administrators, state legislators and legislative research staff members, and state agency managers. Forty of the respondents used the results of the needs assessment, either directly or as background information, on issues of concern to them. Results show that the decision makers were most likely to use such sociological research when (1) the research information is perceived as the best data available; (2) the information confirms an  already-held position; and (3) the research information fits with job-related informational needs. The results also suggest that timing, dissemination techniques, initial involvement in planning for the study, and explanation of the study results are factors that affect use of information about public opinion.

        "description":"This research was designed to identify and assess the effects of a job's context and naturally occurring job content changes upon the job attitudes of 709 Air Force radio operators. The first of two phases of the investigation identified specific job types within the radio operator career field at two points in time, and determined the flow of personnel from one of eight job types to another over a seventeen-month period. In the second phase, a series of multiple linear regression analyses were employed in the prediction of job attitude criteria consisting of perceived job interest, felt utilization of talents and training, and overall satisfaction. Results indicated that individual inputs such as months on the job (MOJ) and total active federal military service time contributed  significantly in predicting job interest and felt utilization; and MOJ, aptitude, and grade contributed to the prediction of overall job satisfaction. In addition, situational inputs such as number of tasks performed and average task difficulty substantially improved prediction of attitudes. Interest and overall satisfaction tended to be more highly associated with an individual's current job while felt utilization tended to be associated with both the individual's current and past job experiences. Implications for job satisfaction predictions include improving job perceptions through personnel, task, and duty assignment policies as an approach to job enrichment. (Author/KC)",

Unique aspects of the project are presented along with their interrelationship. A flow chart is provided to help the reader to understand this interrelationship and the process a student would follow in the program. The dissemination process to be followed by the project is outlined and described along with a second flow chart designed to graphically depict the process. The manual also contains two sample high school districts' plans for the dissemination of the project. Finally, the manual provides the \"physical demands and working conditions\" form, a tool that was found helpful during field testing of the project.

Featured speaker Shirley Price discusses her life as a handicapped person and stresses the need to perceive people as themselves and not as their handicap; to break down stereotypes and prepare handicapped students for real employment in jobs that exist, not just create programs because they sound good. Twenty-seven  presentations are then given in the following subject areas: legislation and litigation; secondary and postsecondary administrative concerns (such as research issues, advocates vs. educators, and modifying programs for the handicapped); teaching concerns (competency-based instruction, classroom management, safety, and teaching emotionally disturbed students); vocational assessment; employment; and specific handicapping conditions.

        "description":"This monograph summarizes discussions by participants at two mini-conferences who were involved in beginning attempts to implement the Youth Employment and Demonstration Projects Act (YEDPA) legislation. The first section presents a historical overview of YEDPA which focuses on a monograph by Garth L. Mangum. Both ineffective and effective program strategies are listed. The second section then describes the YEDPA legislation (which is currently being rewritten). Five concerns of prime sponsors regarding interactions among Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), YEDPA, and local education agencies (LEAs) are then discussed. The next section summarizes Youth Incentive Entitlement Projects (YIEP) efforts in Seattle, Washington; Detroit, Michigan; Boston, Massachusetts;  Cincinnati, Ohio; and Baltimore, Maryland. A summary of problems encountered in early Youth Employment Training Programs (YETP) efforts as well as some examples of ways in which YETP programs supplement educational opportunities follow. Concluding sections list nine recommendations for increasing the effectiveness of YEDPA and four philosophical issues which should be resolved in LEA/prime sponsor agreements. (YLB)",

A brief description outlines scope and four major components of this program, which was located at two high schools in the Salt Lake City School District: career awareness, employment skills, vocational training, and placement. Other sections discuss identification of clients served and student characteristics and describe programs of a similar nature that are operating locally and throughout the country. A report from an independent internal evaluator describing the function of the  program is summarized. The concluding section contains a brief summary statement highlighting the program's major accomplishments, a future perspective where problems are, and programming strategies to resolve these problems for the next operating year. Appendixes, amounting to over one-half of the report, include (1) definitions of handicapping conditions; (2) a report on the structure and changes of the program, whose title was changed to Special Vocational Services Project for the next operation year; (3) the independent internal evaluator's report in its entirety; and (4) participating student characteristics in detail.

Benefit adequacy and fairness, retirement systems, pension plan funding, the impact of extending the individual's working life, and the coordination and design of current retirement policies are examined. The implications of migration and regional development patterns and the impact of an aging population on employment, income, wealth, government spending and revenues, pension plans, and financial markets are analyzed. Following a discussion  of data availability, research priorities are identified in the following areas: finance, benefit adequacy and fairness, employment, and systems coordination and design. The position taken on social security and public retirement systems by business, labor, and the aged is set forth. Conflicts among objectives, major gaps in identified policy options, and the relationship of policy options to economic trends are described.

(This act established K-12 and postsecondary career exploration as national priorities.) Site visits were made in nine states (Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, and Oregon) and thirty-one intermediate and local education agencies. The states represented nine out of ten United States Department of Education regions; large, medium and minimum amounts of PL 95-207 funding during 1979; and high, medium, and low levels of 1974-75 state support for career education. Site evaluations revealed that PL 95-207 funds are serving their intended purpose. State and local education agencies are maintaining and  increasing their investments. State leadership is being exercised at an accelerating rate, and in most districts schools seem well advanced towards complete career education involvment with resources being provided by other state and federal programs and the private sector. Areas needing fuller attention include the following: coordinated state and local evaluation plans, more preservice training, active involvement of organized labor, and active involvement of groups representing the handicapped and other special needs populations.

A random sample of 7547 youths (about evenly divided between male and female) aged 14 to 20 from eight sites were surveyed concerning their opinions of themselves, their perceptions of their current jobs (if employed), their educational aspirations, and their parents' educational aspirations for the youths. Data from these interviews were coordinated with data from two earlier surveys to provide an attitudinal profile of economically disadvantaged 16- to 19-year-olds who have not graduated from high school and who are thus eligible for a full-time summer and part-time school year job that would provide incentive to either stay in or return to school. Analysis  of data collected revealed that on the whole these low income youths have relatively high levels of self-esteem. Black youths are more likely to want and expect to finish college than are white and Hispanic youths. Youths who are employed generally exhibit positive attitudes about their jobs and, if they are not enrolled in school, appear to be holding permanent, well-supervised positions.

Input from thirty vocational educators in twenty states was used to formulate two questionnaires distributed in Florida and Pennsylvania to persons who distribute and use research products. The distribution survey product sample included all products from a twelve-month segment of products accepted by the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) Clearinghouse on Adult, Career, and Vocational Education; the fourteen-product sample for the use survey was selected by state staff members in Florida and Pennsylvania. A total of 1,885 usable questionnaires were returned. The survey revealed the following: copies of reports  and materials from government-sponsored research in vocational education are widely distributed; nearly all recipients of research products used them; students' use of products occurred primarily in secondary and postsecondary classrooms; administrators were potentially key linkers in the distribution process; most products were either learning materials or instructional guides; the greatest product use benefits occurred in the classroom; and direct mail was the most frequent means of product distribution.

        "description":"A literature review was conducted to derive a set of policy implications for improving the effectiveness of vocational education. Variables in the areas of employment, education and training, and ancillary effects (aspirations, attitudes and values, feelings of success, and citizenship) were used to organize data collected from 232 studies conducted from 1968 through 1979 on the effects of vocational education. The literature review revealed that most secondary and postsecondary vocational graduates found jobs in training-related fields, most were satisfied with their jobs, and most employers were satisfied with them. No consistent differences in the unemployment rate or earnings of vocational and nonvocational graduates were found. Further, nonvocational graduates exhibited  greater academic abilities. Insufficient data were reported on occupational skill attainment, and fewer vocational education students planned to attend college. Thus, considerable uncertainty exists over the effects of vocational education. Policy implications for increasing the effectiveness of vocational education include the following: standardization of research methodology and reporting of results, more precise description of educational programs, establishment of the validity of survey instruments, and development of a way to account for the lack of equivalency in the types of jobs held by vocational and nonvocational graduates.

The first section discusses functions of certification, describes various postsecondary vocational certificates and their requirements, and presents evidence of the role of certification in training programs and the labor market. It concludes with a description of reform efforts, such as increased attention to basic skills and work attitudes in training, certificate  standardization, research on predictive validity of certification instruments, and development of new tests and tools to document skills. The second section shows how the lessons of certification can be applied to CETA. A certification process for CETA is recommended which includes a national prototype one-page skill record for use by local trainers; an exploration of use of national standardized competency-based tests of specialized skills, work habits, and basic skills with national minimum passage standards; and the establishment of a full-time placement office for each prime sponsor to market both graduates and tests/training standards.

Cognitive-behavioral theories of psychopathology would predict that they do, since a major premise of such theories is that maladaptive emotional patterns are mirrored in distinct cognitive responses. Highly depressed subjects in an exploratory study of this question were significantly harsher in evaluations of their own guilt-provoking behavior, and were significantly less likely to provide a justification for it, than were mildly depressed and nondepressed subjects. The depressed groups were also significantly more likely, than the nondepressed group, to focus on guilt-provoking situational features and to identify self-oriented, rather than interpersonal, behaviors as  guilt-provoking. Future investigation should attempt to distinguish the cognitive biases or distortions (e.g., selective recall, overly strict self-evaluative standards, attributions to internal causality) that may contribute to these differences.

The framework for the program is self-directed learning, through which women develop coping strategies for change. Participants and leaders make mutual decisions regarding course content, and participants map out individual goals. The presentation lists several characteristics of life-planning programs: (1) they are developmental, helping women to accept changes in life plans as natural outcomes of developing needs and values; (2) they promote self-confidence; (3) they are supportive, involving friends and family and the program group itself in providing feedback and encouragement; (4) they emphasize  taking responsibility for one's own life; (5) they offer strategies and means for gathering information about career options and about one's own interests, abilities, and values; (6) they show participants how to use all available resources for career development; and (7) they teach such career-related skills as assertive communication, stress and time management, and goal-setting. The presentation gives examples of these program traits as they have been realized in Lifework Planning groups. The appendix provides a course outline. (Author/CS)",

The most powerful predictor of client-rated empathy was gender, with women receiving higher empathy scores. The next most powerful predictors were measures of academic achievement. Observer-rated empathy was not significantly predicted by any of the measures used. The greater perceived empathy of the female graduate students may reflect the greater comfort of both sexes in talking with women, or it may reflect the sex-role training of women. The findings also suggest that, while high scores on academic achievement measures predict empathy,\"highly abstract\" people may have difficulty communicating their empathic understanding.

Analyses were computed for expected educational attainment; self-esteem; locus of control; orientation toward work, family, and community; satisfaction with career progress; number of children expected; homemaker aspirations; and welfare dependency. Results indicate that late adolescence parents differed considerably from nonparents on many measures. Differences decreased when allowances were made for differential backgrounds, and when comparisons were made between married parents and married nonparents. Among married women, early parenthood was associated  with lower work orientation measures and a greater tendency to select homemaking. Mothers indicated less satisfaction with career progress, a reflection of the relationship between dissatisfaction and time of the first birth. Adolescent parents expected to have slightly larger families than nonparents. An association between timing of childbirth and welfare dependency was also found. (Author/NRB)",

Expressed choice predicted future occupation more accurately than measured interest. The accuracy of both variables was greatest when they were congruent. Expressed choice was found to be a more accurate predictor for women than for men. Predictive accuracy of the single  highest SVIB scale was greater than that obtained from a grouping of SVIB scales. The SVIB was equally efficient a predictor for undecided students as it was for decided students. The predictions of future occupational choice from SVIB profiles yielded lower &quot;hit rates&quot; than the retrospective method used in most validity studies. (Author/NRB)",

Problems which many stepfamilies have encountered are presented with suggested ways families deal with them. Special problems of children in a stepfamily situation are discussed, e.g., coping with changes, over-attachment to the single parent, child with a deceased parent, and the child of divorce.

The negative outcomes foster a sense of personal and social alienation, which in turn promote behaviors that have negative implications for work motivation and organizational and leadership processes. Research supporting these conclusions points to the need to recognize the multidimensionality of human life both inside and outside the work setting. Societies and organizations must decide how much they will stress such diverse values as achievement, self-actualization, technological progress, and affiliation, recognizing that emphasis on any value usually produces both positive and negative outcomes. Organizational psychologists  should recognize the limitations of the \"linear society\" that encourages achievement and performance at the expense of other values. (Author/CS)",

The counseling strategy used in the project, an integration of photography with group discussion, values clarification, art, and creative writing, is designed to: (1) help children gain self-confidence through the mastery of basic photographic skills and practice in written and visual communication; (2) provide an environment conducive to the sharing of feelings whose expression may be unacceptable in other settings; (3) foster trusting, honest relationships among group participants; (4) provide feedback to the children about how others view them; and (5) offer options for behavioral change. The referral system through which the youths were  identified and the counseling groups set up is described. The components of the group meetings, i.e., photography or written exercise, discussion, and play, are placed within a philosophical framework emphasizing the importance of creative activity and group discussion in helping children to structure, focus, and work through their feelings.

Data showed that burnout was attributed primarily to the nonreciprocated attentiveness, giving, and responsibility demanded by the therapeutic relationship. Most therapists cited lack of therapeutic success as the single most stressful aspect of their work. A majority of therapists felt that the use of support systems (e.g., supervisory relationships, support of colleagues)  was essential to their own mental health. The data further suggest that there are certain inherent difficulties in all work with patients, relating to the nature of the therapeutic role and to the fact that the therapeutic process is slow and erratic. To prevent or minimize burnout, therapists in both the public and private sectors must be able to express, freely, negative feelings toward their work. (Author/CS)",

It was hypothesized that modeling treatments designed to demonstrate reflective problem-solving strategies would improve the problem-solving ability of both normal and hyperactive children, and that, concomicantly, children's ability to sustain attention to visual stimuli would improve. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of a cognitive modeling procedure in reducing impulsivity and increasing attention span, despite claims that cognitive style is a fixed, unmodifiable dimension of behavior. Whether cognitive modeling techniques can be used for problem-solving tasks in classrooms remains uncertain; research evaluating such techniques in the school setting is needed.  (Author/CS)",

An investigation of the interacting influences of siblings and family intactness indicated that the impact of siblings was limited to that associated with sibling status, not family size. Middle-born subjects from divorced families scored lower on perceived popularity and internality than those from intact families.

        "description":"Relationships between aspects of creativity and psychological masculinity and femininity are examined from the perspectives of balance, additive, and catalytic models of androgyny. Female (N=85) and male (N=105) subjects completed Gough's Adjective Check List, (ACL) in which the adjective, &quot;creative,&quot; had been inserted. The ACL was scored for two sets of masculinity and femininity scales and for creative personality scales. Female subjects also completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory. Empirically derived indices of creative self-concept correlated positively with multiple indices of psychological masculinity and somewhat negatively with indices of psychological femininity. Multiple regression analyses detected significant positive linear interactions involving one set of masculinity  and femininity indices and the women's creative self-concepts. Data suggest that potentially creative women may struggle against the very social conceptions about &quot;gender-appropriate&quot; behavior which men find supportive in their creative self-conceptions. Greater sex-role flexibility may make it easier for men and women to develop creative self-concepts. (Author/NRB)",

The major area of reported difficulty was time: scheduling difficulties, time conflicts, time demands of employment, and time available for household activities.

A suprising finding was a strong positive association between family religion and early sexual communication, although this may reflect a cautionary conservatism about children's sexual development. Mothers who were heads of households were more likely to communicate with daughters about sex than were mothers in male-headed homes. The data suggest that two of the most important predictors of frequency of current communication are the pattern of early mother-daughter communication and the quality of the relationship. Communication about sensitive topics is apparently  less difficult in the adolescent years if it builds upon a general pattern of open communication. These findings support program initiatives that seek to strengthen families, and especially women in their role as mothers. (Author/CS)",

External factors that are more likely to impinge on the career paths of female rather than male counseling psychologists include sex discrimination in educational and occupational settings; the availability of role models and mentors; associational ties with colleagues; sex as status; and public policy. Internal factors involve achievement orientation, expectancy of success, and personal belief systems about the rights and roles of women and men and individual responsibility. Professional women must develop a strong  sense of self, recognize the reality of the situation, and develop support systems and a sense of competency. (Author/NRB)",

Two separate studies, one involving college students (N=28) and one involving high school seniors (N=48), were conducted. Subjects were divided into experimental and control groups which met for one hour three days a week, for two weeks. Both groups completed Rasmussen's Ego Identity Scale as the pre- and post-test dependent measure. The experimental group went through a series of questions which operationalized the Enright and Deist model of identity formation, while the control group solved logical problems. In the college  sample, experimentals gained more than the controls on the identity subscale, but not on the Rasmussen composite. The high school sample changed on the composite, but the identity subscale did not show any significant treatment effects. Both studies suggest that social perspective taking as an organized cognitive strategy can lead to greater integrated self-identity. (Author/NRB)",

One problem is that there seems to be a lack of cumulative development, with the research being horizontal in quality, spreading out to new areas. Another problem with schema research is that a person not already convinced of the merit of the schema notion can remain unconvinced by the entire body of evidence relating to schema. What appears to be lacking is a formal theory of schemas that not only describes their own nature but also shows how they fit into overall cognitive processing. A theory that gives an adequate account of schemas as structural entities must give an account of processing as well, because in general one cannot test a structural hypothesis without an auxiliary set of assumptions  about processing, and vice versa. A theoretical effort at defining schema processing as well as structural issues would have a number of beneficial effects, including the following: (1) schema research would acquire a vertical, cumulative quality; (2) the research might go a long way toward answering the objections of the unconvinced; (3) research efforts could be coordinated; (4) there would be a clear test for what is and what is not part of the schema hypothesis; and (5) negative evidence (failed replications and different findings) could be applied usefully to the advancement of schema theory.

The literature proved to be nearly devoid of references to reading skills development directly related to the practice of an occupational specialty.

The first involves limiting the average number of words per sentence and substituting short, easy words and structures. Results with this modification are not encouraging because comprehensibility relies on more complex factors, and text changes are costly and do not necessarily help students cope with real life reading tasks. The second technique can be effective by involving the student as a creative participant. The third technique shifts the emphasis from teacher directed to student directed activities such as paraphrasing or outlining, but does not enable the student to  perceive the text's organizational structure. What is needed is a technique that would consider the background abilities and needs of the reader, the expectations of the teacher, resources, text characteristics, and the implications of current research on reading comprehension. Glossing, an experimental technique that uses marginal and intratext notations to direct the readers' attention while they read, may be one such technique, as it would not merely improve comprehension but would also improve the readers' ability to comprehend.

Two training groups and a control group, each composed of 15 poor and 15 very poor readers, were used in the study. One group (content-specific training) received single-word decoding training that led to decoding mastery of all words to be read (four passages and comprehension questions, which were used by all groups). Another group (noncontent-specific training) learned to decode words, equal in difficulty and number of those of the content-specific group, but never a part of the vocabulary in the passages and questions. The control group read the four passages  and answered the questions without decoding training. The results indicated that only the very poor content-specific readers significantly outperformed their noncontent-specific and control group counterparts. The findings suggest that a transfer effect does exist between single word decoding skill and contextual comprehension performance and that this effect is found in very poor readers who are basically word-by-word readers but who possess adequate auditory comprehension skills.

In the classroom the temptation is to ignore the physical text and to focus attention and discussion on secondary issues which arise out of the text. A distinction needs to be made between reading literature and interpreting or analyzing it. Exercises should be developed to help students perceive, comprehend, and then interpret the text. Reading a passage aloud, the use of context cues, and cloze procedure are some of the techniques that can be used to help students perceive the meaning of a text. The more cues available, the easier the reading is. Teachers need to reinforce the role of the reader as an active participant in the creation of meaning and to emphasize that  what the reader brings to the transaction with the text is as important as what the text itself brings.

In addition, the survey elicited information about the respondents' uses of energy, their attitudes about the energy situation, and their media use in general and specifically for energy information. The results revealed that although subscribers to both daily and weekly newspapers were equally likely to recall reading articles  about energy that appeared in them, significantly higher learning took place for daily newspaper subscribers.

In other contexts, development journalism has been used in a manner similar to that of investigative reporting. Viewed in this manner, the role of the development journalist is to examine critically the existing development programs and projects of a government, compare the planned project with its actual implementation, and report any observed  shortcomings. Any discussion of development journalism is usually emotionally charged. The developing nations claim that the Western journalists are protecting their own capitalistic interests in the world when they attack development journalism as &quot;government say-so journalism.&quot; On the other hand, Western journalists fear that the establishment of the principles of development journalism will mean an end to the freedom to collect information first-hand in foreign countries.

It is, in fact, a scientific activity--much like theorizing in physics, human society, or art. The current state of the art of theory in the drama classroom faces many problems. Most theatre faculty offer courses called &quot;Theory and Criticism&quot; that are just history--the story of theatrical opinion told simply because it was said. Courses that evaluate works of the past and then synthesize them with what is happening today are almost nonexistent. What is lacking are questions that ask not what was said but why, was it accurate, and is it accurate now? There are both an introspective theory of theatre, which is idealistic with no regard for systematic observation, and a scientific  theory, which does not include knowledge of human behavior. For accurate comprehensive theory in theatre, scholars advanced in the techniques of observation and explanation should synthesize and integrate their observations with received theory, and pass this on to students for their own synthesis. Hypotheses advanced in theory must be disposed of, by integration or refutation, and not allowed to simply disappear. We must catch up with what scientists in other disciplines have learned about the mechanisms of behavior, the techniques of inquiry and explanation. (HTH)",

        "description":"In a semiotic study exploring whether the visibility of both ends in a dyadic interaction affected a third party's evaluation of the interactants, subjects evaluated two versions of six simulated employment interviews. The six male applicants for employment simulated overgesticulation, lack of adequate eye contact, moderate aggressiveness, kinesic stillness, fidgeting, and positive aggressiveness. The subjects serving as evaluators of the simulations were 42 undergraduate students and 36 professionals who had rated people as part of their work. Half of the raters saw the version with both the applicants and the interviewers on the screen, while the other half of the raters saw only the applicants. Observers' perceptions of many of the behaviors changed depending on whether the  applicant was viewed alone or within his full interactional context. Physically seeing or not seeing the interviewer greatly influenced raters' perceptions of the interactant to be judged. Hearing the questions to which the applicant replied and knowing there was an interviewer in the actual event was not a sufficient condition for an equal evaluation of both functions. It was difficult to see how semiotic theory could handle the discrepancy in the perception of an identical sign. (RL)",

Two types of metacommunication are discussed: metalinguistic messages, in which there is a temporary shift in awareness from message content to some aspect of the language used to code that content; and framing, which means transforming one kind of event into another kind of event by logical typing. These two domains of metacommunication are analyzed by using examples from the research literature to provide insights about how children develop metacommunicative skills. The discussion of metalinguistic skills focuses on the predictable  development of these skills in preoperational and concrete operational children, noting that the transition from the tendency to centrate in the preoperational stage to decentrate in the concrete operational stage is reflected in metalinguistic performance. The discussion of metacommunicative framing skills revolves around the communicative transformation of one kind of event into a related event through levels of abstraction, and delineates seven types of framing, including quoting, procedural, play, humor, deception, argument, and relationship (symmetry and alternation).

Participant structure was examined in terms of turn taking, spatial arrangement, and teacher management of the event. Content was analyzed in terms of topic and cognitive level. The changes in structure that the teacher made for show and tell from the first observation to the second observation provided a more informal setting, effectively decreasing the status differential between teacher and children. Increased participation on the part of the children resulted, as did an increase in the responsibility of the children for structuring the flow of sharing time. Most of the topics for discussion were objects from home.  Children's contributions increased dramatically under the changed participation structure, while the teacher's contributions decreased correspondingly. In conclusion it was found that the changed goals and structure of sharing time raised both the quantity and the quality of the children's sharing time communication. (HOD)",

Data were collected from 143 speech communication students who were randomly distributed among three groups representing different levels of intimacy (stranger, acquaintance, intimate) and were asked to imagine serious conflict with a person of the corresponding intimacy level. The subjects indicated their likelihood of engaging in 42 different behaviors during an interpersonal conflict. Factor analysis revealed three general conflict strategies: destructive, constructive, and avoidance. ANOVA results showed that acquaintances were significantly more likely than strangers to utilize constructive strategies, and intimates were significantly more likely than acquaintances to use such  strategies. Intimacy level accounted for 17% of the variance in the use of constructive strategies. A main effect was not found for the other two factors. In general, the results suggested moderate support for the hypothesis that greater levels of intimacy are exemplified by greater use of constructive conflict strategies. (Author/RL)",

Some problems pertaining to copyrights may be alleviated by advanced planning, a clear division of responsibilities, and by using reason to determine that policies are workable and fair. The problem involves a growing &quot;product&quot; awareness on the state level, coupled with a need for protection. Copyrights grant exclusive, but not unlimited, rights to the author of original literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and other intellectual works. Eligibility is contingent on two criteria: a fixed, tangible form; and &quot;original, creative authorship.&quot; Among those works that are ineligible for copyright are those produced by the federal government. Statutory copyright has three  levels--notification, deposit, and registration--each with unique stipulations and time limits. Ownership may be transferred in whole or part, and is maintained for the life of the author plus 50 years. Copyrights are limited by &quot;fair use,&quot; which depends on the purpose of the use, the length of the portions used, the nature of the work, and the effect of the use on the work's market value. Owner permission is the key to effective copyright use. To avoid conflict, communication concerning copyrights must take place prior to contractual commitment. (JK)",

Part 1 of this paper presents, in order, the most important functional relationships between the state and higher education, indicating the authoritative sources relating to each, and citing some of the principal omissions in the research. It concludes with an analysis of the overall research on the major agencies and their interrelationships. The important relationships covered are in the areas of budgeting, program review, planning, and information systems. The relationship between private colleges and  universities and the state is also covered. Part 2 describes trends and issues currently confronting higher education that will influence the direction of state roles and functions over the next two decades. These trends affect enrollments, the faculty, the economy, and the society. Part 3 summarizes the major issues and the research needs. A bibliography is included. (Author/IRT)",

While reviewing these vignettes, the reader is encouraged to keep the following specific questions in mind: (1) What content is desirable for the learner? (2) How much of said content is to be prescribed? (3) Is curriculum decision-making centralized or decentralized? (4) Who is to decide the &quot;what,&quot; the &quot;how much,&quot; and the &quot;how&quot;? As the scenarios are placed on a continuum, varying degrees of centralization become apparent. Curriculum activity occurs at several levels of remoteness from the learner. A hierarchy of decision-making becomes evident when the settings are closely scrutinized. In some cases extensive teacher involvement in deciding the&quot;what&quot; takes place, in others the curricular decisions are made by total school staffs under the leadership of the principal or of personnel from the central office, and in others the decision-making becomes the responsibility of school boards and departments of education. In reality, there is often overlap among these levels. (Author/IRT)",

A discussion of the second element, the status of the information base for R&amp;D, follows. A third important element is the establishment of priorities for topics. Data are presented on topics frequently requested by users of information and on topics now being researched. The report recommends establishing priorities based on the discrepancy between topics well documented in the information base  and topics requested by those concerned with women's educational equity. The kind and amount of R&amp;D in the future partially depends on the extent to which women receive advanced degrees, obtain faculty positions, author and publish papers, and assume leadership roles within the profession. A discussion of these factors concludes the report. (Author/MLF)",

The paper attempts to present a brief look at the same issues surveyed in the longer report EA 013 118. After warning that economic conditions are hard to assess and still harder to predict, the author asserts that most forecasters agree on one issue: the inevitability of a serious and year-long recession. He cites as evidence President Carter's attempt at austerity measures summed up by the proposal to chop $13 billion from the federal budget and efforts by the Federal Reserve Board to cut inflation by raising interest rates on borrowing. He notes that the housing market, a good predictor of the health of the overall economy, is already in a  depressed state. The author adds that nowhere does the potential for lasting damage from inflation manifest itself more vividly than in the country's classrooms. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"A review and analysis of the economic outlook for the early 1980s, this paper emphasizes the uncertainties that characterize current predictions. It begins with the highlights of the consensus forecast that predicts a mild to moderate recession tapering off after midyear 1980, with a sluggish recovery extending through 1981 and probably 1982. The study reviews the outlook for the early 1980s as predicted by a number of major economic forecasters. It includes an appended background discussion of the nature and methodology of macroeconometric forecasting and points out basic problems and criticisms raised regarding macroeconomic models. With this groundwork, the discussion proceeds to an analysis of major forecasts in a number of areas. Briefly, it predicts that inflation will  continue at double-digit rates, the gross national product will decline in 1980, there will be a recession in consumer spending, interest rates will peak in early 1980, the housing and automobile industries will be sources of weakness, and government sectors will be sources of economic restraint. The author notes that the early 1980s are expected to bring a tapering down of federal aid to education. (Author/JM)",

Attention to the professional nature of teachers and to the problems of education that administrators and teachers must join together to solve can reduce confrontation. Catholic schools and teachers can find further cause to adopt a collaborative approach to bargaining in their common belief in their church and the school's role in the church and its functions. This approach involves recognition of the interests and rights of pastors, parents, and parishioners as well as administrators and teachers. Drawing on employer-employee relationship models developed in Japan, where a sense of community exists similar to that found in the church,  a process has been developed for establishing the goals, tone, participants, and meeting format of bargaining sessions particularly suited to the characteristics of Catholic education. A conflict resolution method is included in the process. (Author/PGD)",

A model for infusing the arts into the established curriculum was created, along with a guide to provide educators with arts strategies for teaching basic learning skills and promoting aesthetic development. The arts infused curriculum model utilizes all the arts (visual arts, drama/theater, dance/movement, and music) in an interrelated way to teach basic learning skills (gross motor development, sensory motor integration, perceptual motor integration, language development, conceptual skills development,  and social skills development) and aesthetic development (awareness, imitation, self initiation, skill development, and critical judgment). In the 3 years of the project, a large volume of data has been accumulated, with test results suggesting the success of the program. The final report covers project rationale, goals and objectives, organization, activities and accomplishments, research and evaluation results, and conclusions and recommendations.

Ss were assigned to four groups: LD/juvenile delinquent, LD, delinquent, and regular students. Differences in social class indicators among groups were determined using the chi-square statistic and Fisher's exact test.

Analysis of teacher data suggested that physician contacts occurred very seldom, although frequency of contact was higher for hyperactivity than for other behavioral disorders. Contact frequency was also higher for teachers of seriously emotionally disturbed students, special class teachers, and teachers at the elementary level. Analysis of the physician data indicated that when physicians do obtain information from teachers, it is most often useful. Data from both groups indicated that contact was no more likely  during followup than at diagnosis. (Author/CL)",

A case study of an autistic child is presented focusing on behavioral change over an 18 month period. Implications for using the BRIAAC and the course of behavioral change in autistic children are discussed. (Author/CL)",

Teacher Ss were divided into two groups, 16 experimental Ss who participated in 6 days of workshop training and served as advocates for 1 to 3 students and 13 control teachers. Student Ss were divided into three groups, 38 target students who received full intervention services, 224 nontarget experimentals who attended the same school but may or may not have received crisis teacher services, and 225 control Ss. Teacher attitude toward behavior disordered students and student attitude toward school were assessed. Data were evaluated by multiple analysis of variance and analysis of variance techniques. Findings showed no  significant differences between the teacher groups on attitude toward working with behavior problem students, that intervention did not affect differences in morale, that there was a decline in the percentage of students dropping out of school, and that the intervention had some measurable effect in student behavior reaction to school.

Ethology is defined as the study of behavior as it occurs in its natural habitat. The four types of questions ethologists ask about behavior, such as what is the immediate causation of a behavior pattern, are discussed. Seven research methodologies, including ad libitum sampling and sequence sampling, are defined. Areas of interest to ethologists and representative studies in the areas are examined. Ethological approaches to psychopathology are reviewed, and the distinction between comparative psychology and ethological studies is made. The ethological view of autism, which emphasizes  nonverbal aspects such as gaze aversion and stereotypic behavior, is explored. (PHR)",

While nearly all high schools offer FL courses, enrollments tend to be higher in suburban schools and in schools with high populations. FL courses are overwhelmingly elective in nature and rank seventh among elective fields in terms of attracting enrollment. Most FL courses are one year in length and most students tend to remain enrolled for only two years. Only 44% of junior high schools offer FL courses. Spanish has the highest first year enrollments but its successive year enrollments are the lowest of the four commonly taught languages. Preference for  succeeding year courses was highest for German followed by French, Latin and Spanish. Female FL enrollment was 47% greater than male enrollment, and females tended to continue foreign language study longer than males. In the context of recent developments in the field of FL education, the data seem to encourage an optimistic outlook for long-range planning. (Author/JB)",

The first step, the acoustic link, generates a keyword based on the sound of the foreign word. The second step, the imagery link, ties the keyword to the meaning of the item to be learned, via an interactive visual image or other association. An experiment assessed the effectiveness of this technique. Participants were 60 Army enlisted personnel, 20 from each of three ranges of general technical aptitude. The subjects learned the English translations of 15 Korean vocabulary terms at a self-paced rate. Half the subjects in each group were instructed in the keyword technique and were supplied keywords for each vocabulary item, while the remaining subjects served as a control  group. According to the most representative criterion, the keyword group performed 79% better than the control group. (Author/JB)",

Section I deals with the observation phase; Section II focuses on the teaching practicum. Within each section, a wide variety of techniques and activities are suggested to provide as many ideas as possible to help student teachers deal with the demands of a given placement. The following topics are covered: (1) developing a working relationship with the cooperating teacher in the observation phase; (2) meeting and interacting with other members of the school community; (3) interacting with the students during the practicum; and (4) utilizing the textbook, making lesson plans, and using supplementary aids and materials. Three appendices  include sample letters of expectation, some typical questions asked of the foreign language teacher in the interview at the end of the methods course, and competencies to develop within the school community.

        "description":"Second language students may develop writing skills gradually, or they may learn and practice these skills through the use of sentence combining techniques. A study is reported of the consistent use of sentence combining exercises with intermediate language classes at the university level. A total of 325 students enrolled in intermediate French, German, and Spanish classes were included in the experiment. For each language, three classes served as the experimental group and three as the control group. Both control and experimental groups were taught according to a modified audiolingual method and both used the same texts. However, the experimental classes practiced sentence combining and did fewer reading selections. The results supported the claim that consistent sentence  combining practice accelerates the acquisition of writing skills and enables the student to use more advanced syntactic patterns sooner than s/he would if left to develop the skill in a less systematic way. The discussion of the experiment includes suggestions for using sentence combining techniques in the classroom. A large number of examples of sentence combining exercises in French, German, and Spanish, arranged in progressive order of difficulty, concludes the volume. (AMH)",
