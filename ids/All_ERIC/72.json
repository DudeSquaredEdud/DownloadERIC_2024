        "description":"This paper presents data gathered from three countries. Samples of students of high-school age from Japan (N-l700), India (N-1446) and Illinois (N-9582) completed the High School Mathematics Test, and, at the same time, responded to a questionnaire designed to measure various demographic and psychological variables. This paper reports not only on mathematics achievement for the three samples, but also examines the relationship of mathematics achievement with nine &quot;background&quot; variables, namely, students' gender, age, amount of instruction in mathematics, amount of discussion about school work with parents, frequency of reading during leisure time, self-evaluation of reading ability, level of test anxiety, attributions for success and failure, and the importance accorded the test.  Results indicate differences among the samples in mathematics achievement, and, in addition, difference among them in the relative influence exerted by the background variables on students' achievement in mathematics.

The analyses of student achievement were based on pretest and posttest data from seven of the participating countries and a single-test condition from the remaining l3 countries. Data were obtained from items which addressed the areas of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, measurement, and statistics. An extensive questionnaire, which also contained five subscales, was used to measure student attitudes toward mathematics. The subscales focused on: (l) mathematics as process; (2) home support; (3) mathematics and society; (4) mathematics and myself; and (5) gender stereotyping. The pattern of achievement  results indicated that girls were more successful than boys in Belgium, Thailand, Finland and Hungary but least so in France, Nigeria, Israel, and the Netherlands. With regard to attitude measures, the largest differences between countries and sexes occurred for the scale, gender stereotyping. Summaries are provided in table and graph form. (ML)",

        "description":"The status of high school students' mathematics and science preparation and the existence of gender inequities in such courses were investigated in this study of Rhode Island secondary schools. A stratefied random sampling of districts was taken to include schools demographically representative of the state's population. Course enrollment data from the senior classes of 1985 were used (N=1111). The data were analyzed to determine: (l) the number of females and males who had enrolled in each mathematics and science course; (2) the percentage of each gender enrolled in these courses; and (3) the average grades received by males and by females in the mathematics and science courses. Survey results indicated that the l985 female and male graduates took similar numbers and types of  mathematics and science courses. Female enrollment in both upper level mathematics courses and in science courses, except in General Science and Physics, was either equal to or greater than male enrollment. In addition to choosing as many high level courses as their male classmates, young women in the sample tended to receive higher grades than their male counterparts. Brief case studies of the six schools surveyed and analyses of their data are also included. Appended are tables showing mathematics and science courses taken in high school by the class of 1985 and mathematics and science grades received by students at six Rhode Island high schools. (ML)",

        "description":"This paper reports research into the linguistic and extra-linguistic or social-cognitive structure of problem presentation contexts. The effects of textual and social syntax were investigated, including the specific structure of the problem text by which situations, processes, actions, and number relations are implicitly or explicitly expressed, questioned, and commented upon. Also investigated was the nature of the pragmatic and social psychological context (case studies). The paper outlines and discusses an interrelated set of studies showing that: (1) subject matter related to, or factual attitudes toward a problem frequently don't play an important part in problem solving; (2) students often solve problems correctly without understanding them; (3) directionality and goals of  problem solving processes strongly interact with textual and contextual cues; and (4) false contextual expectations can lead to abstruse errors of understanding and strange solution paths. The results are discussed as an analysis of social-cognitive behavior, in which the classroom is described as a format, a social-cognitive matrix, and a metacognitive matrix. Issues raised include questions about students' epistemic control behavior, and the personality of the problem solver. References, figures, and tables are appended. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Differences in science achievement between males and females have been examined either directly or indirectly in a variety of studies. This investigation reviewed a quantitative synthesis of correlational research on science affect, ability, and achievement conducted by Steinkamp and Maehr. Their findings were reassessed by employing a meta-analysis approach which used tests for fitting categorical models to effect sizes. The reexamination focused on explanations of the reported differences in science achievement between males and females as well as on the role of measurement variables in the size of the gender differences. Results indicated that though gender differences tended to favor males, even significant differences were slight, and gender differences for many subsets of  studies were not significant. The size of the gender difference depended in part on the science subject matter being tested and also on the type of measure used in the studies.

Pages in this section are divided into three columns: (1) content or topical outline of the course; (2) summaries of relevant basic knowledge, research findings, and current areas of inquiry about sex and gender; and (3) discussion topics  and possible assignments. Topics are cross-referenced to pages in the second section where a summary of information for a given curriculum course can be found. Intended to create a greater awareness of the ways in which sex bias and gender stereotyping occur through classroom interaction, the second set of guidelines, \"Guidelines for Student-Faculty Communication,\" consists of two subsections. The first, \"Student-Faculty Communication Patterns,\" identifies and discusses types of faculty interactions that may inadvertently promote ethnic or sexual bias. The second, \"The Student Perception Questionnaire,\" is designed to provide faculty with student perceptions of the interactions occurring in individual classrooms. A bibliography of over 40 related references concludes the report.  (LH)",

In the elementary schools girls still are perceived more favorably than boys, disciplined less harshly, and graded more generously than boys; but boys receive more attention, encouragement, and constructive criticism. Boys emerge from this environment ready to move ahead and surpass their female classmates. Girls bring to their future education and career plans a habit of playing it safe and a collection of nagging doubts about their own abilities which often persist in contradiction to their exceptional grades. If this cycle of inequity and lack of confidence is to be broken,  teachers and administrators on all levels must provide visible public leadership so that the community at large will be educated about the essential link between equity and excellence.

Two hundred seventy-five students (ages 14-18) from Poland, West Germany, and the United States defined peace and indicated the degree of influence they felt they have on the future. Differences in definitions of peace, optimism, and degree of influence on the future were found among the various personality types as designated by the Myers-Briggs Type indicator. The survey instrument (Peace Issues: Attitudes and Values Questionnaire) was a Likert-scale of 45 items designed to identify definitions of peace, student attitudes toward peace, and the degree of influence the student feels he/she has on the future.

These changes include: use of legal means to regulate behavior, acceptance of technical medical services such as heart transplants, and diminished importance of farm work to the economy of the community. However, the Old Order Amish constitute a bastion of stability within the larger society. This stability is expressed in the use of draft horses instead of farm machinery, horse and buggy instead of automobile, oil lamp instead of electric lamp, home-produced food instead of commercially processed food, and in families of eight to ten children instead of the usual one to three. In addition, marriage is permanent because divorce is not recognized, and a  literal interpretation of the Bible is applied to all areas of life. This means that when civil laws run counter to sacred belief, such as the mandate for Social Security taxes and inspection for enforcement of building codes, civil disobedience is practiced. (BZ)",

The traditional view of newspapers' superiority has been challenged by those investigators who hold that the determinant factors rest with individuals--their motivation, their political orientation, and their ability to derive information from any source. Additional questions surround the difference between media exposure or use, and reliance or dependence upon those media. Some exposure may be passive, habitual, while other exposure is active, selective and analytical. All these factors are involved in the relationships between media use and social perceptions. This study examines the  relationship between different measures of media use, reliance and social perceptions in the context of the continuing struggle in South Africa as reported in U.S. media. For black college students, media use and reliance play only a marginal role in the formation of impressions about the conflict. A reference list and six data tables are appended. (Author/TRS)",

Concentrating upon recent literature, this report explores current trends and policies in teacher testing. A review of what tests measure and how tests are being used is included. The negative impact of testing on the minority teaching populations is stressed. Underrepresented in the current teaching force, ethnic minorities are projected to become majority student populations in states like Texas and California. Causes of failure of ethnic minorities, remediation efforts in some states, and legal decisions which have played a major role in the reform movement and in testing are reviewed. Solutions being applied to the testing reform movement are  discussed with futuristic planning which could bring about better cooperative efforts in a national climate of great diversity in the 50 states. The results of a national survey on the use of teacher tests and their impact on ethnic minorities are included. The final part of the study is a review and critique of the validation process done in Texas to support the use of the Pre-Professional Skills Test as an entrance examination for teacher education programs. Conclusions are drawn on legal and ethical issues in testing and the fairness of current tests in regard to minority teachers. A 17-page list of references, charts and graphs providing information on the current status of testing in the United States, and the survey instrument are appended. (Author/JD)",

The narrowly defined academic majors of many colleges and universities were considered potential liabilities in achieving a comprehensive science or social studies teaching degree. For a 1-year period, final quarter secondary science and social studies students were given the National Teachers Examination (NTE) Specialty Tests for their respective fields as a measure to assess academic preparation of students with narrow focused majors. In addition, analysis of students' courses of study provided information about students' efforts to broaden their education. Our findings established that  those enrolled in the Teacher Certification Program, with rigorous entrance requirements and limited enrollment, are a cohort of predominantly postbaccalaureate students with extensive preparation in their fields. The students' NTE scores ranked in the 80-90th percentile nationally, suggesting they were well prepared academically to teach the broader context assignments in the secondary schools. (Author)",

The studies met the following criteria: (1) they used student ratings as the primary source of feedback; (2) they investigated post-secondary instruction; (3) they were conducted in the classroom rather than laboratory settings; (4) they employed a control group for comparison purposes; and (5) they stood apart from larger training programs in which the effects of feedback are inseparable from the effects of training. Results indicated that feedback from student ratings alone produces a positive but small effect on subsequent ratings. When ratings  were accompanied by consultation and/or other types of feedback, considerably larger positive effects were likely. In the few studies of feedback's effects on student achievement and affect, results were less clear. Future research should: (1) investigate additional dependent variables; (2) more carefully document and investigate feedback implementations; and (3) explore additional characteristics of the recipients of feedback.

Then, a personal account of a beginning teacher's views of and experience with clinical supervision is offered. It is concluded that clinical supervision, peer or otherwise, is bound to be misinterpreted and to give disappointing results if one asks whether it will do a better job with the familiar purposes of supervision. Neither the shortage of offical supervisors nor the apparent need to improve teaching are reasons to adopt peer clinical supervision. If a climate can be created  in which teachers can genuinely explore the meaning and potential of &quot;reflection-in-action&quot; for improving their practice, then peer clinical supervision is a powerful way for the observation and analysis of teaching to proceed.

A brief overview and analysis of the Napa-Vacaville Follow Through Research Project describes the program designed to improve student engaged rates and achievement at two Chapter 1 target schools. The &quot;hard data&quot; is summarized and a discussion is then presented on 10 themes that emerged from the project and that combined into a tapestry of school improvement revealing how attitudes changed over the four year period. The themes are: (1) collegiality; (2) knowledge about teaching strategies; (3) sense of personal efficacy; (4) changes in cognition about teaching; (5) changes in teachers'/principals' perceptions  about their own learning needs; (6) environmental norms which support experimentation; (7) changes in the workplace; (8) changes in student outcomes; (9) changes in perception of the school in the community; and (10) perceptions about why the project worked from the participants' point of view. Conclusions are drawn about critical factors affecting project development, training, implementation and maintenance. Recommendations are made for replicating the project. (JD)",

The studies sought to illuminate: (1) the attractors and deterrents to teaching; (2) teacher recruitment and selection processes; (3) mobility and attrition patterns of teachers; and (4) the conditions in which teachers work. Findings indicated: (1) teachers still are motivated primarily because of the intrinsic rewards of working with children or adolescents; (2) many teachers are presently  negative role models for recruiting new teachers; (3) school systems have not actively recruited education students and teachers; (4) school systems may recruit better teachers by assisting promising students in pursuit of graduate degrees; (5) in the past, recruitment of teachers has been facilitated by eased entry; (6) increased incentives are important because they are a direct expression of how society values education; and (7) the conditions in which teachers work and the lessons students learn while in public school are the primary forces in today's teacher labor market.

Presently, and for many years, colleges of education have seen the public schools as little more than places for student teachers to practice newly learned skills. University-public school relationships must be assessed and improved so that the two are equal partners in the business of preparing educators and renewing schools. Reforms proposed by the recent education reports for either the public schools or for teacher education progams will be of limited value and effect without fundamental changes in public school-university relationships.

An examination is made of how the policy making process translated the various sets of recommendations into the final legislative language requiring testing for the certification of new teachers beginning July 1, 1988. Personal interviews with some of the individuals who played key roles in the drafting of legislation, as well as those who will have primary responsibilities in the implementation process are featured.  The third part discusses the legal, political, equity, and validation ramifications associated with testing new teachers, and how the Illinois Certification Testing System will attempt to address these issues.

The third chapter examines the various elements involved in the governance of teacher education and explores collaborative relationships among participating partners. Chapter four considers the array of questions embedded in preservice, inservice, and continuing teacher preparation and highlights the concept of adequate \"life space\" within which teacher educators can conduct effective initial preparation and subsequent life-long efforts at  professional proficiency. Recommendations are made for the education of teacher educators. In the fifth chapter, issues of individual and institutional quality control are considered and their implications for certification, program approval, recruitment and selection, and teacher supply and demand are discussed.

The research question asked was: \"What impact would current policy reforms such as career ladders and merit pay have on the career choices of college students who were presently not choosing to enter the occupation of public school teaching?\" Interviews were conducted with 80 students in the major fields of business, chemistry, mathematics, physics, engineering, biology, psychology, sociology, and English. Information was obtained on the students': (1) motivations, experiences, and expectations; (2) choice of subject matter, skills, values, and perceptions of teaching; and (3) public school experience; also  investigated were conditions under which they might consider teaching as a career. Teaching conditions appeared to have a negative impact on these students. It is concluded that the sole addition of increased pecuniary rewards and opportunities for advancement for teachers may have an adverse effect on the teacher labor market. Among recommendations offered for educational policy makers is the need to allow for greater teacher control and less bureaucratic intrusion.

The perspective is illustrated by an overview of the research-centered staff development work done in the beginning months of the Teachers' Conceptual Change in Practice Project. In the first half of the paper the author provides an overview of the staff development approach and defines key concepts of narrative understanding and enacted curriculum. The second half of the paper presents a social constructivist model of the social and academic dimensions of classroom tasks and illustrates the model with an example of a first-grade seatwork assignment. The paper argues that effective teaching necessarily involves mutual adaptation by  teacher and student so that the social and academic task presented to the student fits the student's current mode and level of functioning. This adaptation requires the teacher's capacity through narrative understanding to conduct fine-tuned, on-the-spot analysis of the enacted curriculum of the moment as it is being experienced by students, and it also requires the teacher to possess the authority to alter classroom tasks to fit the learners who confront the tasks. The paper focuses more on the nature of the classroom tasks, and on teachers' understanding of and options for their construction, than it does on the notion of time spent by students in working at tasks.

The supervisors were attached to two teacher education programs based within two universities which differed in the structure of their teacher education programs and, to some extent, in the way student teaching was approached. Supervisors from one university had come up through the system as teachers, cooperating teachers, and then supervisors, and as a group were more experienced than the other group, which consisted of a full-time supervisor, a faculty member, and three graduate students. The study describes the supervisors' backgrounds, the teacher education program of which they were a part, their views of  their place within that program, and their feedback to their student teachers. In interviews, the supervisors were questioned on their own experiences and attitudes toward teaching and student teaching, the role and activities of university supervisors, cooperating teachers, student teaching, and teacher education. A discussion is presented of various weaknesses in the supervision of student teachers, and conclusions are drawn on the positive or negative aspects of the relationships within the triad of student teacher, cooperating teacher, and university supervisor.

The common wisdom concerning the role of the liberal arts in teacher preparation is explored, along with some of the essential contributions, and important limitations of these contributions. The often overlooked concept of the structure of knowledge as a key feature of the contribution of the liberal arts to the teacher education curriculum is elaborated upon.

An analysis of the concept of pedagogy, combined with research about teachers and teaching and an awareness of the social conditions of teaching, can be used to construct a compelling case for a wide-ranging contribution of liberal education to teacher preparation. Even methods courses can be improved by appropriate contributions from the liberal arts and sciences.

CTP was designed to determine if research findings could be used to improve practice and whether practitioners in a school setting were receptive to knowledge derived from research procedures. A major concern was the effect of staff developers' behaviors upon teachers with whom they worked, and the effects of teachers' behaviors on pupil outcomes. The CTP study used research on teaching findings as content for a planned intervention. Research on teacher and school change was used as the basis for a delivery system for that content. These two bodies of information  were combined into a specific change strategy which was introduced to staff development persons in an ongoing school setting and reinforced twice in that setting. The implementation of the CTP study demonstrated the possibilities (and problems) associated with attempting to introduce research findings into school and classroom settings through an intervention aimed at school leaders.

Eight teachers in three school districts were videotaped over the course of a semester and were interviewed for a total of approximately 20 hours (using a variety of techniques, including stimulated recall and &quot;repertory grid&quot; interview techniques). The first chapter of the report develops a conceptual framework for the analysis of beliefs, drawing on recent research on the nature of cognition in complex or &quot;entangled&quot; environments. The second chapter describes the contexts of the three schools in which the teachers were observed, and discusses the possible implications of these  settings for teachers' practices. The third chapter presents a set of eight case studies describing the nature and operations of a core set of the beliefs of the teachers in the sample.

The major conference goals were: (1) the identification of the current pressing issues facing teacher education; (2) the structuring of priority recommendations and critical warnings that should be addressed in the immediate future by policymakers, practitioners, and researchers in teacher education; and (3) the facilitation of communication among those who form policy in teacher  education, those who educate teachers at institutions of higher learning and elsewhere, and those who conduct research in teacher education. The culminating sessions of the conference focused on and highlighted work currently unfolding at the state level. This publication contains papers commissioned by the conference from scholars in each of the teacher education areas of preservice, induction, and inservice. Within each area, the three perspectives of policy, practice and research were provided by colleagues. (JD)",

Three major points of agreement formed the basis for considerations: (1) Teacher education should be viewed as occurring across the professional continuum; (2) Improvement in teacher education is directly tied to improvements in the conditions and status of teaching; and (3) Improving teacher education requires that policymakers, teacher educators, teachers, and researchers work together to develop a shared language and understanding of the complex and multifaceted phenomena occurring across  the profesiional called teacher education. The information presented in this monograph is divided into three areas: preservice teacher education, induction teacher education, and inservice teacher education. Included are statements of specific goals for each area, as well as recommendations and critical warnings.

        "description":"The Holmes Group, a consortium of deans and a number of chief academic officers from research institutions in each of the 50 states, is organized around the twin goals of the reform of teacher education and the reform of the teaching profession. Members of the group represent colleges of teacher education that are the leading research institutions in their respective states and regions. The study and consensus-building deliberations of this group over the past several years culminated in the release of this report. Necessary guidelines for the future work of the reform-minded group emerged during this period of intense discussion and consultation. A common agenda, shared understandings, and a broad outline for action commitments have been defined. The shared goals, understanding,  and action commitments described in the body of this report will guide the refinement and gradual implementation phase of the consortium, bringing great specificity to the standards development work across the next several years. The stated goals of The Holmes Group are to: (1) make the education of teachers intellectually more solid; (2) recognize differences in teachers' knowledge, skill, and commitment, in their education, certification, and work; (3) create standards of entry to the profession; examinations and educational requirements that are professionally relevant and intellectually defensible; (4) connect the group's institutions with schools; and (5) make schools better places for teachers to work and learn. Appendices include a description of The Holmes Group, lists of  participants, and working drafts of goals for The Holmes Group standards. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper demonstrates the relationship between the concept of unidimensionality and direction of an item in a multidimensional space. The basic premise is that if items that measure in the same direction are combined to form a test, that test will meet the item response theory requirements of unidimensionality. This will be true even if the items measuring in the same direction measure more than one psychological construct. A form of the ACT Mathematics Usage Test was analyzed using the multidimensional extension of the two-parameter logistic model to determine the direction for each item using the multidimensional difficulty formulated by Reckase. Using the direction, three unidimensional sets of items were formed and one multidimensional item set. The performance of 1,000  examinees on these items sets was analyzed using LOGIST 5 to determine the fit of the three-parameter logistic model to the data and the relationship of the unidimensional ability estimates and item parameter estimates to the multidimensional counterparts. Overall, the results strongly support the conception of unidimensionality suggested by a common direction in the multidimensional space for a set of items and the use of multidimensional difficulty statistics in forming unidimensional item sets.

Data analyzed were the overall recommendation for acceptance and ratings on seven quality criteria from each reviewer on each paper proposal in 1983, 1985, and 1986. The Casons' model fit each year's data. Significant rater stringency variance was found for each of the three years. Rater stringency persisted up to three years providing strong construct validation for the model. Removing the rater stringency effect improved reliabilities from .768, .722, and .739 to .813, .790 and .790. Construct validities also improved. Had adjusted  ratings been used in 1986, up to 6 of the 35 papers accepted would have been rejected. There were no significant differences in mean rater standards year to year; however, mean paper proposal quality was sharply lower in 1985. In all years, mean paper quality of accepted proposals was significantly better than that of rejected proposals. Access to adjusted ratings at the time of the selection decision would ease the committee's task and probably improve the quality of its decisions. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"This paper presents criteria for establishing the trustworthiness of naturalistic inquiries, and specific techniques to facilitate their achievement or determine the degree of their achievement. The following criteria are briefly described: fairness; and ontological, educative, catalytic and tactical authenticity. Explored in greater detail, fairness is achieved: (1) as a balance between harm and good; (2) when harm is minimized and/or gain is maximized; (3) when circumstances allow for mutual advantage; (4) when all parties are equally free to act in self-deemed appropriate ways; and (5) when established rules are heeded. Four criteria for achieving fairness include: fair negotiations; appellate mechanism availability; informed consent regarding inquiry procedures; and assiduous  use of member-checks. The fairness criterion may be violated through deception; withholding information; collusion; arbitrariness in exercise of power; abrogation of rules or defaults; misconstruction of the definition of fairness; and breakdown in the apellate system. To achieve fairness in an inquiry, the inquirer must assume an impartial posture; provide relevant data collection; assess all parties at risk to be certain the inquiry deals with all relevant factors; refuse to withold information; be an educative agent; deliver a negotiation agenda; and act as convener and chief mediator of negotiations.

Eight randomly equivalent samples of high school seniors were each given a unique form of the ACT Assessment Mathematics Usage Test (ACTM). Students without requisite math courses were deleted from the samples to control the possible confounding effect of differences in instruction at the high school level. Based on the remaining students, signed measures of DIP were obtained for each item in the eight ACTM forms. These DIP estimates were then investigated in a six by eight (item category by firm) experimental design. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures, a significant  item category effect was found indicating a relationship between item characteristics and gender-based DIP. Follow-up analyses suggested that geometry and mathematics reasoning items had the largest negative impact on female examinees and more algorithmic, computation-oriented items were relatively easier for females.

Measures were made of teacher performance using the revised version of the TPAI. Learner ability was assessed with the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking in order to equate classes. Learner achievement was assessed with the Middle Grades Integrated Process Skill Test. Results show that: (1) the aggregation of summative  judgments used in the TPAI scoring can be a valid and reliable procedure; (2) intermediate levels of scoring such as the TPAI competencies are more desirable than total instrument scores; (3) the total is a more reliable, but less valid, indicator of effectiveness; and (4) validity and dependability coefficients are adequate evidence to support the validity and reliability of the competency scores. Caution should be excerised in inferring causality of these teacher behaviors or learner outcomes based on these results. (PN)",

The original sample consisted of 991 grade 11 and 12 students from two suburban high schools in Ottawa, Canada. Following deletion of missing data, the final sample size was 832 (412 males, 420  females). Different SC structures were found for males and females. The number and nature of the facets of SC were similar, but the hierarchical relations among the facets differed. Moreover, grades could be discriminated from their corresponding subject-specific SCs (i.e., subject-specific SC is not an alternate report of grades). Finally, girls obtained higher grades in English and mathematics than boys, but their mathematics SCs were significantly lower. (PN)",

The specific purpose was to determine the extent to which preadmissions measures such as high school grade point average (GPA) and admissions test scores could be used to predict college GPA. Multiple regression was used to maximize the correlation between the criterion variable (GPA) and predictor variables (preadmissions measures). Results indicate that cumulative GPA and major GPA of the presented samples of UCI Engineering and ICS majors can be reliably predicted using a linear combination of two preadmissions measures: high school  GPA and the College Board Mathematics Achievement Test. None of the other three predictor variables (Scholastic Aptitude Test-Mathematics, Scholastic Aptitude Test-Verbal, and the College Board English Composition Achievement Test) added significantly to the predictions. Some shrinkage in the size of multiple correlations is expected when the equations of this study are applied to subsequent samples. However, in general, colleges that use the SAT and the high school record to predict freshmen GPA generally find that the results are fairly stable from year to year. (PN)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on the questions which arise as test practitioners monitor score scales derived from latent trait theory. Large scale assessment programs are dynamic and constantly challenge the assumptions and limits of latent trait models. Even though testing programs evolve, test scores must remain reliable indicators of progress. Fundamental questions relate to the extent that score shifts may be due to changes in achievement or to the way in which achievement is measured. Over time a number of measurement concerns have been raised as item calibrations and score scales are monitored. These concerns are related to the effect on score scales due to item selection procedures and changes in the content of the tests. The following questions are discussed: (1) Can equating  procedures accommodate changes in curriculum and test content? (2) What are the effects of variations in item format, population, and test administration? (3) What are the effects of different item difficulty distributions on score scales? (4) Which estimation procedure or latent trait model best fits the data? and (5) How can the meaning of test scores be enhanced? (PN)",

        "description":"Four methods for determining the dimensionality of a set of test items were compared: (1) linear factor analysis; (2) residual analysis; (3) nonlinear factor analysis; and (4) Bejar's method. Five artificial test data sets (for 40 items and 1500 examinees) were generated, consistent with the three-parameter logistic model and the assumption of either a one- or a two-dimensional latent space. Two variables were manipulated: the correlation between the traits (either .10 or .60) and the percent of test items measuring each trait (either 50 percent measuring each trait, or 75 percent measuring the first trait and 25 percent measuring the second trait). The results indicated that linear factor analysis in all instances overestimated the number of underlying dimensions in the data.  Nonlinear factor analysis, with linear and quadratic terms, led to the correct determination of the item dimensionality in the three data sets where it was used. Both residual analysis and Bejar's method provided disappointing results. The results suggested the need for extreme caution in using linear factor analysis, residual analysis, and the Bejar method, until further investigations confirm their adequacy. Nonlinear factor analysis appeared to be the most promising of the four methods. (Author/GDC)",

The effects of personalizing the cover letter and of including anonymous pre-coded personal information on the questionnaire were studied in a 2 X 2 factorial design which also allowed for an interaction effect. Reminder cards were sent two weeks later. All questionnaires contained pre-coded personal data. There were four treatment conditions: (1) personal letter and no option to remove pre-coded personal data; (2) personal letter and option to remove data; (3) formal letter and no option to remove data; and (4) formal letter and option to remove data. Thirty-nine percent of the  questionnaires were returned. Results showed no interactive effect between the kind of cover letter sent and whether or not subjects were given the option of tearing off the pre-coded personal data. In addition, respondents who were given the option to remove the pre-coded data did not exercise that option. There was no difference in the response rate according to the type of cover letter or whether or not pre-coded information could be removed. (GDC)",

        "description":"The problem of determining optimal test lengths with fixed total testing time has proved to be a difficult one for criterion-referenced test developers. An algorithm is needed which can be used by test developers to allocate available testing time to maximize the validity of their total criterion-referenced tests or testing programs. To be maximally useful, the algorithm should allow test developers to specify: (1) the various informational needs they have in relation to the objectives measured by a test or the uses they have for several tests in their testing program; and (2) the relative importance that they attach to their informational needs. This paper describes such an algorithm for determining the number of items to measure each objective in a criterion-referenced test  when testing time is fixed and when the objectives, in general, vary in their levels of importance, reliability, and validity. Four examples in the paper highlight possible applications of the procedure. While the offered solution is simple to apply, it is only applicable when basic psychometric data are available on the scores at the objective level and when the objective scores are being used to make descriptive statements about examinee performance.

Results from a sample of 218 individuals aged from 8 to 14 showed that some components of intimacy develop earlier than other components; and that traditional sex differences in intimacy are better explained as sex role differences in which females and androgynous males form a homogeneous high intimacy group, while sex-typed  males score significantly lower. Sex-typed individuals also seem more likely than androgynous individuals to view aspects of friendship as appropriate for one sex over the other. Results from a sample of 52 college undergraduates suggest that high intimacy in pre-college years may be associated with high levels of ego identity at the end of adolescence.

As such, it takes as a basic premise that previous and current practices in reporting reliability estimates for essay tests have certain shortcomings. The study provides an analysis of these shortcomings--partly to encourage a fuller understanding of the concept of reliability as applied to essay testing, and partly to build the case that the framework of generalizability theory offers a much more satisfactory way of characterizing the concept. The study applies generalizability theory to existing research to illustrate that this approach is an improvement over the usual methods of estimating essay reliability. The paper also argues that the classical approach to reliability has lead to a  preoccupation with inter-marker agreement which in turn has led to a formulation of the \"reliability problem\" that makes it not susceptible of solution. Conceptual grounds for tolerating inter-marker disagreement are advanced and the paper discusses conditions under which this may be so. However, the paper explains how generalizability theory remains an appropriate framework for estimating the reliability of essay scores whatever assumptions one chooses to make regarding inter-marker consistency.

Specifically, the goals of the research were to describe a newly developed method known as the &quot;plot method&quot; for identifying potentially biased test items and to conduct several methodological investigations associated with applying the plot method. Following an introduction to the theory which forms the basis for the three-parameter logistic model and the model itself, the plot method first described by Shepard was presented. Advantages of the plot method were that (1) the problem of sample size was controlled for through the baseline plots; (2) the baseline plots provided a basis for interpreting the  importance of particular independent variables on the invariance property of item difficulty parameter estimates; and (3) the concept of replication could replace the concept of statistical significance testing. The plot method resulted in reasonably stable determinations of potentially biased test items with small samples. Other methods with small sample sizes were not as successful. Methodological findings provided direction for future applications of the plot method. References and figures are appended. (Author/PN)",

Major ideas are summarized and factors hindering applications of G theory in research conducted in French-speaking Europe are presented. The principle of symmetry affirms that any factor of a design can be selected as an object of measurement and that the G theory operations defined for one factor can be transposed in the study of other factors. The principle allows the extension of G theory to situations based on complex factorial designs and involves multiple purposes of measurement in three major directions: (1) consideration of all types of facets; (2) analysis of multifaceted populations; and (3) development of a general framework for  analysis. Widespread application of G theory is unlikely to occur until specialists in program evaluation develop procedures for integrating the collection and analysis of quantitative data with the application of quantitative methods of investigation. One of the most potentially useful applications of generalizability theory is the procedures it provides for using data from an initial study to determine improvements of the design to be used in subsequent research or in decision making.

The specific purposes are to describe: (1) an up-to-date set of promising and useful methods for addressing a variety of goodness of fit questions; and (2) current research studies to advance this set of methods. Promising goodness of fit methods are organized around three main categories: (1) checks on the extent to which test data fit model assumptions; (2) investigations of item and ability invariance; and (3) model-test data fit studies. Two current investigations of the researchers were also reviewed: the use of non-linear factor analysis to address the assumption of unidimensionality, and new methodologies for addressing  questions of item invariance. The recommended strategy for assessing model-data fit is to accumulate a considerable amount of evidence that can be used to aid in the determination of the appropriateness of a particular use of an item response model. Since a researcher can not prove that a test measures a construct, it was concluded that the more evidence accumulated, the more informed the final decision will be about the use of an item response model.

Major explanatory variables which emerged from the present analyses as predictors of all of the relationships of interest, fall into a small number of categories. Results indicated that there are considerable differences between Catholic and public schools on these outcomes, differences which favor Catholic schools. These analyses show that three sets of factors can effectively explain those cross-sector differences: (1)  variation in the social content of schools; (2) variation in the academic and disciplinary climate among schools; and (3) variation in curricular offerings and requirements. Previous research results concluded that Catholic schools induce consistently higher mean achievement and that mean course enrollment in their students must be somewhat refined. The Catholic schools' advantage in mean school mathematics achievement and the more equitable distribution of that achievement appears to be explainable by the described school-related factors. It was concluded that Catholic sector advantages are explainable by a reasonably modest set of school characteristics and policies. References, tables and figures are provided.

The audit team spent one day in each school to verify the extent to which each school had been successful in  implementing the correlates. Methods of gathering data included interviewing faculty, counselors, students, and administrators, as well as informally observing classes in session, patterns of student movement, use of school facilities, and the interaction among students and between students and teachers.

The system, a multilevel, microprocessor-based computer network, administered tests in a sequential, fixed length format for the purpose of comparing the effect of mode of administration of test items (computerized versus paper-and-pencil). Since the one-parameter and three-parameter logistic models were both determined to be acceptable, the less expensive one-parameter model was used. The results indicated that, in spite of hardware problems, the system design was viable and that microcomputers could be used to administer achievement tests in an  instructional program environment. Some items were found to operate differently when administered on a computer screen as compared to a paper-and-pencil administration. Further research was suggested to determine the cause of the differences in item performance. A 23-item attitude survey, which is appended, was administered to a sample of 136 trainees. The trainees generally had no difficulty taking the test on the computer, and 62 percent indicated that they enjoyed it. (Author/GDC)",

        "description":"Tinto's conceptual schema of college dropout forms the theoretical framework for the development of a model of university student dropout intention. This study validated Tinto's model in two different departments within a single university. Analyses were conducted on a sample of 684 college freshmen in the Education and Economics Department. A Program Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) was developed and given to all students at two universities. The response rate was 55 and 72 percent, respectively. PEQ is composed of 260 items forming 44 variables, measured on five-point scales, semantic differentials, and dichotomous categories. The model variables included: (1) background variables (school achievement); (2) commitments (goal and institutional); (3) expectations vs. reality  (realization or frustration of study expectation); (4) academic integration (grade performance, intellectual development, study problems, motivating qualities of subject matter, relevance of subject matter); (5) social integration (interaction with peer groups); and (6) criteria (satisfaction with studies, dropout intention). Results generally supported the construct and predictive validity of the revised and extended model. However, disaggregated data indicated differences in influence patterns. The basic difference across departments concerned motives for professional choice, choice of major, and study expectations. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper, which is drawn from a larger analytic history of the National Teacher Evaluation (NTE) program, is to investigate issues of validity within the context of the program's 50-year history. Three major findings emerge from historical considerations relating to: (1) the continuity of test content and justification over the 50-year period of the program's existence; (2) the primacy of reliance upon logical or content validity; and (3) the paradoxical relationship of the tests to teacher education curricula. First, since their inception the examinations have measured three categories of teacher knowledge--basic intellectual and communicative skills, general cultural and contemporary background, and pedagogical and professional information. When changes did  occur, they were undertaken for either financial reasons or as responses to specific criticisms. Second, there has been a strong tendency to justify the exams in terms of their logical or practical validity. Finally, despite the persistent assumption that the tests are needed because graduates of many teacher education programs are inadequately prepared, the source of test content and validity has been and continues to be focused primarily upon the perceived curricula of those programs.

        "description":"Prior research has documented the failure of both staff development and teacher evaluation practices in schools to serve as sources of accountability and improvement for teachers. Few districts coordinate these two aspects of a human resource management system. Using a concept of organizational control, this study employs a qualitative methodology involving elite interviews and document inspection to investigate the experiences of four school districts engaged in a process of evaluation reform. The function of staff development as a mechanism of input control is explored, and the impact on evaluation outcomes is examined. Each district used staff development resources to address the beliefs, attitudes, and skill levels of teachers and administrators that have impeded effective  evaluation in the past. The availability of developmental resources that supported evaluative feedback so that teachers could act on the results appeared to be crucial to success. Teacher evaluation, approached in this manner, expands on traditional notions of accountability and improvement that focus on the poor or marginal teacher. Maintenance of effective classroom performance becomes a legitimate goal of evaluation. These tentative findings suggest that a single teacher evaluation system, properly conceived, may be able to simultaneously serve as a source of accountability and improvement for teachers. An appendix describes the methodology employed in the study. (Author/PN)",

A framework was designed which blends sociologists' focus on school organization and educational stratification with economists' explicit attention to individual response to incentive structures. Independent variables such as homework time, misbehavior, and difficulty of courses were found to exert a significant effect on course grade response. However, the magnitude of these effects are slight, and this suggests that stronger incentives for homework time and good behavior may be desirable. Minority, low socioeconomic status, and non-academic track youths do not receive  lower rewards for good behavior; and minorities and non-academic track youth suffer weaker penalties in terms of negative grading effects for attempting more difficult courses. Yet the variables examined in the study are unable to account for the generally lower grade point averages earned by these students. The extent to which such inter-group differences are due to ascription, ability, or motivation remains a research question. A 37-item reference list is appended. (Author/KH)",

The data on Illinois Asian Americans was collected from the public school fall enrollment and housing report, end of year report, public school bilingual census, and selected 1980 census data for school districts with high Asian/Pacific Islander student enrollment. In addition, the report draws on testimonies presented at a community forum on Educational Issues concerning Asian Americans jointly sponsored by the Illinois State Board of Education and the Illinois Asian American Advisory Council to the Governor held on July 2, 1985, at Truman College in Chicago. Evidence demonstrates that in comparison with whites, Asian  Americans are usually disadvantaged; and that there is great diversity in educational and occupational achievement within the Asian American community, usually based on economic status and length of time in the United States. An analysis of findings from the data sets is reported against the backdrop of testimonies from concerned parents, teachers, and community leaders. Findings from S.A.T. results and other special sample surveys are included. Recommendations are made on how to improve the usefulness and quality of data routinely collected by the Board of Education in order to give Asian Americans equal access to the educational and employment opportunities afforded other Illinois residents.

        "description":"This booklet is a review of the State Department's management of Federal funds and voluntary agencies' distribution and use of program funds for refugee reception and placement. Most of the refugees received the required core services with at least 94.3% receiving food, clothing, and shelter; and 84.1% receiving general employment-related services (counseling, training, and/or placement). About 15% of the refugees in the sample had jobs at the time of the review--those with no ties in the United States, of non-Indochinese descent and not resettled in California being more likely to be employed. In 61.6% of the sample cases, at least one case member applied for public assistance. It was found that the goals of the 90-day resettlement program are insufficiently clear. Further,  there are insufficient performance standards and agency accountability mechanisms. It is recommended that (1) self sufficiency goals be clarified; (2) reasonable and measurable performance standards for monitoring program accomplishments be applied; and that (3) the need for specific actions to improve the level of accountability and control required to oversee the refugee program be considered. The report includes extensive appendices analyzing selected refugee cases and providing copies of State Department comments. (CG)",

        "description":"This digest consolidates recent, key information on minority representation in the teaching profession. Despite widespread efforts to recruit minority teachers, by 1983 the total had decreased 1.5% (down to 11% since 1973). Therefore, many students will go through their entire school career with no minority teachers, no role models, and no sense that teaching is a profession for minorities. Some reasons for this decrease are: (1) increased possibilities for minorities to make more money and win greater prestige in other professions; (2) decrease in minority recruitment and enrollment in colleges; (3) dissatisfaction with the teaching profession; (4) a popular misconception that there is a teacher surplus; and (5) state testing in which minority teachers have low passing rates.  Other problems with minority teacher employment include the desegregation efforts which have given many more white teachers jobs which black teachers would otherwise have held; seniority and tenure provisions that have kept white teachers in jobs; and government moves toward incentive grants and tax incentives that diminish programs traditionally employing minority teachers. Some suggestions on how to increase minority participation in the teaching profession are included. (CG)",

Recommendations for better servicing them are included. Another essay covers, by geographical area, the education of Southeast Asian and Haitian refugees in the Boston/Cambridge area in 1985-86.

Witnesses discussed the nature, dimensions and severity of the problem, State and local initiatives being taken to respond to the problem, and recommendations for Federal action to support and facilitate State and local efforts to deal with the problem. Following an executive summary and general introduction, the report is divided into five sections, which provide respectively: (1) a summary of statements made at the hearing; (2) an overview of relevant social science literature; (3) descriptions of State and local programming on drug abuse; (4) discussion of the Federal role; and (5) hearing recommendations. The major conclusion of the  hearing was that a relationship does exist between drug abuse and dropping out, especially among minority students, but no causal relationship could be determined. Special education and dropout prevention efforts are needed, and it is recommended that such efforts should do more than simply provide information. They must also address other problems associated with drugs and dropping out, such as gangs and teenage pregnancy. Federal action is seen as essential, and national initiatives are needed in several areas: financial support for State and local prevention and education programs; programs directed toward youths with special needs; and programs that encourage communities to address drug problems.

        "description":"As part of a larger study which investigated the educational aims of black parents who send their children to private desegregated schools, a survey was taken to examine the relationship between parental involvement and students' peer acceptance. \"Parental involvement,\" knowing how to obtain the information necessary to support the child's schooling, was distinguished from \"parental participation,\" direct engagement in school activities. The study sample consisted of 63 black and white children (Grades 4-8) and their parents, representing four different schools. Data were derived from parent interviews and child questionnaires, and such factors as family income and mother's education were used as measures of family background. The study found that parental involvement is an  important predictor, both positively and negatively, of black children's peer acceptance in schools, even when typical predictors are controlled. Within this essentially middle-income group, the black children and their non-black friends revealed different predictors of peer acceptance on two acceptance measures used (Peer Study With and Peer Be With), but not on a third (Peer Can Influence). Black students whose parents are most likely to be personally involved in school committees, groups, and activities are least likely to be chosen as friends other students preferred to be with. These results point to the need for more studies which explore the implications of family-school relations for children's social development. (KH)",

The use of this social learning procedure resulted in favorable changes in self-concept and strengthening the bond between the delinquent and society.

Chapter I describes the growing problem of school dropout. Chapter II synthesizes governmental and scholarly studies of youth and schooling, reporting findings on the numbers and identity of early school leavers and their social and economic prospects. Various analyses of dropouts' attitudes toward schooling and reasons for leaving are reviewed. In Chapter III, descriptions of youth life--in alternative educational programs, in the labor force, as heads of households, and on the streets--are offered. Chapter IV reviews literature findings about dropouts' actual skill levels and  explores actual functions of literacy in the youth street culture. Chapter V outlines the advocated intervention strategy, which draws on two critical perspectives: the functional approach to literacy training developed by adult educators and based on use of materials of immediate interest and use to the learner and youth service workers' approaches to working with out-of-school youth. Chapter VI is an annotated listing of reports, teaching materials, and other resources for youth literacy program developers. (YLB)",

        "description":"Implementation of section 13(b)(1) of the Wagner-Peyser Act pertaining to referrals of Employment Service applicants to private agencies was examined. It was found that the statute's language did not specifically require states, but only the U.S. Department of Labor, to make referrals. This study also determined whether additional actions might be taken to ensure that private employment agency resources are appropriately used in federally funded efforts to reduce unemployment. Private agency referrals generally had not occurred because of the continuing, noncooperative relationship between state Employment Services and private agencies. Advantages of referrals included increased placements, reduced time taken to find jobs, or both. The review disclosed no convincing reasons why  state Employment Services could not or should not seek and make available to jobseekers the job information and assistance of private employment agencies, provided jobseekers are not required to pay for this assistance. Regulations requiring referrals to private agencies were recommended. (Eight appendixes follow the seven-page report; they provide: a description of scope and methodology; information on how public and private employment agencies operate; detailed discussions of why referrals have not occurred, advantages of referrals, and barriers and approaches to increasing referrals; Department of Labor comments; comments from the Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training; and a discussion proposal from Employers' National Job Service Committee officials.)

Problems include child care, transportation, and tuition cost. The Vocational Education Support Program for Single Parents and Homemakers at Lindsey-Hopkins Technical Education Center in Miami, Florida, addresses all of these barriers and provides other support services as well. Referral to the program is through school guidance counselors and community agencies. Based on referrals from these agencies and one public service radio spot, the program has served more than 140 single parents or homemakers during its first 5 months. The typical client is a black female between 18 and 24 years old with  two preschool children, typically supported by Aid for Families with Dependent Children. The program components include referral or recruitment, intake/interview and testing, discussion of available training, a second interview that includes sign-up for needed services and referral to a counselor, participation in self-esteem and employability skills workshops, monitoring progress of participants, preparing them for job interviews, and follow-up. Although the program is too new for clients to have entered employment, clients seem eager to learn new skills and to apply them. (KC)",

        "description":"A study examined the views of leading Northwest business executives concerning the implications of and need for technological literacy in the 1990s and beyond. The executives made it clear that the United States is moving toward a future in which high-technology industries will alter work functions dramatically. Providing students with a basic core curriculum emphasizing an interdisciplinary approach appeared to be the most appropriate and feasible way of meeting the future demands of employers and of developing the adaptability necessary to cope in a rapidly changing technological environment. Interviews with employers in the three leading industries of the Northwest--wood/forest products, health/hospital services, and high technology--consistently revealed that orientation to  keyboard and other computer skills will continue to be important for future workers. Cited just as frequently, however, were critical thinking, problem-solving, analyzing, and decision-making skills. It was stressed that schools must seriously address the relationship between liberal arts and technological literacy; continue to seek and upgrade qualified personnel in math, science, and vocational education; and increase state-of-the-art resources and equipment for academic and vocational courses alike. (Appendixes include a list of basic skills and competencies for productive employment and data summaries of the employer interviews dealing with the three aforementioned industries.) (MN)",

Presentations include two welcoming speeches (Hywel Jones and Roger Faist), a speech on changes in the industrialized world that will affect education policy (Shirley Williams), and a shortened version of a statement on adult basic education and  literacy, continuing training for new forms of work and development, and older workers (Henri Janne). Other contents are &quot;New Perspectives in Continuing Education and Training in an Enlarged European Community,&quot; a general working paper drawn up by the Education Services of the European Commission; &quot;Pointers for Continuing Education in Europe&quot; (Jacques Delors); and conclusions and recommendations of the three working groups of the seminar: the development of basic adult education and literacy, the role of continuing education and training as a preparation for new forms of employment and development, and the problems of older workers and the transition to retirement and their implications for continuing education and training.

The three countries--Belgium, France, and Italy--are examined successively on the basis of a virtually identical approach. Each chapter begins with a description of the labor market, providing information on the main characteristics of employment and unemployment in recent years, the functional specificities governing the labor supply and demand, and the manifestations of public intervention (employment policy, training policy, and relevant public institutions), from which it can be determined if there is evidence of a preoccupation with the prevention of unemployment. This descriptive  survey is followed by two sections examining collective and individual training measures that might be regarded as contributing toward unemployment prevention. The final section in each chapter examines the development prospects for training to prevent unemployment in light of the situation prevailing in the country and the degree to which the debate on this notion has developed. The report focuses only on training measures offered to lower- and medium-level personnel (skilled and unskilled manual workers and employees). (YLB)",

The first section summarizes reports from women who have successfully entered nontraditional occupations; provides highlights from speeches regarding action taken by the Commission, the European Social Fund, and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training to benefit women; and summarizes seminar discussions on innovative training measures for women and the problem of implementing the measures generally. Suggestions and demands for transforming experimental programs into the  everyday reality of regular training are presented. The second focuses on the seminar discussion as related to employment. It contains a presentation by M. Pierret describing the survey to examine pilot projects to diversify women's work, evaluate their impact, and draw conclusions for the future. The third section offers an analysis of survey results and identifies barriers to training for women in the areas of orientation, first training, further training and promotion, and return to work. The final three sections offer reports and summaries of the discussions in the three working groups on (1) the social, material, and occupational situation of young women and girls; (2) the functioning of the vocational guidance and placement services; and (3) existing mentalities, attitudes, and  motivation.

        "description":"Since the early 1970s, vocational-technical (VT) activities in Italy have primarily been under regional management. Principal activities covered by VT are basic vocational training, further vocational training, retraining, and training for the unemployed. The Regions also have responsibility for the training of apprentices. The VT user population includes 53 percent of young people aged 15 to 19, more than 60 percent of young people at secondary school, and almost 65 percent of those in employment via apprenticeships. Trainers involved in VT activities aimed at placement in first jobs are the teaching staff of vocational colleges and technical colleges, the teaching staff of vocational training centers, and operators working in inservice training centers. Each group is  characterized by a high degree of diversity in both quantitative and qualitative terms. They also display variations from an institutional point of view, in respect to training, recruitment, and qualifications. In the future, VT activities will be affected by changes linked to technological advances, changes in working organization (and hence in job structures), and changes in the organization of education and training. The trainer's role will also be redefined and changes will occur in initial training, recruitment, the acquisition of skills, and refresher courses. (YLB)",

        "description":"Vocational teachers and trainers in France belong to four groups: teaching personnel employed by the Ministry of Education, teaching personnel in private technical education, teaching personnel in educational establishments accountable to other ministers, and trainers in other bodies (apprenticeship training centers and company training centers). Most teachers and trainers servicing full-time secondary vocational training courses are required to hold a qualification from the higher education cycle. Those servicing practical vocational sections are also required to have practical occupational experience. For teachers and trainers in apprenticeship training centers the recruitment standards are statutorily defined at a lower level. The two recruitment training tracks for trainers  are occupational experience or a baccalaureate degree, diploma, or certificate in technical studies. After recruitment, primary emphasis in training is on the pedagogic aspect. Implications of contemporary trends for teaching personnel in establishments run by the Ministry of Education include reorganization of the teacher training system to create uniformity, inservice training to familiarize them with technological advancement, and continuing training provision. General problems facing vocational training are exposing students to technological progress; relating education to work; changing the institutional environment to provide vocational guidance, articulation, and flexible educational approaches; and introducing technological culture.

        "description":"In the Federal Republic of Germany the most important form of training leading to a vocational qualification and the focus of all initial vocational training is the &quot;dual system&quot; of in-firm and in-school learning. Other forms of initial vocational training include apprenticeships, training in a firm, and vocational schools. Trainers employed by an industrial firm are typically salary earners in a technical occupation or a master craftsman. Two educational routes lead to the position of training manager: training to skilled worker level followed by advanced training or study at a technical college. In-firm training staff are normally recruited from within the firm. Vocational school teachers receive their training in two stages: a university course of at least 8 semesters and  practical training of 6 to 12 months as well as 18 months of postgraduate preservice training as a probationary teacher. Problems arise from the fact that vocational school teachers now receive training at universities--training that is theoretical rather than practical. In the case of in-firm training, the weakness is that trainers are not professionals but are employees of the firm and do not teach more extensive and comprehensive skills and knowledge than the firm feels employees need.

Programs with which the interns were affiliated included a goal-based education program, the Center for Sex Equity, an assessment and evaluation program, a computer technology program, and the Pacific Region Educational Program. To assess the impact of these internships, a formal interview schedule incorporating the five evaluation questions delineated in the program's work statement was used. The evaluation found the following: (1) the capability of the interns to pursue educational research and development (R&amp;D) work increased, because the skills needed were acquired or  strengthened; (2) the job placement and promotion activities of the internships have increased the employment of women and minorities in R&amp;D work; (3) the project has assisted interns in obtaining credentials, although this was not a major need, since interns were already well-versed in such procedures; (4) information on internship activities was publicized in several media sources; and (5) the internships were a positive experience for both interns and sponsoring agencies. Recommendations for the future included longer internships, dropping the requirement for university enrollment during internship, and having the internships lead to contracts.

        "description":"A study examined the relationship between occupational advancement among women and their participation in the training offered at the enterprise level in West Germany. Women from four firms, a department store company, a large bank, a computer firm, and a public sector service undertaking, were studied. In all four firms, the internal recruitment of managerial personnel for posts up to the highest level was linked with participation in a solidly institutionalized in-firm training system. Although successful completion of corresponding in-firm courses did not constitute a formal entitlement to internal promotion in any of the four firms, promotion appeared to be dependent on such completion. All training costs at the four firms were incurred entirely by the firms offering the  training. Courses were intended to provide the knowledge and skills required to prepare and qualify the trainees to discharge the functions attached to a specific position or for promotion and assignment to managerial posts. For the most part, courses took place within the firm. The retail, banking, and computer firms all tended to recruit young, unmarried women without family responsibilities, whereas the public service undertaking recruited its management reserve without regard for women's age or family responsibilities. Most of the women questioned felt that equal training opportunities were afforded to men and women at their respective firms. (MN)",

        "author":["Selkin, Burkart"],
        "description":"Since 1976 the Management Board of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training has given top priority to the problem of youth unemployment. Analysis of the employment and training situation among young people showed the emergence of structural deficiencies in vocational training and employment opportunities and the importance of developing an integrated education, training, and employment program for young people. Accordingly, there is a need for change in the relationship between general and vocational training courses in the final years of secondary education and improvement in the range of attractive training and education opportunities during the transition from school to work. Further study has found that short-term schemes prompted by the current economic  situation are not enough to eliminate deficiencies. Although positive results have been achieved with work procurement schemes for young people, they should form part of a comprehensive employment program for all workers. Another suggestion is the improvement of cooperation between schools and firms through the development of alternative training. There is a need for a new form of transition from school to work and from work to school; suitable legislation and collective agreements are required. The Centre has been and will continue to examine new avenues including the possibility of developing a form of postsecondary education designed to combat unemployment, finding and improving the link between vocational training and work procurement schemes, determining the role and purpose of  training contracts between young employees and firms as a means of increasing training, and investigating the cost of financing training and postsecondary education and the possibility of spreading costs between government and the private secrtor.

        "author":["Morgan, William R."],
        "description":"This study was conducted to establish the existence, direction, and size of sibling comparison effects on the occupational aspirations of youth. Data were drawn from the youth cohort subsample of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience, sampling those with expressed occupational aspirations who come from homes with four or fewer children, over the four-year period, 1979 to 1982. The principal finding of the study was that brothers, and brothers only, reinforce one another's occupational aspirations during the critical years of occupational identity formation when youth are beginning to make the transition to full-time employment. The apparent absence of a similar socialization mechanism between sisters may be one further hidden barrier to the career  development of females. The social comparison process that is hypothesized to underlie this tendency for brothers to use one another's aspirations in forming their own is facilitated in families where a degree of male sibling rivalry and competition is permitted and encouraged. Similar rivalry and competition between sisters is likely to be discouraged, especially to the extent that parents consider such behavior inappropriate to the traditional feminine role. The study concluded that to the extent that the various assumptions built into the research design prove correct, the finding of a sex difference in sibling influence suggests that one traditional socialization difference was still strong in 1982. The report contains numerous tables showing the effects of family constellation  (particularly number of siblings and birth order), race, and socioeconomic influence on the occupational aspirations of young people. An 18-item reference list and an appendix describing the method used in recovering the relationships among the respondents are included. (KC)",

The new students on campuses are adults, students from lower socioeconomic levels, ethnic minorities, and women. Since many new students tend to have academic difficulties, colleges have offered remedial classes in each subject area. Colleges can be expected to focus increased attention on the problems of the new student population as the traditional student population continues to decline. If remedial programs are to be successful, the student with weak skills must be identified early, preferably at admission or orientation time. The student will need intensive counseling support to develop a more positive and self-confident approach to learning. The teacher  should select the remedial program assignment, rather than being assigned to it. The teacher should have the responsibility to decide what is to be learned and the teaching methods. Individualization of programs and Bloom's concept of mastery learning may be helpful approaches. Students should know learning goals and work on small, sequential and structured learning units that are self-paced. Constant feedback and evaluation are important. (SW)",

EOPS provides services and financial aid to community college students who transfer to public four-year colleges. The task force concluded that existing comprehensive opportunity programs at all three public segments for low-income or otherwise disadvantaged students have given only limited priority to transfer students. While the Commission generally agrees with the task force recommendations, it believes that more fundamental improvements in the working relationships of existing programs are needed to increase the number of EOPS students who transfer to public universities and complete their baccalaureate  programs. Two alternative strategies to assure a consistent continuum of services are identified: consolidating the existing state-funded programs into a single program; or further revising existing programs to make them more responsive to low-income and educationally disadvantaged students who begin their baccalaureate education in a community college. Specific recommendations for the California State University Educational Opportunity Program and the Community College EOPS program are included. (SW)",

        "description":"Changes in the demand for higher education in postwar Japan are analyzed. Three simple conceptual models of the anticipated benefit of education are considered, along with the validity of each model in explaining changes in aggregate demand for college. A classical model assumes that individuals know about the prevailing wage structure and expect it to stay unchanged. A perception bias (lag) model posits that individuals anticipate the benefit of education according to wage structure perceptions, which are biased or lagged images of the present and past structure. The shift expectation model integrates the factor of expectation of future shift in wage structure. To test the validity of each model, alternative sets of time-series indices of anticipated benefit of higher education  were estimated from wage structure statistics. A theoretical model of individual choice about education was also developed, and the aggregate demand function of education was derived. Shift expectation was found to be a significant factor in the formation of anticipated benefit of education, and thus in determining the changes in the demand for education. The effect of an economic cycle on educational demand is also considered, with attention to changing family income, changing wage structure, and the formation of future growth expectations. (SW)",

English and social science were used to represent verbal tasks and mathematics the computational task. In natural classroom settings, a total of 1,110 community college students completed a questionnaire comprised of the following 10 student attributions for success: luck, mood, effort, textbook, task difficulty, instructor, ability, attitude toward the subject, incentive to do well, and influence of others. Data on student age, prior course-taking, and race/ethnicity were also collected. Because the study focused on successful students only, data were analyzed for 421 students meeting the criteria for success: agreement between  objective letter grade given and the student's subjective evaluation of performance. Data analysis indicated that while there were no gender differences in attributions for success, attributions did depend on the particular course being taken. Therefore attributions for success in mathematics were different from those in English. The role of attribution as a causal variable in a model of academic choice proposed by Meece et al. is addressed, along with recommendations for future attribution research. The Test Attribution Questionnaire is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Factors that affect interracial relationships of white faculty at predominantly black colleges are considered. Based on theoretical writings and research, five dynamics influencing black-white interaction are identified: prejudice and stereotyping, dominance by whites, racial role-playing, social acceptance/social distance, and value differences. Factors at the individual, small group, college, and community levels that influence white faculty members' adjustment within the black college are also addressed. Stereotyped perceptions of white faculty at black colleges as academic rejects who are there for a paycheck or as paternalistic \"know it alls\" can impede effective interpersonal functioning. The social environment of black colleges, where blacks rather than whites are  dominant, can lead to ambiguities and subtle conflicts between the two races. The phenomenon of racial role-playing refers to pretense and a lack of sincerity in relating to those of another race. Some research has concluded that black students distance themselves more from white instructors than black instructors. Value-related concerns include the influence of social class, differing perspectives on race consciousness, and value conflicts that may be experienced by white faculty when grading black students.

        "description":"The use of thought modeling as an effective technique for teaching academic learning skills is examined. Based on decision theory, it is proposed that learning is improved when the student makes active decisions about learning actions or skills. Control over learning is dependent upon the quality of decisions about matching learning resources and task demands. An adequate learning skills repertoire allows learners to respond differentially to changes in external variables. A variety of learning skills appears essential. For example, in learning information, students should have several skills to organize, recall, review, and acquire information. A good skills repertoire also includes both content experience and task experience as well as sensitivity to how well the skills are  being used. Cognitive or thought modeling appears to provide a good method to help students know how and when to use a skill, and how to monitor its success. Seven steps proposed by Cormier and Cormier to demonstrate and teach new thinking patterns are: a verbal set about the procedure, a cognitive model of the task and of self-verbalizations, overt external guidance, overt self-guidance, faded overt guidance, covert self-guidance, and homework. Survey skills are used as an example of the use of thought modeling. (SW)",

Objectives were to determine: (1) the degree to which changes in adolescents' self-concept and career attitudes were related to their level of involvement in postsecondary education; and (2) if there were any sex differences. Data were obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 concerning graduates' sex, family socioeconomic status in 1972, postsecondary educational attainment level, self-concept, and career orientation. Respondents indicated the relative importance of 10 life goals and their agreement with eight self-concept statements. Principal component analysis identified three  factors that were consistent over time: self-image, self-confidence, and career orientation. Exposure to college seemed to have a stronger relationship to the development of a more positive self-image, a modest relationship to enhancing self-confidence, and a differential relationship to career orientation for females and males. Collegiate experience had essentially no relationship to the career orientation development of males, while it had a pronounced relationship to the formation of females' career orientation over the 7-year period.

The focus was the relationship of CE participation to organizational socialization and power within the organization. Responses were obtained from graduates of mandatory CE programs, optional or selective CE programs, and regular degree programs. Scales were administered to assess the accuracy/realism of initial job expectations, the congruence between the needs of the employee and job requirements, employees' perceptions of the relevance of their jobs to their career plans, the strength of an individuals's identification with and involvement in a particular organization, employees' access to resources necessary to  complete job duties, and the amount of personal power on the job perceived by the employee. Findings based on path analysis suggest that CE participants have significantly more realistic expectations about their first job after college than other recent college graduates. CE graduates who remained with their former CE employers were most likely to have realistic expectations. It is suggested that an understanding of CE student experiences may help organizations improve organizational entry and reduce turnover. (SW)",

Major factors implicated in academic failure were disinterest in medicine, cognitive disadvantages, and economic deprivation. Twelve of the students felt they received help from peers, docents and assistant deans, and the medical school, while six felt Arts and Sciences faculty were not interested or unwilling to help. Of the six students who left in good academic standing, five were  female, and two transferred to another medical school. At the time of the exit interview, nine of the students who left in poor academic standing expressed positive attitudes about themselves and their future. Students found the exit interview useful in sorting out their feelings and thoughts about their departure and future plans.

Ecological models suggest that, even in systems where there are relative differences in power between agents, institutional activities and those of various participants will have a systematic interactive impact. Brigham Young University adopted a seven-step process to implement environmental change: (1) designers, in conjunction with community members, select values; (2) values are then translated into specific goals; (3) environments are designed that contain mechanisms to reach the goals; (4) environments are fitted to participants;  (5) participant perceptions of the environment are measured; (6) participant behavior resulting from environmental perceptions is monitored; and (7) data on outcomes, as indicated by participant perceptions and behavior, is fed back to designers. It is important that values underlying the redesign of the student government be congruent with values of the university. Core values identified and functions that support the values are considered, along with structural possibilities that will maximize the value system and functions. (SW)",

Three sets of concepts related to database management are listed and explained: creating a database, using a database management system, and generating reports from the information in a database. Specific directions elaborate on each concept, i.e., generating a master list of fields for use as a guide to selecting an appropriate software program, use of default systems, search strategies, and use of four different formats in creating a report (page format, data format, sort format, and select format). A six-step process is recommended for  designing a database: (1) determine goals; (2) specify the data needed; (3) design the reports; (4) set up the database; (5) revise; and (6) pilot test. A list of eight sample uses for database programs includes: personnel records, study participant records, test item banks, equipment and supply logs, contact and activity logs, financial statements, consultant records, and references in the literature. A seven-step process is also suggested for evaluating individual software programs. (JB)",

        "author":["McDonald, Joseph P."],
        "description":"This report summarizes the proceedings of a conference held at the Harvard Graduate School of Education which focused on the conceptual distinction between microworld software and expert system software in education. Microworld software is defined as software which lacks a specific teaching and learning agenda, and expert systems as software that comes with built-in knowledge of a domain and a built-in plan of instruction in that domain. To assist program presenters in examining the design polarities implied in the two systems, two pairs of educational software systems (carefully chosen to illustrate the polarity) were displayed and discussed. These systems--The LISP Tutor and Geometric Supposer on the one hand and The Writer's Workbench and Quill on the other, provided the basis  for subsequent presentations and panel discussion. Presenters noted specific design and utilization differences between Geometric Supporter and LISP tutor: the former is a tool which students may use in an exploratory fashion and the latter makes inferences about a user's intentions at each step of a guided path. Workbench differs from Quill in that that the former, with its original design as an editing tool with explicit technical analysis, precludes its judging the writing product itself, while the latter is designed to help generate writing materials and facilitate writing between student and teacher, or among students. A more in-depth presentation of each of the four systems, along with the presenter's comments on its use and applications, follows the initial comparison of the  systems, and closing remarks suggest that the concepts of both types of system should be utilized in an educational environment.

A conservative approach to software copyright is taken which looks to how the law will likely be interpreted, rather than waiting for the definitive decision by a court. Three major issues involved with software duplication are discussed: back-up copies, multiple loading or booting from one disk onto multiple machines at the same time, and networks. It is concluded that: (1) although back-up copies (number uncertain) are allowed for use on a second machine in the event the original fails, the copy is not to be used on a second machine at the same time as the original; (2) in the absence of a license that explicitly permits loading multiple  computers with the contents from one disk for use at the same time, users would likely be in violation of the copyright law if they did so; and (3) in the absence of a network license, users would likely be in violation of copyright laws if they downloaded a program to multiple stations at the same time from their network.

        "description":"The basic purpose of this study, which updates a study conducted in 1975, was to present higher education with recommendations for telecommunications curriculum from commercial broadcasters. Data were collected from 71 respondents via questionnaires distributed at the Indiana Broadcasters Association Conference in 1983. Respondents were asked to rate the importance of 60 commonly offered courses and select 10 courses that they would require in such a curriculum. Responses from management, sales, production, and news personnel were tabulated individually so that participants' views could be observed by category. All 71 respondents were tabulated as a composite, and a comparative tally then prepared for the top 20 courses (and ties) so that the differences between choices of the  four personnel categories could be compared at a glance. Findings indicate that the 20 courses which were the most highly recommended carry the same theme--a broad-based variety. However, if the first seven were chosen as the required core of a curriculum, they would include internship, news, writing, law, radio production, radio sales, and audience research. In addition, 90% of respondents agreed that news students should be required to work in their university television or radio station, and an equal number would permit freshmen to enroll in at least one telecommunications class, a policy which is not widely practiced. Conclusions call for universities to improve student preparation by encouraging skills development, better attitudes, motivation, and initiative, and suggest that a  broad, liberal arts background would be an excellent prerequisite for work in the field of telecommunications. A report on a survey of the attitudes of commercial broadcasters toward specialization versus non-specialization by students is appended. (JB)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the use of a technique called windowing in computer assisted instruction to allow independent control of functional areas in complex CAI displays and simultaneous display of output from a running computer program and coordinated instructional material. Two obstacles to widespread use of CAI in computer science courses are given: the need to display a large amount of information on the screen at one time, and the need to either simulate sophisticated computer processes so they can be demonstrated from within a running CAI program, or to exit the CAI program so that students can have some hands-on experience. Windowing is suggested as a solution to these problems because it allows a single terminal to act as either a multiple output device for a single computer  program, or as a single output device for multiple computer programs. Implications of this dual function are discussed. Sample windowing applications, with nine corresponding screen examples, illustrate the technique's potential for instructional application, and three suggestions for handling the system of interwindow/interprocess are given. Two systems for implementation of windowing are discussed--UNIX and VAX/VMS--and it is concluded that, although windowing is a highly desirable CAI feature, its actual use has proven difficult, and more practical approaches need to be devised. A list of four references completes the paper. (JB)",

Concerned with the cultural context of Logo learning and principles upon which it is based, the first section reviews the developmental and cognitive theories of Papert, Donaldson, Cole, and Sternberg and Suben. Section two offers the theoretical premise of a reference model for learning Logo based on research in anthropology, psychology, and sociolinguistics. Section three discusses the components of this model in relation to empirical data from a research project on the relationship between Logo programming and  young children's self-monitoring and comprehension skills. Finally, the fourth section briefly summarizes the discussion and suggests areas for further research, including the questions of what cognitive prerequisites are needed to program successfully at different age levels, and the policy implications of providing children with such training.

        "description":"This research project was motivated by results of earlier work (Katzer et al., 1982) on the overlap among document representations. In the earlier study, one representation used in the INSPEC database proved to perform unexpectedly well in comparison with other commonly used representations, such as controlled vocabulary or free-text terms from the title/abstract of the document. That representation--free-index phrases--is mainly composed of free-text phrases selected by an indexer from the title/abstract. The objectives of the current research project were (1) to discover why the free-index phrases performed as well as they did, and (2) to attempt to produce surrogate free-index phrases automatically from the title/abstract. The free-index phrases in samples of INSPEC  title/abstracts were examined and the results of the previous study were reconsidered in light of the current project. The project began with all of the noun phrases in the title/abstract. From these, several methods were used to select surrogate free-index phrases. Each method was compared statistically and empirically against the actual free-index phrases, and in no case did the surrogates perform as well. No clearcut cause for the performance of the phrases was found. One viable possibility has to do with those relatively few free-index phrases which do not derive directly from the title/abstract of the document, but are added by indexers at INSPEC, who take most of them from the controlled vocabulary. Numerous tables, 29 references, and five appendices are included.  (Author/THC)",

        "description":"This field experiment begins to build a theoretical framework for exploring the effects of media characteristics on subjects' understanding and integration of information. Students in two eighth-grade science classes wrote term papers with one class using a print encyclopedia and the other an electronic encyclopedia to conduct their research. A third class, taught by the same teacher, was not assigned the term paper and acted as a control group. Measures of horizontal knowledge (breadth of knowledge on the topic) and vertical knowledge (depth of knowledge on the topic) were collected from pre- and posttests, as well as from teacher assessments of the final papers. The horizontal and vertical knowledge measures were designed to tap the effects of basic characteristics of the two  media systems on the way in which the subjects used them. Because of the nature of the system, students using the videotex system were expected to score highest on horizontal knowledge, whereas print students were expected to perform best on measures of vertical knowledge. Results support the first hypothesis with students in the electronic encyclopedia class scoring significantly higher on measures of horizontal knowledge. However, teachers also scored the electronic encyclopedia student papers higher on vertical knowledge. This exploratory study concludes that efforts to link specific media characteristics to dependent measures of subject understanding or learning is a fruitful approach for research on the effects of new technologies. An 11-item bibliography and 3-point scales for each  of the dependent variables (appearance, vertical, and horizontal knowledge) are included. (Author/THC)",

        "description":"This document presents testimony heard on S. 2418, a bill to authorize the Librarian of Congress to construct the Library of Congress Mass Book Deacidification Facility at Fort Detrick, near Frederick, Maryland, subject to the supervision and construction authority of a federal, civilian, or military agency. The facility would be used to neutralize acid in book paper, thereby extending the life of books in the library's collection by 400 to 600 years. The bill would authorize $11.5 million for a building to house the necessary equipment and its laboratory facilities. Deacidification costs in the mass facility are estimated to be $3-5 per book, substantially less than the alternative cost of approximately $30 for microfilming each book. Operating costs for this laboratory facility  are expected to be between $2-3 million per year, including three or four new positions to staff the facility. The document includes testimony of Daniel J. Boorstin, Librarian of Congress; Beverly B. Byron, Congressional Representative from the State of Maryland; Carolyn Greiner, on behalf of Mayor Ronald N. Young, city of Frederick, Maryland; a panel including Carolyn L. Harris (Columbia University Libraries), Susan Martin (Johns Hopkins University), and Gary E.

Users are individually authorized for access to specific information centers, and use standard commands for the downloading, compilation, and online review of citations in a common format. Previously reported  post-processing capabilities have been expanded, permitting: (1) online citation review, categorization, and addition of new data elements; (2) disassembly and re-assembly of citations; (3) statistical analysis of data field contents; (4) cross-correlation of data field contents; and (5) concordance generation. Additionally, the new two-pass interpreter for the post-processing program permits: the transformation of abbreviated data field names into English names preferred by each agency, the statistical analysis of the density and completeness of data fields in selected sets of bibliographic citations, the elimination of redundant citations, and trend analysis.

Part of the study focused on the large discrepancy between the number of community college students saying they wanted to earn a bachelor's degree and the actual number who attained the baccalaureate. A survey of students in randomly selected transfer-credit course sections at 22 urban community colleges yielded 1,163 usable responses. Study findings included the following: (1) 74% of the students planned to attain a baccalaureate degree or higher, yet only 54% indicated transfer as their primary reason for attending college; (2) 44% expressed strong feelings about the relative importance of transfer; (3) only 12%  could be classified as exhibiting behavior highly indicative of transfer, and most had not taken the initiative in planning for transfer; and (4) students with high transfer attitudes and behaviors were concentrated among those who had completed 45 to 59 units, were attending full-time, and were of traditional college age. The study findings suggested that community colleges concerned with the identification of potential transfer students should collect other data besides planned degree attainment. (LAL)",

A questionnaire was distributed to 444 randomly selected faculty members teaching transfer courses at 24 colleges, requesting information on faculty awareness of student characteristics, faculty interaction with students, how faculty prepare students for the four-year college environment, faculty involvement in transfer-related activities, and faculty attitudes toward transfer and other community college functions. Study findings, based on a 78% response rate, included the following: (1) 67% of the instructors did not have information on student transfer aspirations,  81% had no information on performance on basic skills tests, and 80% had no information on students' employment status; (2) 61% met with students during office hours, yet very few indicated communication with students in other settings; (3) 45% did not use essay exams at all in determining course grades; (4) most faculty engaged in a variety of activities to achieve course equivalency between community colleges and senior institutions; (5) most faculty were not greatly involved in formal transfer activities outside the classroom, but many were involved in less formal ways; and (6) only 19% agreed that the primary function of the community college should be transfer. The study findings suggested that lack of faculty involvement in the transfer function was due to the perception by faculty  that transfer education was the domain of administrative personnel, and that transfer education had become a secondary function.

The findings of these surveys resulted in several suggestions for strengthening the transfer function, including: (1) college leaders should communicate the importance of transfer to college constituencies by establishing a high-level administrative position to deal with transfer, commissioning research on the effectiveness of transfer education at the college, and opening communications with senior institutions; (2) the curricula and services of the college should be  reorganized to promote transfer more effectively and coordinate the efforts of faculty, administrators, and researchers; (3) the procedural and qualitative aspects of transfer should be improved by such means as revising college catalogs to include transfer requirements, and providing training to help counselors and faculty develop skills in advising potential transfers; and (4) transfer and articulation agreements should be created with senior institutions within the community college's service district.

First, data from California, North Carolina, Illinois, Missouri, and Minnesota are presented, contrasting the numbers of students who transfer from two- to four-year colleges to the sometimes greater number of students transferring from four- to two-year colleges. Next, the digest reviews three research efforts undertaken by individual colleges to identify the characteristics and needs of reverse transfer students, including: (1) a study conducted at Piedmont Virginia Community College (PVCC), which focused on the demographic characteristics and reasons that students with certificates or degrees attend PVCC; (2) a study conducted at Santa Ana College  (California) to determine the educational interests and matriculation patterns of students who had previously attended a four-year institution; and (3) research undertaken at the Los Rios Community College District (California), which compared the characteristics and objectives of students with five different educational backgrounds. Finally, the digest offers conclusions about reverse transfers, indicating that: (1) those holding four-year degrees represent one of the most academically able segments of the community college student body; (2) those without a baccalaureate come to the community college for a variety of reasons, only one of which is academic difficulty at the senior institution; and (3) while reverse transfers constitute only a minority of the community college population,  their presence is further evidence of the growing complexity of the community college environment.

Next, information is provided on degree awards, indicating that in absolute numbers, 158,000 non-vocational and 276,493 vocational degrees were awarded in 1981-82. The next  section looks at trends in the participation of women in associate degree education, showing that since 1976-77, over 50% of the degrees have been earned by women, though most in health, office, and public service occupations. The final section addresses several issues that must be addressed in the future planning of associate degree programs, including the relatively low prestige of the degree, variations among colleges with respect to subject area and unit requirements, the need to keep up with technological advances in vocational curricula, and the transferability of the degree.

Based on a unitary theory of human cognition and some basic assumptions about the conditions for successfully intervening in public education, the model can be implemented at any grade level within any instructional framework. Currently used models for thinking skills instruction are briefly reviewed. Then, a unitary model of cognition is translated into an instructional model of thinking skills which can be taught and reinforced in instructional contexts. Six general categories of thinking skills are considered: (1) a general procedure for increasing task efficiency; (2) recognition and encoding procedures; (3) storage and retrieval procedures; (4) matching procedures; (5)  procedures for building new cognitive structures, and (6) executive system principles. Four major implications of the unitary model for instruction and curriculum are discussed. (RH)",

The Toy Safety Act of 1984 amends the Federal Hazardous Substances Act to enable the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to quickly recall dangerous toys and other articles used by children. The Act authorizes the CPSC to give public notice about any toy posing a substantial risk to children and empowers the agency to order the toy manufacturer to repair, replace, or give a refund for the hazardous toy. Testimony concerns examples of recalled products and possible amendments to the Act. H.R. 1797  would prohibit shipment in interstate commerce of any fur taken from an animal caught in a steel-jaw leghold trap, prohibit export or import of such furs, and impose fines and prison terms for violation of the legislation. Legislation concerning amusement park safety would restore jurisdiction of the CPSC over the rides located in amusement parks. H.R. 5788, 5790, and 5982 respectively, amend the Consumer Product Safety Act to make that Act applicable to amusement devices permanently fixed to a site, to strengthen the authority of the CPSC over amusement devices, and to strengthen the authority of the CPSC over amusement parks.

        "description":"The way cognitive, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) can aid in further understanding of memory span change in children is discussed. ERPs are time-dependent changes in electrical activity of the brain (as recorded by scalp electrodes) following the presentation of a physical stimulus through auditory, visual, or somatosensory modalities. The cognitive components which are elicited by the processing demands of the task are relatively independent of the physical character of the stimuli. One of the most studied of the cognitive components is the P300 or P3, elicited by task relevant events. Research findings indicate that people who quickly generate the P3 tend to have a larger memory span at any age, that minimal latency of the P3 is associated with the onset of puberty, and  that P3 latency, an age sensitive variable, can serve as an estimate of the time required for stimuli to be identified and classified with respect to task demands. Research further suggests that stimulus identification processes are less efficient among children. In addition, speed of item identification as measured by the P3 has been found to determine the size of memory span, to the extent that early processing is involved. It can be concluded that a significant proportion of the variance of memory span development is tied to the speed of stimulus identification processes and that ERPs provide an important additional metric for analyzing the ontogeny of working memory capacity.

The goal of working with children must be to build their self-esteem so they like themselves as human beings. The document (1) reviews research findings that will help teachers make insightful caregiving decisions, (2) describes early learning in group care, and (3) suggests numerous positive discipline techniques. The review of research describes findings concerning attachment, attachment and competence, control and competence, sex differences in early childhood education, factors influencing language development, the relationship between physical punishment and child competence, television and prosocial development, child abuse and the  early childhood classroom, and the effects of day care on child development. The discussion of early learning in group care describes the development of object permanence, the understanding of means-ends and causal relationships, classification ability, seriation, and aspects of language development such as functions of early speech productions. Interspersed in the text are suggestions of ways teachers can most appropriately influence young children's development. The discussion of discipline techniques briefly reviews a few books written on the topic and suggests many positive ways of influencing children's behavior. (RH)",

Findings indicated that interpersonal themes and environmental events were used significantly more than other themes, whereas achievement themes were used significantly less than others. Interpersonal themes were used significantly more often than other categories as explanations for  anger and sadness. Impersonal contexts were used significantly more than other categories to explain happiness and surprise. Contextual explanations involving animals were used significantly more than other emotions to explain fear, and food was used most to explain happy feelings. Older children used more interpersonal and achievement themes than did preschoolers. Girls used more interpersonal contexts than did boys, whereas boys tended to use more achievement themes than did girls. Preschoolers used more fantasy explanations for fear than did older children.

Facial expressions were unobtrusively videotaped in a 45-minute session in which subjects viewed a series of televised vignettes portraying dramatic interpersonal interactions expected to elicit positive (euphoric) or negative (dysphoric) emotional responses in viewers. Variables scored were affect valence, overall affect, and type of affect evoked. Both younger groups displayed significantly more affect than did the oldest group, and mean affect displayed per episode decreased  monotonically with age. Furthermore, girls displayed significantly more affect than did boys. Although the mean affect valence displayed for episodes was similar across ages, boys displayed less negative affect than did girls. Gender-related differences were also observed when facial expressions were coded into specific affect categories. The most notable changes with age were decreases in expressions coded as &quot;afraid&quot; and increases in expressions coded as &quot;sad.&quot; It was concluded that findings offer support for views of differential socialization of affect with age and according to gender.

Out-of-school or &quot;free time&quot; offers great opportunities for children to learn from new experiences and to develop, through carefully selected activities, a sense of competence, self-esteem, and achievement. Focus is on the developmental needs of middle childhood, when children are six to twelve years old, and real-life examples and everyday language are used to direct a parent toward understanding and developing his child's interests. Specifically presented are the following chapter titles: &quot;A Child's Life Out of School&quot;; &quot;Parents' Roles and Special Insights&quot; (appeals to parents to trust themselves and express their convictions to their children);&quot;Resources--What Are the Options?&quot; (gives detailed information on searching for resources for activities); &quot;Fostering Independence, or the Other Three R's: Resourcefulness, Responsibility, and Reliability&quot; (offers a view of the child as member of a family); &quot;Protecting Children's Safety&quot; (starts with home safety and moves into the neighborhood); and &quot;Putting It All Together&quot; (includes a section entitled &quot;A False Start Is Not a Flop&quot; for those who fear failure or are easily discouraged.

The &quot;emergent&quot; view recognizes the social changes which men are undergoing and claims that men are becoming more involved domestically. Yesterday's absentee father is being replaced by a man involved both practically and emotionally. The paper looks at this perspective and assesses whether any real increase in paternal involvement in domestic life can be measured. Two methods are used: (1) asking men to compare their own parenting roles with those of their fathers and (2) comparing data collected in studies on fathers in previous generations with that obtained in recent studies. Both methods involve methodological problems. Also a gap appears  between fathers' descriptions of change and evidence to support their claims. Narrations of actual interviews with fathers are given, as well as tables summarizing the results. It is concluded that the emergent view of fathering is only supported by incidental evidence and that the key issue is not how involved men become in fatherhood, but rather which parent takes responsibility for the child. It can only be inferred that parenthood is different these days and that any comparisons between generations must take into account both the social context in which parenting takes place and the possible variations in paternal involvement over the life-span.

Data were obtained in a longitudinal study of 120 families with children 6 through 12 years of age. While children in the sample were not very disturbed, data indicate that the \"well-being\" of children and mothers was better after the first post-separation year. Analysis of mother-child interaction corroborated the finding of improvement after the passage of a year. Children with problems at Year 1 tended to have problems at Year 2. At Year 1, mothers with healthier scores on the Positive Affect and Health measures rated their children as being more psychologically adjusted than did mothers with less healthy scores. Data from mothers, children, and teacher agreed  that mothers who still had problems in Year 2 had children who were similarly affected. Mothers who were more satisfied with their work reported more positive adjustment than did less satisfied mothers, and mothers in higher level jobs had children with fewer physical health symptoms. Interparent conflict affected children negatively when the divorce had not been heard in court by the time of the second year assessment. Children's age and gender were found to be related to the types of relationships children had with their mothers, suggesting that children's age and gender may draw out different interactions with their mothers and that these interactions may differentially affect adjustment directly.

        "description":"Aiming to show that improved learning can take place when children use self-monitoring and evaluation skills, this study represents a relatively new approach toward helping children &quot;learn to learn.&quot; Among 60 second grade students, two questions were explored: (1) Is it possible that with proper training young children who ordinarily do not monitor their cognitive activities can be encouraged to do so? and (2) If metacognitive training is feasible, will these newly acquired self-observing skills enable children to select an effective learning strategy when faced with different learning tasks? Training consisted of &quot;playing games&quot; in several ways, one of which was clearly superior to the others. Throughout the course of game playing, experimental subjects were prompted to monitor  their performance and evaluate the effect different ways of playing had on the outcome of the game. Findings indicated that: metacognitive training is a feasible and productive technique for improving learning performance in young children; second graders can readily generalize newly acquired metacognitive skills from a game such as circle drawing to another involving paired associates learning; and second graders may not be able to maintain their newly acquired memory-monitoring abilities for a period of 2 weeks.

Four criteria used in determining eligibility for Head Start programs are reviewed: (1) family income, (2) age, (3) handicapping condition, and (4) need. Several tables provide data and estimations of enrollment and children being served. These are as follows: 1984 Head Start Family Income Guidelines; Illinois Head Start Funded Enrollment by Grantee October 1, 1984; Estimates of Eligible Illinois Children Served and Not Served by Head Start, December, 1983; and Statewide Estimates of Eligible Illinois Children Served and Not Served by Head Start. In summary, during the 1983-84 school year program, approximately 71% of  eligible children were not served by Head Start, and during the 1984-85 school year program, approximately 69% of eligible children were not served by Head Start. In addition, although the number of children being served by Head Start in 1984-85 was about 1,500 greater than during 1983-84, a substantial proportion of low-income preschool children were still not being served by Head Start.

Primary attention is given to: (1) the education of non-handicapped children between birth and entrance into first grade, and (2) those programs and services which influence the primary education continuum of instruction. National socio-economic trends and social influences are described in relation to the current status of Illinois' early childhood education in pre-kindergarten and kindergarten programs. The study of pre-kindergarten programs addresses the following topics: the kinds of pre-kindergarten programs and services provided and numbers of children served; their effectiveness;  and identification of potential clients. The study of kindergarten programs examines the following topics: enrollment changes in the last five years; the types of schedules and their effects on children; types of curricula and their effects on children; and use of chronological age to determine compulsory attendance and entrance eligibility. In addition to a listing of state and federal initiatives and a summary of findings, an appendix provides a sample copy of the Early Childhood Education Program Survey Instrument used in 1984 to obtain baseline data on programs and to assess opinions of principals regarding early childhood education issues. A pamphlet describing the State Board of Education Policy Statement on early childhood education is also given. (DST)",

        "description":"This paper examines the relevance of social structure, in terms of class, race, and gender, in the lives of damaged parents of low power positions who abuse or neglect their children. The predominant view in the understanding and treatment of abusive parents stresses the parent's poor childhood experiences and the &quot;intergenerational cycle&quot; of the problem. Despite evidence for the &quot;classlessness&quot; of the problem, maltreating parents seem to be overrepresented in the low power segments of the society. In addition, evidence suggests that mothers, the poor, and ethnic minorities also are overrepresented among maltreating parents. Available data points to a particular psychological profile in these parents, characterized by a sense of powerlessness, low self esteem, isolation, and  dependency on welfare services. The effectiveness of individual therapy for abusive and neglectful parents is discussed, and suggestions for use of a developmental dialectical approach to therapy are addressed. Unlike the pschodynamic approach to therapy, developmental dialectics suggests that healing for damaged parents requires not only awareness of past victimization, but also of present social victimization. Several case studies illustrate some of the difficulties when damaged parents seek help from therapists. (DST)",

        "description":"A developmental dialectical approach to understanding and working with lower and middle class damaged parents--those identified as abusive and neglectful--has specific features and implications. The approach suggests that (1) the personality characteristics and interpersonal relations of parents are inseparable from their social conditions; (2) characteristics of adequate and damaged parents of lower and middle classes are both product and contributor to the social and material conditions of their classes; (3) poor parents' powerlessness and external locus of control reflects contradictions resulting from the interpenetration of social and psychological structures; and (4) the middle class's internal locus of control is as far from (or as close to) reality as the poor's external  locus of control. Dialectics' affirmation of the integrity of levels of systems suggests that all generalizations about social status cannot substitute for knowing the individual and that development and change ensue from contradictions inherent within and between systems. Intervention with low-power-position damaged parents involves clarifying their personal and social victimization. For middle class parents, too, intervention involves clarification of personal victimization and social pressures involved in maintaining social status. Team work, group therapy, and parent support groups should be the contexts of work with damaged parents; therapists should be supportive and affirmative. While healing might be slow and incremental, enough quantitative change will result in a qualitative  difference in the parent. (RH)",

The following parenting models and their relevant research are reviewed briefly: the psychoanalytic model (emphasizing intrapersonal and interpersonal family dynamics); the social structural model (emphasizing parents' membership in various social, cultural, or economic groups as fundamental to their childrearing practices); and the transactional model (focusing on interactions among family members). Two attempts to integrate these models are described: Bronfenbrenner's ecological model of development and Greenspan's developmental structuralist model. A developmental  dialectical approach might usefully integrate the strengths of both models. Next, a hypothetical composite sketch of a maladaptive parent is introduced, and suggestions for intervention using the aforementioned models are given. Next, the main tenets of the developmental dialectical model are outlined, and their relevance to adaptive and maladaptive parenting explained, emphasizing the differences in parenting between socioeconomic classes.

        "description":"Fifteen boys and 15 girls were interviewed during their seventh, ninth, and twelfth years about a friendship dilemma in which the protagonist had to decide whether to keep a promise given to a friend or to accept an invitation from a third child. Interviews assessed descriptive and prescriptive aspects of the differentiation and coordination of perspectives with regard to various components of social and moral cognition. These components include thinking about: (1) action choice (or choices) and motivating reasons; (2) consequences of the violation of interpersonal-moral obligations for those concerned, including the self; (3) the regulation of such consequences; and (4) the evaluation of action-choices in terms of moral rightness. Three developmental levels of  interpersonal-moral awareness were constructed on the basis of these components. Results provide evidence that children's concepts of morality are part of their understanding of actions, persons, and relationships. At the first two levels, the reasons for action and moral evaluation were clearly distinct from those derived in the context of Kohlbergian dilemmas. Marked agreement was found between Kohlberg's Stage 3 reasoning and what was characterized in this study as level 3 interpersonal-moral awareness. (RH)",

        "description":"This multivariate, longitudinal study examined the role of mothers' employment with respect to children's cognitive and social development, children's home environment, and mothers' attitudes toward employment. A total of 130 middle class children and their mothers participated. Data on children's cognitive and social development, the home environment, maternal employment status, and family structure variables were collected from the children's first to fifth year of age. When their children were 1 year old, 36 percent of the mothers worked; when children were 5 years old, 56 percent were employed. At the child's fifth year, mothers were questioned regarding their work patterns, attitudes toward work, and perceptions of the influence of their employment on their children's  development. Multiple regressions indicated that maternal employment status did not significantly predict children's development or home environment, whereas family structure variables were significant predictors. Mothers' attitudes were favorable, with the majority reporting a positive influence of employment on their child's development and family relationships. These data, in conjunction with previous longitudinal findings on home environment, indicate that the experiences to which children are exposed are important for development, regardless of maternal employment status. Results thus support a favorable view of maternal employment. Public policy implications are suggested. (Author/RH)",

Subjects were 72 fourth and fifth grade students low in subtraction skills. During pretests subjects indicated the extent to which they thought ability, effort, task characteristics, and luck helped them solve problems correctly; judged their capacity to solve different types of problems; and completed a skills test. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of six experimental conditions: male mastery model, male coping model, female mastery model, female coping model, teacher model, and instructional control (no model). All children in the five model conditions received two, 45-minute treatment sessions over  consecutive school days. During the sessions, they observed two videotapes presenting models posing and solving subtraction problems; tapes including peer models differed in sex of model, problem solving behaviors, and verbalizations of achievement beliefs and self-efficacy. Subjects then received 40 minutes of subtraction training and practice for 5 days. Posttests similar to pretests were administered. Results suggest that teachers who incorporate peer models into their classroom instruction may help to promote children's skills and self-efficacy for mastering the skills. Neither type of peer model nor sex of subject significantly affected self-efficacy for learning. Both boys and girls judged themselves more similar to the mastery than to the coping model; for each type of model, boys  made higher similarity judgments than girls. (RH)",

School principals can use various strategies to increase community involvement. They can simply extend an invitation to visit the school, allow the school building to be used for community activities, actively recruit community volunteers, and publish a school newsletter. One study showed positive school-community relations in schools that allowed citizens to use the library, advertised events in the news media, or had a cafeteria or gym open to community members. Because small and rural schools are often closely identifed with the  community, community cooperation is usually easy to secure and community members may be eager, or at least willing, to assist. They can serve on staff development planning committees, identify community resources, teach minicourses on local history, serve on advisory boards for various programs, and help to recruit teachers who fit the community. A key to good school-community relations may be community-minded administrators and teachers who participate in civic activities outside the school and feel comfortable in the community. (JHZ)",

An energy audit focusing on human, structural, lighting, mechanical, and special systems should occur and generate data on annual energy costs, climate conditions, and building strengths and weaknesses. Based on the audit, achievable goals should be set. Inexpensive energy conservation practices can include lowering  thermostats and water temperatures; removing decorative/unnecessary lights, caulking and/or weatherstripping windows/doors; limiting/consolidating evening activities including custodial work. Conservation methods requiring small capital outlays include installing smaller, well insulated windows, adding vestibules at outside doors; switching to fluorescent, sodium or mercury lamps; planting shade trees; installing heat recovery equipment and attic fans; repairing leaking faucets; repainting/resurfacing roofs to increase reflectiveness; developing vacation shutdown procedures.

While rural educators share the desire to provide excellence in education, the Commission and the United States Department of Education must recognize the unique characteristics of rural schools and provide appropriately different strategies to enable rural schools to meet the new goals. Rural educators urge national policy makers to recognize diverse rural subcultures, support innovative teacher training programs, develop career ladder and merit pay systems designed to retain quality rural personnel, support more comprehensive inservice training programs, support intermediate educational units, and provide adequate rural  special education services support. Problems for rural schools include insufficient funding and inadequate specialists to provide higher level basics, foreign languages, and advanced placement classes recommended as graduation requirements by the Commission. To strengthen programs, rural schools should consider senior student schedules, non-academic programs, classroom time on task, traveling teachers, and community participation. To support rural school reform, policymakers should address recruitment, support, and retention of rural teachers by providing flexible certification requirements, career ladder and merit pay programs, and adequate university teacher training programs.

The program was administered by the New York City Public Schools' Office of Bilingual Education and funded by Title IV of the Indian Education Act. Curriculum development continued, with emphasis on career orientation and alternatives available to Native American students. The program's instructional component included a 10-session mini-course on Native history, culture, and crafts in each of the city's boroughs; 31 presentations to Native American children in classes in their own schools throughout the city; trips  to Native American cultural events; individualized assistance with research projects on Native American subjects; a tutoring program for reading and elementary mathematics; and a 6-week summer session. Other activities focused on personal, academic, and vocational guidance support services; staff development; and parent and community involvement. Recommendations included: finding more accessible quarters or concentrating on reaching students in their homes, schools, and communities; improving coordination with other Indian organizations to identify students and increase program participation; prioritizing objectives; and expanding satellite classes held throughout the city.

Quality research to assess the effectiveness of rural education has been hampered by inconsistently applied definitions of &quot;rural&quot; and inadequate data to compare rural and urban districts. A study conducted in 1984 by the National Rural Education Research Consortium was the first comprehensive national effort to derive an empirical data base for rural education research priorities. This synthesis of the larger study reviews methodology, lists the nine resulting research priority clusters and the questions related to each cluster, and outlines implications for federal government, state agencies, higher education institutions,  rural schools and students, and data dissemination. The nine rank-ordered research clusters are listed as rural school effectiveness, governance and finance, staff training needs (technology as a resource), teaching styles and incentives, field-based personnel preparation, preservice preparation, personnel recruitment and retention, school-community interaction, and rural versus non-rural factors.

The work of the SRDC Business Management Network culminated in FY 1985 with the nationwide distribution of materials for small business management training. Plans are underway for several regional conferences that will address issues such as the interdependencies of agriculture and rural communities, water quality, and economic development for small communities. Materials development sponsored by the SRDC has included training for local officials in the selection and use of computers in  government and a bibliography on water law and water rights in the South. Nine studies or projects are investigating topics such as agricultural land conversion, water resources management, and rural labor markets. The SRDC's advisory committee formulated a 1986 plan of work that gave top priority to the farm crisis and its impact on rural communities, broad economic strategies for rural communities, and small farm assistance. The Center's information dissemination program produced a training manual for rural officials, newsletters, conference proceedings, reprints, etc. (JHZ)",

Results indicated that 21 of the 208 institutions in 27 rural states prepared students specifically for teaching in a rural environment. Fourteen of the suggested 26 components were currently available in over half of the institutions surveyed. The four components available at most institutions were: coursework in developing curriculum; training for work with exceptional children; coursework in educational technology; and training for teaching physical education, music, art, and community recreation. Although preservice programs were generally considered  nonessential by respondents, the need for special preservice training for teaching in a rural environment was considered essential. Recommendations to implement preservice training programs for rural teaching or to upgrade existing ones related the components to six areas: general curriculum concepts; preparation for rural cultural, social, and economic factors; realities of teaching and living in isolated areas; availability of regional service centers; need for faculty specialization in rural education; and awareness of characteristics and needs of rural teachers and schools.

This report focuses on the Administration's proposal, discussing in detail significant features that would affect agriculture: reductions in individual and corporate tax rates, modifications in investment tax credit and depreciation policies, changes in the current deductibility of various development costs, restrictions on property eligible for capital gains treatment, and limits on the use of the cash method of accounting. The current law  and the 3 proposed tax reform laws are compared on 12 provisions--expensing, capital gains, interest, cash accounting, development expenditures, conservation and land clearing, individual tax rates, standard deduction, personal exemption, corporate tax rates, investment tax credit, and depreciation. The final section examines four types of agricultural enterprise and compares their federal tax burden in dollar amounts under current law and the Administration's proposed reform. The hypothetical cases illustrate effects of proposed reform on orchard development, a crop farm, a dairy operation, and a hog operation. (JHZ)",

        "description":"A 3-year study of decentralization of Alaska schools identified several factors that influenced whether a school was locally controlled and found patterns of control associated in important ways with staff and community attitudes toward school. Information was gathered by surveys and interviews conducted in 28 communities randomly selected to represent all rural Alaska schools. Analysis of patterns of control showed 24% of rural Alaska schools with regionalized control, 40% with localized control, and 36% with &quot;mixed&quot; control. Field studies suggested that the attitudes and values of district superintendents were a major factor in decentralization. Localization of control was also dependent on a stable local administrator with positive attitudes toward the community, stable local  school boards that represented community interests, and district policy specifying areas of local authority in school governance. Measures of school climate and satisfaction with school showed significant differences among the three types of control. Administrators and teachers of regionalized schools were somewhat more proud of student academic achievement and learning than those of localized schools. Parents and community adults were particularly satisfied with Native culture and language programs at localized schools. Administrators and teachers at mixed control schools were significantly more likely to have negative expectations of students' ability and achievement than those in any other type of school. (JHZ)",

        "description":"The inappropriateness of using standardized achievement tests to measure the cognitive skills of Navajo children was demonstrated in a 1975-76 case study of 17 Navajo preschool and daycare children in Los Angeles. The Circus Receptive Vocabulary Test and the Circus Quantitative Concept Test were given individually to each child. Scores were compared with a sample of 66 randomly drawn children in the Tribal American preschool and daycare programs, and with national results. On both tests, the Navajo children in the study scored the lowest, with results below the national average. Children who had most difficulty with the tests were the youngest and lived in the least acculturated Navajo households, suggesting that the acculturative status of the child's household and the age of  the child influenced the child's response to the testing situation. The study concluded that because complex behavioral interactions involved in testing situations are almost never reported, &quot;objective&quot; tests results take on a reality that does not exist. Testing all individuals with the same instrument regardless of individual/cultural backgrounds is a misleading and culture-bound method of assessing and understanding the abilities of any given individual.

A major category of research needs and opportunities concerns the relationship between the inputs and the public service outputs of interest to consumers. Other research needs concern the development of technology for providing services under conditions  of sparse population, to isolated households, or in small communities; the development of alternative methods of delivering public services; and the effect of state and federal laws or restrictions on the presence/absence of services/facilities. Additional research is needed in conceptualizing and ensuring spillover benefits from public services, the effects of projected population growth/shifts on the aggregate amount of investment expenditure in various capital facilities, and data gaps in public finance problems.

The Old Order Amish also present a rapidly changing culture due to scarcity of farm land available for younger families and competing modern ideas. The majority of Old Order Amish buy health services when needed, but they do not carry insurance on property or personal life. They insist upon strict separation of church and state and do not participate in the social security system. Old Order Amish also believe that an eighth grade, parochial education with no kindergarten is  adequate for their children. Reading, writing, arithmetic, and religion are the basic curriculum. Basal textbooks are used in social studies, but science texts omit a study of evolution and contain Biblical injunctions. Schools are usually one-room buildings with outdoor privies and horse barns. Lack of electricity prohibits utilization of audio-visual aids. Old Order Amish pupils rank well in standardized achievement test results. (NEC)",

One group of 33 families was served in a Texas border area; the other 12 families were served in central Washington state. The sites represented extremes in terms of proportion of Spanish speakers in the general population. The study found that Washington families were more likely to be recent immigrants, with lower economic and educational status than their Texas counterparts. Relying on translators, Washington families had a poor understanding of their child's handicapping condition and were less able to deal with the  strains it placed on family life. Variables significantly related to positive behaviors on behalf of the handicapped child included: severity of handicap, level of mother's education, cohesive/supportive family structure, mother's knowledge of English, and greater economic resources. In most cases, the mother was the handicapped child's primary caregiver. Key factors for successful recruitment of parents into support efforts were issuing personal invitations, providing transportation, and making parents comfortable about bringing their child to meetings.

Studies show that rural youth learn citizenship and social studies knowledge, skills, and attitudes to about the same extent as the majority of their non-rural counterparts. Although rural schools as a class are well  within the educational mainstream of the nation, some rural schools offer inferior or superior opportunities for learning. The quality of research done on rural social studies has varied widely, possibly because of the lack of financial support available for research in rural education. Large scale research projects such as the National Science Foundation studies need to be continued and should be used as models for replication in local rural communities. References are included for the 33 studies reviewed in this paper. (JHZ)",

        "description":"Educational effects of migrant student mobility are reviewed and issues and recommendations for educational continuity are offered for discussion by policymakers. Considerations for discussion of mobility are presented: continuity of age-grade level progression and education/social/health services; agency responsibility; communication requirements; uniformity of instruction; graduation requirements; assessment procedures; record-keeping; materials cross-match indexing; and coordination of instructional, counseling, and administrative components. Issues inhibiting educational continuity are identified: lack of integration of migrant educational services; need for bilingual instruction; ineffective parent advisory councils; lack of coordination among funding and service delivery  agencies; problematic special education referrals; inadequate demographic data; interstate differences in competency testing and graduation requirements; inadequate records transfer; lack of communication among programs; and need for flexible programming, career guidance counseling, remedial classes, and uniform curriculum. Three recommendations call for research agenda developed by federal agencies to include needs studies, demographic data, migration patterns, nature of interschool communication, methods for meeting student needs; development of support services and remedial opportunities and innovative planning and administrative procedures; and a national interstate migrant student policy including uniform definitions of migrant students and reporting regulations, coordinated formulas  for fund allocation, guides to agency and administrator responsibilities, and federal funding of program coordination and development.

        "description":"The paper explores problems that frequently cause migrant students to become high school dropouts and outlines possible solutions; it chronologically reviews developments to provide continuity in migrant students' secondary education programs; and outlines further needed action. Identified as barriers to completion of high school are the economic necessity for migrant students to work; the negative attitudes of schools toward migrant students; the bewildering array of curriculums, requirements, and class schedules; specific state/local graduation proficiency standards; and access to special educational services because of mobile life styles and/or rural nature of schools. Cited among developments to provide credit accrual/exchange for secondary migrant students are the 1971  Migrant Student Record Transfer System and a 1981 National Policy Workshop on Education for Migrant Secondary Students. A chart outlines solutions, initiatives, and agencies having ultimate control for eight migrant student problems: lack of credit reciprocity, lack of fractional credit transfer, lack of course continuity, language barriers, inconsistent grade placement, inaccessible vocational and special programs, inaccessibility of mandated competency tests, and absence of alternative instruction. Recommended actions are supporting/adopting resolutions of the National Policy Workshop, implementing solutions offered by the Interstate Migrant Secondary Services Program, and explaining these policies/procedures at the state level.

        "description":"Knowledge-based expert computer systems are addressing issues relevant to all special educators, but are particularly relevant in rural settings where human experts are less available because of distance and cost. An expert system is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that typically engages the user in a dialogue resembling the conversation a person might have with an expert consultant. The expert systems could serve as consultants to the educator in addressing issues such as identification, diagnosis, and remediation of problems presented by special education students. A number of computer systems are available or under development that may be of immediate value to rural educators. One such system is the Buggy program which identifies a student's arithmetic  misconceptions by analyzing error patterns from test problems worked by the student. Several prototype programs are being developed by the staff of the Special Education AI Project at Utah State University to test the feasibility of using expert systems to solve problems in special education. For example, two CLAS.LD systems provide second opinions regarding the accuracy of the &quot;learning disabled&quot; classification. To prepare themselves to capitalize on the advantages of new technologies such as expert systems, educators in rural settings can develop their technological literacy. (JHZ)",

        "description":"The approximately 15,000 Hutterites living in the United States and Canada have a long history of development. Their founder, Jacob Hutter, became a martyr in 1536 in what is now Czechoslovakia. From Czechoslovakia, the Hutterites moved to the Ukraine in 1770 and to the United States in 1874. Hutterite philosophy emphasizes both modern and traditional ideas. Modern ideas permit the utilization and ownership of combines, tractors, trucks, telephones to communicate with other Hutterite communes and the outside world, as well as automobiles to transport people. Tradition resides in Hutterite systems of governing their people, language utilized on the bruderhof (commune), communal ownership of property, education of children, and religious beliefs to support their way of living. A  central Hutterite belief is conscientious objection to participation in war. Hutterites wish to be segregated from the larger society and maintain their right to educate offspring as they see fit. Character development, morality, and christian ethics are highly significant in Hutterite education. Teachers live on the commune, serve as models to their pupils, and teach in a manner which is accountable to God. Hutterite formal education ends at age 16, but selected adults take high school and university correspondence courses. (NEC)",

        "description":"This paper contends that women are as vital as men to the functioning of western ranches where cattle raising--or cattle culture--is central to the social system. The self-sufficient nuclear family is also emphasized, and a ranch couple is described as a business as well as a domestic partnership. Ranch women have four roles: rearing children, teaching ranch skills, and ensuring family continuation; raising cattle by participating as full cowhand and as ranch accountant, coordinator, and administrator; maintaining social relationships and cooperation among family and neighbors through hospitality; and representing the ranch and family in business and social matters where performance reflects on the family. Early Spanish and Mexican culture--in which women owned property, made  contracts, and held community property--influenced the development of an active role for women in cattle culture. Each generation has adapted this role to its needs, resulting in the present definition of a ranch family as a partnership and of women's role as an integration of economic and social function, of instrumental purpose and symbolic expression.

Chapter 1 (an introduction by Wynne Harlen) summarizes subsequent chapters. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 provide some general theoretical discussion about workshops. They are, respectively: &quot;Learning and Teaching Primary Science: The Case for a Workshop Approach to Teacher Training&quot; by Wynne Harlen; &quot;The Teacher's role and implications for Training&quot; by Jos Elstgeest; and &quot;Change in Science Education: The Social, Political, and Cultural Context&quot; by Juan Manuel Gutierrez-Vazquez. This latter chapter suggests that the power structure in a country, often reflected in the power structure within the educational system, affects the individual  teacher; it also suggests that new teaching materials and methods cannot bring about change alone. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 provide examples of in-service workshops in practice. They are, respectively: &quot;Reflections on a Workshop to 'Ask the Water'&quot; by Jos Elstgeest; &quot;Planning, Running, and Following Through a Workshop in England&quot; by Wynne Harlen, and &quot;Developing a Workshop Approach to In-Service Training in Indonesia,&quot; also by Wynne Harlen.

Indiana educators are required by law to provide for all students in grades 6-12 within the two weeks preceding each general election five full recitation periods of class discussion concerning the U.S. system of government, voting methods, party structures, and election laws, and the responsibilities of citizens to participate in government and in elections. These lessons, intended to help Indiana teachers fulfill that legal requirement and to extend it to all K-12 grades, are sequenced to align with the guidelines for the Indiana social studies curriculum. The sequence is as follows: K-1, freedom and responsibility (classroom and school); 2-3, rules and voting (neighborhood and community); 4-5,  organization of government (state and nation); 6-7, constitutionalism and power (world focus); 8-9, the American party system (civics, history); 10-11, electoral politics (civics, history); and 12, participating in government (American government). The kind of information provided for each lesson includes major ideas, learning objectives, learning activities, evaluation procedures, and resources needed. (RM)",

The student is asked to consider plans and options in each category and to provide written narratives. The instrument for the critiquing process is constructed as a Likert scale. The student responds to statements about the photograph and records a number corresponding to that response on the chart. The statements are organized under four categories that correspond to the categories in the assignment  plan. They are intention, subject, technique, and composition. The instrument is especially effective with elective students and with those students who do not have extensive prior experience in art or photography. The scale can be used by the teacher to critique student work, by the student for self-critique, and by a group of students to evaluate one another's work. (RM)",

Activities focus on geopolitical and cultural groups of nations, including Latin America, South Asia, East Asia, Western Europe, the Islamic world, French-speaking nations, newly industrializing countries, and Africa. Stereotypes, similarities and differences, and interrelationships among the nations are explored. The activities in the second section deal with the issues of human rights, labor, rich and poor nations, refugees, separatist movements, the arms race, global  environmental problems, and forms of power. In the last section students apply research skills to the &quot;Atlas&quot; as a whole. All the activities involve the use of more than one map and are structured to reinforce higher level cognitive skills.

The first of five articles, &quot;Sweeping Men and Harmless Women: Responsibility and Gender Identity in Later Life&quot; (Dorothy Ayers Counts), examines the perception of gender over the life cycle through a focus on the Lusi-Kaliai people of Papua New Guinea. &quot;Cultural Alternatives for the Vulnerable Elderly: The Case of China Past and Present&quot; (Andrea Sankar) considers the elderly in China who have &quot;fallen through the cracks&quot;--e.g., childless and single elderly. &quot;The Family Life of Older People in a Changing Society: India&quot; (Sylvia Vatuk) concerns the effects of urbanization on the aging in India. &quot;Aging, Power, and Status in  an East African Pastoral Society&quot; (Elizabeth H. Andretta) looks at a society in which the elderly are not a special status group. &quot;Familial and Public Contexts for Aging: Growing Old in a Rapidly Changing Mexican Village&quot; (Jay and Joan Sokolovsky) argues that societal transformation does not in itself preordain disastrous consequences for the elderly. Notes on contributors conclude the volume. (LP)",

        "description":"Study findings showed that living with a new family in a foreign country has a major and direct impact on the quality of young people's relationships with parents, siblings, and friends. A sample of 300 recently returned AFS students were surveyed; 173 students completed questionnaires. The returned students assessed their communication with their parents as being significantly higher in frequency and in quality than their communication with siblings and friends. Regarding changes that may have occurred in relationships since their departure for their homestay abroad, students revealed that relationships with friends changed more negatively than relationships with siblings or parents. One fifth of relationships with friends were described as deteriorating a great deal. In  contrast, only 2 percent of parent relationships and only 1 percent of sibling relationships were described in this way. Romantic attachments are especially prone to deterioration. In the cases of both romances and other friendships, the underlying cause of negative changes was often identified as the comparatively rapid maturation and increase in knowledge on the part of the returned AFS student.

The subjects included 220 first, second, third, and fourth graders ranging in age from six to nine years. One hundred and fourteen subjects were assigned to the treatment group. All subjects lived in a predominantly white neighborhood and attended one of two neighboring schools. Each subject was individually interviewed; responses were tape recorded and later scored by two trained judges who were specialists in economics. The major results indicated that children, as they get older, seem to have both a better understanding of cost-benefit analysis and a tendency to invoke such reasoning in everyday  decision making. Also, participation in an instructional program, Mini-Society, appears to produce both a greater understanding of and proclivity to utilize cost-benefit analysis. (Author)",

To assess the different aspects of men's and women's attitudes towards war, a 48-item Likert-type scale was constructed and administered to 148 students. Results showed that women will support war, at least as enthusiastically as men, when an appeal is made based on empathy for oppressed and vulnerable human beings, or an emphasis is placed on group cohesion and intensification of interpersonal relationships in the community during war. The data indicated that men are more prone than women to justify war according to rational and legal criteria, and that women find it more difficult than men to accept,  condone, or justify any acts of violence, killing, and destruction during war. It was also found that men more than women accept stereotypical sex roles during war, e.g., men as warriors and protectors and women as caretakers. (Author/RM)",

A Nuclear Weapons Policies questionnaire was administered to students before and immediately after the telecast of the movie. Seven days after the movie telecast, four class sections attended a previously scheduled lecture on the psychological aspects of the nuclear arms race. The questionnaire was again administered to all students ten days after the movie was televised. Results showed that the lecture did not enhance the effects of the movie. The lecture was then modified by introducing  more psychologically oriented information and tested on another group of 241 students. In addition to replicating most of the effects produced by the film and the film with lecture, the modification of the lecture format produced significant changes in estimates of the probability of nuclear war, and most importantly, in arms control opinions.

Resource monitoring and rationing were favored under both conditions. Those representing local groups not facing a crisis favored democratic usage decisions and were more likely to endorse solutions applied locally.

This study compares the work ethics of American and Japanese men. A questionnaire was designed to measure values related to America's &quot;Protestant work ethics&quot; and to traditional Japanese work ethics. Work Ethic Questionnaires were distributed to samples of 220 American and 368 Japanese employed men. T-test comparisons of groups resulted in significant differences on 29 of 34 work ethic items. American men were found to place a higher value on individualism, independence, and self-sufficiency, and tended to believe that education and hard work lead to success. Japanese men were found to place a higher value on group  involvement, loyalty to employer and country, and large over small organizations; and tended to agree with many of the values that have been termed &quot;Puritan&quot; or &quot;Protestant work ethic&quot; in America. Results were discussed in terms of American and Japanese cultural traditions and change. The data provided evidence that &quot;Protestant ethics&quot; are still strong in America, while some aspects of traditional Japanese work ethics may be changing. A reference list and a table showing the results of a comparison between the work values of American and Japanese men conclude the document. (Author/LH)",

Following a brief introduction, a background section provides an overview of Japanese American history, population size and socioeconomic measures, and selected social characteristics. A second section looks in greater depth at socioeconomic status as reported in findings of the United States Commission on Civil Rights and the United States Bureau of the Census. Among the findings are the greater tendency of Japanese Americans than White Americans to have two-income families, lower median incomes, high median education and overrepresentation in fields such as science and engineering. Also considered are characteristic social problems and the question of assimilation. Common conceptions of Japanese  Americans as having few social problems and assimilating easily are refuted. In the conclusion, the author states that the positive image of Japanese Americans has certain negative consequences in that it validates the American idea of equal opportunity and obscures important social problems facing Japanese Americans.

Through such involvement, young people will develop positive attitudes toward community participation that will persist throughout their adult lives. Community service projects represent an important and exciting way to bring democracy to life for young people and to demonstrate to them that they can solve problems and make vital contributions to improving the quality of life in their communities. The booklet begins by discussing the place of community service in the school program. The rationale and objectives of a school citizenship program and criteria for community service projects are discussed. Some existing community projects involving secondary students are  then described. Practical matters involved in developing community service programs are discussed. These include identifying community needs, defining personnel roles, scheduling and time considerations, financial considerations, and project planning. The last two sections discuss evaluation of projects and the future with regard to community service education. The booklet concludes with a bibliography. (RM)",

Individuals with no children in the public schools were included in the survey. Priority ratings for all questions are presented on tables. An overview of the results indicated that teaching basic skills and values to all students, regardless of their handicaps, should be a higher priority for Delaware Valley schools than teaching computers or the  arts. High priority was also assigned to teaching job skills to students not going on to college, and to providing programs for exceptionally bright students. Other high priority items were stricter promotion standards and more stringent discipline.

These values, and their political significance in terms of power and control issues, go far toward defining the educational experience that students and teachers, both in the schools and in universities, have. Educators are generally not conscious of the values that are embedded in the curriculum of teacher education. Our investigation suggests that the student teaching evaluation form used at the University of Alberta is technical, code (rather than meaning) centered, and focusses upon knowledge and value transmission rather than on a broader sense of education. The form embodies a set of ideological beliefs that impacts students, teachers, and the  school community. Student teaching evaluation forms, although they legitimate particular educational &quot;truths,&quot; do so quietly. They remain unexamined, partly because those directly involved in the student teaching experience fail to see the experience in anything more than the narrowest sense of practical. Our purpose is to examine one student teaching evaluation form thoroughly and critically to expose its theoretical and ideological agenda. (Author)",

Since the middle of the 1960s, movement education has gained in popularity as both a methodology and as a program focusing on learning through efficient movement. Several conferences have been conducted to develop conceptual frameworks for both the professional preparation of teachers of elementary physical education and the optimal implementation of the values of human movement as a medium of learning within the curriculum. \"Essentials of a Quality Elementary Physical Education Program,\" initially formulated by members of the profession in 1970, states guidelines for the integration of  elementary physical education as an integral part of the total educational program.

This paper reports on what has been learned from the MTIP and its satellite effort. A review of research studies on beginning teacher induction and problems of beginning teachers cites two major areas of concern for new teachers: classroom management and organization of content and instruction. Another key area of concern is the establishment of professional relationships as beginning teachers move into the school setting. A description is given of the research questions addressed by the MTIP and the instruments used to identify and clarify  the reactions and opinions of participants in the project. Some implications for staff development procedures are: (1) programs should not be structured around the assumption that the first year is always traumatic; (2) pairing a new teacher with an experienced teacher should be based on the fact that they teach the same subject at the same grade level; (3) address new teachers' concerns about classroom management immediately and monitor their concerns closely in order to determine when it is appropriate to introduce interventions; and (4) consider local needs, goals, and resources when designing the program.

        "description":"This study examined the relationships among reading activities, rules for pupil participation, student engagement, and subsequent student achievement in reading lessons taught by student teachers (ST) and experienced teachers (ET). Two ST/ET dyads were observed and interviewed while they instructed third and fourth grade pupils in reading. The teachers in one dyad had similar participation structures: however, their subsequent student engagement and student achievement were different. While the participation structures of the second dyad differed, student engagement and achievement were alike. The contrasts between dyads indicated different levels of ability between the two student teachers. The differential effectiveness of the student teachers suggests that several factors may  play important, interrelated roles in determining the success of novice teachers' reading instruction. The difference between these student teachers seemed to be explained best by their conceptions of their roles as student teachers, and the influence these conceptions had on their choice of participation structures and reading activities and their ability to implement these choices. These differences suggest that student teachers progress at different rates in the process of learning to teach. (JD)",

The purpose of the study was to gain insight into the roles played by incentives and rewards as teachers attempt to improve their practice with a new innovation. Ten classroom teachers participated. School sites were highly diverse. Through documentation of teachers' use of &quot;Quill,&quot; it was determined what incentives and rewards were offered to, and experienced by, the teachers, and how these interacted with the characteristics of the support sytem, school, classroom, and students to influence the implementation of &quot;Quill&quot; and its success as an innovation. This final report documents the background of the  study, the research design, findings, and cross-case analyses. Detailed case study reports are presented along with analyses of teachers' implementation of &quot;Quill.&quot;&quot;Quill&quot; vignettes are included. Rewards to teachers for putting effort into the innovation depended upon the success of the effort and the teacher's ultimate interest in the innovation.

        "description":"This study examined the conduct of academic tasks in six secondary classrooms, focusing specifically on assigments requiring some higher level cognitive operations, with attention to how management strategies and classroom conditions associated with these assignments affect their cognitive demands on students. Analysis of tasks in these six classes was designed to answer the questions: (1) How often were higher level tasks attempted and what was the nature of these tasks? (2) What management strategies and conditions were associated with conduct of higher order tasks? and (3) What impact did these management strategies and conditions have on student engagement in the tasks and on their use of intended or other cognitive operations. All classes were under the direction of  experienced teachers, and three classes were designated honors sections. Each of the classes was observed for six or seven weeks, and teachers were interviewed at the beginning and end of the study in each class. Tables present descriptions of the tasks in each class, and notes on how the class was managed. A catalog of management strategies describes ways in which safety nets were provided for students to reduce the risk of failure. It was concluded that the teachers were not equally or consistently successful in engaging their students in higher level tasks. Other studies have suggested that many secondary teachers avoid or mismanage higher level tasks. (JD)",

        "description":"Researchers have found that the elderly are as capable of learning motor skills as younger persons but perform better under some conditions than others. For example, the elderly learn and perform motor skills more efficiently when there is additional time to respond to stimulus. Tasks which are self-regulated rather than directed by an external source allow the older person additional time to monitor the accuracy of their response. This results in greater probability of an accurate response even at the expense of speed. This is a common trait of elders who feel that errors are more detrimental to quality performance than reduced speed. It is hoped that the use of cognitive strategies by older performers will enable them to be more efficient in feeling more comfortable and perform  at maximal efficiency under a variety of environmental conditions. Examples of cognitive strategies which might be most compatible with meeting this objective include imagery, anticipation, self-verbalization, chunking, rhythm, focused attention, and pre-cueing. This paper includes a review of each of these cognitive operations and practical suggestions for using them in teaching the older adult learner. A 59-item reference list is appended. (Author/JD)",

Without fundamental changes in the ways that teachers teach, changes will not occur in the learning outcomes of a particular lesson or class or school. Pervasive and widespread change in teacher education has already occurred. These changes include: raised admission criteria; more rigorous exit requirements; more student teaching experience; increased use of standardized achievement testing; and greater reliance on technology. To continue the reform, groups interested in education reform must recognize that teacher education is \"nested\" in colleges and universities often caught in  the middle of competitive and intense pressure. Changes in teacher education must be responsive to the aspirations and needs of the profession and also be accountable to teacher education institutions. Actions for change must be consistent. The teacher induction or internship process may be the best strategy for the immediate future of teacher education. (CB)",

This paper assesses the extent to which research on teaching has served as a suitable resource for the profession of teaching and suggests ways in which that service might be enhanced or extended. It is pointed out that an attempt to relate the notion of profession to the study of teaching requires clarity about what the term \"profession\" means and what role knowledge plays in the process of being or becoming a professional. Issues of  professionalization are explored with particular reference to education. The status and utility of the knowledge that has emerged from teaching research is examined.

Results showed  that Rasch and z-item difficulty parameters were similar. Item fit increased as sample size increased. The removal of poorly fitting items improved fit values for the entire test, but worsened them for the remaining items.

During the late 1920's, intelligence tests became popular; teaching aptitude, subject matter competence, and knowledge of testing were also measured. In 1931, a cooperative program of the Teachers College Personnel Association and the American Council on Education tested entering education majors. Quality was found to vary considerably. A large-scale evaluation program, initiated by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, tested high school and college students in Pennsylvania. The Cooperative Test Service (CTS) of the American Council on Education, organized in 1930, provided teacher tests for participating  school districts. The tests covered English comprehension and expression, reasoning, general culture, professional information, contemporary affairs, and relevant subject areas. The director, Ben Wood, promoted use of the test as one criterion for teacher selection, while making statements about the mediocrity of teachers. The CTS's first NTE, developed in 1939,resembled its earlier versions. It stressed basic intellectual and communication skills, cultural and contemporary background, and professional information. These areas are still important in the current NTE, which is administered by Educational Testing Service. (GDC)",

The findings do not support those previously reported in the literature. Regression equations and theoretical expectancy tables were prepared for use by residency program directors in predicting future success in the certification process. Various factors that possibly influenced the size of the correlation coefficient are discussed, including examination purpose/content,  security breaches, motivations to take the examination, and other factors. Implications for other medical specialties in analyzing and interpreting In-Training Examination results are discussed. (Author/BS)",

        "description":"Multidimensional item difficulty (MID) is proposed as a means of describing test items which measure more than one ability. With mathematical story problems, for instance, both mathematical and verbal skills are required to obtain a correct answer. The proposed measure of MID is based upon three general assumptions: (1) the probability of answering an item correctly increases monotonically with an increase in each dimension being measured; (2) it is desirable to locate an item at a single point in a multidimensional space; and (3) the best point to use in defining the MID for an item in the multidimensional space is the point where the item is most discriminating and provides the most information about the person being measured. To demonstrate the procedure, the multidimensional  extension of the two-parameter logistic (M2PL) model has been selected. M2PL parameter estimates are computed using item response data from a sample of 1,000 students who took the ACT Assessment Mathematics Usage Test. As a basis for comparison, a traditional item analysis and a three-parameter logistic calibration using LOGIST are performed on the same data set. It is concluded that the results are readily interpreted. (GDC)",

        "description":"A procedure which may be used to project the frequency distribution of one test onto that of another test is described and illustrated. The procedure is useful when a test developer wishes to construct an alternate form with preferred distributional characteristics. For example, the test developer may wish to construct a new test form with a completely different set of items but which yield comparable measures of central tendency, dispersion, skewness and kurtosis, reliability (KR-20, KR-21, Kappa), norms, pass-fail rates, etc. Rather than constructing alternate parallel tests, the test developer may wish to construct alternate forms which are substantially easier or harder. The procedure is also applicable in that situation. The technique assumes that items on both tests have  been previously calibrated and equated with the one-parameter Rasch model. The three-parameter logistic model may also be used when number-right rather than pattern scoring is used. A basic skills multiple choice test consisting of 21 items or 32 items provides the illustration. (Author/GDC)",

This standard survey form was modified by presenting a range of values and increasing the question length to improve the rate and the quality of the data collected. Six participating districts were randomly assigned to data collection (mail, phone, or mixed) and were then randomly half-sampled. The overall response rate for both the modified mail and phone format was significantly higher than for either of the standard formats. The lack of a screening question for employment confounds whatever effects the format modifications might have made. The results  indicate no pronounced pattern in the mailed item response rates. Further, it is only if the phone interviewers react positively to the form that one might expect to see improvement in overall response rates for the modified phone group. However, no systematic measures of interviewer attitudes towards the standard or modified forms were attempted. The appendices include the standard and modified forms for both the mailed questionnaire and the phone interview. (PN)",

Longitudinal data over three years tracked four cohorts of students to address when retention appears to be most effective and whether a combination of repeated classroom instruction and remedial services can correct such deficiencies. The issue of relative effects of early or later retention was addressed by comparing the performance of promoted-then-retained and retained-then-promoted students using the Statistical Analysis System general linear models procedure to compare 1984 grade 3 performance of the two groups with initial 1982 grade 2 performance differences controlled. The issues of promotion  and then mastery of subsequent grade level skills, as well as the prevention of later academic difficulties were addressed by computing the numbers and percents of students meeting the performance standards of the BST and the mean BST scores of promoted and then retained group of students. The results indicate that a combination of remedial instruction and a repeated year of classroom instruction appears adequate for correcting skill deficiencies among the majority of students. (PN)",

        "description":"The effectiveness of 19 methods of smoothing was investigated as those methods apply to the equipercentile method of test equating. Seven methods involved smoothing the score distribution before the tests were equated (presmoothing). Seven involved smoothing the resultant points after the equating (postsmoothing). Five methods involved combining presmoothers and postsmoothers. The results of smoothing were evaluated by comparing smoothed and unsmoothed equatings with large sample equating or other criterion equatings. The data that were used include the results of test simulations and results of administrations of military selection tests. Measure of average absolute deviation, average signed deviation, and root mean square deviation were calculated. Jackknifing was also used to  estimate standard errors of equatings. The nonlinear presmoothers were less effective than a presmoother based on negative hypergeometric distribution. Among the postsmoothers, the most promising was a technique using cubic smoothing splines. Combining presmoothers and postsmoothers was not notably more effective than either smoother alone. It is suggested that the family of smoothing functions based on the negative hypergeometric be more fully investigated. (Author)",

Data for two tests plus an external anchor test were generated from a three parameter model in which mean test differences in difficulty, discrimination, and lower asymptote were manipulated. In each case two data sets were generated consisting of responses of 2,000 examinees to a 35 item test plus 15 item anchor test. Each test equating case was comprised of 4,000 examinees and 85 items. The robustness with respect to violations of assumptions was tested for the linear and Rasch equating methods. For equipercentile equating, the results showed how the  method responded to various conditions for the three-parameter model, the study primarily tested LOGIST's simultaneous estimation procedure. Results indicated that equipercentile equating was very stable across the cases studied. Linear and Rasch model equating were very sensitive to violations of their models' assumptions. Results for the three-parameter model were disappointing. Paying close attention to test item properties was advised when selecting an equating method. (BS)",

Analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, multiple analysis of variance, and multiple analysis of covariance are heavily used by educational researchers. It is concluded that researchers would do well to consider using general linear model (GLM) techniques as opposed to analysis of variance and its analogs. GLM and analysis of variance are equivalent when the ways in an analysis of variance design each have exactly two levels. In other cases, the GLM analytic approach yields more specific information regarding effects, and greater power against Type II error, because the comparisons are planned a priori rather than post hoc. Multivariate  canonical correlation methods are superior to univariate techniques in providing important information on the interrelationships among variables. Furthermore, multiple univariate procedures tend to inflate the probability of a Type I error. (GDC)",

Using a two-step analysis based on linear regression, rather than the direct search interative procedure, gave about equally good results while providing a 33 to 1 computer processing time advantage, across 14 cohorts of junior medical students rated by residents and attending physicians in a medicine clerkship. First, regression analysis of z-transformed ratings produced regression weights (b's) associated with each rater and subject. Then, the unit vector and person b's were converted into inter-person distances, then person locations on the underlying stringency and ability scale. Essentially equally good fit with the data was achieved by the new method in 12 of the 14  data sets. In the other two, fit was still quite good. Correlation between parameter values estimated by the two methods was very high in groups where equal fit was achieved. In the other two, moderately high correlations were observed. The new method provided equally good improvement in reliability and convergent validity of adjusted scores. The improved economy and ease of application of the new method further expanded the advantages of using the Casons' model to statistically control rater bias. (Author/GDC)",

When Pearson product-moment correlations are used to measure zero-order associations involving dichotomous variables, the resulting coefficients underestimate the true associations. As a result, using product-moment correlations involving dichotomous variables in regression equations apparently yields biased partial regression estimates. The analysis reported here was based on fifty sets of simulated data with 500 cases and four independent variables in each set. We found that tetrachoric and polyserial correlations for associations involving dichotomized variables yield more accurate estimates of the regression coefficients based on the  underlying continuous data than did product-moment correlations for the same dichotomous variables.

The theory and research methods of selected verbal information processing paradigms are reviewed. Work in factor analytic, information processing, chronometric analysis, componential analysis, and cognitive correlates psychology is discussed. The definition and measurement of cognitive processing operations, stores, and strategies involved in performance on verbal test items and test-like tasks is documented. Portions of the reviewed verbal processing paradigms are synthesized and a  general model of text processing is presented. The verbal processing model serves as a conceptual framework for the subsequent identification and assessment of cognitive processing contributions to performance on the verbal subtests of ASVAB 8/9/10.

Priorities are input to the Instructional System Development training model, which guides the development and revision of specialty training courses. For 20 percent of specialties, training emphasis ratings have been subject to poor interrater agreement. Data may contain conflicting rating policies within a specialty. To develop a methodology for identifying multiple rating policies in such data, this research investigates: (1) the variation in interrater agreement with respect to sample size; and (2) the multiple rating policy hypothesis via modified REXALL analysis, cluster  analysis, and factor analysis. Agreement is found to vary within and across sample sizes, and a minimum of 55 raters is recommended. REXALL analyses are inconclusive with respect to confirming the presence or absence of multiple rating policies. Results indicate that samples of training emphasis ratings are less complex than expected. REXALL analyses are recommended for single ladder specialties; principal components factors analysis with VARIMAX rotation is recommended for multiple factors--extracting one and then multiple factors as appropriate. Interpretation of these results can be enhanced with CODAP auxiliary programs. (LMO)",

        "description":"Recent theorists have begun to re-conceptualize the construct of &quot;intelligence.&quot; This paper reviews recent theories of intelligence and indicates implications for practitioners, educators, and individuals. Theories and theorists discussed include the following: (1) Robert Sternberg has advanced the &quot;triarchic theory&quot; of intelligence with three subtheories (componential sub-theory, experiential sub-theory, and a contextual sub-theory). Of particular importance for education are Steinberg's conception of &quot;insight,&quot; his components of &quot;knowledge acquisition,&quot; and his conception of &quot;automaticity.&quot; (2) Howard Gardner has indicated that there is no single intelligence, but that there are several types. These include linguistic, logical, mathematical, visual and spatial  conceptualizations, body kinesthetic skills, inter-personal abilities and intra-personal knowledge. (3) Warren Dohemann and Melvin Suhd have removed emphasis from higher theoretical aspects of intelligence to the practical matters of learning and education. They point toward growth and the maximization of intelligence through the curriculum. (4) Alan and Nadine Kaufman have developed the Kaufman Assessment Battery for testing of sequential and simultaneous processing, in an effort to integrate theory and practice. (5) Feuerstein's Learning Potential Assessment Device also has a strong theoretical foundation. (6) Thorndike has advocated an information processing point of view toward intelligence. His processing perspective encompasses long and short term memory, neuristics, and speed of  processing. (LMO)",

Data consisted of (1) information from school records, (2) information on personal background, (3) scores on three intelligence tests and three standardized achievement tests, and (4) replies to questionnaires on pupil attitudes and interests. Students born in 1953 provided similar material for the second set of data. In 1980, a two-step sampling design was used: (1) A stratified sample of 29 out of 277 local communities was drawn. (2) From these communities, a systematic sample of classes from grade six, mostly students born in 1967, was selected. Comparisons were made by year of  testing, by sex, and by blue- or white-collar status. Results showed that the average level of spatial and reasoning intelligence had risen over 20 years. Verbal intelligence increased during the 1960's but declined later. Changes in performance were noted between sexes, but not between social groups. Girls advanced more than boys in the verbal test from 1961 to 1980, and overcame the boys' lead in spatial and reasoning ability. (LMO)",

The highlight of the reshaping of the NAEP data has been the scaling using item response theory (IRT). AT this point in the data analysis, an IRT-based scale appears appropriate for reading proficiency. A single dimension that spans the three grade levels (4, 8, and 11) and the three age levels (9, 13, and 17) has been located. A report of results on a scale representing a hypothetical test with known properties is in preparation. Effects of changing the administration of exercises from a tape recording to pencil-and-paper have been examined. Data from past NAEPs are being rescaled onto the new reading proficiency scales for  analysis of trends. Present technology has been adapted to mesh with the new Balanced Incomplete Block (BIB) spiralling. The following activities are discussed in detail: (1) the multifaceted approach to establishing the dimensionality of the reading parameters; (2) estimation of reading parameters; (3) proficiency imputation; (4) the reading proficiency scale; and (5) trend data.

Numerous methodological problems arise, however, when research synthesis is applied to studies conducted in field settings. The present paper categorizes and discusses these problems as being threats to either the (1) internal validity (whether one can draw conclusions about cause and effect), (2) statistical conclusion validity (whether one's inferential statistics are capable of detecting cause-and-effect relationships), (3) construct validity (whether one's treatments and outcome measures are valid operationalizations of the independent  and dependent variables of interest), or (4) external validity (whether one can generalize results to particular populations, settings, or time periods) of research synthesis (see Cook and Campbell, 1979). Specific recommendations are made for minimizing these threats to validity, in order to improve the quality of research synthesis in program evaluation. (Author)",

Teachers were provided with specific formal feedback through a program called The Effective Use of Time Program (EUOT). The program had four components: (1) observation in the classroom and feedback about performance; (2) information from research applied in the context of a teacher's specific situation; (3) opportunities for guided practice; and (4) observation and feedback following workshops to assess improvement. To test EUOT, data from 40 elementary, junior high, and secondary teachers were examined. These observations, using the Stallings Observation Instrument (SOI), provided a message of actual teacher performance. Four variables were  selected for comparision from self-rating and observation data: (1) managerial and organization efficiency; (2) student discipline; (3) interactive instruction; and (4) monitoring. Results showed that teachers improved their actual performance and gave themselves higher ratings at the end of the program. In general, teachers were no more accurate in assessing their performance after training, although junior high teachers showed significant relationships between posttraining self-ratings and observed behavior. Several explanations are given for failure of data to show wider improvements in accuracy of self-assessment, and five tables are included to show results. (LMO)",

The Basic Skills Placement Test (BSPT) is required of all College freshman in New Jersey public colleges. Mercer County Community College, used as an example throughout this paper, uses the BSPT as a basis for placing students in appropriate remedial courses in writing, reading, and mathematics. The development of tests designed to measure the reading ability of college students and adults has not kept pace with the instructional programs. The few, widely used, standardized tests are discussed, especially the Nelson-Denny Reading Test (NDRT), designed for average college students. The NDRT is popular because of low cost and short administration time, but it  has several shortcomings for remedial testing, including: (1) limited testing time; (2) no gradual increase in difficulty of items; (3) questionable results as a pre/post test measure; and (4) use of passage-dependent items. Ten desirable features in a diagnostic test for remedial college students are discussed at length. If a diagnostic test is well matched with the reading program, the information gained can assist instructional planning. (LMO)",

Current achievements are often attenuated by poor language skills, especially when English is not the first language of the child. Similarity thinking assesses the child's ability to learn without achievement constraints. The model of similarity, composed of seven types of thinking, is discussed in relation to several theories, including (1) Piagetian theory, (2) Feuerstein's model and (3) Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. Aids are used in present research studies not only to assess children's potential to learn, but also to help them move along Vygotskys'&quot;zone of next or potential development&quot;. According to this view,&quot;competence&quot; is not a &quot;point&quot;, but rather a range or zone on a developmental scale (the similarity thinking scale) which is affected both by environmental and organismic influences. A practical consequence of this approach is that ethnic minority children will be more appropriately placed in school learning environments. (Author/LMO)",

One hundred five female undergraduates were classified according to their Repression-Sensitization type and were presented with threatening self-relevant information. Self-report measures of anxiety were then obtained and were supplemented by the monitoring of physiological response. As expected, repressives alone demonstrated a discrepancy between physiological and self-reported distress levels in response to the threatening information. Following debriefing, all participants types returned to baseline levels on both distress measures. It was  concluded that debriefing can effectively ameliorate the negative consequences of distress resulting from experimental participation, even among persons whose self-reports characteristically misrepresent their true reactions.

        "description":"This study examines the effect of the degree of family politicization on several citizenship orientations of adolescents. The research population consisted of 734 respondents, ages 14-18, who were students in both academic and vocation schools in the greater Tel-Aviv area. Degree of family politicization was assessed using three sub-scales: parents' own involvement; the extent to which parents and children discuss politics, and the degree to which parents encourage their children to take an active public role in school and in youth organizations. Citizenship orientations included the perception of the citizen role as active vs. passive, and as restricted to the political sphere vs. as a broader commitment to one's community and society. Also included were political efficacy,  support of freedom of speech, and political involvement. A path model measuring the effects of social and personal background variables and of family politicization was tested. The major findings indicate that respondents' age and S.E.S. [socioeconomic status] were related to their perceived degree of family politicization. The older the respondents and the lower their S.E.S., the greater the tendency to report of lower family politicization. Concerning the effects of family politicization upon the perception of the citizen role, none of the path coefficients was statistically significant, and the percentage of explained variance was low. Concerning the other citizenship orientations, family politicization had significant effects. The higher the degree of family politicization, the  greater the political efficacy and involvement of the respondents, and the lower their support of freedom of speech. (Author)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine and compare how Israeli-Arab and Eastern-Jewish adolescents view the role of the citizen. Both groups share a minority status within Israeli society, but have different socializing environments and different political and cultural status. The study population consisted of 118 Israeli-Arab and 279 Eastern-Jewish adolescents ages 16-18. They were asked to rate 36 questionnaire items according to their importance for good citizenship. The data indicate that, overall, Arab respondents tended to assign less importance than their Jewish counterparts to all the items describing good citizenship. As expected, Arab youth assigned greater importance to the non-political than to the political dimension of good citizenship. Within the active and the  passive categories the items which were considered important by them reflect a minimal commitment to the State and its institutions. Eastern-Jewish adolescents did not differ in their civic orientations from the general Israeli public. They assigned greater importance to the political, rather than to the non-political dimension of good citizenship, and stressed passive orientations more than active-participatory ones. No differences were found concerning the measured civic orientations between boys and girls in both groups. (Author/CR)",

Twenty percent of the 139 students in the classrooms were black males. Of the six teachers, all of whom were female, three were white and three were black, with the black teachers in charge of the classes with heavier black enrollment. The observations concentrated on: (1) teacher's perceptions of these students; (2) interactions between teachers and black males; and (3) black males' experiences in peer networks. Major findings include the following: the teachers observations were that the black males had poor academic skills on the whole, were a  potential behavior problem, and exhibited estrangement and posed a vague threat. Black male student and teacher interactions were more limited than for other students, black males resisting out of class chats with teachers nearly two to four times as often as other students. Black males were also less attentive to the teachers, which led to teachers' feeling that the students were unready for the work. Black males' peer interactions were, in comparison to other students, more central to their schooling experience. They were more insular; gaining status among peers was more important; and group unity was greater and caused tension with the teachers. (CG)",

Five additional, more specific goals of the conference were: (1) To examine the Asia-Pacific situation in relation to global and historical immigration patterns; (2) To analyze immigration in the context of other international linkages to obtain insight into its causes and implications; (3) To call attention to the impact of emigration upon the sending countries; (4) To address the question of what Asia-Pacific immigration portends for the region; and (5) To facilitate policy analysis through building a better data base and stimulating analyses of the role of international migration in the Pacific Basin. The first section is a  description of highlights and conclusions regarding demographic information about the various Asia-Pacific immigrant groups in the United States, societal factors influencing immigration, and the impact of immigration on the countries of the immigrants' origin. This section is followed by abstracts of the numerous conference papers and panel discussions, each approximately 700 words long. Next is a summary of research and policy issues addressed by three working groups that met during the conference, on gains and losses to the sending country, gains and losses to immigrants and the receiving country, and the implementation and effectiveness of U.S. immigration policy.

        "description":"Six school-based improvement programs distributed throughout the United States were studied in order to determine how effective these plans have been and what factors help or hinder them. The programs studied shared three central features: 1) focus on the school as a whole; 2) involvement of teachers in designing improvements; and 3) incorporation of elements of rational planning. It was found that while school staffs are able to establish a continuous planning and review process, these processes do not necessarily lead to improved instruction. Two important factors for achieving instructional improvement were found to be the instructional content and support for change. The conditions they found necessary for achieving improvement were that preconditions for change existed, that  there was instructional leadership within the school, and that conditions outside the school (i.e. Federal or State government) were favorable. The general conclusions were that: 1) the concept of treating the school as an organizational entity and developing a process for ongoing planning and review with staff involvement is sound; 2) the creation of school based planning and change is difficult; 3) the fact that planning groups can be formed, even though they may not immediately cause instructional improvement, is hopeful; 4) there is little evidence that the most needy students will be overlooked in school-based improvement plans, although more serious risks lie at the district level and disadvantaged schools require more resources; 5) the kinds of knowledge, skills and actions  essential to instructional leadership can be used as criteria for identifying and training local staff as change agents and to develop and expand preservice training programs.

        "description":"Project HAPTT (Haitian Parent-Teacher Training) is a training program for educators and members of the New York community who work with limited English proficient Haitian students in Haitian Creole/French-English bilingual programs. The project is comprised of two components: the Parent Training Institute (which helps parents acquire skills to assist their children in the educational process) and the College Component (which identifies and assists Haitian Americans who have an interest in pursuing a career in education). Both components were evaluated in 1981-82, the first year of Project HAPTT. The evaluation of the college component focused on: the recruitment and hiring of staff; the recruitment and screening of prospective trainees; the course of study offered; and the  general success of the program. By the end of the year, all trainees were found to have a good understanding of their responsibilities as part of the program, the goals of bilingual education, and the needs of the Haitian community. The evaluators also found that the Parent Component was highly successful in meeting its first-year goals. It concentrated its efforts on gathering and disseminating information, developing materials, preparing and holding workshops and conferences, and producing radio programs. Despite its overall success, the parent outreach activities encountered difficulties in the area of radio programming. During the year of the evaluation, a Project Advisory Committee was formed to discuss the Project's progress and to identify concerns and goals.

The project represents a comprehensive effort to attack the problems encountered by Haitian students and parents in the New York public school system. This evaluation of the second year of Project HAPTT's operation at City College of New York was conducted using information gathered from September 1982, to August 1983. The evaluators found that the Project continued to function much as it did during the first year, and complied with the specifications of its grant proposals. The first of the Project's two major divisions, the College Component,  assists college students interested in education to get special training towards a bachelors degree in elementary education, with a bilingual (Haitian-Creole) concentration. The achievement levels of the 1982-83 freshmen were found to be well above average, and all the students interviewed praised the help and concern of Project staff. All the courses developed by the Project were found to have been completely institutionalized, ensuring that the degree program will continue to be offered after the grant period. The second major component of the Project, which attempts to provide Haitian parents with the skills they need to meet their responsibilities, consists largely of outreach activities. The evaluators found that the links between this component and the Training Component were  continuing to increase, especially as trainees have become more involved in outreach. Under the leadership of HAPTT's Advisory Committee, the Parent Component launched a campaign to focus community attention on the needs of Haitian children, entitled &quot;The Haitian Child: Struggling for a Future.&quot; (KH)",

The first part of the paper describes why and how Project HAPTT was established to attack the problems of Haitian students and parents in the New York City public school system. Next, the Project staff is discussed: no staff changes for 1983-84 are reported, and a recommended increase of staff size was not implemented due to the necessity of locating funding. Evaluated next is the College Component of the project, which assists students interested in education in  developing a Creole-Haitian concentration. It functioned as successfully as it had previously. The only major shift in emphasis, it is reported, was in the completion of the process of institutionalizing the Project courses. The discussion of the College Component next focuses on the achievement of the 31 students to whom the Project provided guidance. The remainder of the report deals with activities carried out by the Project's Advisory Council and its Parent Component, which disseminates information to Haitian parents. Conferences, workshops, meetings, and interactions with other institutions are also described. The findings of a survey of Haitian students in public and private schools are summarized.

These speeches were followed by six work sessions. The first gave four minority viewpoints on the problem of desegregation and bilingual education in the participants' individual communities. The second was on how to build a support system for  bilingual education in an integrated school system, focusing on case study examples and emphasizing the need for status equalization between students with different ethnic and language backgrounds. The third session was on the observations of one speaker who had toured the country examining different desegregation and language assistance programs. Three examples are given of programs the speaker found effective. In the fourth session the speaker discusses what California children are entitled to and what they receive in terms of equal access to equal education. The fifth session concerns the factors that positively and negatively affect desegregation and bilingual education programs. The sixth concerns convincing parents, principals and the community of the value of an integrated  education. (CG)",

The learning activities suggested are intended to teach children about place names, flora and fauna, songs, and historical facts about their community, so that they learn to formulate generalizations about location, adaptation, utilization, and conservation of their Hawaiian environment. Unit II presents activities which immerse children in the study of diverse urban and rural communities in Hawaii. The activities promote the study of factors that influence the start and growth of communities in Hawaii and elsewhere in the world, the ecosystem, environmental ethics and economics, and the adaptation of animals and plants to the various environments found in Hawaii. General appendices include a  basic Hawaiian vocabulary list, discussions of the concepts of self and &quot;'ohana&quot; (family-based community); a bibliography and discography; and a list of songs cited in the text.

        "description":"California's demonstration programs in reading and mathematics are the State's only educational programs whose funds are used exclusively to serve low-achieving students from disadvantaged areas at the junior high-middle school level. The purpose of the programs is threefold: to establish exemplary programs in reading and mathematics instruction in Grades 7, 8, and 9; to develop the reading and mathematics competence of low-achieving students; and to disseminate these successful practices to other educators. The findings of a series of annual reports submitted to the Legislature since 1970 show that the demonstration programs have adhered closely to the legislative mandate in serving those students in disadvantaged areas. They also show that low-achieving students in reading and  mathematics can equal or surpass expected standards of achievement as the result of the programs' intervention. The report shows, moreover, that the demonstration programs have operated with increasing efficiency over the years, both in use of funds and in promoting student achievement. Finally, the demonstration programs' information and materials have been extensively adapted and utilized by other educational professionals throughout California as the result of dissemination activities. The State Department of Education recommends that the current demonstration programs in reading and mathematics be continued because they have been effective in promoting student achievement. Further, the legislature should consider three additional options: (1) obtaining new information on demonstration  program practices; (2) expanding these practices to new schools; and (3) developing new demonstration programs in other curricular areas.

        "description":"Evaluations of Chapter 1 programs usually center on one of three questions: (1) Does the program constitute an appropriate Federal investment? (2) Does the program have the potential to benefit students? and (3) Is the program feasible enough to implement? Often, evaluators and legislators disagree over which of these questions is most important. In the case of Chapter 1, getting the money to the right children is an outcome of great interest, and many congressmen assume that once that is accomplished, it is up to the district to see that the funds are used effectively. At the moment, the most asked question concerns whether and how well a proposed program can be implemented. This is evident in the National Institute of Education's (NIE) mandate to study the reauthorization of  Chapter 1: of the seven items of information requested by Congress, six concerned implementation, and only one concerned effectiveness. It is likely that the 1987 reauthorization hearings will reflect this configuration of questions. Thus, the NIE study will focus on four implementation questions (administration, targeting, program design, and services). This study differs from others in its efforts to review existing evidence (rather than gathering new data) and in the design of its implementation study, which emphasizes the way context can influence the fate of the Chapter 1 program. Two very different kinds of contexts can have an impact: (1) local organization factors and the management and budgetary constraints faced by Chapter 1 directors, and (2) the educational &quot;mood&quot; of the  district, and nation, regarding the desired direction of education.

The objectives were to assess the attitudes and perceptions held by Israelis regarding Eqypt and Eqyptians, and to evaluate the pattern of change occurring in these attitudes and perceptions following an intervention program and subsequent contact with Egyptians during a standard tour of their country. The subjects were 662 (Jewish) Israelis visiting Egypt on 16 organized tours. There were two groups--an experimental group which was exposed to programs designed to improve Israelis' perceptions of Egyptians and a control group which was not exposed. The results indicated that there were two factors included in the participants' attitudes: 1) a general attitude that included  emotional reactions and cognitive evaluations, and 2) political reactions which included opinions concerning the nature and feasibility of the Israeli-Egyptian peace process. For the control group the changes in these attitudes as a consequence of contact with Egyptians showed a negative trend in the general attitude and no change in the political attitude. Regarding the Israelis' perception of the Egyptian, there was a negative change in the intellectual-competence aspect and a positive change in the personal-social dimension. The changes were congruent with the initial attitudes held by the participants. For the experimental group it was clear that the various programs to which they were exposed had a positive effect on their personal-social attitudes towards Egyptians. In this group  again, however, the political attitudes were not significantly altered. A reference list and tables showing the attitude changes on a scale from 1-4 are included. (CG)",

        "description":"This report is based on evidence that despite the negative outcomes so often associated with early childbearing, not all teenage parents experience difficult lives. Given the heterogeneity of outcomes among teenage parents and their children, the issue addressed in the research is to identify the factors that explain variations in academic achievement and school performance among the children of teen parents. Data are from the 1976 National Survey of Children. Analyses were conducted separately by race and birth order, and by whether or not the teenage mother had dropped out of school prior to becoming pregnant. Social and economic variables were controlled for. Results indicate that predictors of vocabulary score include mother's age at first birth, her education, income, and  the child's number of siblings. Whether the mother was enrolled in school when she became pregnant has a very strong association with her child's subsequent vocabulary score. It is not clear what it is about being a drop-out that results in poorer outcomes for children. One conclusion of the research is that out-of-school adolescents are a high risk group that should be of particular concern to those planning pregnancy prevention efforts, but they may be especially difficult to reach.

The program provided supplementary career education and daily living skills instruction to 4,503 students residing in facilities for neglected and delinquent children and adolescents. Analyses of pupil achievement data showed that the program was very effective in meeting its proposed goals: the large majority (88%) of participating students attained the achievement objective of mastery of at least 80% of their short-term instructional objectives within the expected period of time. The program was  effectively implemented at all sites visited by field consultants. In response to recommendations from previous cycles, the program strengthened pre-planning. In addition, based on findings from the 1982-83 evaluation, career education for higher functioning students was expanded to include supplementary objectives. It is recommended that the program continue to emphasize short-term planning and ongoing assessment, continue to provide expanded, supplementary instruction to the highest functioning students, and explore the possibility of field trips to potential employment locations for students.

        "description":"Of the 110 public high schools in New York City, 11 are alternative high schools serving students who have been identified as &quot;high risk,&quot; particularly dropouts and potential dropouts, as well as students who would benefit from learning environments and options not offered in comprehensive high schools. In 1984, the Curriculum Consolidation Program was implemented at these schools. To enable staff to review alternative high school curriculum in order to identify exemplary programs, the program coordinator set up an alternative high school conference, interschool informational workshops, and seminars that focused on curriculum and staff development. Staff developed or adapted curricula which encouraged active student participation. The coordinator compiled a curriculum guide  containing descriptions of available curricula and distributed it to all alternative schools. While most of the curricula were developed by teachers from a single school, several were products of interschool efforts. All seminar meetings served as a form of staff development. In addition, staff from four schools worked in discrete staff development projects. In its one semester of operation, this project has begun a process that is likely to have an important positive effect on alternative school students. It is recommended that: (1) the curriculum guide be distributed to the traditional high schools; (2) conferences be planned for an entire day to allow adequate time for workshop participation; and (3) a longitudinal study be developed to tally the number of requests for various  curricula, assess rates of implementation of the new curricula, and survey qualitative responses of staff and student users.

        "description":"Project TRIUNFE is a bilingual instructional program that served approximately 260 students of Hispanic, Asian, and Haitian backgrounds during the 1983-84 school year at John Jay High School in New York City. It is a transitional program whose major goal is to mainstream students in less than two years. Most significant is its pioneering effort to develop computer-assisted instruction and computer literacy in a bilingual education program. An evaluation of student achievement during the 1983-84 year found that, overall, program students exceeded the project proposal's criterion level on the Criterion Referenced English Syntax Test. Spanish-speaking students made significant gains in native language reading achievement, with Grade 10 and 12 students showing the greatest progress.  Data for French-speaking students were inconclusive. The results of a computer literacy test were positive, and students' overall passing rates were 70 percent or better in mathematics, science, social studies, and vocational courses. Finally, the attendance rate of program students was significantly greater than the schoolwide attendance rate. Despite the apparent success of Project TRIUNFE, the evaluators recommend: (1) the restoration of staff responsibilities according to the original project proposal; (2) strengthening the vocational education aspect of the project; (3) exploring the possibility of using students to help with some project work; (4) stressing the proposed alternative education for the marginal student; and (5) administering the instruments proposed to measure program  objectives and revising program objectives as needed, based on students' past performance and on instruments available.

The Living Planet Program's budget was to cover the cost of instructional guides, four staff development sessions, and program evaluation. Its objectives included the following: (1) training teachers to integrate the series into their classroom curriculums; (2) providing instructional guides; (3) integrating home viewing of the series with classroom instruction in order to extend junior high and high school students' learning environments; (4) encouraging  family participation in order to enhance students' learning experiences outside the classroom; and (5) regenerating junior high and high school students' interest in the scientific community. Participants in the staff development activities indicated that teacher guides and guest lecturers provided the most beneficial aspects of the training. In a post-program survey, junior high school teachers reported greater success with the program than high school teachers. They tended to use more classroom activities relating to the &quot;Living Planet&quot; and reported higher student viewer response rates. Implementation of the program in five other cities was found to be similar to that in New York. For further enhancement of the program, it is recommended that videotapes be obtained from the producers  for viewing during class hours, and that the program should include student-parent orientation sessions to stimulate family participation.

TOP trainees are placed in businesses and agencies with facilities, equipment, and human resources not available in the public schools. In 1983-84, the third year of the program's operation, TOP was funded to serve 2,000 students. An evaluation of that year's program found that the employers who retained trainees were unanimous in citing good trainee performance on the job as the reason they retained trainees as regular employees. Most employers said they would continue to participate in TOP, and most were extremely positive in describing their experiences with the program. When contrasted with a group of non-participating students, TOP participants had higher achievement  in English, social studies, and in their area of specialization or major. Similarly, the TOP student recruitment and selection process is based on a number of considerations, including achievement in academic subjects, but coordinators relied most heavily on their personal knowledge of the student's abilities and the demands at the job site. Major findings and recommendations of the evaluation were: (1) the academic achievement of students with high grades declined slightly while participating in TOP, but lower-achieving students' grades improved; (2) absence rates declined for all TOP participants surveyed, but especially for below average students; (3) TOP should continue to emphasize trainees' vocational skills and interests, since these are more important to employers than academic  skills; (4) the current selection process for participants should be revised to deemphasize the importance of strong grades in academic subjects; and (5) a greater range of students should be included in the program.

Over half of the program of students were Haitian immigrants and the remainder were Asian, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, and Italian. The majority of program students were recent arrivals in the United States. Project JOBS had two basic objectives: to assist and encourage students to complete  high school requirements, and to orient and train students in job-related skills. Funded in part by Title VII funds and tax-levy monies, Project JOBS included the provision of supportive services to students, staff development activities, curriculum materials development, and parent participation activities. The most significant academic achievements of program students were in classes other than those related to E.S.L. Their attendance rates were greater than the schoolwide attendance rates. In short, the evaluators found that JOBS has made substantial achievement, that its staff is highly committed, and that it has made much progress toward achieving program objectives.

In 1983-84, all of the program's students were born outside the United States. Almost half of them were Hispanics, and the remainder were Asian and Middle Eastern in origin. To achieve the program's central goal of dropout prevention, its bilingual instructional approach was transitional in nature. Individualized programs were planned for each student and classes were taught by both mainstream and resource teachers to heterogeneous groupings. In addition to  instructional services, the program activities included student support services, curriculum development, staff development, parent involvement, and an advisory committee which addressed areas of program improvement. Student achievement data indicates that most students progressed in all subjects except mathematics at rates which matched the program's proposed criteria, and the attendance rate of program students was significantly greater than the schoolwide rate. Moreover, the program's dropout rate was significantly lower than the schoolwide rate. To improve the program's overall effectiveness, it is recommended that the program: (1) introduce more individualized approaches, such as grouping, to instruction in certain areas; (2) continue curriculum development and, if possible, bind  materials rather than distribute them singly or in packets; (3) hold more formal staff meetings and planning sessions; and (4) strengthen the program's counseling component in the area of preventive group counseling.

        "description":"During 1983-84, the second of three program cycles of the Title VII English as a Second Language, Special Education Development Approach Curriculum Project (ESL-SEDAC) was fully implemented in the New York City Public Schools. The project provided direct instruction to 260 handicapped limited English proficient students, resource assistance, ongoing individual staff training, staff development, and parent training workshops. All program objectives were fully or partially attained. The proposed criteria for student achievement were met in English-language listening, speaking, reading, and writing, as was the criterion for improvement of the instructional skills of participating classroom teachers. Staff development and parent training workshops were effective and well received,  although not as well attended as hoped for. The program curriculum, &quot;Day by Day in English: ESL-SEDAC Daily Living Skills Curriculum Guide,&quot; was field tested, revised, and distributed. The following recommendations are offered for continued program effectiveness: (1) continue to provide services to students, parents, and classroom teachers; (2) explore additional ways of documenting pupil achievement; and (3) seek to utilize program, school, and community resources to increase parental participation.

        "description":"In 1983-84, the Bilingual Mini-School at Samuel Gompers High School of New York City, was in its first year of a three-year funding cycle. An evaluation was conducted to determine how well it had met its aim of preparing students of limited English proficiency (LEP) for career opportunities through vocational, technical, and academic education. Instruction in English as a second language (E.S.L.) and native language arts, in addition to bilingual instruction in mathematics, science, and social studies, was provided to approximately 60 Spanish-speaking students of LEP. Also program students were assigned to an all-English exploratory vocational course to expose them to a variety of occupations. In 1983-84, curriculum development was delayed by the late arrival of Title VII funds,  but program staff conducted extensive research on materials related to job survival skills, translated materials from English textbooks, and designed five student workshops on career awareness. Staff development activities included a pre-service orientation, monthly meetings, attendance at demonstration lessons, outside workshops professional conferences, and university courses. Efforts to involve parents in school activities were generally unsuccessful, so the program's parental involvement component was established as a priority for its second year. To improve the program's overall effectiveness, it is recommended that: (1) student achievement data be collected; (2) teacher-training activities be conducted on the role of the paraprofessional in the vocational classroom, teaching Spanish  as a native language, and developing teacher-made materials; (3) more space be allocated to separate tutoring and couseling from administration activities; (4) teachers not acquainted with bilingual education be better informed; and (5) efforts be made to improve parent involvement.

        "description":"This report presents child-based data from the March 1983, Current Population Survey. The data have been reorganized from their usual form which is as information on households, families, or individual adults, to data with children as the unit of analysis. The primary focus of the report is on children's living arrangements: what kinds of families children live in and how the family and economic situations of children vary according to these differing living situations. The report finds that although a majority of all children live in two-parent families, a substantial number of children live for at least some period of time with only one parent. The report also finds that among these single parent situations there is great variation: 20.5% of all children live with their mothers  and 2.0% with fathers. The children's economic and social status is better when living with divorced or widowed mothers than with separated or never married mothers (71% and 81% respectively of the latter two groups living in poverty). Children living alone with fathers enjoy a higher social and economic status. Children are, however, better off in two parent families with regard to the social and economic factors considered. Particularly striking are the very large race differences in family composition. For example, among whites, 81% of all children live in two-parent families, compared with 41% among blacks, and black children are disproportionately represented in the most disadvantaged family types. The paper includes a short bibliography and five tables giving the statistical data  used for the study. (CG)",

For the study, 469 cases with successful outcomes and 150 cases with unsuccessful outcomes were selected from files provided by the states of Florida, Kansas, Mississippi, and Ohio. Data were analyzed by discriminate analysis. The study found that membership in wage earner status outcome groups can be predicted using vocational rehabilitation process variables, personal variables that include biographical and visual disability related factors, financial and  disincentive variables, occupational history factors, and environmental factors. Training and experience characteristics of the rehabilitation counselor were not found to contribute significantly to the prediction process. The study showed that these variables can be used to predict outcomes of rehabilitation with a correct classification rate of about 69 percent, a 272 percent increase over chance. Predictor variables can be used to predict client outcomes correctly and possibly influence course of treatment. (Each variable is analyzed in relation to the four employment outcomes.) (KC)",

        "description":"This report, the first of a six-part, intensive longitudinal study, examines the relationships between selected demographic, attitudinal, and educational characteristics of male youth in the United States and their labor market experience and occupational aspirations. The data are drawn from interviews conducted during October-December 1966, with a national sample of the noninstitutional civilian population of males 14 to 24 years of age. Analysis of numerous tables is used to seek explanations for variations in their experiences based on economic, social, and psychological variables. The report is organized in eight chapters. The first chapter introduces the study and explains how it was conducted. Chapter 2 presents a description of the demographic and social characteristics of  the age cohort of males 14-24 based upon the sample data. The determinants of labor force participation and employment status are analyzed in Chapter 3. Youth's employment patterns, such as types of jobs held, the number of hours per week worked, rate of compensation, and mobility patterns are studied in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 examines the variation in occupational information among young men and the factors that appear to be related, both as causes and effects, to such variation. Chapter 6 focuses upon attitudes of workers toward their current jobs and the extent of their attachment to these jobs. The educational and occupational aspirations of high school youth and of young men no longer enrolled in school are analyzed in Chapter 7. The findings and conclusions of the study are summarized  in Chapter 8. On the basis of these findings, various hypotheses are presented that would be tested with the data collected in subsequent surveys. (KC)",

        "description":"This study of competency-based vocational education (CBVE) in Pennsylvania was guided by evaluation questions in eight areas: overall, current status of CBVE; implementation of the state Bureau of Vocational Education's (BVE) model of CBVE; characteristics of other CBVE models implemented in Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Department of Education funding strategy; needs of local education agencies related to CBVE; correlates of successful CBVE implementation; positive impacts on students; and long-range policy recommendations. The methodology relied on intensive interviews of Pennsylvania Department of Education staff and senior personnel from local education agencies across the state. Teacher surveys were also distributed to collect information on the classroom implementation of  CBVE. The study found that there is widespread support for competency-based vocational education across the state. The BVE's model of CBVE has achieved a moderately high level of implementation at the adult vocational-technical schools. Although supportive of the basic tenets of CBVE, community colleges and high schools have adopted the BVE model less extensively. Differences in the implementation of the Bureau's model across the three types of schools most likely was influenced by the targeting of state funds for training, technical assistance, and materials primarily to the adult vocational-technical schools. Administrative support for CBVE was also much higher at the adult vocational-technical schools and community colleges than at the comprehensive high schools. In spite of widespread  support for CBVE, there were no evaluation data to support its positive impacts on students. The outstanding needs listed by CBVE implementers include the provision of additional resources to support program updating and modernization, especially in the high technology areas. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Continuing education programmers must be risk takers; however, they should not be gamblers. The most successful of them are able to estimate a balance between potential rewards and risks, taking chances when the odds are favorable. Although it is essential that course planners balance potential financial rewards and risks, it is important to bear in mind that other nonfinancial rewards, particularly those related to reputation-related concerns, must not be forgotten. Once the programmer is ready to balance the financial rewards and risks of offering a particular course, the following factors should be considered: cost and value of programmer time, opportunity costs, sunk costs, enrollment probabilities, and up-side versus down-side potential. Each of these factors can be  considered together with the others to arrive at a reward/risk index for the contemplated course, which will allow a planner to compare the course with other potential offerings. Finally, the potential risks of comtemplated courses can be shared in several ways: through shifts between fixed and variable costs, through joint decision-making efforts that allow risk to be shared between programmers and their superiors, and through a \"portfolio management\" approach that spreads risks among several courses rather than accounting on an individual-course basis.

        "description":"A study examined the nature and extent of programs and course offerings available in the United States to prepare education and training professionals and analyzed the offerings in terms of a 1983 study done by the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD). Colleges and accredited business schools from across the country were identified, their available catalogs and course descriptions were secured, and data collected from them were subjected to both qualitative and quantitative analyses. No program offerings by American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AASCB)-accredited schools were found to lead to degrees in education and training. However, a number of courses having content consistent with the preparation of education and training specialists were found.  These courses were offered by a variety of academic departments, with no consistency evident from institution to institution. Three models of the coordination of available training were identified: education and training was either supplied (1) totally within the personnel unit; (2) within the organization and separate from the personnel unit, but with strong linkages to it; or (3) by a separate unit outside the organization under contractual arrangement with personnel. Many of the 31 competencies identified as necessary for training and development specialists in the aforementioned ASTD study were being addressed in many of the courses identified during the present study.

        "description":"Older adults attend continuing education courses for a variety of reasons. Some, like Wuschko K., seek to make sense of their early life experiences. Wuschko is a Polish immigrant who wanted to go on with his education in early life but was prevented from doing so by poverty and war. He spent years in a concentration camp, then became a carpenter and immigrated to the United States. He sees education as a life review and pursues it for self-esteem and the pleasure of learning. Others, such as Jenny M., a black widow in her 60s, pursue education as a means of getting a new job. Jenny had an opportunity to go to college when whe was young, but rebelled against her parents and married instead. Jenny insists she has no regrets about her decision, but is now continuing her education  in order to learn more about working with retarded toddlers. She is looking to the future and learning for practical rather than philosophical reasons. These two persons are illustrative of the myriad personalities of the older persons who continue their educations. Their motives vary, and all must be respected by adult educators. Methods of research on motivation must include data that tap the most personal levels of history and psychology. Such methods must be qualitative and allow for in-depth answers. Finally, it is also important that adult educators do not isolate the older adult through a \"they-out-there\" versus \"we-in-here\" approach, but respond to individual needs with respect. (KC)",

        "description":"Research indicates that many illiterate youth and adults who become parents are unable to transfer high levels of oral language skills or to model literacy use for their children. Consequently, their children begin school without the readiness skills necessary to learn to read and thus continue a cycle of family illiteracy and employment problems. Studies indicate that among the benefits that could be attained from employer-sponsored literacy training programs for marginally literate youth and adults while developing their literacy, oral language, and learning skills the following human resources-related benefits would be attained: (1) the value obtained from education dollars could be doubled, (2) youth and adult employment problems could be relieved, and (3) children's ability  to achieve in school could be improved. Research studies have confirmed that literacy skills and their use have a direct impact on proficiency and productivity in the workplace. Literacy programs that focused training directly on teaching students how to perform job-related reading tasks resulted in improvements in both general and job-related literacy, with even brief programs having significant impacts on workers' literacy skills. In light of the intergenerational benefits to be gained from job-related literacy programs, researchers should seek cost-effective ways for employers to implement such programs. A brief list of references concludes the report. (MN)",

Existing measures used to analyze literacy demands and abilities in the workplace are not suitable for analyzing the same demands and abilities in schools. Methods that are effective for general job analysis can be specifically applied to the literacy aspects of jobs. Two screening methods used by employers to assess job literacy abilities are the cloze procedure and the more effective, though more time consuming, job problem solving simulations. Business and military trainers are faced with the problem of trying to improve worker performance through literacy and basic skills training. Evidence suggests that job performance may be more closely related to metacognitive  aspects of literacy than to the basic literacy abilities of achieving simple comprehension or communicating simple messages. Trainers wishing to improve the literacy job performance of workers can use literacy task analysis to help determine the metacognitive skills employed by superior workers. Interviews focusing on how superior workers make literacy-related decisions is an effective method of determining important skills needed by new and less competent employees. These skills can then be taught to less competent workers. (YLB)",

This includes the survey's instrumentation, population, sampling plan, data collection methods, and data analysis techniques. Chapter IV  presents data collected with the current version of the instrument. These data describe vocational educators' self-perceptions of their competencies in both general and specific instructional techniques related to special needs learners, as well as their preferences regarding the format, time, and delivery personnel needed for such inservice experiences.

Task forces on, for example, defense preparedness and entrepreneurship education have been established at the national level. Two new programs--corrections education and rural education--have been established and have had a significant impact. In partnership with other organizations the Department has initiated a series of major development projects to enhance work force education and training. Major issues of importance to vocational education are lack of the basic academic skills in youth, international competitiveness, national defense, and productivity. Vocational education is related to many elements of change in society, including demographics (lower birth rates, an  aging work force), students' lack of basic skills, national policy, and legislation. Vocational education is marked by progress at all levels. The Department has particularly focused on priority initiatives. Perhaps one of the brightest accomplishments of the vocational education field is its capacity for incorporating and demonstrating choice, content, and character. Careful, responsible research is the key to keeping vocational education on the cutting edge. For example, research has shown that vocational education plays a role in preventing dropouts, benefits graduates in the work force, and benefits employers. (YLB)",

As stated in the Act, vocational education programs are best administered by states and their communities; the Federal Government is a junior partner with a catalytic role. The law has two major purposes--to improve the quality of vocational education programs and to make vocational education programs accessible to all people. Five titles cover assistance to the states, basic grants, special programs, national programs, and definitions. The State Board of Vocational Education is the sole state agency responsible for administration and distribution of Federal funds. The State Council on Vocational Education advises the State Board on the State  Plan and reports to the governor, business community, and general public. The apprenticeship provisions of the Act offer some important linkage opportunities with the home building industry. This legislation supports an even stronger alliance among vocational education, apprenticeship, and private industry. Specific key citations in the Act that offer meaningful opportunities for the home building industry include those on institutional and worksite programs, building more effective linkages between education and private sector employers, and related instruction for apprentices.

        "description":"The second phase of an analysis of the National Network for Curriculum Coordination in Vocational and Technical Education focused on the impacts of six regional centers on vocational educators. Another concern was the Network's overall contribution to curriculum-related activities and initiatives in vocational education. Specific issues were the impacts the Centers have had on their users, the nature and effects of relationships developed between the Network and other organizations involved in vocational education, and factors that have affected program impacts. These issues were investigated through various data collection activities, including case studies of the Curriculum Coordination Centers, participation in regional meetings, visits to other organizations involved in  vocational education, and telephone interviews with vocational educators. Data indicated that the major purpose of the Network--to create a resource through which curriculum materials and resources would be readily available to practitioners--has been accomplished. The ready availability of materials resulted in savings of time and money to states in curriculum-related activities and reduced duplication of effort in curriculum-development efforts. The Federal investment in the program leveraged a considerable amount of state support. Recommendations were made in these areas: curriculum evaluation, outreach, impact reporting, and emerging technologies. Some data are appended. (YLB)",

        "description":"The incidence of pregnancy among young teenagers has increased dramatically in the past several decades. Young single mothers are much more likely than others to leave school before graduation and to be unemployed and poor. This study was conducted to identify differences in completion, school attendance rates, and grades for secondary and adult students who received day-care services for their children compared to those who did not. Data were gathered from four day-care sites in Akron, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Dayton. (Data from two other sites were not usable.) A total of 145 secondary and adult students were provided with day care for their children and 145 were not. The study found that attendance rates and grade point averages (GPAs) for students using day care were  similar to the attendance rates and GPAs of those who did not. In general, attendance was higher for high school students than for adults. Nearly three-fourths of secondary students who had children in day care completed courses or graduated, compared to only two-fifths of secondary students whose children were not in day care. While one-third of adults with children in day care completed courses or high school equivalency degrees, only approximately one-tenth of the adult comparison group did so. Recommendations were made to the Home Economics Section staff of the Ohio Division of Vocational Education and to local coordinators of day-care programs for program improvement. (KC)",

Their relationship to three common methodologies (empiricism, ethnomethodology, and grounded theory) of adult education were explored. It was concluded that methodological conflict is essentially counterproductive and serves only to conceal the complementary nature of research methodologies. Further, the diversity of research paradigms in adult education could provide the creative tension for theory formation and the subsequent growth of adult education as a discipline. To manage such diversity, however, would require a holistic perspective to integrate the seemingly diverse and disparate data into  meaningful theory. It was suggested that one paradigm that could accomplish this integrative function is general systems theory. (Author/YLB)",

These changes have altered new needs for vocational preparation and job structures. The \"new feminism\" has caught rural women in a double bind. They are participants in a modern society saturated with the new ambitions of women, while they are among the most conservative and traditional people. Rural women find juggling home and career more difficult than metropolitan women for two primary reasons: lack of commercial support systems and deterioration of the traditional community system in rural areas. To alleviate the problems of the rural working women, two things should be done. First, thinking about rural women's occupations needs to be  reoriented. Since rural women avoid nontraditional occupations, women should be given access to interstitial occupations. Women need help in identifying possibilities and determining those ideas that are feasible for them. Second, delivery systems should be reoriented to provide accessible and appropriate vocational preparation to rural women. Three alternative ways to prepare women for interstitial occupations are community apprenticeships, school-based enterprises, and network-based training and support services.

Thirty soldiers in a course to train fire control systems repairers received training in technical mathematics using the hand-held computer, whereas another 30 soldiers enrolled in the same course were presented the same course material, but without the use of computers. An end-of-training mastery test, which was administered to both groups, failed to reveal any statistically significant differences between the two instructional approaches. Flaws in the design of the evaluation study prevented the researchers from determining whether there really were no differences in the relative  effectiveness of the computer-aided and conventional methods of instruction in the particular course under investigation or whether the lack of any statistically significant differences could be attributed to such factors as differences between entry-level mastery of course material, different amounts of training received by the two groups, or the administration of an end-of-course test that was not difficult enough to reveal proficiency differences between the two groups. It was recommended that these factors be taken into account when similar studies are planned in the future. (This report includes the instructor manual for the computer lesson.) (MN)",

This finding is based on a study that examined the perceptions of high school graduates and their employers' reports of hiring and job performance standards and employment outcomes. High school students completed questionnaires at the beginning and end of their senior year and one year after graduation. Their employers were surveyed at the one-year follow-up. Employers were influenced to hire youths who had these characteristics: (1) looked clean and neat at the interview, (2) filled out the job application neatly and correctly and attached a resume, (3) showed interest by asking questions about the job, and (4) called the employer after  the interview to indicate interest in the job. Employers tended to reject youths who had these characteristics: (1) falsified the job application, (2) could not read well, (3) had a poor absentee record and showed low effort on the previous job, and (4) had high job turnover. Employers were inclined to fire workers who did not follow company rules and policies or who were not making enough of an effort to be productive--more so than workers who did not perform well because of inadequate basic skills and attitudes. Young workers who believed that employers have tough hiring and job performance standards had better employment records and received better job performance evaluations. The study indicated that schools should teach the importance of these findings in order to help their students  find and keep jobs. (KC)",

        "description":"A survey of employers showed that high school grade point average had the strongest positive influence in the hiring of young people for entry-level jobs. Eight hundred and fifty employers in three fields (clerical, retailing, and machine trades) were asked to rate application forms of fictitious job seekers for specific positions. Other factors that these employers rated highly were the following: (1) high school diploma, (2) part-time or full-time work experience, (3) work experience in large organizations, (4) relevant work experience, (5) participation in cooperative or occupational work experience programs, (6) participation in machine trades vocational education programs for machine trades positions, and (7) attendance at a postsecondary school. A high number of prior job  terminations due to quitting or being fired earned a negative rating from employers. Ratings were also influenced by the personal characteristics of the rater and characteristics of the particular job and firm. The study concluded that school administrators should be aware of the importance that employers place on good grades and good attitudes and should encourage students to work for academic honors in order to help them enter the work world.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine how employers make hiring decisions for entry-level jobs. In simulated hiring settings, 56 employers in Columbus, Ohio, were asked to rate young job seekers first from their application forms and then from videotaped interviews. The applicants (aged 16-25) were seeking full-time employment in three fields: clerical, retail, and machine trades. In screening the application forms, the employers considered these factors as most important: relevant work experience, relevant postsecondary program, skills relevant to the job (e.g., typing), good grades, and neatly completed application forms. The two most critical factors in the videotaped interviews were attitude and grammar. Interviews with the employers emphasized their stress on good attitudes,  not just for the interview, but also for jobs performance. The study concluded that school administrators should take employers' opinions into account, since the future economic success and job security of their students will depend on the degree to which students are able to fulfill employer expectations. Schools should promote cooperative education programs, emphasize basic skills, and include employability and job search training as part of the curriculum. (KC)",

        "description":"In a survey of 28,000 high school seniors, researchers found that 21,000 (75 percent) were in the labor force. The average number of hours worked per week was 16.4. The study identified the characteristics of the students and their schools that affect part-time work: (1) the higher the wage rate, the more likely a student was to work more hours per week; (2) students who believed in the importance of work, steady employment, and earning income were more likely to work more hours per week; (3) students who had a strong commitment to school were less likely to be in the labor force and worked slightly fewer hours per week if they were employed; (4) Black and Hispanic students were less likely to work and had more difficulties finding a job; (5) female students worked about one-half  hour more per week than male students, were slightly more likely to work, and had less difficulties finding a job, but their salary averaged 34 cents less per hour; (6) attending a vocational or private school increased a student's wages; and (7) engaging in cooperative education and work study tended to improve a student's experience in the labor force. The study concluded that working was a student response to the desire to have immediate income and to a lack of interest in school. Therefore, teachers and administrators should integrate school assignments with job-related experiences. The study also concluded that counselors should make extra efforts to help minority students find work. (KC)",

        "description":"A survey of over 3,800 employers found that school-provided vocational training was required for 9.5 percent of the jobs studied and \"important but not required\" for another 37.9 percent. In this study, new employees with relevant vocational education exhibited these characteristics: (1) were 6.5 percent more productive 6 to 36 months after being hired; (2) required about 20 percent less formal on-the-job training and 10 percent less informal on-the-job training; (3) had higher wage rates; (4) increased the firm's output and reduced its training costs by considerably more than the additional wages paid; and (5) were more productive and required less training if that training were obtained at a two-year college or vocational institute. Only vocational education that was relevant  offered these benefits. Also, increases in productivity and savings of training costs by having a vocationally trained worker were much greater at small companies than at large companies. Employers also benefited in a similar manner by hiring workers with relevant prior job experience. As a result of these findings, the study concluded that vocational education should focus on generic occupational skills or focus on more specific skills that are in short supply, that vocational education should set an immediate goal of a high rate of training-related placement, and that students should be encouraged to secure part-time jobs in fields related to their school programs.

        "description":"A recent study showed that high school students who are not planning to attend college full time should combine vocational and academic course work to maximize their success in the labor market. In a study of non-college bound youth (based on the High School and Beyond Survey data) that examined the impact of high school curriculum, grades, and performance on standardized tests on labor market success, the following results were found: (1) taking additional vocational courses is associated with only a small reduction in the number of academic courses taken; (2) taking additional vocational courses is strongly associated with success in the labor market immediately after high school; (3) taking additional academic courses is not associated with higher earnings immediately after  high school; (4) taking a combination of 16 or more academic and vocational courses during the last three years of school enabled students to have greater labor market success than taking fewer than 10 such courses; and (5) good grade point averages and standardized test scores generally had mixed effects on labor market outcomes. The study concluded that school administrators should stress that for the 30-40 percent of high school graduates who do not attend college full time, the choice of high school curriculum is one of the most important decisions they will make affecting their success in the labor market following graduation. Counselors can help students select the proper balance between academic and vocational subjects to ensure labor market success, and vocational teachers can  help students secure jobs. (KC)",

In this study on the school-to-work transition, interviews were conducted with 25 adolescents over a one-year time span. Researchers observed the youths at work and interviewed their managers. Major findings were reported for four areas: finding a job, surviving on the job, training at the work site, and leaving a job. Some of the highlights of these findings are the following: (1) youths viewed finding a job as a matter of luck, rarely conducted an organized job search, and wanted good pay and job security with little attention to a career path; (2) attendance and punctuality were often a problem, unless employers were  supportive--but many employers did not expect youths to remain long and did not invest much time or resources in them; (3) little training was provided to the new hires; aand (4) many youths quit jobs without notice or were fired and often disagreed with their employer about the reason for leaving. The study concluded that school administrators should implement employability development programs to ease students' transition from school to work. It also stressed that counselors and teachers can show youths how to conduct a job search and how to leave a job gracefully. (KC)",

        "description":"This research program examined the effects of schooling on 10 student outcomes selected as indicators of labor market success: four academic test scores (verbal, qualitative, science, and civics); two measures of career expectations (educational and occupational expectations); three attitudinal factors (self-esteem, work values, and sense of control); and school deportment. Four separate studies were conducted, based on an analysis of the High School and Beyond Survey data. Findings are based on information from about 27,000 students surveyed in 1980 as sophomores and then, again, two years later. Some of the major findings of the research are these: (1) more academic course offerings raised test scores and educational expectations; (2) dropping out of school decreased verbal and  mathematics test scores, had a substantial effect on individuals' readiness to learn and was more injurious to blacks; (3) longer school days or school years did not have large effects on any of the outcomes; and (4) family background had a strong effect on whether a student entered the academic track, especially during the last two years of high school. Although the effect of track membership was small, some of the effects reported were that students' educational expectations and mathematics test scores rose with membership in the academic track, and that taking vocational courses often deflated students' test scores and career expectations. Among the implications for school policy are that consideration be given to increasing the required number of academic courses, strongly encouraging  youths to complete high school, and possibly discontinuing the track system.

Alternative delivery patterns were reviewed, and appropriate vocational education-university linkage factors were identified. Next, three workable models for improving such linkages were developed, and a composite model was formulated from the three recommended for implementation. Included in the composite model were strategies for delivering the following basic services: preservice education of nonvocational teacher education-degreed persons; supervision of new vocational personnel; pedagogical, technological, and informational update; skills testing; curriculum development and  dissemination; and research and development. It was recommended that the Ohio SDVE do the following: establish a transition period of at least 1 year before requiring implementation of the model, give teacher educators an important role in the implementation activities, consider some incentives to ensure the commitment of universities in the State to the proposed activities, contact other States that have reorganized their vocational education-university linkage relationships, and designate at least 50 percent of one SDVE staff person's time to maintain the linkage relationship with universities.

The following are a few of the recommendations for program developers to bear in mind when preparing material for Chinese audiences: obtain estimated needs statements and participant background summaries from  sponsoring agencies; prepare detailed course materials for prior translation and review all translations carefully; remember that Chinese persons value age, dignity, and formality of presentation; maintain a respect for Chinese needs and remain sensitive to contextual communication; strive for a clear and logical stepwise progression of content; use quantitative exercises and repeat points in a variety of ways; and select examples appropriate for Chinese experience.

Age (grade level) did not appear to influence students' attitudes toward the interrelationship of sex and occupational choice. Furthermore, there did not appear to be any significant differences between the sexes with regard to generalized attitudes toward traditional male, traditional female, and sex-neutral occupations. Those students surveyed appeared to be relatively open and nonconservative when asked about the relation between sex and career choice for others as an abstract, generalized body; however, there was evidence that deeper attitudes, reflected by self-efficacy  beliefs, led students of both sexes to be more traditional when contemplating their own future jobs. It was recommended that similar research be conducted with older student populations to see whether these attitudes persist. (MN)",

Data for the evaluation were obtained from numerous documents and publications, field trips, and discussions with key officials in various ministries and institutions, including the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Education, Technical and Vocational Institute, Institute for Further Education, and Food and Nutrition Council. The data collected from these sources indicated that there is an urgent need to strengthen the agricultural education program in Grenada. Particularly needed is a strong basic education program in the primary schools, including instruction in mathematics and science, as a foundation for strong agricultural education programs. The  development of curricula and syllabi for teaching agriculture at these levels should be the country's top priority. Also vital are the preparation for agriculture teachers and the establishment and government support of 14 proposed agricultural education centers. Staff supervising agricultural science programs should hold bachelor of science degrees in agricultural education, and teacher workshops should be provided on a regular basis.

Data for the evaluation were obtained from numerous documents and publications, field trips, and discussions with key officials in various ministries and institutions, including the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Education, and various schools, colleges, and associations throughout the country. The agricultural sector is crucial to the economic development of Saint Vincent: it provides about two-thirds of the country's employment and is the country's main source of foreign exchange. However, the country's general population, and farmers in particular, lack adequate knowledge and understanding of the principles of marketing. To meet the need for such  information, policymakers at both the ministries of agriculture and education should take steps to improve agricultural education at all levels, with particular attention to teacher training policies and practices. In addition, criteria for admission into diploma programs in agricultural education should be upgraded, existing educational facilities should be updated and expanded, and followup studies should be conducted to assess the success of graduates of agricultural programs.

The existing shortage of appropriately trained agriculturalists in Saint Lucia sorely limits the possibility of the further development of agriculture in the country. Strengthening the country's program to prepare agricultural education teachers and improving agricultural and general training at the primary and secondary levels are crucial to the country's development. To accomplish this, the  Ministry of Education should have at least one staff member specifically assigned the responsibility of administering and supervising agricultural education. Moreover, two persons should be assigned the task of coordinating agricultural programs in the primary and secondary schools. More and better prepared agriculture teachers are needed at all levels, and periodic studies (occurring at least every 3 years) should be conducted to determine the occupational attainments of graduates of agriculture programs.

These parents were involved in the MAP (Monitoring Achievement in Pittsburgh)-AT-HOME Program, which focuses on helping parents to reinforce student acquisition of mathematics, reading, and grammar/composition skills. A mailed questionnaire collected data about parents' perceptions of the effectiveness of the training activities, how much they used the materials provided to them, and the frequency of participation with their children in other educational activities. Virtually all respondents reported they used the MAP-AT-HOME materials and found them understandable and easy to use and their children enjoyed them.  Respondents were enthusiastic about the contributions the program made both to their children's and to their own learning of math and reading. Most frequently cited activities were talking with children about the school day and helping child with worksheet or workbooks. Three important dimensions of parent involvement in their children's out-of-school learning are identified: helping with homework, using home and community resources, and parent-child verbal interaction. Parent involvement was greatest for children in intermediate grades but it did not vary significantly by parents' educational attainment. (YLB)",

To assess the knowledge and attitudes of college students toward various aspects of STD's, a 45-item Likert inventory focusing on symptoms, prevalence, causes, and personal responsibility related to STD's was administered to 843 college students at two midwestern universities. An analysis of the data revealed that the average respondent was single, sexually active, 20.6 years of age, moderately religious, and had received minimal formalized sexuality education in secondary school. The results of the knowledge section indicated that significant differences existed between males and females,  with females reporting more accurate information than males. Knowledge items dealing with pregnancy and syphilis, initial symptoms of STD's, and social class incidence of STD's were items which were most typically missed by male respondents. The results indicated that although the respondents recognized the magnitude of the problems surrounding STD's, they had many misconceptions about the specific symptoms and effects of individual STD's. Religious preference, area of academic study, and sexual activity were not found to be significant response predictors. (Author/NRB)",

To identify some of these characteristics, 26 married couples with an alcoholic husband (ALC) were compared with 26 maritally-conficted (MC) and 26 nonconflicted (NC) couples without alcohol problems. All couples completed the Marital Adjustment Test, the Marital Status Inventory, and the Areas of Change Questionnaire. Couples were videotaped for 10 minutes while discussing a current marriage problem, and tapes were rated using the Marital Interaction Coding System. In addition, MC couples completed a Problem Areas Questionnaire; ALC husbands completed the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) and a portable breath test; and NC  wives completed the MAST about the husband's drinking to assure that the husband had no drinking problem. The results indicated that ALC couples resembled MC couples and both showed greater relationship distress than NC couples in the areas of marital stability, change desired, and percent of positive communication behaviors. Although findings were not very supportive of the prediction that ALC couples would show characteristics unique to ALC's, ALC husbands reported fewer desires for change in the relationship, greater marital satisfaction, and less awareness of partner-desired changes than did ALC wives, suggesting that the ALC husbands held positively-biased perceptions of their marriages.

        "author":["Alloy, Lauren B."],
        "description":"This paper considers three clinical judgment biases in clinical inference: (1) illusory correlation bias, the report by clinicians of a correlation between psychodiagnostic test signs and patient's symptoms which are not correlated or are correlated to a smaller degree than that reported; (2) labeling bias, the tendency of exposure to diagnositc labels to influence clinician's inferences about patients in such a way as to confirm the original label in the clinician's diagnosis; and (3) therapy outcome bias, the clinicians' belief that therapeutic techniques toward which they are favorably predisposed are more effective in remediating patients' symptoms than are alternative treatment strategies, even when research has shown that their favored strategies have no advantage over  alternative therapies. Alloy and Tabachnik's theoretical model for understanding people's covariation assessments is applied to clinicians' diagnostic and therapy decisions in an attempt to formulate a covariation perspective for understanding clinical judgments. Evidence is presented which demonstrates that clinicians' judgments are influenced jointly by expectations and situational information. It is argued that often when covariation judgments go awry, they have been biased by clinicians' a priori expectations. The implications of the illusory correlation, labeling, and therapy outcome biases for clinical practice are considered, and the issues of accuracy, rationality, and utility in evaluating the impact of such biases are discussed. Possible strategies for debiasing inaccurate  diagnostic and therapeutic inferences are suggested. (NRB)",

        "description":"Modern test construction strategies in the areas of personality and psychopathology differ in the use of disguise within test stimulus material. Previous research on the validity of using disguised test item content has favored the rational strategy of test construction which views disguise as a liability under normal test-taking circumstances. The utility of disguised test item content for the assessment of psychopathology with a psychiatric inpatient population was explored in a group of 352 adult psychiatric inpatients. All subjects completed the Basic Personality Inventory, a 12-scale, 240-item, structured, self-report instrument of abnormal behavior. Test item disguise was differentiated into components of face validity (the contextual relevance of a test item) and item  subtlety (lack of an obvious, substantive link between a test item and its underlying dimension). The results indicated that the more empirically valid test items had greater face validity and less item subtlety. These findings suggest that the most valid results may be obtained through the use of direct questions, supporting the efficacy of a rational approach to constructing self-report instruments for assessing psychopathology.

The first section defines perceptual bias and presents research data which show that perception is not a faithful representation of reality, but a product of previous beliefs and values. Section II reviews research showing that sex stereotypes, although consciously disavowed, still function as tacit knowledge about men and women and are still represented empirically in contemporary social structure. The research reviewed in section III provides evidence that an intellectual product or process believed to be the work of a man is often evaluated as superior to the identical product or performance attributed to a woman. Section IV reports  survey research on the career paths of large samples of men and women in academia and section V focuses on unconscious discriminatory evaluations. Section VI examines research on stereotyping and discrimination against black people, especially black women. The seventh section addresses the question of change toward equality of reward and offers five specific proposals for counteracting perceptual bias. Each section concludes with a summary. (MCF)",

        "description":"To identify behavioral and attitudinal differences between students who became high school dropouts and students who remained in school, sophomores from Illinois who participated in the National High School and Beyond Study (N=1,950) were interviewed and tested. Their responses were weighted to represent the total sophomore enrollment for Illinois and a profile of student behavioral and attitudinal characteristics was compiled. In 1982, participants from the 1980 study completed follow-up questionnaires. A portion of their responses (N=166) were weighted to represent an estimated number of respondents who would drop out of school by the spring of 1982. Comparison of dropout profiles with profiles of students who continued high school showed that dropouts were more likely to  report failing academically, being absent or tardy, lack of interest in school, and being subject to disciplinary actions. Of the Hispanic and Black Illinois sophomores, 25 percent eventually dropped out, exceeding the rates of other racial-ethnic groups and the national rates for these groups. Although male students proportionally were more likely to drop out than females, over one-half the dropouts were females. Of these, over one-third reported having one or more children. The findings indicate that poor academic performance, absence from school for 3 or more days, lack of high school completion by one or both parents, and pregnancy for females are warning signals for students at-risk for dropping out. (Fifteen data tables presenting the profile comparisons are included.)  (MCF)",

To further understand the pattern of interaction between counselor and client, transcripts of four initial interviews by Albert Ellis and two by Carl Rogers were analyzed for the pattern of responding within each unique dyad. The verbal utterances of counselor and client were coded by two independent judges for personal, descriptive, cognitive, or directive communication modes. Using Shannon and Weaver's (1949) mathematical theory of commnication, each interview was analyzed first for the pattern of the four communication modes regardless of the speaker, and second for the pattern of communication acknowledging the speaker. Response data  without the speaker revealed consistent third-order redundancy, suggesting various communication modes were controlled by the preceding two responses. Analysis of response modes crossed with the speaker showed second-order redundancy, or response modes controlled by the other's preceding response. The ambiguity of both the counselor's and the client's responses was somewhat greater within Rogers' interviews, suggesting slightly more freedom of response. The results may reflect Ellis' rather directive style of counseling or the structuring provided by counselors in initial encounters with clients. (MCF)",

Documentation of the elderly's increased financial risk is presented which is based on data from a case study of the elderly in Massachusetts and on an analysis of the elderly's out-of-pocket health care costs using data from the Health Care Financing Administration. After an executive summary of the report, chapter I provides an introduction to the health and financial risks faced by the elderly. Chapter II includes data on the growing numbers of elderly with increasing chronic care needs. The elderly's inaccessibility to quality care caused by the current emphasis on health care cost containment and the lack of available protection against rising health care costs are considered.  Chapter III presents data on the elderly's increasing out-of-pocket costs. Chapter IV looks at those elderly persons at highest financial risk and documents the extent of financial risk associated with chronic illness. Chapter V calls for Congressional action to reduce the elderly's risk by limiting their out-of-pocket costs to 15 percent of income and by implementing a coherent policy for long-term care that will protect the elderly from impoverishment when faced with chronic illnesses. Appendices contain an analysis of elderly's out-of-pocket health care costs and a description of the Massachusetts study's methodology. (RNB)",

        "description":"Humanistic psychology has emerged as a third force alternative to behaviorism and psychoanalysis. It offers a new orientation to psychology, one that incorporates basic existential ideas related to personal choice, freedom, and responsibility, and which also includes central phenomenological themes related to perceptions, personal meanings, and subjective experiences. Coming into its own in the mid 1950s, humanistic psychology established a theoretical-philosophical beachhead that focused on the whole person, highlighted the importance of conscious processes, and gave psychological respectability to the constructs of self and self-concept. Humanistic and cognitive emphases have combined to have an enormous influence on teaching-learning activities at all levels of education,  including: (1) a recognition that affective states and cognitive functioning are interactive processes, both of which influence learning outcomes; (2) a recognition of how and why a classroom's emotional climate influences learning for better or worse; and (3) a recognition that learning is facilitated when personal meaning is enhanced. The underlying concern that early humanism had about the right of people to arrive at some level of self-realization through reason and rational thought remains alive and well through its contemporary expressions in humanistic and cognitive psychology. An 8-page list of references concludes the paper. (Author/NRB)",

The Victim-Offender Mediation and Service Model and the Victim Financial Restitution Model are also  described. Part III of this guide concerns program implementation and includes sample forms, a checklist for restitution programming that can be used to implement new programs or to diagnose the needs of existing programs, and suggestions for getting programs started. Program management information systems and continuing evaluation that serves the informational needs of the program are discussed in part IV. Part V contains various papers on resources available to restitution programs: summaries of research findings about the effect of restitution, a review of legal issues, a discussion of employment models, information about federal assistance for restitution, and a bibliography.

Many support-oriented consultation interventions attempt to bolster informal helping systems by modifying informal caregivers' attitudes toward their helping role, building their helping skills, and/or altering the structure of their network ties. A review of work on consultation efforts with informal caregivers from an ecological perspective suggests five issues deserving more attention in the planning and evaluation of support-oriented interventions: (1) whether intervention efforts introduce changes in the types of people helped by informal caregivers; (2) whether intervention efforts change informal caregivers'  relationships with other network members who might be potential caregivers; (3) the costs and consequences to the caregiver, and ways to minimize the costs of assuming a caregiving role; (4) the influence of the social context on the maintenance of change in informal caregivers' actions; and (5) determining which forms of collaboration have the most beneficial impact on both the formal and informal caregiving systems. As researchers continue to conduct research in the community on such support efforts, they should increase their effectiveness as advocates for programs which strengthen natural helping systems.

A study was undertaken to determine whether years of experience in a domain of knowledge could compensate for age-related differences in performance on recall tasks, as well as to examine whether within that domain, areas that are better known would be more highly structured and richly recalled than less well-known areas. Telephone sales clerks (N=30) ranging in age from 23 to 69 years were recruited from three fastening companies, divided into three age groups, and asked to perform a sort-recall task of high (HF) and low (LF) frequency usage fastening items. The  results revealed no age differences on sorting or recall for either the HF or the LF items. On a within-subject basis, all measures of recall were significantly higher for the HF items than for the LF items. HF items were found to have a different organizational relationship than LF items which supports the notion of a more cohesive and structured recall and a richer memory for well-known items. These findings suggest that work experience and frequent exposure to certain product items affects both qualitative and quantitative aspects of organization and recall of this knowledge domain.

To investigate this area, a 17-item questionnaire was sent to independent practitioners in psychology. The questionnaire asked about respondents' education; extent and location of practice; frequency of verbal abuse, physical attack, and other harassment by patients; and concerns regarding patient violence. Results from 300 returned questionnaires revealed that 81 percent of the practitioners had at least one incident of patient physical attack, verbal abuse, or other harassment in private practice or at another job. Verbal abuse was the most  frequently reported event. Physical attacks were about twice as common at jobs in hospitals and clinics than in independent practice. Other harassments, such as annoying phone calls or threats to sue, were more common in private work than at other jobs. Over half of the practitioners reported avoiding certain types of patients (those with violent histories, paranoid schizophrenics, drug addicts) to avoid danger. Since these types of incidents do occur with some frequency, it would seem advisable for clinical training programs to discuss such incidents with students and suggest ways to deal with or prevent patient harassment. Results of the questionnaire are presented in tabular appendices. (NRB)",

        "description":"Recent smoking treatment programs have shifted emphasis from initial cessation rates to long-term abstinence, with aversion therapy and coping response training having had the most success. A smoking cessation treatment consisting of rapid smoking and behavioral counseling was supplemented with two maintenance treatments. After completing the 2-week smoking program, subjects continued in either a control condition (N=20) or in one of two maintenance conditions (N=37). Subjects in both maintenance groups underwent coping response and exposure treatments. In addition, one group's treatment included rapid puffing trials. The differences in the results of the cessation only group and the two maintenance groups became significant after the 3 month posttreatment follow-up. By 6 months  postreatment, however, the difference was nonsignificant: 50 percent of the maintenance subjects remained abstinent compared to 37 percent of nonmaintenance subjects. High scores on the Depression Proneness Inventory and the Self-Control Schedule, as well as a large number of life stressors as measured by the Social Readjustment Scale, correlated with quicker relapse in the maintenance subjects. Since the relapse curves of the two maintenance groups were similar, the rapid puffing trials failed to make a significant contribution to abstinence. Although maintenance sessions did retard relapse during the 3 month maintenance period, the lack of significant long-term differences suggests a need to re-examine the factors underlying maintenance effects.

          "And Others"],
        "description":"Despite recent research showing men capable of nurturing behavior, most men remain reluctant to care for children. Some researchers have suggested that men are fearful of nurturing as a result of traditional sex role socialization while others have suggested an increased role of external factors in explaining the lack of men in child care (pay, status, social stereotypes). To further examine the issue of nurturance, 78 male and 84 female college students read one of ten babysitting scenarios which varied according to sex of babysitter and type of care provided (refusal to sit; minimal care; masculine, feminine, or androgynous care). After reading the story, subjects evaluated the babysitter using the Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ), the Semantic Differential, and the Life  Events Questionnaire. On the PAQ, subjects rated the character who refused to sit as most masculine, followed by the character in the masculine scenario. The character in the feminine scenario was rated as most feminine. Analysis of Semantic Differential scores revealed three factors: niceness, competence, and activity. The feminine babysitter, whether male or female, was rated nicest and the feminine, masculine, and androgynous caregivers were rated most competent. The results suggest that the perception of nurturing people as masculine or feminine depends on the gender of the evaluator and the person doing the nurturing. These findings do not support the views that men fear nurturing or that nurturing men are devalued. Social and economic factors may offer better explanations for the  low levels of child care done by men. (TW)",

        "description":"Despite the recent increase in interest about the homeless population, the last large-scale systematic studies of the older skid row man were completed more than two decades ago. A more sophisticated and comprehensive instrument for measuring the physical health, mental health, social needs, and social interaction of this aging heterogeneous population can provide the first comprehensive picture of these men and their response to current social programs. It can also aid in urban planning. Men (N=281) with a mean age of 61.5 years from the Bowery, a 13 block section of lower Manhattan, were interviewed using the Comprehensive Assessment and Referral Evaluation and the Network Analysis Profile. The responses were compared to a general community sample from the Cross-National Study  on four major areas of concern: socioeconomic, mental health (including alcoholism), physical health, and social interaction. More than 50 percent of the Bowery men earned less than $3900 per year, 60 percent lacked sufficient money for food, 68 percent had worked as semi-skilled or unskilled laborers, and 56 percent recently attempted to find work. Only 14 percent received public assistance and 23 percent received Medicaid. Their scores on the depression scale were twice that of the New York City elderly and almost one-fourth had previous psychiatric care or symptoms. The results suggested a high rate of alcohol abuse. Several physical complaints were 2-3 times that of the community elderly. There were no complete isolates and group behavior was common. Most men indicated that they would  seek some aid from an agency. Project Rescue was established as an outgrowth of these findings to help achieve the following objectives: respite, nutrition, health, housing, financial and vocational assistance, and outreach. Further research was conducted following Project Rescue to illustrate the advantage of a collaboration between an academic facility and a service agency. (TW)",

        "description":"Recent research suggesting a link between loneliness and social networks and a difference between males and females in both the quantity and quality of relationships support the view that loneliness can be predicted by gender from social network variables. In one study, two samples were used to explore gender differences. Sample 1, 97 males and 82 females, were undergraduates, most of whom had never married and lived at home. Sample 2, 42 males and 82 females, attended evening classes, were older than 25 years, and lived away from home (65 percent). All respondents completed the Social Network List, the Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors, and the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale. In a second study, 76 male and 67 female undergradute students between the ages of 17 and 46  years completed a demographic information sheet, the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, the new social network density measures, and the Millers Topics Inventory. The results showed that social network characteristics, especially density, were consistently better predictors of perceived loneliness for males than for females. Uniformly, males with more highly interconnected, cohesive sets of friends reported less loneliness, while density had little correlation with loneliness in females. These results suggest that males and females may employ different standards in evaluating loneliness, with males using group oriented criteria, and females focusing on dyadic relationships. More research is needed on reciprocity, mutual emotional expressiveness, and nurturance. Such qualities may prove to be  better predictors of loneliness for females than for males. (Author/TW)",

During orientation, 67 male and 32 female first-year medical students completed the Personality Attributes Questionnaire and 21 months later also completed measures of psychological well-being, interpersonal functioning, humanistic attitudes toward patient care, and alcohol consumption. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses with interaction terms revealed main effects of masculinity on self-esteem, extroversion, and confidence, and main  effects of femininity on hedonic capacity, interpersonal satisfaction, sharing of personal problems, and alcohol consumption. Measures of impaired mood and alcohol and drug impairment were also studied in relation to masculinity and femininity. Both variables contributed to the prediction of depressed mood; femininity also contributed to the prediction of drug impairment. Neither scale has sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be used by itself as a test of impairment. Further study is needed to measure the precise relationship among low femininity, low hedonic capacity, and high potential for substance abuse. (Six data tables are included.) (Author/TW)",

Studies of adolescent alcohol use typically sample intact high school populations, excluding dropouts and adolescents alienated from straight high school populations. Alcohol and drug use and alcohol related attitudes were measured in 62 urban, high-school aged street adolescents (40 females; 22 males) who were alienated from the mainstream educational system. Interview materials included open-ended and structured questions which assessed respondents' alcohol consumption, alcohol related problems, marijuana and other drug use, parental alcohol use, parental norm sending, alcohol concepts, drinking motives, negative mood frequency, peer drinking, and street alcohol use. The  results indicated that the respondents were highly alcohol and drug oriented: (1) they reported very high alcohol and marijuana use, high frequency of drinking to get drunk, and alcohol problems; (2) high proportions of their peers drank; and (3) drinking appeared necessary for acceptance into social groups. The major correlates of alcohol use and problems were peer alcohol use, limited knowledge of alcohol effects, and personal drinking motives. Reported parental alcohol use and norm sending showed weak or inconsistent correlations with respondents' alcohol use. These findings demonstrate that a sample of adolescents who would not appear in typical school-based studies exhibited much stronger alcohol involvement than the general adolescent population.

        "description":"Delinquency intervention and research have undergone changes in recent years. One new line of research has been aimed at mapping out juvenile criminal careers. Findings from this research suggest that involvement in technically delinquent activity may be a transitory, developmental phenomenon related to adolescence. Youth appear to be increasingly involved in antisocial acts up to the age of 16 and then to show a marked decline in antisocial behaviors. The new task for research becomes one of mapping out the separate processes by which youth become involved in, stay involved in, and stop involvement in delinquent behaviors. A developmental perspective should be of major importance in the formulation of delinquency theory and the influences that promote cessation should play a key  role in secondary prevention efforts. Delinquency cessation generally occurs at an age that marks a youth's passage into adulthood. It is possible that fear of adult criminal sanctions has a marked impact on the calculation of the likely risk of continued criminal activity. It is also possible that older adolescents have a greater investment in a conventional lifestyle and feel they have more to lose by continued criminal activity. In exploring the cessation of delinquent behavior in late adolescence, it would seem imperative to focus investigation on the juvenile's perceptions of the impending role change into young adulthood.

        "description":"Near-death experiences (NDEs) are subjective experiences at the threshold of death which can include strong positive affect, dissociation from the physical body, and paranormal/transcendental phenomena. Empirical investigation of NDEs has typically relied upon retrospective reports and personality studies of individuals who have come close to death (e.g., through accidents, illness, surgical procedures, etc.) and later recovered. Psychological understanding of NDEs has been complicated by the failure of past research to reveal any personality factors consistently related to reporting NDEs. Recently, Wilson and Barber (1983) have suggested that some excellent hypnotic subjects (fantasy-prone personalities) may be more likely to report NDEs than the rest of the population. This  hypothesis was investigated in subjects who had: (1) reported prototypical NDEs (N=63); (2) been close to death, but without reporting NDEs (N=28), and (3) never been near death (N=45). Subjects completed the Near-Death Experience Scale; the Memory, Imagining, and Creativity Schedule (MICS); the Absorption Scale; and the Survey of Psi Experiences. Subjects who had never been near death did not complete the NDE scale. The results revealed that the MICS and Absorption Scale were highly correlated and that both measures were significantly correlated with NDE Scale scores. Analysis of variance revealed that the group reporting NDEs scored significantly higher on the MICS than either comparison group, and NDE reporters' scores on the Absorption and PSI scales were higher than those of the  never near death group. These results lend partial support to the hypothesis that fantasy-prone personalities may be more likely to report NDEs than the general population. (NRB)",

While there is some research on the sex role attitudes of Chinese Americans, little is known about Japanese American attitudes and beliefs. To assess and compare Japanese and Caucasian American college students' attitudes, a questionnaire assessing values related to men's and women's roles in family and work contexts was administered to 244 Japanese American and 99 Caucasian college students. The results revealed that while all groups tended to be more liberated than traditional, they also maintained some relatively traditional beliefs. Japanese and Caucasian men differed significantly in their beliefs regarding women's place in the home, working women's homemaking and childcare  responsibilities, sex differences in abilities related to homemaking and childcare, and men's capacity for enjoyment of homemaking and childcare. Japanese and Caucasian women differed significantly in their beliefs regarding women's capacity to handle the responsibilities of both career and home, potential effects of wife's employment on marital adjustment, their own potential for enjoying the role of a full-time housewife, shared roles in marriage, potential effects of househusband roles on masculinity, women's primary responsibilities, comparative male/female suitability for housework and childcare, and equal rights and responsibilities. Japanese American beliefs and attitudes towards male and female roles can be seen as reflecting both traditional Japanese ideals and the realities of  early immigrant life and work in America.

Some family alliances involve triangulation, drawing a third person into a dyadic relationship to mediate tension. Family relationships were examined in 309 college students who completed a Family Background Questionnaire about their past and present family relationships and their current adjustment to college. A sub-sample (N=88) participated in more in-depth structured interviews and completed the UCLA Revised Loneliness Scale. Analysis of the questionnaire responses revealed that MANP students who indicated that no sibling was available to join the  triangle after the student entered college were performing poorly in academics and were more likely to consider counseling than were MAP students. Interview data further revealed that MANP students reported being lonelier than MAP students, and students who indicated more contact with one parent reported being lonelier than those indicating equal contact with both parents. These findings suggest that the integrity of generational boundaries is important to the functioning of individual family members and that the negative effects of cross generational alliances can be buffered by other family members who can be triangled into these alliances.

Univariate analyses indicated that, in comparison to non-aggressive boys, aggressive boys had significantly lower PCSC self-esteem, fewer verbal assertion solutions with peers, fewer verbal assertion solutions in hostile conflicts, more direct action solutions with teachers, and more direct action solutions in hostile conflicts. Discriminant analyses significantly differentiated the two groups. Problem solving interventions for aggressive boys can use these results to focus specifically on children's rates of verbal assertion and direct action solutions with different persons, on their perceived social competence, and on their self-esteem.

        "description":"Several theorists have advocated marital therapy in treatment programs for alcoholics. Given the promise of marital therapy for alcoholics, it is important to develop successful techniques for recruitment. One approach toward improving recruitment is to identify the characteristics of couples who are likely to accept or reject marital therapy. Following an extensive evaluation in which husbands and wives separately completed questionnaires about their marriage and an interview about the alcoholic's drinking, 35 couples with alcoholic husbands decided to participate in couples therapy (acceptors) and 28 couples did not (rejectors). Data from the evaluation were used to examine ten demographic variables, the severity of the husband's drinking and the couple's marital problems,  previous help-seeking behaviors, and each spouse's motivation to improve the marriage. A stepwise multiple discriminant analysis was used to compare scores of acceptors and rejectors. A significant discriminant function indicated that acceptors were characterized by husbands with more education, better marital adjustment, full-time employment, and a larger number of alcohol-related arrests. Acceptors also had sought more outpatient help in the past year. Rejectors were characterized by wives with better marital adjustment, greater living distance from the clinic, and husbands with more alcohol-related hospitalizations. Rejector husbands also tended to be older. These findings have implications for planning efforts to attract alcoholics likely to accept marital therapy and for identifying  and dealing with potential rejectors of marital therapy among patients in alcoholism treatment programs.

        "description":"Studies in the area of video training for offenders note the possibilities of modeling as a training method for delinquents. The impact of three job-related, interpersonal skill training programs for 50 Black and Hispanic inner city adolescent and young adult ex-offenders in a community-based employment program was examined. In addition, the impact of test anxiety on trainees' preparation for and adaptation to work was evaluated. Prior to the five experimental sessions, subjects completed the Test Anxiety Scale, Job Interview Skills Questionnaire (JISQ), Efficacy Questionnaire, and the Demographic Questionnaire. All subjects participated in the first desensitization session. For the remaining four sessions, subjects were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: symbolic  meaning videotape, video discussion, or best alternative training intervention. Following the last session, subjects completed the JISQ, Identification Questionnaire, and the Efficacy Questionnaire and individually role played a job interview. Follow-up outcome data were obtained from agency placement specialists 30 days after completion of training. The results indicated that the two video interventions (symbolic meaning, video discussion) had essentially equal positive impact on knowledge of and ability to use job interview skills. Test anxiety was found to interfere with performance when trainees were assessed in a mode that differed from their training mode. The findings suggest that a brief community-based video training experience can strengthen the interpersonal skills for job  acquisition and retention with adolescent and young adult ex-offenders.

To examine the reality monitoring model of Johnson and Raye (1981) and to explore the relationship between memory specificity and reality monitoring, the amount of cognitive operations involved in processing information was manipulated for 72 subjects who imagined and perceived spatial relationships between objects in treasure maps. Subjects (N=24) in the whole map condition saw a continuous path between five objects, while subjects (N=48) in the segmented map condition saw segments of the path which they mentally combined into a continuous path. All subjects imagined spatial relationships by reading descriptions of imaginery hands of a clock. All subjects perceived ten maps and  imagined ten maps. After presentation of the maps, the accuracy of subjects' memory for the relative location of objects was tested and subjects completed a forced-choice recognition and identification of origin task. An identification of origin score computed for each subject reflected the accuracy with which subjects discriminated between memories of imagined and perceived maps. The results indicated that subjects in the whole map condition were significantly more accurate at correctly identifying the origin of maps than were subjects in the segmented map condition. The findings demonstrated that difference in the amount of cognitive operations was a reliable reality monitoring cue and differences in the cognitive operations produced the opportunity for differences in memory specificity  to be a reliable reality monitoring cue.

Students in five fourth-grade classes served as the control, receiving no semantic mapping instruction. Subjects, 39 fourth-grade poor readers, were presented semantic mapping instruction in two of the three daily lessons, once in a small group (poor readers only) and once in a large group (whole class). On each day, eight target vocabulary words pertaining to one of three specific topics (water, stores, or Olympics) were introduced. On the third day, subjects received no instruction but were tested on the vocabulary pertaining to the third topic. One and a half weeks following completion of treatment  the twenty-four item vocabulary test that had been administered seven weeks prior to treatment was given again. Analysis of daily test performance, as well as pre- to posttreatment gain scores, indicated that there were no significant differences between poor readers' performance after small group instruction and their performance after large group instruction. Poor readers who received semantic mapping instruction had significantly higher pretest to posttest gain scores than did students in the heterogeneously grouped outside control classes. This finding lends further support to the effectiveness of semantic mapping as an instructional strategy for vocabulary development. (EL)",

Directives were defined as the range of language forms used to direct actions (imperative statement, need/want statement, permission request, explicit question, nonexplicit question, and hint). The children read the written stories and listened to the picture book stories prior to answering questions concerning pragmatic relations expressed in the texts. The findings indicated that alternative directive processing strategies evolved as the children gained experience in varying language choice in different social settings. These strategies--reciprocity, reflexivity,  and reasoning--reflected a gradual shift in the children's thinking from reliance on situational context to consideration of the relationship of form, function, and context in comprehension. A reasoning processing strategy emerged as the children developed a cognitive model of pragmatic relations in conversation. (Author/HOD)",

Twelve of the students worked with a fictional story, while the other nine worked with a nonfictional selection. In each of these conditions, subjects were divided into three groups.

The results showed that in both the fiction and nonfiction conditions, the group that completed the outline after discussion and after viewing the webbing did so considerably more accurately and in less time than did the other two groups. Besides webbing, other alternatives to the normal outline form can provide students with practice in organizing the material read in texts; these include pictorial, topical, charting and predication outlines.

Among the programing problems encountered were counting words (taking into account numbers, acronyms, and abbreviations) and counting the number of syllables in a word (English has no regular rules for reliably dividing words into syllables). Using only this readability program will not ensure improved comprehension because the act of reading and comprehending involves so many interrelated factors. However, the program can be used to test the readability of government manuals, orders, instructions, and so on. It  can also be used to alert writers to revise their prose according to the reading level of the intended audience and to serve as a taking-off point for a college classroom discussion of audience. An advantage of the readability program is that students can run it themselves. For those who use word processors, a readability program will probably end up as one more utility program--like a word counter or spelling checker--that quickly provides potentially useful information about one's prose.

It was hypothesized that the three components (informational, causal, and evaluative) of the second and third grade inferencing abilities tests would constitute a hierarchy of inferencing and that the impact of the inferencing abilities on basic skills competencies would change over time. Subjects, 217 children from 12 classes in seven schools from a cross-section of socioeconomic, rural, commuter, and urban populations were followed from the beginning of grade 2 until the end of grade 3. Literacy and numeracy achievements were assessed using the Canadian Tests of Basic Skills. Each child in the sample met individually with an experimenter in  the fall of each year for a 30-minute session, of which the Inferencing Ability Test formed a 10-minute part at the beginning of the session. The child was shown a poster, given time to examine it, and then asked a set of questions (with the poster in view). In addition the child was given two sets of scrambled sequence cards to put in order, one set at a time. Results support the notion of a hierarchy of inferencing skills, and suggest that skill in inferencing may underlie and constrain achievement in literacy and numeracy in the primary grades. Measurement and evaluation of inferencing ability ought, therefore, to occur earlier to determine which children require extra assistance in their development. (Tables of findings are included.)

For example, the years from 9 to 13 are a time of physical, social, emotional, and cognitive change--also called an \"age of ambivalence.\" Many of these students tackle decision making sooner and reach the stage of formal operations (abstract thinking) earlier than their peers. Consequently, certain teaching preferences become apparent. Teachers should accept challenges brought by gifted students, and they should offer new and alternative ways of helping them view their problems. Several approaches or strategies for teaching reading and the language arts follow logically from traits of gifted students that have been identified:  e.g., directed reading-thinking activity, the individualized approach, and the merging of instruction in reading and writing. Gifted students also need access to the library whenever possible, and the library serves as an excellent means for crossing subject matter boundaries. The characteristics of gifted readers are also related to certain types of literature. The kinds of books that gifted readers are likely to enjoy can be found among the selections in the annual list of \"Children's Choices,\" a project of the International Reading Association-Children's Book Council Joint Committee. (Appendixes include an annotated list of readings taken from lists published from 1980 to 1985 and suggested reading/language activities to challenge gifted students.) (HOD)",

All the pages in the eight books were read independently and word by word by two researchers who met regularly to discuss the part of a textbook that both had recently read. Each researcher noted segments of a text that even came close to being a specific suggestion for teaching comprehension. The findings were similar to findings from prior studies of classrooms and basal manuals in the sense that specific descriptions of comprehension teaching were either  scarce or totally missing.

The self-directed questioning strategy involved making predictions, defining evidence that generates the predictions, evaluating subsequent clues, and reformulating predictions when necessary or devising new ones when previous ones are confirmed. Subjects were 23 intermediate grade students, randomly assigned to two instructional groups. Each group received eight consecutive hour-long sessions, either teacher-directed preposed purpose setting and follow-up questions, or on-going self-directed questioning. Pretest and posttest scores were obtained using the New Developmental Reading Test. Results indicated that the self-directed questioning technique was effective for all readers in  that group when asked to draw relationships between two important parts of the text. The technique did not significantly improve text explicit comprehension or creative comprehension, as measured by the reading for relationships subtest. Furthermore, this method significantly improved the text implicit comprehension for the low-verbal ability group, but not for the high-verbal ability group, indicating that less proficient readers profit from explicit instruction in reading comprehension.

        "description":"A study was conducted to explore first grade students' conceptions of reading and writing, and how those conceptions may be associated with and influenced by the type of reading instruction they receive. The study was conducted in three separate classrooms, each based upon theoretically different models of literacy learning: (1) a content-centered mastery learning program; (2) a traditional, eclectic, basal reading approach; and (3) a child-centered literature approach. All children were interviewed individually concerning their conceptions of reading and writing. Children's reading achievement levels were also obtained from the teachers. Responses were rated according to the degree to which they were meaning-based or related to the deep structure aspects of language as opposed  to the degree to which the responses were letter-sound based or related to surface structure. The results reflected the nature of the classrooms and the children's ability levels. Students' conceptions of reading and writing were highest or most meaning-based in the informal or literature-based classroom. The traditional or basal class students had the middle-level mean score, while mastery learning students had the lowest or most analytical score. When correlated with achievement level, the middle achievers had the lowest reading conception scores and the highest writing conception scores. Both reading and writing achievement scores for the informal classroom tended to decline from low achievers to high achievers. Results suggest that the type of instruction and the context for  instruction significantly and quite powerfully affect the way that first grade children perceive literacy and literacy activities, and that this effect changes with the students' achievement level.

Individual children's ranks on 61 oral language features derived from a previous microethnography were compared to their ranks on the California Test of Basic Skills and their Reading Miscue Inventory scores using Kendall correlation coefficients and multiple regression equations. The language features included language awareness indices as well as pragmatic, functional features during classroom activities. The analysis revealed several oral language features had positive though not usually significant correlations with fourth and fifth (but not  third) grade reading measures and their contributions to the variance in the multiple regression equations were generally substantial. The trend toward a positive relationship of these features with later reading measures was consistent. Metalinguistic awareness (print awareness and offering or requesting definitions or etymologies), correcting self or others' behavior or positions, and the use of the interactive functions of language across whole sessions and within specific activities that were not teacher directed were the oral language features that presaged later reading achievement.

        "description":"J. D. Bransford's tetrahedral model of learning considers four variables: (1) learning activities, (2) characteristics of the learner, (3) criterial tasks, and (4) the nature of the materials. Bransford's model provides a research-based theoretical framework that can be used to teach, model, and have students apply a variety of study strategies to the learning situation. Learning activities, for example, include study techniques that give rise to learning, such as surveying, questioning, mapping, text underlining, making concept cards, summarizing, and so forth. The most important idea is that students learn a study sequence to follow. The second crucial aspect of the learning process is what the student brings to the learning situation, such as prior knowledge. College reading  instructors can teach students how to tap into existing knowledge and how to use it in a variety of ways. The third variable, the ability to determine and carry out a variety of tasks, involves teaching students how to take both essay and objective tests, as well as how to solve problems. The fourth variable--the text--usually determines why a professor selects one text over another. Major differences among texts involve text organization, format, study aids, clarity of explanation, and occasionally readability. Students should learn to carefully examine a required text to see how it is organized. Teaching students in such a way that all four variables are addressed should be the major goal of any college reading program. (HOD)",

In this way they can build a framework which can be used for different types of information.

The purpose of the task analysis meeting is, therefore, to elicit from the subject matter experts information that is procedurally and user oriented. The goal of the meeting is to have participants generate tasks that fit  into four columns: action, audience, information requirements, and result. The information generated in this collective exercise is more comprehensive than what can be extracted through individual interviews.

        "description":"In order to find out what a three-member peer group in freshman composition was discussing during their meetings and how--if at all--they talked about writing, their conversations about their first drafts for the class were taped and analyzed. Analysis showed that in addition to discussion of their drafts (text talk) and social chat (off-task talk), the students also talked about the assignment, group procedures, and feedback (mataresponse). Of the five categories (text, assignment, metaresponse, procedures, and off-task), metaresponse revealed the most about what the students were and were not doing in the group. It gave them a way to vent frustration, express confusion, and negotiate new ways of interacting, while providing feedback for the teacher. Analysis showed that more  inservice training in reading, responding, and using feedback to revise would have been helpful, and pointed to the problems caused by using teacher-generated assignments in a workshop that was supposed to be collaboratively run. Perhaps most importantly, findings indicated that when students are given some instruction in reading and responding to one another's drafts, they may spend time discussing the complexity of reading and writing. Peer writing instruction provides group members with the opportunity to discover and discuss the difficulties of composing, reading, responding, and revising. (DF)",

Eighteen college students were assigned a persuasive business letter writing task in control, outline, rough first draft, and polished first draft conditions. The letters were judged on language usage, coherency, idea development, effectiveness, and mechanics. Any benefits from the outlines and rough drafts presumably would be evident in the letters. Subjects were also trained in directed introspection, in which they identified their thoughts during writing as best fitting one of four categories: planning, translating, reviewing, or other. The results of the letter writing task analysis and the introspection  training indicated that use of written outlines increased the time spent translating ideas into text and improved the quality of letter, but failed to effect overall writing efficiency. The use of rough versus polished drafts affected when the students revised their work, but had no effect on quality or efficiency. A subsequent survey of science and engineering faculty supported these laboratory results. Academic writers who reported frequent use of outlines during prewriting also tended to use polished drafts. However, their use of a polished draft strategy had no consequences for their productivity. (Author/HTH)",

The planning section of the handbook highlights factors to be considered: choice of topic for writing, objective for writing, incorporation of library skills, integration of instruction, use of effective teaching strategies, identification of learner needs, and identification of appropriate strategies and resources. The handbook then provides guidelines and tips on working with reluctant  writers and with very young writers (for example, establishing the climate for writing and retaining the authorship of each child) and offers suggestions for incorporating library and bookmaking skills into the project. The handbook concludes with ideas for sharing students' books and with samples of units that have already been developed on topics such as expressing feelings, riddle/entertaining, nuclear energy/promoting ideas, survival, the life cycle of frogs, and making a fantasy book.

        "author":["Strickland, James"],
        "description":"In the area of composition, computer assisted instruction (CAI) must move beyond the limited concerns of the current-traditional rhetoric to address the larger issues of writing, become process-centered, and involve active writing rather than answering multiple-choice questions. Researchers cite four major types of interactive CAI, the last of which addresses higher-order concerns: (1) drill and practice programs, (2) tutorial programs, (3) text-editor programs, and (4) dialog systems. The CAI dialog programs can offer advantages for teaching rhetorical invention, specifically in the generating stage of the composing process, that the other three cannot. Both systematic and unsystematic writing heuristic activities can be programed for CAI. Two such invention programs are QUEST  and FREE. One of the advantages of computer assisted invention strategies is that the programs can be individual, generative, and encouraging. The heuristic can also address specific rhetorical problems. Finally, the computer encourages students to spend time prewriting, an important activity that many poor writers ignore completely. While there is a lack of commercially prepared software packages dealing with rhetorical invention, a number of CAI invention programs written by writing teachers are being exchanged among campuses across the country. (Information for obtaining the QUEST and FREE programs, and a select bibliography on computers and composition are included.) (HTH)",

        "author":["Dobrin, David N."],
        "description":"Idea processors are computer programs that can aid the user in creating outlines by allowing the user to move, reorder, renumber, expand upon, or delete entries with a push of a button. The question is whether these programs are useful and should be offered to students. Theoretically, an idea processor prioritizes ideas by placing them in a hierarchy. Unfortunately, the idea processor does not really set priorities; it attaches labels indicating priorities that the writer has set. The confusion is between labels or symbols (which are on paper or in the computer) and ideas (which are in the head). The basic limitations of the idea processor are that (1) the meaning of an item on a list is not stable, and (2) the appropriate symbol for the meaning must change when any of the things  the item depends on change. Three things need to be adjusted when a program command is used: the idea of what the item means, the idea of what other items mean, and the symbol. The question is whether having to update items is more likely to be a distraction or a way of gaining new insights. Idea processors are not likely to be useful to the ordinary user. Rather, they are likely to be useful to people who regularly plan with outlines, who tend to write things that they are sure about, and who rarely update entries in paper and pencil outlines. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to explore attitudes toward the credibility of individual media and news media in general. The first phase of the study was a series of focused group discussions, while the second involved a national representative sampling of 1,469 adults interviewed by telephone, 875 of whom were then surveyed by mail. Credibility scores for newspapers and television were constructed and used as a &quot;yardstick&quot; with which to measure results, including indicators of credibility developed specifically for this study and indicators developed by other studies. These results showed that it is possible to develop a useful summary measure of credibility as long as the complexity of credibility is taken into account. The results also showed that, although people's attitudes toward  credibility of newspapers and television are often similar, when forced to choose, they are likely to perceive television as more credible than newspapers. Television was chosen by most respondents as the medium: (1) they would believe concerning reports of conflict; (2) they would choose if they were limited to just one source for local, state, or national/international news; and (3) they consider most reliable for local, state, and national/international news. Newspapers were named as most reliable for understanding complex or controversial local topics. (Extensive tables of data are included.) (HTH)",

Following an introduction, the first section of the guide deals with language as communication, as thought, and as a series of interrelated skills. Three questions language arts teachers must ask themselves are posed: whether they give receptive and expressive skills equal time, whether inner thought can occur without language, and whether teachers interrelate the language arts. The second section explores creating an environment for language, and is organized around the essential areas of language teaching. The section includes three language arts teaching frameworks, ways of providing for  interaction between the different language arts, and two suggested models for enriching the context for language learning. The third section deals with designing language experiences in the areas of listening, oral expression, dramatization, written expression, literature as a base for critical reading, and a framework for teaching reading using children's literature. In addition to the resource lists in each skill area, a selected list of writings in language arts is included in a bibliography. (HTH)",

Because previous research has indicated that teachers find children to be attractive when they communicate with friendly, relaxed, and attentive styles, it was hypothesized that nonteaching adults might find children to be attractive if they display slightly different communicator styles. Each of twenty children attending prekindergarten, kindergarten, or first grade in a private school (context 1) and a play school in the afternoon (context 2) was evaluated on ten dimensions of communicator style and three dimensions of attractiveness by two teachers and two play school  supervisors. A cross-content comparison of the evaluations revealed a significant difference in only one area: adult perceptions of children's personal attractiveness. Teachers rated the children more highly on personal attractiveness than did the nonteaching adults. Further research is needed to examine the contextual determinants of children's communicator style and attractiveness. (Tables of findings are included.) (DF)",

Communication scripts (cognitive structures that help people function in day-to-day communication situations) can provide a useful framework for analyzing each of these variables in relation to the labeling of sexually harassing communication. This four-part model has implications for training workers to recognize and deal with potentially harassing situations. Future research should test the effects of immediacy,  career choice, prior experience, and topical knowledge on the perception of sexual harassment. (DF)",

The types were: (1) informational (excerpts from network news); (2) persuasive (child-oriented commercials and adult-oriented commercials); (3) educational (excerpts from an instructional spot); and (4) mixed (child-oriented public service announcements). Immediately after viewing each message, children responded to open-ended interviews about message content, type, intent, believability, and belief criteria. It was found that comprehension of narrative content  was high, even among the youngest children. Similarly, young children were able to identify messages for which common labels existed in the vernacular. However, few children ever attached labels to educational spots or public service announcements. Correct articulation of message intent took much longer; few children under the age of 8 years correctly identified the intent of any message type. There was also an age-related trend toward the use of functional cues to aid in message identification and a dramatic trend toward reality testing as the appropriate basis for evaluations of message believability.

These issues are outlined in this booklet, which also provides a number of policy recommendations. The basic concepts reviewed are (1) the assumptions that underlie the collaborative endeavor that is effective education; (2) factors affecting the recruitment, training, and professional development of teachers; (3) possible responses to variations in teacher supply and demand; and (4) appropriate development and application of certification standards and professional requirements. Additional concepts covered are (5) various forms of teacher compensation, incentives, and rewards; (6) the need for defining incompetence and  establishing effective procedures for teacher discipline; (7) the characteristics of effective schooling and the value of decentralizing authority as determined through research; and (8) the importance of cooperation among educators and educational policy-makers at all levels to develop strong, coordinated approaches to educational improvement.

Following a brief introduction, the first section discusses definitions of &quot;skill&quot; and outlines empirical attributes of teaching skills. In the following section, the four lines of inquiry are described. Results are analyzed in the third section. First, naturalistic studies--analyzing teaching and instructional management in &quot;regular&quot; classrooms, and often deriving experimental models of effective teaching--are reviewed. Second, theory-driven studies--positing particular educational environments as affecting specific types of learning and analyzing the skills used to create such environments--are examined in four subcategories: social models, involving group inquiry by students;  information-processing models, emphasizing techniques designed to improve cognition; student-centered models; and behavioral models. Third, examples of curriculum research are reviewed. This research asks whether there are reproducible techniques for producing curricula that affect learning, and whether schools can foster sufficient stability for these curricula to succeed. Finally, effective schools research is considered; it inquires into what types of school environment benefit learning, and how educators produce such environments. The final section briefly summarizes the findings of all four research avenues, assesses their value, and suggests an integrative framework. An extensive bibliography is included. (MCG)",

This document reports on the conference at which these authors presented their papers, beginning with introductory remarks concerning the conceptual framework in which the business-school collaboration can be viewed and brief interpretations of the conceptual attitudes of each of the authors. The document then presents transcripts of the introductions made at the  conference itself, of the authors' remarks concerning their papers, and of the discussions following the presentation of the papers. The document concludes with abstracts of the six papers presented. The central topics of the six papers and their authors are as follows: (1) conceptual frameworks for thinking about private sector-public school collaboration (Marsha Levine); (2) incentives for the barriers to collaboration from a labor education perspective (Maurice Leiter); (3) a school superintendent's view of business-school relationships (Larry Cuban); (4) legal aspects of business-school relations (focusing on equity); (5) one corporation's commitment to quality education (Susan (Schilling); and (6) corporate responsibility in the context of rapid change (Badi G.

Dewey's methods were applied to the presentation of the inservice program itself. The experimental process was flexible, allowing the researchers to respond  creatively to the participants' needs, developing each phase of the process after evaluating prior phases.

The researchers interviewed the transferred teachers and principals as well as a sample of nontransferred teachers, parents, and district trustees to explore the effect of transfer on the development of transferred teachers, as well as on the teachers' colleagues, schools, and district. Among the positive effects found by the study were increased teacher enthusiasm and use of new techniques, enlarged teacher perspectives on student development and district needs, self-examination and change in the receiving schools, and increased dialogue and sharing of ideas among teaching staffs. Negative effects of the intervention included  teacher distrust, burdensome preparation time, practical problems of time and money connected with travel to new schools, and mutual adjustment difficulties between teachers and community members. The study draws on the case to discuss conditions under which transfer can offer a viable solution to teacher stagnation and to recommend essential elements for a transfer policy. (Author)",

The district had been fighting a desegregation case for 9 years and operating in a receivership with a triple bureaucracy imposed upon it (the normal school dictrict bureaucracy, court-mandated reporting procedures, and state-imposed procedures). As a result many problems still exist. Testing is a major problem, because the triple requirements have resulted in overtesting. The district also faces problems evaluating programs. To better understand these and other problems, the district is developing better relationships between schools and the central administration and is working in a  manner similar to regional exchanges (problem clarification to resource identification, to resource linkage). The Research and Analysis Department is developing policies based on court documents and investigating and analyzing the impact of policies after implementation. The district recognizes that it has been oriented toward reacting to immediate prescribed tasks due to these problems. It is now working to orient itself to the end of the desegregation case by combining the Final Standards with prescribed actions, with permanency, and with evidence that the district is functioning beyond the prescribed requirements.

The political bargaining model, used in conjunction with the broader systems framework, constitutes a familiar approach to research regarding education policymaking at the state level. This paper focuses on the conceptual implications of a study which applied that approach to a longitudinal investigation of the legislative process resulting in Minnesota's tuition tax concession statutes for elementary-secondary education. The findings indicate that the political bargaining model is a valid, productive, but insufficient model because it does not directly address two pervasive features of the process--political language and symbolic action. This paper provides a summary of the Minnesota study, a brief  illustration of the utility of the political bargaining model, and a preliminary case for the consideration of categories that direct our attention to the symbolic dimension of state level policymaking.

This paper discusses the indirect controls imposed by various levels of government on these schools and the response of the courts to these controls. It is organized by court decisions related to zoning ordinances, civil rights, and employment relations. The basic argument is that diversity in educational systems benefits the nation, and that private schools should therefore be protected from regulatory attempts by government as they develop programs and methods different from public schools. Zoning ordinances imposed by local government against nonpublic schools have been upheld in some cases and overturned in others. In general, the courts have ruled against the nonpublic  schools in matters related to civil rights. Church operated nonpublic schools have been protected from control of the National Labor Relations Board and have been exempt from paying unemployment compensation taxes. Although the nonpublic schools have been protected in some cases, they have as much to fear from indirect government controls as from those directly applied. (Author/TE)",

The study focused on mathematics curriculum and gathered data through survey questionnaires of elementary, middle, and high school level teachers. Three instruments were used: a school assessment questionnaire, a mathematics objectives survey, and a mathematics materials survey. The data from the materials and objectives surveys have not been analyzed, but data from the assessment survey and preliminary information on academic achievement are presented in this paper. Preliminary findings reveal important differences in academic achievement of intermediate students by ethnic category. The most critical finding is that curriculum alignment seems to contribute  negatively to achievement of white students, but positively for Black and Asian students. These findings suggest a need for closer evaluation of the data on curriculum objectives and materials surveys. If further analysis confirms this correlation, then demands for strict adherence to a single district-developed curriculum need to be examined. Further questions to consider are whether this study measured curriculum alignment or faculty responses to issues on the survey. Three appendices are included. (MD)",

It summarizes the findings of a survey conducted in the spring of 1982 to obtain information about the recruitment, selection, retention, an evaluation of prospective teachers in Illinois public schools. A questionnaire was sent to a stratified random sample of Illinois school districts based on the type, size, and geographic location of the districts. The survey questions and results are presented in the same order as they were presented in the questionnaire: (1) recruitment, (2) selection, and (3) evaluation. Findings suggest that local district personnel generally do not recruit widely or vigorously even though recruitment efforts may be hampered by  competitive salaries in other districts, geographic preferences, inadequate supply of candidates, or unique district needs. Selection criteria and procedures are frequently not formalized. Districts rely heavily on references and academic record, but the candidate's willingness to accept extracurricular assignments or ability to teach in more than one area are also pertinent. Evaluation procedures in most districts are formalized for teachers, but seldom for other educational personnel. A larger than expected percentage of districts report that unsatisfactory evaluations result in personnel actions including dismissal. Results are also reported for open-ended questions to district personnel on constraints that prevented them from realizing their recruitment, selection, and evaluation  goals, and on inservice practices. An appendix provides tables showing response percentages for each item on the questionnaire. (TE)",

The first section considers B. Bloom's Taxonomy as a basis for developing learning centers. Definitions of each level of the taxonomy are presented along with examples of questions and objectives which illustrate each level (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation). Then 83 ideas for products are offered. The second section discusses the nature of giftedness and talent and covers differentiation of instruction, student contracts, and responsibilities of the regular classroom teacher to the gifted  child. The final section addresses concerns for using the approach with special needs students. Suggestions in this section include ways to adjust the work time for the mainstreamed student and the use of peers in the regular classroom. The student guide entitled &quot;Blooming for Vertical and Horizontal Expansion or Creative Obfuscations to Confuse and Bewilder Your Friends&quot; aims to assist the student in writing learning units for other students. It contains exercises and questions related to Bloom's Taxonomy. (CL)",

        "description":"The paper examines whether a relationship exists between intellectual limitation on the mother's part and unfavorable outcomes for her children. The scope of the problem is examined and the difficulties inherent in estimating prevalence are noted. The issue of child neglect, rather than abuse is shown to be a major problem among institutionalized mentally retarded parents. Studies supporting this problem are cited. Further research indicating that factors other than the mother's intelligence--such as willingness to place the child's needs ahead of her own--may be more important predictors of the mother's ability to improve her child care skills. Additional factors include absence of significant emotional problems and experience in child care. It is suggested that a variety of  environmental, medical, economic, and social factors may affect the outcome, with intellectual limitation on the mother's part being additive to other negative environmental influences. Possible intervention approaches include following up children via home visitors, parent skill training, and helping with immediate needs. The paper suggests building in a system of non-coercive supports to existing social, medical, and educational services. Nine recommendations (including screening for literacy by welfare workers and appropriate family planning education in special education programs) are followed by suggestions to medical care or social service personnel for giving instructions, providing more outreach, using family-centered supports for mother and father, and adopting appropriate  attitudes. Two final sections address implications for Title V public programs and the role of University Affiliated Facilities. (CL)",

Topics covered include the effects of first impressions on nonhandicapped students and the impact of physical proximity, and the nature of interdependence among students' learning goals and rewards as structured by the teacher. A comparison of the dynamics of a cooperative learning situation and a competitive or individualistic one highlights the ways in which a cooperative situation fosters an atmosphere of trust and higher valuing of classmates. Regular class teachers are urged to teach social skills by carefully planned modeling programs in which accurate information about handicaps replaces fears and prejudice. The importance of teaching handicapped students such  skills as accepting responsibility for their actions, following instruction, and resisting peer pressure is stressed.

General concerns cited included the reports' lack of recognition of exceptional children and special education, and the need to evaluate excellence in terms of the learner's individuality. The dangers of using singular standards for assessing achievement in exceptional students are considered, and the committee asserts that a system of singular criteria for curricula and assessment to determine competence, graduation, or program evaluation is  immoral as well as poor educational practice. The committee further suggests caution in interpreting the reports' calls for firm discipline.

The federal definition of giftedness as contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 is provided. More recent emphasis on high performance capability in mathematics, science, foreign languages, or computer learning is noted. It is suggested that the ways in which schools operationally  define giftedness are often based on the needs of society.

        "description":"In this digest the problem of underachievement among gifted students is examined. Gifted underachievers manifest three behavior patterns in the school setting: non-communication and withdrawal, passive compliance, and aggressive/disruptive behavior. Gifted underachievers have been identified in greater numbers recently. Some of the causes of underachievement include lack of motivation, values conflicts, lack of environmental nurturance of intellectual potential, developmental delays or chronic poor health, specific disabilities, and specific or general academic skill deficits. Educational programing should address three critical areas: (1) an understanding of the nature and problems of being gifted; (2) development of constructive ways to cope with conflict and frustration caused  by the gap between cognitive ability and performance level; and (3) development of a healthier, more realistic self concept and higher self esteem. To be effective, programing should feature challenging and meaningful curriculum, maximum opportunity for inquiry and creativity, a compatible peer group, and support services. (CL)",

Background information touches on the scope of the problem, legal issues involved, and confidentiality issues. Discussion of risks examines the risk of transmission in the school, day care, or foster setting and notes that casual contact among school children appears to pose no risk, although studies are very limited concerning younger children and neurologically handicapped children who lack control of their body secretions. Risks for children with the disease are also considered. A series of 11 recommendations are made, including the following observations: (1) that for most infected school-age children, benefits of an unrestricted setting would outweigh both the  risks of their acquiring potentially harmful infections in the setting and the apparent nonexistent risk of transmitting AIDS; and (2) that for infected preschoolers and some neurologically handicapped children who lack control of their body secretions or who display behavior such as biting and who have uncoverable lesions, a more restricted environment is advisable until more is known about transmission in those settings.

An Adolescent Survey Form on Counseling Needs was designed to investigate the students' characteristics, affective needs, common coping styles, and preferred counseling techniques. Characteristics used by these students to describe themselves, as well as ratings of perceived competency, indicated this group was curious, independent and perfectionistic. They felt highly competent in cognitive areas, and less so in social and physical areas. Common  concerns and preferred coping strategies were summarized. Students reported school counseling services were rarely used except for gathering information and scheduling courses. Preferences for counseling techniques were listed.

DS, nonretarded (NR) and MR (non-DS mentally retarded) Ss (N=33) listened to or looked at increasingly-long sequences of single digits and attempted to recall them either orally or manually. Analyses suggested that (1) manual responding failed to enhance auditory recall in either DS or any other Ss; (2) difficulity in recalling auditory stimuli was greatest for DS mentally retarded Ss; and (3) DS auditory difficulty was most apparent in the recall of order information. Findings  suggested that the adverse consequences of mental retardation were most apparent in the recall of order information, and that this recall difficulty was greater for DS Ss. (Author/CL)",

Results of the state analysis include state rankings on three scales of state MR/DD fiscal effort: personal income share, total state budget share, and per capita expenditure. Cumulative fiscal efforts over the 8-year period (FY1977-84) are also illustrated in a table for community services, institutional services, and both sectors combined. The federal analysis includes a tracing of the historical evolution of federal MR/DD activity from 1914 to the present. The chapter on intergovernmental expenditures looks at trends in state-federal MR/DD spending and state expenditure shifts toward community objectives. Extensive appended materials are included.

The instrument is currently used to pre-screen kindergarten and first grade children before being given the WISC-R, a requirement for admission to LEEP (Learning Enrichment Experiences Program). A total of 38 Ss, 19 per group, were included in the study. Two dichotomous groups based on WISC-R IQ scores were used: 100-124 and 131-152. The null hypothesis, i.e., no relationship exists between checklist items and IQ scores, was tested using phi-coefficient and chi-square. Results indicated no significant relationship between  any checklist item and IQ score and no significant relationship between number of items checked by teachers and IQ scores. However, the instrument as a whole appears able to identify children with gifted potential over 50% of the time which is respectable in view of the children's young age and higher number of expected false positives.

Specific recommendations are given for control of AIDS transmission, Hepatitis-B transmission, Herpes transmission, and Cytamegalovirus transmission. Also discussed are the public relations aspects of infectious disease in the public schools, and cost considerations, especially legal costs and liability insurance. It is concluded that the greatest risk at the present time  is the potential for legal action on the part of school employees and parents of susceptible children. Schools are encouraged to implement procedures and face the associated risks in the interest of assuring each child's right to an education. (DB)",

Four measures with clear contrasts in content and mode were constructed and used to identify linguistic and method variance in a correlation matrix of language proficiency variables. The four measures were administered, along with eight other language measures, to a group of beginning-level learners of English as a second language. Factor analysis and comparison with demographic data were performed on  the data. The findings suggest that the language proficiency data were best modeled by a large general factor and two specific, content-related factors--grammar and vocabulary.

        "description":"Two studies were performed to determine the process used by young children to figure out the meaning of a new word. It was hypothesized that the children would use one of two strategies: (1) ignore the word and wait for more information, or learn only what is unambiguous about it, or (2) make a reasonable but uncertain guess, quickly setting up relatively complete but sometimes faulty semantic representations for new words. In one study, 3-year-olds were exposed to the word \"ecru\" using a beige cup with an unusual shape in one of three conditions: contrastive information given, a label only given, and a control condition in which the word \"ecru\" was not given at all. The children were given a cup identification task and a hyponym task. Results indicated that some children used  the latter, error-prone strategy. In a second study, 4- to 8-year-olds and adults were exposed to the same experimental design but heard \"ecru\" contrasted with \"red.\" Similar results were found: some children and adults use the more error-prone strategy for word learning, and a general bias exists favoring shape and category labels over color. Questions concerning a possible hierarchy of attributes considered by word learners and concerning the situations in which learners need and use linguistic contrast are discussed, and further research is recommended.

First, the distribution of the forms &quot;I,&quot;&quot;me,&quot;&quot;my,&quot; other-reference, and personal names was examined. The contrastive use of pronominal self-reference forms based on the transitivity parameters of their use in the subject position was then analyzed. It was found that among the younger, more ego-anchored children, utterances containing two participants and referring to completed actions and intentional behavior were more likely to contain &quot;my&quot; than &quot;I.&quot; In contrast, &quot;I&quot; was found most often in utterances  expressing the child's experiential states and intentions. The pattern was not found among older, nonego-anchored children, who used &quot;I&quot; when referring to themselves as causal agents as well as in experiential expressions. The ego-anchored children also used &quot;me&quot; in initial utterance position, as a subject affected by action. Nominal self-reference generally occurred in acts of naming, identifying, and describing, and with gestures. Contrast in the use of nominal versus pronominal forms of self-reference is suggested as a subject for further study. (MSE)",

        "description":"In a study of very young children's pronunciation of nouns and verbs, ten children aged 20 to 25 months were exposed to experimental nouns and verbs, which had not yet been comprehended or produced by the children. Each of the objects and actions was given an experimental name based on phonemes in the children's speech. These objects and actions were named six times during each child's session. Three of the namings were paired directly with the object or action, and three were in comprehension and production probes. A production posttest was then given, in the same form as the production probe. Two types of response, spontaneous productions during the exposure sessions and responses during the posttest, were analyzed. Without exception, in both spontaneous response and posttest  response, the children produced nouns more accurately than verbs, that is, with a higher percentage of correct consonants. This finding suggests an interaction between semantic and phonological domains. Further study of this and other possible language domain interactions is recommended. (MSE)",

Test sentences designed on the basis of two important syntactic aspects in Korean reflexive anaphora--relational hierarchy and backward principle--were presented to the subjects in both neutral and overtly stated topic contexts. The children's identifications of the antecedent were recorded and analyzed. Results indicate that, in general, the topic context had a greater effect on the children's interpretation than did the neutral context, and that the children's sensitivity to the topic contexts increased with age. Unlike previous research results, however, the older  children used context more frequently, but with more selectivity. The children's possible formulation of a hierarchy for referents is also suggested. (MSE)",

Features that correlated with the children's use of the \"-le\" perfective were found to be tied to the child's personal experience of events. Characteristics of the events included pastness, a clear end point, the re-enactment potential, transitivity, and agentivity, in that declining order of statistical occurrence. It is concluded that, in general, young children express their more elaborate time and aspect  distinctions when they are talking about the events that affect them most directly. Personal involvement was found to be a far more powerful trigger for aspect marking than were syntactic or semantic factors. These results are found to parallel results of research on Turkish-speaking children. (MSE)",

        "description":"Two experiments examining adults' use of dimensional adjectives focused specifically on the distinction made between height and overall size as determiners of &quot;bigness.&quot; The subjects in both experiments were college students. In the first, the hypothesis that the meaning of &quot;big&quot; shifts as a function of the object being described was tested. The subjects were asked to judge the size of symmetrical and tall rectangles and line drawings of people. It was predicted that they would be more likely to emphasize height in people but area in rectangles. The results were clear and in accord with the prediction. In the second experiment, subjects were asked to judge either the bigness or the area of figures of people. It was predicted that, if height bias in the first experiment was due to  a perceptual problem, the subjects would answer alike in the two conditions (&quot;big&quot; and &quot;area&quot;). However, if &quot;big&quot; does not refer to area, the subjects would show more of a height bias when judging bigness than when judging area. The results again suggested that the adjective &quot;big&quot; as applied to figures does not refer to overall area. Theories of semantic development must deal with the variability of meanings across contexts. (MSE)",

        "description":"In an examination of the acquisition of the spatial syntax of American Sign Language (ASL), 43 children aged 3-10 years were given a range of comprehension and elicitation tests designed to analyze the subsystems involved in the corrrect use of ASL syntax. The subsystems were nominal establishment, verb agreement, and consistency of reference. The results indicate that the acquisition of ASL spatial syntax includes several stages in the learning process as well as several components learned independently. Although verb agreement with present referents is learned relatively early, complete correct verb agreement with non-present referents is learned relatively late in spite of the intermediate accomplishment of comprehension of abstract loci for non-present referents. It is  suggested that research on other aspects of the acquisition of the spatial syntactic system and the development of nonlinguistic spatial cognition in deaf and hearing children will shed light on the interplay between spatial and language representation in the visual-spatial modality.

Chapter 2 outlines current issues in the design of the syllabus, discusses the question of oral language proficiency, and describes the provisional oral proficiency guidelines pubilshed by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. The chapter also explains the role of grammar and its application to oral proficiency goals, proposes to integrate grammar into a notional-functional syllabus through the use of the computer, and  discusses the adaptation of currently-used textbooks. Chapter 3 explores the process of creating a notional-functional syllabus and investigates the activities that could be used to implement it. The manner in which the material could be ordered is illustrated with a three-level sample syllabus. Activities concerning the integration of grammatical structures are included as well as a discussion of classroom experience. Recommendations based on the discussion and predicted results of those recommendations are presented. (Author/MSE)",

The comprehension approach avoids the teaching of explicit linguistic knowledge, and recreates the supportive and relaxed atmosphere of the native language acquirer, focusing solely on the development of comprehension skills. Traditional language classroom practices are replaced by a highly permissive acceptance of any output. The success of this approach has been linked to the teacher's ability to devise instructional materials that are interesting and appropriate to the learner. Full  productive language ability then develops as an automatic by-product of the development of fluent comprehension processes through exposure to high-quality input that is presented in comprehensible contexts. The success of the comprehension approach is explained by a theory of language processing which makes a clear separation among the components of language ability while emphasizing the ways in which these components interact in the ongoing comprehension, production, and acquisition of language.

The first goal of foreign language and culture teaching is the acquisition of communicative competence in the broadest sense of this expression. Courses offered in foreign language and culture departments should be oriented toward contrastive and comparative analyis of cultures more than they are currently. These departments should see themselves as devoted to intercultural rather than monocultural study. The presentation that seeks to promote admiration for a foreign culture is as detrimental to cultural understanding as is a negative presentation. Awareness, arrived at  through questioning of one's own perception of the other culture, is essential. Students should also be made aware that their own culture has instilled in them patterns of perception. Materials designed broadly, for students of all cultures, should be avoided because they do not aid in explicit cross-cultural comparison. Constant feedback involving the student's native culture supports the process of self-reflection. Application of these principles in one comparative French-American culture course was found to satisfy a previously unexpressed need for a more explicit intercultural approach. (MSE)",

A quasi-experimental design was used to compare two groups of Mexican-American tenth-grade students enrolled in a traditional high school where all subject matter was presented in English. The experimental group (n=86) had previously been taught one or more years in an elementary bilingual education program. The control group (n=90) had had all its schooling in English. The students' seventh-grade and tenth-grade records were examined for these variables: grade point average, absenteeism, grade repetition in elementary and secondary grades, dropout rates at the completion of junior high school, and the completion of tenth  grade. Results revealed no differences in grade point average in either period. The control group had a statistically significant higher rate of absenteeism during two quarters of the seventh-grade year, a significantly higher grade repetition rate at all levels, and a higher frequency of dropouts in both periods studied.

The dependent measure consisted of the number of propositions included in the subjects' written free recall samples. Results indicated significant main effects for both topic (Cold War and Vietnam War) and version (original and revision), with subjects recalling the revised version and the Vietnam passages best. There was also a significant topic by version interaction, with the percentage of total propositions  recalled greatest for the revised Vietnam passages.

The subjects were 10 adolescent (mean age 16.5) and 10 older (mean age 24.5 years) mothers, all lower to middle class, first-time mothers, and Caucasian. Each mother and child pair was videotaped in a laboratory setting--first, in three minutes of face-to-face interaction, second, in a teaching situation, and third, in three minutes of free play. The videotapes were transcribed and coded for structural complexity, length of turn, discourse role of the utterance, and number of utterances. Results from repeated analyses of variance demonstrated main effects for maternal age but no significant interactions between maternal age and situation, with adolescent  mothers less responsive to their infants and using fewer utterances in all situations. Given the importance accorded to maternal contingency in the acquisition process, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that children of adolescent mothers may be at risk for language development.

Four data sources were considered in the first year of evaluation: interviews with people involved and not involved with the program, student scores on teacher-made tests, classroom  observation, and preference surveys. All of these methods are to be used again at various points during the overall evaluation process. Findings about the program's first year include improved listening and use of memory among participants, improved academic achievement and attitudes among learning disabled students, interest among younger and older children, teacher and administrator interest and support, and parent support. Negative effects include loss of learning time, interruption of classes, variable student behavior upon returning from language instruction, and scheduling difficulties. (MSE)",

        "description":"A need exists for a large fund of short, disconnected video materials designed specifically for rapid selective access and for use either in the classroom or the language laboratory, starting at the earliest stages of instruction. A theoretical model for creating these materials could be the language learner in public places in the target culture, communicating, functioning, and satisfying intellectual curiosity. Situations could include signs and ads with obvious or familiar contexts, signs for which the context must be inferred, signs and inscriptions requiring that a context be easily understood, materials that must be read to initiate a conversation, and purely conversational exchanges. In such situations the learner must be able to articulate the message orally in a manner  recognizable to the native speaker. Two competing video technologies are useful--the video cassette recorder (VCR) and the laser videodisc. The VCR allows reading and writing, while the videodisc allows only reading. However the videodisc offers many advantages over VCRs, including greater capacity, precise and instantaneous cuing, and superior freeze-frames. In producing suitable materials for video use, three principles must be kept in mind: discontinuity, brevity, and maximum simplicity of production values. (MSE)",

        "description":"Although listening comprehension has been identified as the first and most important foreign language skill, research has shown that little class time is devoted to developing more than very basic listening skills. Early practice in listening in a foreign language helps to develop both language skills and confidence in communicating in the target language. The objective of instruction for listening comprehension should be to help students overcome the tendency to panic over lost portions of a message and to get the main idea. One way to increase listening effectiveness is to provide students with advance information about what they will be hearing, such as simple introductory statements, background information, key vocabulary, excerpts, and comprehension questions. Class  activities can be geared toward developing listening skills when they are followed by comprehension questions. Some such activities are: presentations by the teacher or guest speakers, an audio-motor unit using a set of taped statements that the teacher and then the students pantomime, and show-and-tell and its variations. Students can also be encouraged to develop their skill by being taught appropriate ways of asking questions, especially when the input begins to become incomprehensible. Because commercially prepared materials accompanying texts do not generally address listening skills, it is the teachers' responsibility to do so. (MSE)",

To deal with texts in a new language, the learner needs extensive exposure to a variety of language in realistic situations. The immediate recall protocol designed for development of reading comprehension can be adapted to help develop second language listening comprehension. The reading technique uses short texts to avoid sensory overload, gives students time to read them, and then allows students time to write, in English, what they understood from the text. For listening skill development, the technique would need to be adapted to a classroom listening situation, and features of  spoken language (voice characteristics, volume, pitch, etc.) that aid considerably in the processing of listening material should be considered. Students should be given advance organizers and a specific listening task to perform, and should hear the tape once without taking notes. The student protocols indicating their comprehension level can be either graded or discussed, and the teacher can use the protocols as a basis for further instructional planning. (MSE)",

Use of inferential skills then becomes the most effective way of learning new vocabulary; it is the way native speakers build their 60,000 word vocabularies. Because the skill is not automatically transferable, it must be systematically taught to students of foreign languages. This task is best accomplished with a good classification scheme for context clues. An improved classification system that uses grammatical as well as semantic clues and that stresses both structural and semantic dimensions has been developed. It consists of four overall categories: direct-explanation, overall-context, trans-sentence, and intra-sentence clues. For each of the last two  categories there are two dimensions, structural and semantic. The scheme can be useful for native English speakers, learners of English, and learners of other foreign languages. Five tables display each category, including definitions, examples, and illustrative sentences. (MSE)",

Students progress individually and in small groups through planned, self-paced, continuous progress programs.

Supporting audiovisual materials are available. Long-term contracts detailing the students' obligations and &quot;compensations&quot; are negotiated each quarter, and short-term contracts concerning homework, speaking and reading exercises, quizzes, tests, and other obligations are negotiated daily or  weekly. The advantages are that students can pursue second languages despite low enrollments, the advanced language levels of all students allow exclusive use of the target language, and students learn from other students at other levels and in another language. These interactions often prompt basic sociolinguistic discussions and third-language enrollments. Administrators like the flexibility of the program, and students and parents like both the approach and the information provided them by the contracts. An important consideration is that the approach requires overt commitment and concentrated skills and effort from the teacher to orchestrate a complex teaching situation. (MSE)",

Its overall goals were to ensure positive foreign language learning experiences for elementary and secondary school students and to sensitize foreign language teachers at all levels of instruction to the need for cooperation. The project's functions in meeting those goals were to: (1) establish communication between curricular (school-based) and extracurricular (community-based) foreign language programs within a community, (2) work for mutual understanding and support of foreign language goals for the various instructional levels within a community,  and (3) develop cooperative efforts in classroom and special program activities on the various instructional levels. Implementation began in one community with a cooperative project, a foreign language week, established by the teachers of an existing secondary school French and Spanish program and an extracurricular, community-wide elementary-school level French, Spanish, and German program. Written and discussion-based evaluations of the project were conducted, and both possibilities and problems in future cooperation were identified. A suggested major change in future programs was the inclusion and cooperation of the school administration. Improved articulation was also strongly recommended. (MSE)",

The administration of the double cloze can be divided into four parts. First, the students listen twice to a reading or recording of the untouched text, and fill in the blank spaces in their text copies. Students are paired so that each student in a pair has a different version of the text. They are given a second handout that outlines phrases for the functions they have learned in class, such as asking for information, clarification, or affirmation. While not allowed to look at each other's papers, the students use the phrases on their handouts to seek information from  their partners, varying the phrases to reflect a variety of speaker/listener relationships suggested by the teacher. It is preferred that students not look at the phrases while speaking them. This exchange can be followed up with group discussion or guided questions. In this activity, teachers are free to provide individualized instruction while students practice, the time spent actively speaking the language is maximized, students are not threatened by the situation, realistic communicative exchange takes place, and students are motivated.

The ratings assigned to the subjects were compared with an expected rating distribution. Results indicated no statistical difference in the ratings across agencies, either for the combined languages or for each language separately. However, ratings in various sub-portions of the proficiency scale showed clear across-agency differences, generally reflecting relatively higher ratings on the  part of FSI raters and, occasionally, wide discrepancies in scoring for individual examinees. Findings also indicated that, despite the feeling that their language proficiency had been adequately probed, a significant number of examinees felt that the FSI procedure was more anxiety-producing than the others and that it used some &quot;unfair&quot; eliciting techniques. It is concluded that, although the study examines only the test-retest comparability of the interviewing process across agencies, there is a need for further research if the procedure is to be used as an inter-agency measure.

Initial analysis of the data suggested several hypotheses concerning the use of mitigation, and quantitative measures were developed and validated. The findings supported the five hypotheses that: (1) requests to superiors are more mitigated; (2) requests are less mitigated in crew-recognized emergencies; (3) requests are less mitigated  in crew-recognized problems; (4) topic-failed speech acts (i.e., those not followed up immediately) are more mitigated; and (5) crew suggestions unratified by the captain are more mitigated.

Formal impact statements can help foundations examine their grant programs by asking a series of questions about: applicants' commitment to ending discrimination; the access of women and girls to the programs and services that will be provided; the inclusion of women as researchers and administrators; the evaluation of program results and of print and other materials for sex bias; the inclusion of women in scholarship, fellowship, and award programs; and evaluation data that yields information about women. The questions can be adapted to assess the impact on other specific groups, such as minorities, and may be useful to  institutions other than foundations that want to assess their own programs. Over 50 questions are provided, including: whether the grantee has a formal policy prohibiting discrimination in employment; whether the grantee periodically reviews the status of women within its organization; whether there is a formal policy prohibiting sex discrimination in programs and services; whether women are included as subjects of research; whether research design and instruments are reviewed for possible bias; and whether women are featured in publicity materials.

Student problems were identified through formal/informal interviews and work with graduate students over a 12-year period. In the first step of choosing a topic, students may be worried that the topic is too broad, narrow, or unimportant. The literature review is sometimes the largest difficulty to be encountered. Some students are unaware of all of the possibilities offered in the library in addition to the card catalog: indexes, microfilm, microfiche, government document sources, and computerized databases. The fewest problems are encountered in synthesis of previous research or collection and analysis of data, because these areas are likely to be included in  a graduate research course. The last step, overall synthesis and the process of summarizing, drawing conclusions, and offering recommendations, is often a difficult one. Problems with writing style and form are common. Approaches to address these problems may include (1) teaching research and research writing skills by incorporating assignments in introductory graduate courses or (2) a mentoring program to bridge the gap between thesis research and research and writing for publication.

High school and college academic performance of athletes were considered, including: high school and college grade point average (GPA), aptitude test scores, a measure of intensity and commitment to athletic participation, and whether the student was on academic probation or left school for academic reasons. No direct relationship was found between gender and university academic performance. However, significant relationships were found between gender and intervening variables, such as  intensity of athletic involvement and athletic scholarship assistance. A number of inequities between men's and women's athletic programs were identified. In particular, scholarships awarded to athletes and program budgets were inequitably distributed.

Attention is directed to measures of performance, the explanations and specific correlates likely to influence high research performance, and the practical implications of empirical studies for faculty development and evaluation. Three common measures of individual research performance are publication counts, citation counts, and peer and colleague ratings. Productivity researchers attempt to explain the variation in faculty research performance by psychological-individual factors, including superior intellectual ability, a strong motivation and drive to  perform, personality traits, and background characteristics. Access to resources and advantages and reinforcements have also been linked to productivity. Additional correlates of productivity have also been investigated: prestige of doctoral program and employing institutions, rank and tenure, early productivity. Numerous correlate studies in the past 40 years have resulted in a profile of productive researchers. In addition to ideas to promote faculty development and evaluation, suggestions for future research of faculty research productivity are offered. Ten pages of references and an index are provided.

Societal changes that influence colleges include a declining birth rate, changing sex roles, and shifts to an information-based society. Notable political trends that affect colleges include accountability requirements, concern for quality, and financial problems. In addition, student services have responded to the needs of nontraditional students (women, minorities, foreigners, older people, the disabled, part-time students, and academically underprepared students). To deal with the various changes, colleges have employed a variety of strategies that have implications for student affairs organizations. New strategies concern: comprehensive planning,  enrollment management, preventive law, resource management, and changing relationships of business and colleges. The student affairs worker can help to integrate both student and institutional needs. In serving as an integrator, the student affairs worker needs to develop skills in management and research, as well as political and organizational skills. College preparation programs for student personnel workers need to provide training for these new roles. Student development theory also faces challenges from changes that are occurring.

A total of 398 two- and four-year colleges and universities responded to the study questionnaire (an 85% response), and the data were statistically adjusted to represent national trends. In response to national reports, two themes were emphasized: the need to measure student learning and to emphasize the competencies that students should gain through their studies. More than 80% of responding  colleges had recently or were currently reviewing the curriculum. Almost all of these reviews focused on mathematical or computer-related skills, writing, or competencies such as communication and reasoning. Increased enrollments were occurring for part-time and older students, as well as commuters and foreign students.

Accurate financial information is need to determine appropriate awards. The analysis revealed: over 97% of VA beneficiaries misreported benefits; the total net loss to the BEOG program due to misreporting of VA benefits was less than $2 million in 1979-1980; the overreporting of VA benefits was the most common problem; no systematic variation in the likelihood of misreporting of VA benefits was found for the different times of year the BEOG application is filed or when comparing the dependent/independent status of applicants; the majority of misreporting applicants actually overreported the level of  benefits they received from the VA program, which caused applicants to qualify for lower levels of BEOG benefits; validation affected misreporting of VA benefits by shifting the type of error from overreporting to underreporting and increasing the loss to the BEOG program due to overpayments to more students; current computer system edits applicable to the VA benefits issue appeared to cause at least a proportion of applicants to shift to overreporting from underreporting VA benefits; and the monthly benefit amount changed at least once annually for 80% of VA recipients. Ten data tables are provided. (SW)",

Information reported on BEOG applicants and IRS income tax returns was compared for various categories of applicants. The study provides information on the impact of major quality control initiatives undertaken by BEOG during the 1978-1979 academic year, preaward validation (PAV), and the revisions to the application processing system edits. BEOG applicant files that were matched with IRS files consist of: 1979-1980 BEOG regular applicants with 1978 IRS file; 1979-1980 BEOG supplemental applicants with 1979 IRS file, and 1978-1979 BEOG quality control study group with 1977 IRS file.  The PAV Study objectives center on assessing the relative efficacy of the validation process and the pre-established criteria for selecting applicants most likely to misreport information. Information is included on the logistics and sampling plans (e.g., selection of the preliminary sample, obtaining parents' social security number, finalizing the sample, IRS data extraction, and merging the IRS and BEOG data).

Generic organization theory provides extensive reasons why participation in organizational decision-making can improve employees' satisfaction and performance. Types of faculty participation in institutional decision-making are separate  jurisdictions, shared authority, and joint participation. Faculty participation can involve curriculum design, faculty personnel status, selection and evaluation of administrators, planning, budgeting, and planning for retrenchment or financial exigency. Joint faculty and administrator efforts may focus on four important areas: rebuilding collegial foundations, shaping the consultative framework, increasing the availability of information, and facilitating group deliberations.

The Debilitating Anxiety Scale was completed by 62 second-year medical students before taking the NBME Examination. Debilitating test anxiety has been described as anxiety that interferes with test performance. Based on their responses to the scale, the students were categorized as either high, moderate, or low test-anxious. Each group included approximately one-third of the participants. Test anxiety was found to be significantly associated with performance on the NBME Part I Examination. The mean Part I score of the low test-anxious group was significantly higher than that of the high and moderate test anxious groups; however, there  was no difference between the latter two groups' scores. The results suggest that there may be varying thresholds related to test anxiety levels. But when the thresholds are reached for students with differing levels of test anxiety, performance differences are likely to be diminished. (Author/SW)",

The self-paced method consisted of a modified Keller Plan (PSI) arrangement in which students progressed through small instructional units at their own pace. The lecture/discussion method consisted of a modified form of the traditional teaching style in which students were exposed to lectures and discussion that covered large units of information, and students proceeded at the instructor's pace. The results revealed little difference in course performance for the two teaching methods, except that the self-paced students performed better on the unit (chapter) tests. No differences were found between the two methods with respect to performance on the final exam, retention  one year later, or average course grade. The results further reveal that the students were more satisfied with the self-paced courses than with the lecture/discussion courses. The evidence suggests that the general evaluation of the two courses favored the self-paced method. It is concluded that the self-paced course is not necessarily a better way to learn, but that students are more satisfied with the self-paced format than with the lecture/discussion style.

        "description":"Academic deans and presidents' perceptions about the state of college governance was studied. A total of 99 higher education institutions were randomly selected from 9 different types of schools, based on the Carnegie classification. In general, academic deans perceived college governance as undergoing transformations. Most deans perceived college governance as being bureaucratic, somewhat collegial, and political to some extent. Some schools, primarily those that were heavily unionized, were clustered around the bureaucratic framework. Presidents perceived academic governance to be rooted in the principles of shared governance. Variations in perceptions were found across institutional categories. Some presidents, mostly from two-year colleges and liberal arts II institutions,  indicated that college governance resembled the bureaucratic model. Overall, research I institutions were mostly associated with the collegial model of organization. Research II universities operated primarily within the bureaucratic and collegial models. While doctorate-granting I institutions were characterized as collegial and bureaucratic, doctorate-granting II were predominantly organized around the bureaucratic model. (SW)",

The research is emphasized so that the findings can inform and advance the ongoing debate and operational decision about this issue. Qualified, but not complete, support is found for the belief that lack of faculty influence in institutional decision-making causes faculty unionization. Other significant variables, such as the institutional context, enter into this equation. The view that faculty bargaining causes significant increase in the faculty's influence in institutional decision-making is not clearly supported, particularly for academic matters at mature universities. The notion that faculty bargaining will bring about  the end of faculty senates is premature. The literature supports the assertion that other collegial governance structures, such as personnel and academic committees, will be either significantly eroded or enhanced. Finally, to the extent that faculty have collectively gained influence in decision-making, it seems that their gains have been generally paralleled by centralization of administrative authority, largely at the expense of deans and department chairs.

The report then focuses on the use of the home microcomputer by children in these families and attempts to determine: (1) the ways in which the children are engaged, if at all, in educational microcomputing, and (2) why their educational microcomputing takes the form(s) it does.  The paper ends with a discussion of the potential future aspects of the relationship between family and school if the use of microcomputers for educational purposes by children at home continues to grow. Additional topics addressed include computer programming as the dominant educational activity and the resistance of family members to the use of professionally prepared educational software.

Methods are presented for providing multiple views of hierarchical structures, overlaying results of a search process on top of static structures to make the strategy visible, and pictorially expressing evidence relations between findings and hypotheses. This work demonstrates the advantages of stating a diagnostic search procedure in a  well-structured, rule-based language separate from domain knowledge.

The target population consisted of a group of learners who are elementary school teachers and teacher assistants involved in the teaching of bilingual (Portuguese/English) children. The methodology selected for instructional  curriculum mapping for each unit of training is a combination of the procedural and hierarchical approaches. This was determined by the nature of the topics of the curriculum, which involved such domains of learning as verbal information, intellectual skills, motor skills, cognitive strategies, and implicit attitudes throughout the curriculum. A needs analysis was the first critical step in identifying the content to be addressed during the short-term computer literacy training.

The first day of hearings concentrated on the EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system developed at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Testimony on the second day considered the proposal of the Federal Maritime  Commission (FMC) to establish an automated tariff filing and information system. To explore potential conflict between the FMC and the private sector, some of the companies offering tariff automation services offered testimony. Other witnesses at the hearing represented three agencies that have developed electronic dissemination systems for press releases and other agency data--the Census Bureau, Food and Drug Administration, and Department of Agriculture. The final day of hearings focused on the National Library of Medicine's Medlars system and on the trademark automation activities of the Patent and Trademark Office.

        "author":["Anglin, Gary J."],
        "description":"This study investigated the possible contribution of pictures serving a representation function to the recall and retention of information presented in written prose passages. The primary variable considered was the durability of picture effects; a second variable concerned the potential effect the presence of pictures had on the recall of information that was not pictured. Thirty graduate students from a southeastern university were randomly assigned to one of two groups--prose-plus-picture (N=16), and prose-only (N=14). In the prose-plus-picture group, subjects read the prose passage and viewed a representational picture (line drawing). In the prose-only group, the participants read the prose passage without the relevant picture. Participants were tested in a group format; when  a subject completed reading one passage, a 10-item test for that passage was administered; the same procedure was used for two subsequent passages. Fifty-five days later the subjects were tested again without rereading the stimulus material. Results indicated that subjects' average recall in the prose-plus-picture was 11%-15% higher than that of subjects in the prose-only condition. Although the presence of pictures moderately facilitated the recall of information which was presented only in the prose passage for the immediate testing condition, this facilitation was not significantly greater for the prose-plus-picture condition. In addition, the presence of pictures neither facilitated nor hindered recall of information which was presented only in the prose passage. A nine-item list of  references, one data table, and a sample illustration complete the document. (JB)",

        "description":"A brief discussion of three phases in research on instructional films--whether films can teach (approximately 1910-1950), how films teach (1940 through the late 1950s), and who learns from films (1960-1985)--introduces a review of the research literature on the third phase. The experimental studies reviewed focus on three concerns: (1) use of films to teach higher level cognitive skills; (2) effects of film viewing on individual learning; and (3) effects of film viewing on students' self-concepts. The following conclusions were drawn from the literature review: films are effective in teaching students the skills of inquiry learning, discovery, and problem-solving; unstructured films generate more relevant questions and hypotheses in problem-solving activities than structured  films; films are particularly effective in teaching observation skills and in training students to attend to important details; high-aptitude students tend to benefit less from visual cues in films than low-aptitude students; films tend to be more effective with field independent students who are left brain dominant, independent, active, and high in personal responsibility; films can have a positive influence on students' self-concepts; and at least one study found sex role stereotyping in films for young children. Implications of these findings for teachers are indicated for each conclusion, and a 34-item reference list is provided. (JB)",

        "description":"The Sales and Marketing Education organization of AT&amp;T Communications conducts ongoing research to monitor the impact of their National Teletraining Network (NTN) programs for professional sales personnel on: (1) learning, (2) student acceptance of courses and instructors, and (3) student willingness to take additional teletrained programs. During 1984, comparisons were made between face-to-face courses and a teletrained delivery mode; no significant differences were found at the .05 level of significance between the two methods in either the course relevance and design or the quality of instruction categories. A short questionnaire was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the teletraining programs; 91.6% of the students who responded indicated they would participate in future  teletraining courses. Cost benefit analysis substantiates the fact that teletraining is a cost-effective alternative to face-to-face delivery of training. Additional benefits include: the ability of the medium to reach remote, low density areas; the ability to add multiple locations to a training session; the flexibility to increase the number of students who can be reached at one time; the ability to quickly disseminate information to an entire sales force; and the ability to share limited instructor resources. It is pointed out that without the NTN, much of the current update training would not be attempted due to various constraints, e.g., the high cost of travel and travel time. Two data tables and two graphs are provided. (JB)",

        "author":["Dalton, David W."],
        "description":"This comparison of the effects of LOGO use with the use of teacher-directed problem-solving instruction, and with conventional mathematics instruction, focused on the problem-solving ability, basic skills achievement, and attitudes of junior high school learners. Students (N=97) in five seventh grade mathematics classes were systematically assigned to three treatments: a problem-solving strategies instructional treatment that used printed worksheets, a structured LOGO treatment, and a control group. Learners were then assessed on their achievement, attitudes, and higher-level thinking skills using the Program Criterion Reference Test (PCRT), the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, the Revised Math Attitude Scale, the School Attitude Measure (SAM), the Test of Cognitive Skills  (TCS), and the Test of Non-Routine Problem-Solving Skills. Results indicated that: (1) neither the LOGO group nor the problem-solving strategies group demonstrated any improvement in basic skills achievement as the result of the experimental intervention; (2) the problem-solving group scored significantly higher than the other two groups on both measures of problem-solving skills; and (3) while learners in the LOGO and problem-solving groups scored significantly higher than their counterparts in the control group in the Revised Math Attitude Scale, this can be, in part, attributable to a novelty effect. It is noted that the problem-solving skills fostered through LOGO use may not transfer outside the context of LOGO, since LOGO provides only a single algorithm which may not apply to many  types of non-routine problems. A list of references, one graph, and 12 data tables are appended. (JB)",

At the conclusion of a lesson on general shop safety rules, students were given a print-based posttest and a survey to assess their attitudes toward the instruction. Analysis consisted of a completely crossed 3X2X2 treatment by achievement by sex factorial design, featuring three levels of prior achievement (high, average, and low). The means for the treatment groups on the performance measure were 64.98%,  73.54%, and 70.48% for the video, CAI, and interactive video treatments respectively; attitude scale means measured 75.07%, 74.26%, and 82.87%. Results indicate that CAI alone tends to be the most effective instructional delivery system where the additional capabilities provided by interactive video are not required. However, interactive video instruction did produce significant improvements in the attitudes of low ability learners when compared with CAI and video. A list of references is provided. (JB)",

Based on results of a writing pretest, 80 seventh grade students were designated as relatively high or low in prior writing achievement and assigned to one of two groups: a word processing treatment and a conventional writing process treatment. Students in each treatment produced two weekly writing assignments and four major papers over the course of one year. At the conclusion of the study, each was given a standardized writing test which was evaluated for structure and organization, correct use of the parts of speech, punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. Analysis consisted of a 2X2 completely crossed treatment by achievement factorial design, featuring two levels  of treatment and two levels of prior achievement. Results indicate that relatively low achieving learners scored significantly better when using the word processing treatment than low learners in the conventional treatment; however, word processing was not effective for the relatively high ability students. Lack of this efficacy is attributable to two reported factors: difficulty in keyboarding and problems in accessing the microcomputers. Future research on keyboarding skills, varied hardware configurations, and pre-writing and editing activities are suggested. A list of references, two data tables, and two figures are provided.

Students were also provided with an 11-page description of the program, which included instructions for its operation, and informed that use of the bulletin board was voluntary. Data were collected at the end of the quarter via two methods: a consent form, signed by each student, which clearly  explained the study's intentions; and the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ) developed by Hall, George, and Rutherford (1979). Analysis of the data indicates that only half the students signed on the bulletin board during the fall quarter; however, most students were preparing for their preliminary oral and written examinations and viewed the bulletin board as adjunctive or unnecessary at that moment. Students reported a variety of problems encountered in using the bulletin board, but most indicated it should be continued and stated that they expected to use it more frequently during the next quarter.

Participants were 50 university undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory educational psychology class. All students received the same treatment--four sections of computer-based instruction designed to require learners to sort among numerous facts and concepts. Following each section, students were asked to rate their level of understanding of both the factual and the inferential materials. They then answered eight short-answer embedded questions--four factual and four inferential. Factual questions were divided into three levels of specificity and detail;  inferential questions were divided into intraframe and interframes inferences. A posttest of 32 items was also administered; half of the questions were repeated from the lesson and half were new items. Regression procedures were conducted to determine the predictive value of enroute self-assessments for corresponding factual and inferential learning. Enroute ratings were used to predict student performance on embedded and posttest questions, as well as to examine the relationship among ratings for facts or inferences. Little or no correlation was found between the ratings of understanding and subsequent performance on either the embedded questions or the posttest, suggesting that learners may not be good judges of their enroute comprehension.

The variables include: heading location (embedded or isolated); line length (short or long); space between lines (single or double); paragraph indication (indented or spaced); use of running heads (present or absent); and directive cues (present or absent). Sixty-four computer text types were designed using all possible combinations of the six bivariate text format variables. The text items were distributed to 31 undergraduate students, who sorted them into seven normally distributed categories (Q-sort procedure) based on their perceived study-ability. Data from the Q-sort were analyzed via a six-way repeated measures analysis of  variance, and two significant five-way interactions were found. Results suggest several text design considerations: (1) the presence of a running head was preferred, and its interaction with the other variables usually served to improve the study-ability rating of the text type; (2) the presence of a directive cue is also a preferred design condition; (3) while double spaced text was preferred, a single spaced text with running head and/or directive cue would be preferred over a double spaced version without these variables; (4) the location of headings had the greatest effect on the ratings, although this effect was unpredictable; and (5) line length did not appear to be a significant factor for study-ability, though short lines were preferred.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of behavioral and cognitive organizing strategies and varied processing intervals on factual and inferential learning. A total of 49 upper-division undergraduate and graduate students, who were randomly assigned to either a cognitive, behavioral, or individual orienting strategy group, received computer-assisted instruction (CAI) with either 10 or 30 seconds of access time to branch to lesson segments. Presented at identical locations throughout the lesson, orienting strategies addressed criterion information either explicitly or in more general abstract terms. Upon completion of the lesson, students were administered a posttest measuring both factual and inferential learning. Results indicate that the explicitness of the  orienting strategy did not affect the learning of either facts or inferences differentially; however, a marginal effect was found for access time, with students performing better with 30 seconds. The results suggest that differences in orienting strategies may not be as important as sufficient time for strategy utilization. A list of references, two data tables, and two figures are included.

        "description":"This study was conducted to field-test collection mapping as an evaluation technique, to determine collection standards against which individual schools could compare themselves, and to compare the collections in schools to nationally-recommended lists published by Brodart and Wilson. Questionnaires were sent to 120 library media specialists in elementary, junior high, and high schools in 11 states. A total of 68 (37 elementary, 10 junior high, and 21 high schools) respondents provided sufficient data to be included. Survey areas included grade levels and number of students, total number of library media materials (categorized by Dewey Decimal System), and number of materials in both general and specific emphasis areas. Analysis of the data indicates that: (1) the average  collection size ranged from 8,372 for elementary schools to 18,306 in high schools; (2) the greatest number of elementary schools (14) were in the range of 16 to 23.9 items per student as compared with the national recommended standard of 40 items per student; (3) 431 emphasis collections covering 134 discrete topics were identified; and (4) collections related to social science, reading, and literature predominated. Findings also indicate that school library media specialists build different collections from those recommended by national lists, and it is recommended that these lists be re-examined in light of current school curriculums. It is concluded that collection mapping is a viable and effective technique for collection analysis and management. Examples of collection maps and  charts generated by a computer program written for this project in BASIC and a list of references are provided. (JB)",

Topics investigated included: (1) basic descriptions of institutions housing noncommercial radio stations; (2) operating budgets; (3) station organization and personnel; (4) station operating hours; (5) station programming; and (6) station philosophies. A survey was sent to 670 college and university stations throughout the United States; 268 were returned for a response rate of 40%. Of these, 243 (90.75%) were completed adequately, including 51 National Public Radio-affiliate (NPR) responses. Findings indicate that stations receive financing from a  combination of sources--general college funds, student funds, departmental or school funds, and other sources such as underwriters. A wide range of operating budgets was reported; from $600 to $1.5 million per year, with the average NPR budget at $345,000 per year. Of 239 stations reporting, 197 (45%) reported having full-time technicians versus 132 (55%) which had some type of part-time technical help; 88% of the NPR stations had full-time technicians compared with 33% for the non-NPR stations. NPR stations operate 364 days/year while non-NPR stations reflect the academic calendar, often closing down during summers and vacations. Programming is not standardized. While 179 (78%) indicated a specific sound or format, they covered the range of music from jazz to AOR (album oriented rock) to  free form to fine arts. NPR stations broadcast more news and public affairs-oriented programming and tend to play classical music and jazz.

The questionnaire requested information concerning demographics, funding, organization and structure, personnel, operation, programming, and philosophy or mission. A question to identify National Public Radio (NPR) affiliates was included to isolate and develop this subcategory. Findings are derived from 243 completed questionnaires (36.3% response rate); NPR responses equaled 51, representing 7.91% of the total population and 21% of the returned replies. Three noncommercial groups were identified-NPR affiliates, large non-NPR affiliates (over 10 watts),  and small non-NPR affiliates (10 watts or under). Results indicate: (1) a majority of stations are expected to carry out fully functional operations on a small financial base; (2) NPR stations have superior budgetary bases as compared to other demographic groups; (3) non-NPR affiliate stations have inadequate technical support; (4) station format varies widely by group and institutional expectations; (5) programming covers the full range of sound, from classical to jazz to rock; and (6) the station philosophy varies depending upon station market thrust and selected format.

        "description":"While individualized learning strategies typically provide large amounts of instructional support, they also reply heavily on learner judgement to determine the amount of support required to achieve an objective. Frequently, these strategies result in high achievers selecting too much support and low achievers selecting too little. Interest in this problem led to the development of the Memphis State Regression Model, which systematically selects the amount of instructional support the learner needs. Three adaptive versions of the model were evaluated: (1) quantity of instructional support and incentives; (2) meaningfulness of problem-solving contexts; and (3) density of narrative text. The first study consisted of five treatment groups: individual prescriptions generated by the  model, prescriptions based on ability, low or high levels of instructional support, and nonadaptively-varied instructional support. Results indicated that the adaptive group performed significantly better than any of the other treatments. The second model was evaluated via three studies which adapted problem contexts to the learner's interest. Results indicated that the context-specific groups performed significantly better in all three studies. The third study focused on the application of this model in a self-instructional unit covering 10 algebraic rules taught in an introductory college statistics course. Three versions of instruction were developed and administered to students via print or computer presentation--low, high, or learner control of narrative density. Learners in the  computer model took more time with both the high- and low-density treatments; subjects in the computer mode of the learner controlled treatment also selected the high-density narrative more often, suggesting that they had less confidence when learning from information presented via a CRT screen. A list of references and a flow chart of the model are provided. (JB)",

Data were collected via student pre- and posttests, student and teacher surveys, observation of teachers, and interviews with administrators concerning their level of satisfaction with the project. Results indicate that: (1) students  enrolled in courses over the interactive system perform almost as well as students enrolled in the same class taught in the traditional setting; (2) students reacted positively to the system; (3) the biggest problem with the interactive system is that it does not allow students to get to know classmates from the other schools; (4) the biggest obstacle to the teaching/learning process was &quot;downtime&quot;; (5) 80.1% of the students surveyed rated the system average to excellent; and (6) all project goals were met, and in some cases, surpassed.

In October 1985, Training Magazine surveyed thousands of training professionals responsible for instructional development in business and industry. Results indicate that, although half of respondents did employ some method of writing objectives and conducting evaluation, the percentages of affirmative answers to the following questions were for: (1) write objectives in behavioral terms (60%); (2) assess entry level skills and knowledge (64%); (3) base media and method decisions on objectives (78%); (4) test programs as they are  developed (65%); (5) evaluate the effectiveness of programs (65%); and (6) use feedback and test performance to revise (87%). Seventeen percent agreed with the statement &quot;Our organization is too small to justify the processes and procedures implied by the above items,&quot; and 29% said yes to &quot;Our management would never stand still for the time necessary to follow the processes and procedures implied by the above items.&quot; Results also indicate that only 27% of respondents reported using computer-based training or instruction, and just under 12% reported hooking a computer to a video or videodisc player to deliver training.

The first report details the approach and methods used in the study and the results obtained; it draws no conclusions and presents no implications. The methodology used was the Sense-Making Approach, which assesses information needs of the intended clientele of information  systems by looking at individuals' opinions and attitudes in the context of their lives independent of those systems. The second report sets the study in the context of larger societal and professional purposes and relates the study approach and results to these purposes. Findings are organized around 10 major conclusions, and related implications and applications are discussed. The major conclusions relate to: unsatisfied information needs; need for more emphasis on the human dimensions of information use in serving citizens; effect of socioeconomic status on information needs and equity issues; need for less emphasis on demography and more emphasis on sense-making patterns in organizing information services; ongoing information needs assessment by information providers; the need for  more emphasis on the human aspects of information use in difficult situations; the need for information linkages and networks; adolescent information needs; the need to use professionally accepted entry points when addressing everyday information needs; and the lack of inherent barriers between Californians and their potential library use.

Designed to put self-help tools into the hands of library staff responsible for developing plans and procedures for preserving library materials, the PPP self-study is divided into three distinct but interrelated phases. The initial phase included the first of three site visits to CSUL by ARL/OMS staff and resulted in an interim report documenting the institutional setting, previous preservation activities, external factors affecting preservation, and planning assumptions. The data-gathering phase required the creation of three investigative forces  averaging six members each. Task forces investigated three areas: physical condition of the collection; environmental conditions of the buildings; and the organizational/communication preservation aspects of the CSUL system. The final phase consisted of synthesizing the three task force reports, determining the ultimate format of the final report, and preparing the study team's recommendations and timetable for phase implementation. This report begins with a discussion of the background of the institution and the external factors related to the current preservation situation. The report than details the specific concerns and interests of Colorado State University. In a final section, the library's implementation plans are presented. The document includes reports on: library  administration; physical condition of the collection; environmental conditions within the libraries; preservation education; and disaster preparedness.

        "description":"This final report is a product of a Preservation Planning Program (PPP) self-study conducted by the State University of New York (SUNY), Stony Brook, working with the Association of Research Libraries' (ARL) Office of Management Studies (OMS). The PPP is designed to put self-help tools into the hands of library staff responsible for developing plans and procedures for preserving library materials. A study team first conducted a background study to acquire an overview of the factors in the library that related to preservation. The study team appointed task forces of both staff from throughout the university libraries and some key personnel from non-library areas, and charged them with collecting and analyzing data in order to assess: (1) the effect of the present state of  environmental conditions on the preservation of library materials; (2) patterns in the physical condition of the collections; (3) strengths and weaknesses of preservation resources currently available to the Library; (4) the vulnerability of the collections to physical disasters; and (5) the strengths and weaknesses of the current library preservation activities and their administration and organization. In addition to summaries of the task force reports, this document contains task force membership lists; background information on the study; and discussions of libraries in their institutional setting, external factors affecting preservation, and identifying the problems at Stony Brook. Recommendations are offered in the following areas: physical housing, shelving, and support systems;  preservation, replacement and reproduction decision making; physical treatment; internal and external organization; and staff and user education. A brief implementation plan concludes the report. (THC)",

        "description":"Part of the Communications Design Center's (CDC) on-going research on communication and document design, this report emphasizes the importance of a multi-level computer help system that goes beyond simple command descriptions to include assistance with goals and strategies within the application domain--in this case, automated authoring. The help system should be dynamic to at least some degree, basing its presentation of help options on the user's current activity. It is also suggested that an adequate help system would include both a mechanism for controlling the amount of information presented on a help request and an interactive facility to allow users to try out different features in a procedural fashion. Finally, the textual information contained in the help database must  be carefully designed and structured to make the necessary assistance both accessible and understandable for maximum user efficiency. An introductory discussion of computer-based instruction (CBI) is followed by five sections: Defining the Audience; Prototype Help Systems; Factors in the Design of Help (Dynamism and Access); Information Requirements (Level of Explanation, Amount of Information Presented, Level of Detail, Categories of Information, and Tutorials); and An Evaluation of a Help System.

In an attempt to identify factors in the design and development process that may be contributing to such deficiencies, this project studied five publication houses, four of which produced DOD technical manuals. Writers, managers, and illustrators were interviewed at each site to obtain information on the work flow in developing a manual; the use of specifications; the validation and verification process; and the skills and duties of writers, illustrators, and government representatives. This report presents an introductory review of the literature; a description of  the research methodology; and discussions of the findings on specification use and deficiencies, cost of inadequate/inappropriate specifications, relative effort in the workflow, the government's technical manual representative, writers and their qualifications and training, writers' job duties, source materials, degree of automation, comprehensiveness, illustrations, quality assurance, validation, and verification. A final discussion of the study results and their implications, a list of 29 references, and a flow chart of a typical technical information development process conclude the report. (THC)",

While there is no single database designed to cover the field of communications, there are several databases which include material that is of interest to investigators in the field. An experiment was performed to determine which databases would be most useful to communications scholars. Topics representing the dominant paradigms of the discipline were searched on the 11 databases selected as most likely to provide strong coverage of the communications literature. Among the topics chosen were: audience behavior, communications theory, media content, the relationship between mass media and the state, and the economics of the communications industry. Information on those topics and the results  obtained are compared. The most useful databases are described in terms of the types of communications research being reported in the literature. Lists of the most important databases for communications research and online vendors are included.

Emphasis is placed on knowledge gained via degrees in library science and the applicability of additional graduate degrees for academic librarians. Directors' responses to the questionnaire accounted for 1,378 full-time academic librarians in the region. The survey revealed that slightly more than 34% of the librarians held graduate degrees in addition to the master's degree in library science. Comparison with a 1978 study shows an increase in southeastern academic librarians' educational credentials. The report concentrates on  the acceptability and significance of earning additional degrees, including the influence level of additional graduate degrees on hiring decisions, hiring at the administrative level, determining salary at the time of hiring, and determining periodic salary increases.

        "description":"The approaching information age will encompass a different societal system in the 21st century due to the impact of the information revolution resulting from developments in computer and communications technology. In light of these changes, libraries need to evolve with the new technology by preparing now to become part of the electronic revolution. Librarians must become familiar with all aspects of the communication cycle and its relationship with the organizations and communities to be served; they need to educate themselves about future scenarios relating to employment, education, energy, leisure, communications, etc., and the impact of changes on the role of the library; and they need to know the changing human needs of the information society, and how these needs will  effect changes in characteristics of the library system. In the future, emphasis on a customized approach to designing information delivery systems will be the norm. Finally, librarians may assume numerous roles, including: initiator of the transformation of the library system; promoter of the library system; personal guides, information consultants, and information synthesizers of the electronic services and sources; interpreters of information; facilitators or linkers of information networks; freelance specialists; and group practitioners. Libraries should act as centers where users can receive instruction in the uses of new communications technology, assistance in exploiting various databases, and important communication information services.

Colleges surveyed were private, Middle States accredited institutions designated as II A (diverse post-baccalaureate programs, but no significant doctorate level programs) and II B (baccalaureate institutions) according to the American Association of University Professors' rating scale. The questionnaire was a modified version of the Council of Independent Colleges' Library Cost and Services  Module, Data Collection Instrument. Usable responses were received from 35 colleges (58%), including both colleges with national reputations and less prestigious colleges with limited resources.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether increased test-taking time on a college-level achievement test would differentially increase scores for selected subgroups of community college sophomores. The study sample consisted of 181 Miami-Dade Community College (MDCC) students who were classified on the basis of native language, ethnic group, and sex. An analog of the College-Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) was developed according to CLAST specifications and administered to the subjects. For each group, three time-limit conditions were examined; i.e., 70 minutes, 75 minutes, and 80 minutes. The findings clearly indicated that increased time limits did not result in statistically significant increases in test scores for any of the groups examined. Based on study findings, it  was concluded that the analog instrument was functioning as a power test and that increased time limits would probably not result in higher test scores on the CLAST.

        "description":"In March 1984, immediately following the adminstration of the College-Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST), Miami-Dade Community College (MDCC) conducted a student survey in an effort to evaluate the educational reforms implemented at the college. The survey, which was completed by 918 CLAST examinees, focused on students' appraisal of the general educational experience, educational demands expected of students, instructional effectiveness, students' reaction to the CLAST, and student comments regarding various aspects of instruction and advising at MDCC. Analyses were conducted comparing results with those of a similar survey conducted in October 1983 and comparing responses among major ethnic groups. Study findings included the following: (1) approximately 75% of those surveyed  responded positively to the items appraising educational experience; (2) 72.7% of the students indicated that course objectives were made clear by the instructors at the beginning of the term most of the time or always; (3) 62.1% agreed or strongly agreed that the quality of instruction in their classes was very good to excellent; (4) 33.1% of the White respondents, 17.2% of the Black respondents, and 23.7 of the Hispanic respondents had never seen their advisor; (5) 66.2% of the students felt prepared for the CLAST reading subtest, 69.5% for the writing subtest, 52.7% for the computation subtest, and 66.0% for the essay test.

The October 1983 and March 1984 administrations of the CLAST were analyzed to determine whether one ethnic group was consistently obtaining lower reliability estimates than other groups, the accuracy of each subtest in student placement, standard error, and subtest reliability. Study findings included the following: (1) the computation portion of the CLAST had the highest reliability, while the writing subtest had the lowest reliability; (2) the scores of Hispanics and Black non-Hispanics usually had the lowest reliabilities of  any sub-group; (3) the size of the standard error of measurement around the cut score was somewhat higher than the traditional standard errors of measurement previously reported, indicating that students who fell below the cut score by 10-20 scale score points should be encouraged to retake the test.

All students who took the summer and fall 1984 administrations of the CLAST were included in the study. Original passing rates were recalculated based on three test-taking strategies serving as possible alternatives to skipping test items. Study findings included the following: (1) students were most likely to skip items on the reading test, with Black students more likely than Whites or Hispanics to skip at least one item in all three test areas; (2) most students responded to all test items; (3) for all students taking the test, the number of items  skipped averaged less than one; (4) both Whites and Blacks had a significantly higher mean number of skipped items in computation than Hispanics; and (5) the recalculation of passing rates to reflect instruction in test-taking skills showed that the reading passing rates would be affected by only a small amount; that the writing passing rate would have been affected only during the fall 1984 administration; and that the passing rate for computation would be affected least of all. Based on study findings, it was concluded that if efforts to improve students' test-taking strategies were initiated, activities should focus on the area of writing. (LAL)",

The study revealed that: (1) grades in the English sequence were related to CLAST performance, with higher grades being associated with higher passing rates; (2) students with the same grade in the same course had different passing rates depending on the campus location of the course; (3) generally only students with grades of &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; in English courses had higher passing rates than students who had not taken the course; and (4) increasing the number of  English courses required of students was associated with higher passing rates only for those students who entered MDCC with basic skills that fell below the cut in both reading and writing.

Study results included the following: (1) students with cumulative GPA's of 3.0 or better had passing rates of 90% or higher on each area of the CLAST except the essay; (2) as cumulative GPA decreased, so did passing rates and the proportion of students passing all four parts of the CLAST; (3) for students with GPA's of 3.5 or better, the only section of the CLAST that kept 10% from an Associate in Arts degree was  the essay; (4) students with GPA's lower than 3.0 had less than a 70% chance of passing all four test sections; and (5) for students taking the CLAST in fall 1984, correlations between GPA and CLAST scores ranged from a collegewide high of .48 for GPA and computation to a low of .34 for GPA and the essay. Based on study findings, it was concluded that cumulative GPA can predict CLAST performance although attainment of a GPA of 2.0 or better was not a sufficient indicator of basic skills competence as measured by CLAST.

Study highlights included the following: (1) in spite of significant declines in both unduplicated enrollment and total class enrollment between fall 1983 and fall 1984, the rates of successful retention and total retention increased districtwide by 1.4% and 2.3%, respectively; (2) districtwide retention rates for fall 1984 were 70.5% for successful retention and 81.2% for total retention; (3) all five colleges in the  district had similar retention rates and all made improvements between 1983 and 1984; (4) the business disciplines continued to have the lowest districtwide successful retention rate at 51.5%; (5) business disciplines' successful retention rate increased by 1.2% and total retention rate increased 2.3%; and (6) grade distribution remained virtually unchanged between fall 1983 and fall 1984.

        "description":"Meeting together as a family group for discussion and/or activities is the best way of establishing and maintaining a system of free-flowing, snag-proof family communication. Once a family starts meeting together, a sense of purpose and direction is needed. Adherence to four concepts becomes important: dialogue democracy, reasoned revealing, pressureless persuasion, and self solving. When dialogue is democratic, when there is self-revealing without ulterior motives, when persuasiveness never includes pressure tactics, and when people are allowed and encouraged to make decisions and to solve problems through their own initiative, many benefits are attained. Putting these concepts into practice during regular family conferencing keeps communication flowing, is an effective means of  preventing and solving problems, and promotes the attainment of familyhood. In almost every type of situation, family conferencing is more efficient and more effective than other forms of dialogue, such as conversations sandwiched in at mealtimes, during television viewing, while riding in the car, or when passing through the hallway. Children raised with the spirit of familyhood tend to become socially adaptable, expressive, emotionally resilient, intellectually curious, creative, self-motivated, and self-responsible. Parents who meet regularly with their youngsters and experience the dynamic flow of ideas and feelings need never worry about being labeled as &quot;uncaring.&quot; (RH)",

Discussion focuses on John Anderson's unitary model of cognition (1983), learning-to-learn, the nature of traditional curriculum content, thinking skills such as storage and retrieval, matching, and execution, and basic beliefs, or epistemic thoughts, which control broad categories of human behavior. The major implication of the model is that the present conceptualization of the acts of teaching and learning should be expanded far beyond the domain of content area knowledge. Specifically, the components of the teaching/learning process should include (1) learning-to-learn strategies, (2) a new approach to content  which emphasizes basic concepts and organizational patterns of declarative knowledge and the developmental nature of procedural knowledge, (3) basic reasoning skills in the areas of storage and retrieval, matching, and execution, and (4) basic beliefs which are high level controlling principles. These beliefs include the notion that perceptions are subjective and generated from a specific point of view and that one's point of view is controllable and can be changed.

Participating were 19 primary, 32 upper elementary, 10 junior high, and 16 senior high school teachers at four sites varying in size and locale. Providing a framework for teaching a wide range of thinking skills within content area classrooms, the thinking skills model includes three general categories of cognitive skills considered relevant to academic success: (1) learning-to-learn skills, (2) content thinking skills, and (3) basic reasoning skills. Altogether, 18 skills areas are included in the model. Each is hypothesized to affect different student behaviors and to be associated with a particular rationale for the  hypothesized effect; each was assessed with different measures within either one-shot case study or pretest-posttest designs. Trained in four spaced sessions, the 77 participating teachers pilot-tested the thinking skills techniques on over 1,900 students. Data were obtained through teacher-made tests, interviews with students, and observations of students by teachers. Results are reported for each skill area of the model: attention control, goal setting, attitude change, self-evaluation, concept attainment, pattern recognition, synthesizing, proceduralizing, deep processing, use of memory frameworks, categorizing, extrapolation, analogical reasoning, evaluation of evidence, evaluation of value, elaboration, problem solving, and invention.

After a summary of research supporting the need for mental health services for this population, some findings and their implications are presented from the discretionary grant that provides comprehensive mental health services to Head Start children and their families. Historically, Head Start has placed far less emphasis on the mental health component of the program than on other components. It is argued that neglecting the mental health needs  of those children and families who would benefit from professional assistance jeopardizes the gains made by the Head Start program. Finally, the testimony urges a commitment to mental health to accomplish the primary goal of Head Start and the promotion of social competence of children and families, and concludes that targeting of mental health funds within Head Start with emphases on prevention, early identification, and rehabilitation is vital.

The situations were: (1) having a person as a houseguest for a week; (2) renting a room to someone; (3) having a person live in the adjacent apartment; (4) having dinner in a nice restaurant with another person sitting nearby; and (5) sitting next to a person on an airplane flying non-stop from Washington, D.C. to San Francisco. Two forms of the SAS-A/C were used. Whereas the control form did not designate the ages of the participants in the situation, the experimental form indicated ages by including a  child or children under the age of 7 years. Findings indicated that students tended to react more negatively to the situations when children under the age of seven were included. Few differences by sex or the social distance involved in the situations were found. Implications for the education and development of young adults and the ways in which they may acquire prejudiced attitudes toward young children are discussed.

A total of 19 sibling pairs were videotaped as they viewed one of two television programs. The younger child in all of the pairs was in first or second grade. Fourteen of the older siblings were more than 3 years older, and five were 1 or 2 years older than their younger siblings. All of the children saw a &quot;Fat Albert&quot; cartoon and an episode of the situation comedy &quot;One Day at a Time.&quot; Results indicate that young children who viewed the age appropriate program with a sibling with whom they were unfriendly were better able to interpret that program than were young children who were friendly with their  siblings. For the adult program, however, both children from the companionable pairs scored about equally, while those young children from the unfriendly pairs scored quite a bit lower than their older siblings. The disparity of the unfriendly siblings' scores suggests that they interpreted the program independently of one another, whereas the equality of the friendly siblings' scores indicated that the younger sibling may have benefitted from viewing with the older sibling. Three pages of references conclude the document. (RH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to clarify and empirically examine the role played by a toddler's self comforting skill in facilitating the separation-individuation process. On the basis of psychoanalytic ideas and empirical findings it was predicted that self comforting would be positively related to both secure attachment and self awareness. It was also predicted that the mother's fostering of independence would predict secure attachment. A total of 19 toddlers and their mothers participated in the study. Children ranged in age from 64 to 95 weeks. Data were collected in interviews, a structured play session, a stress diary, and in a 5-minute session modeled on the Ainsworth procedure, but abbreviated to minimize stress and concentrate on relevant ratings. Correlational findings  did not support the former predictions, but did confirm the latter. Discussion explores the possibility that the mother's style of comforting her fearful toddler may determine the way in which self comforting and self awareness connect for the toddler. (Author/RH)",

Descriptive data were collected on children's own views about emotion management in interpersonal conflict scenarios and in general hypothetical situations. All of the child variables provide information about children's preinteraction expectancies from the standpoint of emotion management. Developmental differentiation in the children's data was examined by coding three qualitative variables according to ordinal ranks of complexity. Remaining variables were coded according to nominal categories. Specific category variables studied were (1) justification for emotion management in hypothetical conflict scenarios, (2)  interpersonal consequences for emotion management, (3) preference for either peers or adults as targets for genuine displays of emotion, and rationale for preference, and (4) a rationale for an adaptive &quot;balance&quot; in showing or not showing one's genuine feelings to another. Instruments used to collect data included the newly-developed Parent Attitude toward Children's Expressiveness Scale, Snyder's Self-Monitoring Scale (1974), and Moos' Family Environment Scale (1974). A total of 32 children in three groups with mean ages of 7.9, 10.8, and 13.8 years and 52 of their parents participated. (RH)",

Panel 2 documented the need for parental leave policies. Specifically, this panel discussed experiences parents go through as they prepare for a new baby and  assume responsibility for his or her care; phases in the development of the young child and the new parent; the interaction between infants and parents; and the needs of adoptive parents and their children and of families confronting the serious illness of a child.

In contrast to research indicating that administrative preparation in graduate courses is of little value, findings indicate that principals generally feel adequately prepared for most role activities. This perception of preparation is highly correlated with their perceptions of role difficulty. Many perceptions were found to differ according to background variables. (RH)",

After pilot observations had been carried out for 3 hours at each of 20 preschool and day care centers, detailed observations were made at a single site, four hours per day, twice a week, from late fall to mid-spring. The 37 children under observation ranged in age from 28 to 48 months. In the main study, 290 crying episodes were recorded at the rate of 2.1 per hour. Observations were coded in terms of causes of crying, peer responses to crying, teacher responses to crying, and context. Each child was rated on sibling status, length of time at the center, number of friends, and verbal clarity and fluency. Findings indicate that crying was an  infrequent phenomenon that was responded to infrequently by peers. Responding to crying behavior over two-thirds of the time, teachers were much more likely to console a crying girl than a crying boy and tended to respond more critically to a boy crier than to a girl crier. When they responded, children responded like their teachers. Two-thirds of crying episodes were peer-related; positive, prosocial responses were more likely to occur when a child was crying alone than when interacting with a peer. (RH)",

Questions guiding the research were: Does the teacher (1) Repeat strategy suggestions frequently? (2) Give a rationale for strategy use or feedback concerning the effectiveness of the strategy? and (3) Attempt to promote strategy generalization? Attention was also given to describing differences over grade level in the use of repetition, rationale-giving, and generalization instruction by teachers. A group of 69 teachers from public school classrooms of grades kindergarten through 6 were observed according to a time-sampling scheme for 30 minutes per day on five days as they taught language arts and mathematics. A total of 292 strategy  suggestions were recorded in a written narrative and were classified into 12 categories having to do with rote learning, elaboration, attention, specific attentional aids, transformation, deduction, exclusion, imagery, specific aids for problem solving and memorizing, general aids, self-checking, and metamemory. Findings indicated that repetition of strategy suggestions did occur among teachers of all grade levels, rationales for strategy use are given more frequently at higher grades, and instructions that promote strategy generalization, which should be particularly effective in the classroom, were rarely seen. Implications for teacher education are pointed out. (RH)",

While emphasizing oral and written language skills, the book is more generally aimed at teaching cultural concepts and values which reflect the importance of family and clan ties and the concept of right and respectful relations with others and nature. The 16 pages of illustrations and graphics are large and geared toward children in the lower primary grades, although the text may be used throughout the elementary grades and as an informational  supplement for teachers at all levels of instruction. As an adjunct activity, illustrations can be photocopied and colored, painted, or otherwise elaborated by students. While this book is written primarily for Navajo students, it can be used successfully as an addition to a multicultural curriculum when studying variation in human habitation, family organization, residence patterns, and home life.

Rural educators must make certain that rural students begin to receive their fair share of attention and resources. In the current concern for the improvement of public education, those who work in rural and small schools must make certain that legislative decisionmakers are informed of the unique qualities and associated strengths and weaknesses of rural schools. In any statewide effort to improve education, rural schools must be  represented on task forces and study groups to insure that mandatory guidelines and requirements acknowledge and allow for differences between large big-city school districts and small rural ones. The need to persuade legislators and educational decisionmakers to consider rural education points out the need for more and better rural schools research so that recommendations to policymakers can be based on facts. Areas in need of study include rural school effectiveness, staff development, and the use of educational technologies. (JHZ)",

        "description":"A study of 149 nonmetropolitan Southern counties used data for 1973 and 1983 to examine the effects of rural industrialization in the region. Variables studied were population size, number of manufacturers, rate of family poverty, and percent of high school graduates. A comparison of white (75% or more whites in the population) and nonwhite (more than 25% nonwhite in the population) counties showed that nonwhite counties continue to lag behind white counties in the South. Data showed that absolute gains in industrialization (number of manufacturing establishments) and measures of income were greater in the white counties. However, the decline in the poverty rate and the increase in percentage of high school graduates were significantly greater in nonwhite counties. The rate of  population growth and the original level of poverty in 1983 were the two significant factors influencing change in the rate of poverty over the decade. Industrialization had little or no effect on the reduction of poverty during this period. The study findings raise questions concerning many theories of economic change. For example, contrary to predictions of modernization theory, the study points to continuing racial differences in the &quot;New South&quot; with past racial discrimination continuing to influence the social structure.

        "description":"The opinions of 1,585 Iowa farmers about 8 emergent agricultural technologies (energy production from feed grains and oils; energy production from livestock waste; genetic engineering research on plants, livestock, and humans; robotics for on-farm use; confinement livestock facilities; and personal computers for farm families) were found to be essentially independent of the respondents' socioeconomic statuses and farm characteristics. The best set of explanatory variables were opinions about science and support for land grant college activities. The more firmly respondents possessed a faith in science to solve society's problems, the greater their support for these third-wave technologies. Given the generally low relationship obtained in this analysis for personal  characteristics, farm-firm characteristics, and science orientations, it seems that public acceptance of these technologies is dependent upon yet unidentified factors. Although data were not available in this study, it is suspected that moral and ethical considerations may loom large in the relatively low levels of support received by some of these third-wave technologies and may prove pivotal to both how farmers react to the newer technologies and to the scientific endeavors that create them.

        "description":"A study of two rural New York counties--Cortland and Otsego--was undertaken to identify innovative ways to provide public passenger transportation services in rural areas by using transportation cooperatives. Information about current transportation services was obtained from staff members of the human service agencies and county government officials in the study counties. Additional data were obtained from the 1980 Census of Housing and Population and the New York State Department of Transportation. Data indicated that in both counties direct transportation costs were substantial, indirect costs in staff time were also significant, and many transportation needs were unmet. According to agency representatives in the study counties, the cooperative is an acceptable form of  organization to facilitate interagency coordination. Cooperative alternatives could be responsible for clearinghouse functions, administrative activities, vehicle maintenance and repair, and fleet purchase. Cooperative organizations could be sponsored by the agencies themselves, by a service club, or by a combination of both. There is considerable potential for coordinating passenger transportation services with rural postal delivery routes. A demonstration project for the two-county study areas is recommended to determine the best type of transportation cooperative for the area and the feasibility of using rural postal service routes.

Student assessment, retention, and graduation data over the past 20 years indicate change in the Native students' success in the Manitoba education system is markedly below that of the general population. The &quot;deficit syndrome&quot; and &quot;discontinuity/mismatch explanation&quot; are examined. The &quot;cultural diversity paradigm&quot; is presented as a more contemporary explanation that has the greatest potential for impact  upon educational practice for minority students. Initiatives undertaken by Manitoba's Frontier School Division to soften the system's negative regard for the cultural capital of Native students are outlined: cultural awareness workshops and inservice training to prepare non-Native teachers for work with Native classrooms and identification of program needs and development of curricula by Native educators.

The questionnaire included 13 statements about principles/qualities of effective schooling arising from &quot;effective schools research&quot; to be graded by respondents on the basis of their own experience. Only 21 senators responded, 10 of whom indicated they had adopted a policy of not participating in surveys, questionnaires, or interviews with academic institutions.  Of the 11 who did complete questionnaires, 5 had graduated from high schools with 40 or fewer students in their class, with 3 graduating from schools with 15 or fewer seniors. Although the response rate was too low to make any inferences, senators who attended small schools rated their experiences more positively than those attending large schools in all areas except parental involvement in the school and community support of the school. Interestingly, these are two areas referred to in the literature as strong points for small schools. (NEC)",

The Algonquian-speaking Micmac Indians used pictographs, petroglyphs, notched sticks, and wampum as written communication to serve early social, political, cultural, and spiritual needs. Roman Catholic missionaries adapted the aboriginal symbols and developed hieroglyphs to teach prayers. These modified hieroglyphs remain the essence of Micmac literacy although four Roman scripts were developed by European missionaries and the Canadian government to promote cultural assimilation. Micmac language research to develop culturally responsive educational materials during the  1970's led to debate about choice of writing script and the subsequent development of a new script and extensive modifications of traditional scripts. Although the value of literacy has been recognized by the Micmac Tribe for over 300 years, the varieties of scripts imposed by outside cultures has impeded production of bicultural educational materials.

Four aspects of psychological research relevant to science curriculum design are discussed: (1) the state of the reasoner; (2) the mechanisms governing change in reasoning; (3) the delivery of instruction; and (4) the equity of educational outcomes. Taken together, this research suggests that science instruction can and should produce a larger number of citizens and scientists who understand some of the phenomena which contribute to scientific creativity and insight and who know how to add to their scientific knowledge  autonomously. Instruction which emphasizes discovery of new ideas, which helps learners gain feedback about their ideas, and which encourages them to assess their own ideas is likely to result in citizens who continue to learn in the future.

Children below the age of 19 did not do any significant label-reading, despite a variety of attention-getting treatments used. However, labels were significant in assisting parents in explaining exhibits to children. In the absence of printed labels, parents invented erroneous explanations.  Visitors preferred labels which conveyed scientific as opposed to historical information. Finally, visitors read an average of 200 words per label, when they selected an exhibit for study. Furthermore, they felt it was important to have this printed material available so that they could elect to learn more about the particular exhibits which were of interest to them.

In doing so, three developmental approaches were compared: (1) Piaget's structuralist approach; (2) Siegler's rule assessment approach; and (3) Anderson and Wilkening's functional measurement approach. In order to assess children's understanding of temperature via the three developmental approaches, tasks with two variables were selected, namely, heating varying amounts of water by varying numbers of candles. Subjects were 96 middle-class Israeli children aged 4 to 11. Findings, among others, indicate that there are both commonalities and differences in children's development of the concept of  temperature across various methodologies. In the Piaget and Siegler approach, children's development proceeded from centering on one variable to attending to two variables without coordinating them to attending to two variables and coordinating them. In the Anderson and Wilkening's approach, development proceeds from integrating two variables via integration rules of first addition, then subtraction, and finally division. Children who concentrate on one variable via Piaget's and Siegler's tasks integrate these variables via Anderson and Wilkening's tasks. This suggests that the latter two approaches may underestimate children's intellectual capacities. (JN)",

Results were generally as predicted as most of the additive subjects failed the immediate and delayed posttest problems (62 percent and 80 percent respectively) while most of the proportional subjects  succeeded (80 percent and 71 percent respectively). Group differences were significant (p less than .001). Since science is an enterprise based upon the process of falsification of hypothesis, it seems clear that this fundamental property is lost on many students as indicated by the results. Clearly, if these students are to grasp this property, a far greater effort by teachers and curriculum developers will have to be made. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"Nine undergraduate science and non-science majors (novices) who had recently completed their first college classroom study of genetics and seven genetics graduate students and biology instructors (experts) were videotaped as they attempted to solve a selected group of seven moderately complex classifical genetics problems and three Piagetian tasks (proportions, probability, and combinations). Three conclusions based on the analysis of the videotape recordings appear to be warranted. First, for the three schemas studied, formal thought is not a condition &quot;sufficient&quot; to determine success in dealing with portions of genetics problems which require applying that scheme. Second, for the formal schema of combinations at least, formal operational thought does not appear to be a  necessary condition to success in solving genetics problems of the type presented in this study. Third, while not addressing the question directly, results are in agreement with previous research which suggests a positive correlation between cognitive development and success in genetic problem-solving. The paper notes that it is premature to assume that concrete operational students should not study classical genetics. (JN)",

Included are results of a pilot study of how geneticists and biologists categorize genetics problems. Findings (based on five faculty responses) show that: biology faculty members apparently have a detailed mental  organizational structure for genetics problems; genetics problems are apparently mentally organized by these individuals in a hierarchical system; the self-report of at least one subject suggests that this organization plays a signficant role in problem-solving; genetics principles used by faculty subjects to organize genetics problems appear to be very similar in most cases; the organizations produced were based on &quot;deep structure&quot;; and the keywords identified by subjects are closely tied to the organization scheme being used.

        "description":"A study explored the effectiveness of an instructional approach designed to help students establish connections between their understanding of the decimal system and the stardard symbols and procedural rules used to solve decimal problems. Ten children each in grades 4 through 6 participated. They were individually interviewed prior to and six weeks after instruction. Group tests containing decimal number items were administered in Fall and Spring to the entire classrooms from which the samples were drawn. It was found that after instruction students could engage in semantic analysis on tasks similar to those covered during instruction and could use their understanding of the symbols to perform novel tasks. The extent to which they engaged in semantic analysis appeared to be tied  somewhat to the amount of previous formal instruction in decimals. Students who had already learned a procedure for performing a task were less likely to use semantic meanings for the symbols to solve a problem than students who had not yet learned a procedural rule. Consequently, the effectiveness of instruction designed to create meanings for symbols seems to depend, in part, upon when it is introduced. Appendices contain group activities, test items, and interview questions. (Author/MNS)",

The ACT theory of skill acquisition and its successor (PUPS--PenUltimate Production System) provides production-system models of the acquisition of skills such as LISP programming, geometry theorem-proving, and solving of algebraic equations. The three major sections of the document discuss; (l) the cognitive theory that serves as the basis for the tutoring endeavors, (2) the model-tracing methodology and how it derives from the cognitive theory, and (3) issues that arise in implementing the methodology. Knowledge begins in declarative form and is used by  analogical processes to solve specific problems. Domain-specific productions are compiled from the traces of these problem solutions. The model-tracing methodology has been developed as a means of displaying this cognitive theory in intelligent tutoring. Implementation of the methodology involves developing a student model, a pedagogical module, and an interface. Work on tutoring and on skill acquisition have proven to be symbiotic -- each has furthered the other's development. (Author/MNS)",

One of the texts used was an experimental one written to challenge and change students' common misconceptions about how plants get their food. The other two texts were commercially available texts covering the same content as the experimental text. Daily interviews were used to trace the thinking of students (N=18) as they read one text chapter over a 3-day period. This approach provided detailed information about the cognitive lives of students during textbook reading that has important implications for  understanding learning processes, teaching, and textbook development. A unique part of the study was the exploration of conceptual learning from text. Findings, among others, show that both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; readers have difficulty learning from text because they use ineffective text processing strategies and that only students using a conceptual change strategy for processing text were successful in giving up or modifying their incorrect prior knowledge in favor of text explanations.

The subjects consisted of 18 senior high school biology teachers and one randomly selected tenth-grade biology class of each teacher. Each class (mean size of 22.72 students) was heterogeneous with respect to sex, race, and socioeconomic status. Teachers were compared with respect to their conceptions of six aspects of the nature of science (amoral, creative, tentative, testable, parsimonious, and unified) as measured by the Nature of Scientific Knowledge Scale (NSKS). Quantitative comparisons were made between &quot;high&quot; teachers (those exhibiting the highest NSKS scores) and &quot;low&quot; teachers (those exhibiting the lowest NSKS scores)  with respect to 44 classroom variables. Only one variable differentiated between the &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; groups of teachers. Thus the data did not support the prevalent assumption that a teacher's conception of the nature of science influences his/her classroom behavior. Interestingly, most of the classroom variables used for teacher comparisons have previously been shown to be related to improved student conceptions of the nature of science. (Author/JN)",

Individual teams synthesized the extant research using meta-analysis procedures. One of the syntheses showed that the post-Sputnik or &quot;new&quot; science programs on the whole produced very positive gains in student achievement. Statisticians have questioned the integrity of meta-analysis results because standard procedures fail to take into account the error associated with the sample estimation of the effect size. It is argued that when a set of different effect sizes are pooled across studies, the means most properly should be computed using weighted factors associated with the precision of the effect size values. This  research repeated the meta-analysis of research on the new science curricula using weighted procedures proposed by Hedges. The results provide more precise information on the actual effectiveness of the post-Sputnik science curricula meta-analyzed in the Anderson project and establish clearer guidelines regarding the application of meta-analysis techniques in synthesizing research results.

Specifically, the views on the interaction among science, technology, and society (STS) held by undergraduates in this department were examined using a variation of VOSTS CDN-2. In addition, individual interviews with selected students were conducted. Results obtained from the VOSTS CDN-2 and from two areas explored during interviews (the nature of science and the role of science in society) indicate that the undergraduates are nearly identical to high school graduates in their understandings of the relationship between science, technology, and society. The number of university science courses taken appears to have had little effect on  this understanding. Drawing prospective science teachers from this group presents STS teacher educators with a challenge. To prepare teachers to deal with STS issues, teacher educators must move beyond methods courses to remedy serious deficiencies in knowledge about the social context of science and technology. This task will likely be taken on by faculties of education and not faculties of science. (JN)",

To this end, past, present, and future styles of research are considered to: (1) demonstrate links between alternative conceptions research and earlier investigations of science learning; (2) identify new issues of importance for science education in current research on children's ideas; and (3) indicate directions that research should take. Consideration of past research inevitably involves an elaboration of personal epistemologies. Therefore, the first section of the paper considers the evolution over the last 20 years of the  general direction of science education research at Monash University. More specific research on students' alternative conceptions of science are then outlined. This leads to a consideration of present research in terms of the relations between research and practice, and of the implications for further development. The future developments described focus particularly on research on the strategies used by learners, and on the continued growth of interaction between research and practice.

Both teachers (one male and one female) were described as &quot;exemplary&quot; by their peers, in terms of subject expertise and teaching ability. Particular emphasis was placed on: (1) whether the teachers could influence students' attitudes toward science (indicating that the teachers did provide a  classroom environment conducive to fostering positive attitudes); (2) students' intuitive views and inappropriate observations during a laboratory activity dealing with flotation; and (3) whether exemplary teachers were still exemplary when teaching outside their field of expertise (indicating that the teachers may not always bring about sound scientific understanding in students if they are called upon to teach outside their area of expertise).

        "description":"A major goal of science education is to turn novices (students) into experts (scientists or science literates) with a minimum amount of pain, effort, and time. However, transfer of biology knowledge from instructor to student usually results in a loss of the rich interconnections that an expert has. The papers in this set describe efforts to restore and exercise these interconnections in the knowledge of the student. This first paper provides a rationale for and overview of the general approach taken which is to: (1) design a formal and systematic representation of biology knowledge in the form of a semantic network of concepts and the relationships between them; (2) build a set of computer-based tools to support the design and construction of semantic networks for particular  areas of biology; and (3) build a set of computer-based games to present semantic networks to students along with tasks which will require students to exercise the interconnections among concepts. Also discussed are: previous studies of methods for improving integration of new information; previous work in knowledge representation; and reasons for selecting the particular representation method used (which stem from practical constraints arising either from instructional considerations or from the capabilities of current computer systems).

While the primary thrust of Phase I of the project was to develop reliable and valid multi-item scales, the Economics Values Inventory (EVI), additional purposes were to test tentative hypotheses about factors associated with attitude differences and change, and to gain a glimpse into the actual content of adolescent economic activities. The Phase II design specified an initial measurement, or pretest, of students' economic attitudes as measured on the EVI scales, followed by an instructional period, then a post-test of the same youth's economic attitudes. Responses of the pretest group (N-1911), were factor-analyzed to see if essentially the same factors would emerge as in Phase  II. In Phase I, economics knowledge proved to be the strongest predictor of students' economic attitude differences. The Phase II pre- and post-test displayed this tendency to an even greater extent. Greater economic knowledge was associated with (1) stronger affirmation of the free enterprise system; (2) an increased trust in business; (3) a decrease in feelings of being economically powerless and alienated; (4) decreased affirmation of governmental responsibility for social welfare; and (5) higher opposition to government price-setting, to unions, to statements that workers are treated unfairly, and to statements that attack the economic status quo.

Economics Values Inventory (EVI), the design for the evaluation, specified an initial measurement of the same youths' economic values. The central finding was that, for the main comparison group, the text had a measurable impact on student values and attitudes. While both users and non-users had essentially similar EVI scale means at the pretest, their attitudes significantly differed at the post-test, as measured by a number of scales. Specifically, text users were (1) more supportive of  the American economic system, (2) showed more trust in business, (3) felt a greater sense of personal economic efficacy, (4) were more likely to feel that the treatment of workers is fair, and (5) were less likely to express disagreement with the economic status quo.

        "description":"In attempts to forestall problems inherent in too-rapid urbanization, China has instituted a migration policy designed to strictly control changes in permanent residence from rural areas or small urban places to larger cities and to encourage the development of small cities and towns. The policy is enforced through the household registration system, whereby each person has an official place of residence and must obtain official permission to change locations. Within these controls, considerable migration does occur, much of it for job-related reasons or for education. Such temporary migration, which has increased greatly, is sanctioned because it is seen as providing benefits without concurrently imposing burdens on the cities. Temporary movement (1) absorbs a considerable  portion of the surplus rural areas; (2) generates income to fuel a rising standard of living in rural areas; (3) meets demands for service workers and other needs associated with improving the quality of life in cities; and most importantly, (4) provides linkages between rural and urban places. Coupled with a realization on restrictions governing permanent migration from villages to towns, temporary movement may serve as a first step in the development of small, rural oriented urban centers that are intended to provide employment opportunities and some urban amenities not otherwise available in rural areas. It remains to be seen whether such towns or the temporary contacts that peasants have with the cities will satisfy the rising consumer demands and aspirations for a better quality of  life, or whether the listed exposure to urban life styles will instead increase peasants' desire to live in cities.

Much of scientific reasoning, however, especially in the human sciences, involves propositions incapable of either verification or falsification; yet belief in and commitment to unprovable propositions obviously influence scientific work and provide the basis for schools of thought. Political theories are organizations of subjective assertions which, along Q methodological lines, can be shown to be structured, thereby giving empirical substance to Newton's unpublished Fifth Rule. As a demonstration, leading hypotheses concerning the  nature of political society are collected, and the views of major political theorists (Plato, Locke, Marx, et al.) are each modeled as Q sorts. Correlation then demonstrates the interconnections among these schools of thought, and factor analysis points to the intellectual traditions of Western political philosophy.

        "description":"Intended for educators interested in providing peace and nuclear war education in the public schools, this publication examines the nature of peace and nuclear war education, rationales for its inclusion in the public school program, and ways to deal with the controversial nature of the topics. The first of eight chapters presents a four-fold rationale. Peace and nuclear war education are considered appropriate content for (1) developing reflective and competent young adults, (2) increasing the relevancy of peace- and nuclear war-related content in today's world, (3) addressing psychological concerns of students, and (4) preparing young adults for civic involvement. Chapter 2 defines peace and nuclear war education and addresses commonalities between the two. Chapter 3 presents a  rationale and criteria for teaching controversial issues. Chapter 4 examines biased and unbiased instructional materials, personal beliefs, age appropriateness, teaching methods, infusion of peace and nuclear war education into the middle school, junior high, and elementary school curriculum, and some helpful teaching hints. Materials and instructions for a curriculum materials analysis system are provided in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 gives suggestions for dealing with school and district level resistance to the political and controversial nature of peace and nuclear war topics. Annotated citations for over 20 teaching resources in Chapter 7 are followed by five concluding challenges in Chapter 8. A list of over 50 related references concludes the publication. (LH)",

The first section on general secondary education provides information such as objectives; organization; marking and examination systems; enrollment; problems; basic curriculum; alternative programs; subject matter reform; teacher training; educational administration; and research in secondary education. Next, an overview of secondary specialized education, the training of specialized technicians or professional support personnel in a wide range of specialties, includes information on objectives, funding,  entrance requirements, specialty fields of study, enrollment, terminology used to describe differences in Soviet Schools, courses of study, graduation requirements, teacher training, and administration and research in secondary specialized education. A third section focusing on vocational education presents an overview of purpose, traditional vocational skills, teacher training, administration, and research in vocational education. The final section is devoted to the final examination in Soviet secondary schools. Appendices making up nearly half of the publication provide the text of general instructions and questions for secondary school final examinations. Tables showing the 10-year curriculum in Russian and Ukrainian general secondary schools, the all-year curriculum in Estonian  general secondary schools, and sample one-, two-, and three-year vocational school curriculums are provided where appropriate.

In section 2, &quot;Assessing Ecological Decline,&quot; Lester R. Brown and Edward C.

Next, in &quot;Increasing Water Efficiency,&quot; Sandra Postel describes water-saving  irrigation methods, new cropping patterns, recycling and reuse, conservation in cities, and balancing the water equation. The next section, &quot;Managing Rangelands,&quot; (Edward C. Wolf) is followed by two articles, &quot;Moving beyond Oil,&quot; and &quot;Reforming the Electric Power Industry&quot; by Christopher Flavin. Section 7, &quot;Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants,&quot; (Cynthia Pollock) addresses issues concerning decontamination and dismantlement, waste disposal, and cost. Two health articles: &quot;Banishing Tobacco,&quot; and &quot;Investing in Children,&quot; by William U. Chandler are followed by a look at &quot;Africa's Decline,&quot; (Lester R. Brown and Edward C. Wolf). In the final section, &quot;Redefining National Security,&quot; Lester R. Brown addresses new threats to security, militarization of the world economy, costs to the two  super-powers, countries reducing arms outlays, and challenges to world peace. (LH)",

The study of nuclear arms should be included in peace studies at the secondary level. Research and informal interviews with secondary and college students indicate that youth are not knowledgeable about nuclear arms and, furthermore, do not think that nuclear policy can be influenced by what individuals do or don't do. The social studies curriculum teaches students a great deal about war. But it should also, through peace studies at all levels, focus greater attention on peace. Elementary and secondary students should learn about  peacemakers, those who oppose war, and about alternatives to war. There are many other themes that can be included in peace studies curriculum, e.g., foreign language study, cross cultural studies, and sister city/sister school projects. (RM)",

For the purposes of this paper, discussion is limited to the field of psychology. One of the primary goals of the project was to develop a set of content guidelines for each of the target disciplines. For psychology these guidelines took the form of a handbook for instructors containing summaries of current knowledge about sex and gender and key references. A second project goal was to address student-faculty communication patterns, and provide suggestions for eliminating sex bias in actual classroom behavior. A  student-faculty interaction handbook discussing potential forms that sex bias in the classroom might take and suggesting tactics for change was developed. The methodology used to develop the content guidelines and the student-faculty interaction handbook included literature reviews, scholarly feedback, classroom observation, and product testing and revision.

        "description":"The aim of this paper is to offer possible explanations for the declining interest in regional geography. One of the major contributing factors is employment potential. Employment is perceived as being relatively limited for persons defining their interests as \"regional\" within geography. Students, therefore, do not enroll in regional geography courses. From the students' perspective it is only logical to select career-oriented geography courses, and since the early 1960's systematic geography courses have enabled them to do this with great ease. The quantitative revolution in geography complemented the systematic side of the discipline extremely well. Systematic-quantitative geography, because it was new, dynamic, and had publication potential and external funding possibilities,  became very appealing. Regional geography lacked this dynamism. Another reason for regional geography's decline is that it requires years of study and travel to become knowledgeable about a certain region. In a publish or perish academic world, this is often not feasible for a young faculty member. The paper concludes that lack of faculty interest and student concerns will hold geography firmly in the grip of the systematic camp for some time to come. (RM)",

As host of the Mount Vernon Conference and president of the Philadelphia Convention, Washington brought to the growing movement for a new constitution great dignity and political stature. Washington's stamp of approval for the new Constitution gave the advocates of the Constitution, the Federalists, a hefty advantage in the rhetorical battle for ratification. While Washington was the spiritual force behind the Constitution's framing, it was Madison who was the intellectual force. Madison, who first confronted the theoretical problems of confederalism head on, became the dominant voice in the creation of the American republic. It was Madison who argued  for the &quot;judicious modification of the federal principle,&quot; i.e., the dimunition of state sovereignty and an extension of the sphere of influence of the national government. This bicentennial year of the Constitution is a time to glorify the Constitution. It is a time to reaffirm those lasting truths that undergird our individual rights and to salute those responsible for the Constitution's creation. (RM)",

To renew public appreciation of the Constitution, our fundamental law and the philosophical foundation of our political order, is the most fitting bicentennial celebration U.S. citizens can engage in. James Madison, often called the father of the Constitution, believed that &quot;justice is the end of government.&quot; He believed that the accumulation of all powers in the same hands was the very definition of tyranny. The solution that Madison and the others founders offered was an institutional solution. Central to their institutional scheme was the principle of separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and  judicial branches of government. As Madison put it, the &quot;preservation of liberty requires that the three great departments of power should be separate and distinct.&quot; What this means is that the Constitution does not make our liberties dependent upon the good will or the benevolence of those who wield power. Sound institutions were meant to offset the defects of human reason and virtue. (RM)",

It is outranked in importance only by the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The immediate purpose of the Northwest Ordinance was to provide government for the largely unsettled lands north and west of the Ohio River. In promising gradual and orderly development of representative government, and guaranteeing eventual statehood on an equal basis, the framers of the Ordinance tied the western territories to the nation with firm legal bonds. The Ordinance asserted the supremacy of the national government in a manner that anticipated the system of federalism of the Constitution. The Northwest Ordinance includes core civic values and principles in the American heritage. It  also raises issues in American history, pertaining to slavery, states' rights, western expansion, and individual liberties. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 allows insight into fundamental aspects of the American civic heritage. Thus, it is among the most important legacies Americans have and is worthy of special recognition as part of the Bicentennial celebrations of 1987. (JP)",

Research indicating that experiential community-based learning raises student motivation is also presented. &quot;Why aren't community- based strategies more widely implemented?&quot;  considers the following reasons for the low implementation of community studies programs: extensive preparation time and perceived low administrator support. &quot;How can the community be implemented in social studies education?&quot; describes specific strategies for integrating a community--based social study component.

        "description":"A research study shows the strong positive relationship between traditional personal values and academic success of students from various disadvantaged backgrounds. Four categories of values were examined: (1) the work ethic, (2) religious commitment, (3) parental support of success in school, and (4) peer group support of success in school. A sample of 11,885 tenth grade students from families whose socioeconomic status was below the national median were selected from 30,000 sophomore students in the 1980 nation-wide study, High School and Beyond Survey. Values of students whose GPAs were in the upper 20 percent of the nation were compared with those whose GPAs ranked in the bottom 20 percent. Comparisons were made within each ethnic and racial classification. Students in the  top category of academic achievement tended to express much stronger support for traditional values than did those in the bottom GPA category. Furthermore, the students in the top category were much more likely to have parents and friends who supported success in school. This finding is the same for all disadvantaged populations represented in this study, which includes four racial or ethnic groups: Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites. This study suggests that development of character and intellect are intertwined. If teachers and parents collaborate to encourage positive values of students, they are likely to enhance academic achievement and success in school. (JP)",

Students' values in this study refer to the work ethic, importance attached to education, and strength of religiosity. Indicators of parents' values are concerns for their children's success in school. Values of a student's friends refer to the importance they attach to education. Data for this study came from the sample of 30,000 sophomores in the 1980 High School and Beyond Survey, which involved 1,100 high schools throughout the country. In 1982, there was a follow-up study of this sample of students. The primary finding of this study was that traditional American values are important predictors  of students' success in school, as indicated, for example, by high academic achievement and infrequency of discipline problems in school. Traditional values are twice as important as family socioeconomic status in predicting the success of students in school. Another major finding was that students with strong traditional values were more likely than those with less-traditional values to use time outside of school to reinforce learning in school. For example, there was a significant difference in the amount of time spent on homework. Likewise, students with parents and friends who valued education and good behavior in school were more likely to have success in school. It seems that efforts to improve the American educational system must take into account the values held by students, their  parents, and their friends. (JP)",

During the twelfth year (1984-85) of the operation of the project, three distinct groups of graduates who had completed either the bachelor or master's degree program were studied. The basic instruments included were: (1) University records; (2) principals' evaluations; (3) the California F-Scale; (4) a measure of satisfaction of the students taught by graduates; and (5) classroom observations. The study's major findings for the first-year subjects were similar to those reported in the past 11 years of the study. Comparisons between bachelor and master's degree graduates indicated few significant differences; although, in  general, bachelor degree students appeared to be functioning at a slightly higher level than the master's degree graduates. This was in opposition to findings of previous years. Based on the results of the study and the applications that have been made, the model has become a permanent operational feature of the teacher education programs at Tennessee Technological University. Appendixes include a six-page list of reports and the instrumentation used in this study. (Author/CB)",

Scores of the Pre-Professional Skills Test (PPST) were also analyzed. Both high school rank and class standing appeared to be strong variables for success in the PPST. Students with grade point averages over  2.5 generally scored higher on the PPST than did students with grade point averages below 2.5. Ethnicity was another variable associated with the success rate on the PPST.

Changes are suggested for improving and strengthening the association and its power in the teacher education field. It is noted that NCATE's power base is weak; although the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) is a major force within NCATE, AACTE does not required NCATE accreditation for its member institutions. Little is said by NCATE accredited institutions about requiring graduation from NCATE accredited  undergraduate programs as an admission prerequisite to graduate programs.

The Lesley College/Spring, Texas partnership challenges traditional delineations of responsibilities in teacher education. Preservice and inservice education are shared responsibilities of both the college and the school district. Third year undergraduate education majors must compete to participate in the program. To be considered, they present a professional resume, videotapes and audiotapes of their teaching, and a portfolio of other evidence of personal and professional achievement. Their academic and communication skills must be strong. If chosen, students complete a senior practicum and are therafter guaranteed a first year teaching position with the Spring Independent  School District. During their first year of teaching, ongoing guidance and support are provided by a faculty member. (Author/CB)",

As schools become more sophisticated in the education of children, they must become correspondingly more sophisticated in working with the parents of the children. A High-Active Parent Invovlement Program involves administrators, teachers, parents, and students. One part of that program is the daily \"public relations package\" known as homework. Homework is a human bridge between the possibilities of the school and the realities of the home. This paper presents strategies through which administrators and teachers can use homework as a public relations tool to obtain greater parental involvement, that will in turn lead to greater student achievement and positive attitudes toward the  school and the teacher.

One such program geared to upgrading the professional quality of its graduates is the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program at the University's laboratory school. The MAT program is a graduate internship designed for college graduates with degrees in liberal arts, education, or other professional fields. The program extends over four terms beginning with the Summer Session and continuing for a full calendar year. During this year the intern spends each week of the school year at Falk School, the university's laboratory school. The 180-day clinical experience at the laboratory school involves  teaching responsibilities during school hours which are monitored by the master teacher to whom the intern is assigned, and formal classes held after school hours. This paper describes the MAT model of teacher development and the rigorous qualifications and standards employed to insure a high caliber student pool accepted into and graduated from its program.

Ethnographic research procedures were used to identify trends and factors in the decline in the supply of education students and teachers in Louisiana. Methods included: analysis of graduation statistics for Louisiana schools of education; interviews with deans of education in Louisiana; analysis of black and white performance on the National Teachers Examination (NTE) in Louisiana; analyses of entry level teaching certificates of Louisiana education graduates; and interviews with education and noneducation majors in Louisiana schools. The hypothesis that there has been a steady decline in the number of education  graduates in Louisiana since 1976 was confirmed. The study data also showed that the number and proportional representation of black graduates has dropped substantially and sharply. The report discusses in detail the study methodology and results, and presents seven recommendations concerning teacher salaries, financial incentives, teacher recruitment, the NTE, legislative needs, and community involvement.

The study was designed to investigate the difference in the analysis of absolute and relativistic generalizations. Data from this research indicate that differences do exist between middle and high school students in this area of absolute and relativistic thinking. In their reactions to absolute statements provided for analysis, high school students tended to show greater uncertainty in agreement than middle school students. On the relativistic statements, middle school students tended to show greater uncertainty than high school students. Middle school students, when confronted with both relativistic and absolute statements, show more uncertainty in agreement on  the relativistic statements.

College of education faculty, concerned because the majority of their population has traditionally been older, Hispanic students, developed a pre-PPST screening and advising program as part of the required Orientation to Education course. The core of the program consists of reading and math screening tests tied conceptually to the PPST and administered at voluntary testing sessions. The tests predict PPST scores with 96 percent accuracy. Students falling below a validated cut off score are referred to remedial or refresher work, including successful PPST-preparation workshops. PPST pass rates of UTEP  students have consistently been at or above the overall state average, with minority enrollment in the college maintaining constant over time. These screening tests and variations of the UTEP program are used in over 70 institutions, and a Texas-wide Network on Teacher Competency Testing has been developed to share ideas about test-preparation and program improvement.

Year one, Phases I and II, involved the administration of pre- and posttests to all staff members in order to measure their knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward computers. Based on the analysis of pre-assessment data, levels of training were determined and implemented. Year two, Phases III and IV, involved implementing the  project developed in the first year, including a basic computer literacy program for all students. The goal of the third year, Phase V, is the refinement of the computer management system and the expansion of software resources to meet the needs of low incidence groups. These groups include special education students in the mainstream and in the resource room, students identified as talented and gifted, and students from minority and multi-ethnic backgrounds.

The schedule requires a higher level of inference by the observer than many researchers may find acceptable. The paper argues that inference can be controlled within acceptable limits and that issues of objectivity and subjectivity are very complex. The SCOTS schedule attempts to reduce observer bias by concentrating on 43 separate variables believed to be parts of a teacher's teaching style or strategy. The observer places the teacher under observation on a defined continuum for each variable. Each continuum consists of five points, thus making each variable a multiple choice item for the observer. The items cover such topics as teaching skills, feedback and individual aid, pupil interest and  motivation, development of responsibility, grouping practices, efficiency of management, authoritarianism and coercion, class control, and relationships with students. Appended are the complete SCOTS schedule by John L. Powell and Mabel N.G. Scrimgeour (1977 Revision) as well as items of a summative version that differ from the classroom version. (DWH)",

        "description":"This study was designed to explore the effect of selected test and background variables on the pooled within-school relationship between Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) scores and first year grade average (FYA), and to assess the potential role of selected Test of English as a Foreign Language-related variables as supplemental predictors of FYA for foreign students. Data were supplied by 59 United States schools of management for 1,762 foreign non-native speakers (English second language) and 157 foreign native speakers (English primary language). Continuous variables were standardized by school--that is, expressed as deviations from school means in school standard deviation units--and then pooled for analysis. It was found that the mean relative standing of various  country-contingents in terms of first year grades tended to correspond more closely with relative standing on the less valid verbal measure than with standing on the more valid quantitative measure. One conclusion was that for these samples of non-native speakers of English, differences in English-language background affected (artificially depressed) both performance on the GMAT verbal measure and first-year performance in the Masters of Business Administration programs. Appendices provide numerous figures, scatterplots, and an interim report dated March 1984. (PN)",

The three phases included: (1) development of three prototype instruments based on a checklist approach, a semi-documented approach, and an open-ended portfolio approach; (2) development of an instrument with a simplified format that contained positive features of the prototypes; and (3) pilot-testing of the simplified version, on newly enrolled graduate students, in 26 university departments (representing fields of English, biology and psychology). The third phase investigated the technical soundness and the feasibility of the instrument's use in the admissions process.  Descriptive and correlational analyses of the responses to the inventory were conducted to describe characteristics of the students and the instrument, and to identify the most reliable clusters of items and indices of accomplishment. End-of-the-year follow-ups provided student accomplishment data for analyses of the short-term correlates of the measure. Faculty were interviewed regarding plausibility of the content of the instrument and the utility of various reporting formats. Student reactions were obtained by interview and by additional questions at the end of the inventory. The survey is contained in the appendix. (PN)",

A section on maximum likelihood solution focuses on extensions of the classical model, especially the normal case. Many of the recent developments have taken place within this context, and it provides a unified framework of exposition against which other models may be introduced in contrast. Section 2 provides a brief review of factor analysis of measured variables, setting up notation and formulas in this more familiar context. Section 3 introduces the common factor model for dichotomous items. Sections 4 and 5 discuss estimation of factor loadings from matrices of tetrachoric correlations, unweighted and weighted respectively. Section 6 discusses a  full information solution based on the method of maximum likelihood. Finally, section 7 outlines a number of extensions to the basic model under investigation. These include Bayesian prior distributions on unique variances, confirmatory factor analysis, comparisons of factor structures between groups, and relaxation of assumptions about response functions and population distributions.

All four were scored holistically, two were also scored for sentence-level and discourse-level skills, and some were scored by the Writer's Workbench computer software and by professors in the fields of engineering and the social sciences. Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores were obtained for all foreign students, and Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) General Test scores for some. A GRE score and a multiple-choice writing test score were obtained for the Americans. Findings included: (1) holistic, discourse-level, and sentence-level scores were so closely related that the  holistic score alone should suffice; (2) correlations among writing sample topics were as high across as within topic types; (3) scores of English as a second language raters, English raters, and subject matter raters were all highly correlated, suggesting substantial agreement in their standards; (4) correlations and factor analyses indicated that writing samples and TOEFL scores were highly related, but each also reliably measured an independent aspect; and (5) correlations of holistic writing sample scores with GRE item type scores confirmed a previously reported pattern of relationships.

        "author":["Perry, David K."],
        "description":"Political communication researchers recently have emphasized conditional relationships as crucial to specifying and understanding the effects of the mass media. In many cases, however, researchers will not predict which variables will modify the form or existence of media effects. They therefore will not include measures of the conditional variables in research designs. The presence of heteroscedasticity, or unequal precision of prediction at different levels of an independent variable, suggests the likelihood of an overlooked conditional relationship. This paper examines the possibilities for the use of statistical tests of variation in mass communication research. Research situations that employ both discrete and continuous independent variables are covered, and the visual  examination of scatterplots as an alternative to performing variability tests is examined. Problems with the variation tests available on commonly used computer packages is addressed. A number of recently developed, apparently dependable variability tests also are presented. A research example involving two-way, linear interactions is provided. Additional concerns with unequal variability are also discussed. Three figures and a four-page list of references are included.

        "description":"Simultaneous estimation of many parameters can often be improved, sometimes dramatically so, if it is reasonable to consider one or more subsets of parameters as exchangeable members of corresponding populations. While each observation may provide limited information about the parameters it is modeled directly in terms of, it also contributes information about the populations to which they belong. Knowledge about the populations, generally superior to knowledge about individual parameters, can in turn be brought to bear in the estimation of any individual parameter. This article describes a Bayesian framework for estimation in item response models, with two-stage prior distributions on both item and examinee populations. Strategies for point and interval estimation are discussed  and a general procedure based on the EM algorithm is presented. Details are given for implementation under one-, two-, and three-parameter logistic item response theory models. Novel features include minimally restrictive assumptions about examinee distributions and the exploitation of dependence among item parameters in a population of interest. Improved estimation in a moderately small sample is demonstrated with simulated data. Possible extensions of the procedures are discussed. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"This study compares the contribution to measurement accuracy of the verbal score of each of four verbal item types included in the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) General Test. Comparisons are based on item response theory, a methodology that allows the researcher to look at the accuracy of individual points on the score scale. This methodology is based on the assumption that the four verbal item types measure the same verbal ability. Since the results of the study do indicate that the reading comprehension item type measures something slightly different from what is measured by sentence completion, analogy, or antonym item types, only tentative conclusions may be drawn. The antonym item type contributes the most accuracy of the four item types for scores above about 550.  Analogy items contribute to the measurement accuracy of verbal ability throughout the score range. This is especially true when item types are matched on verbal difficulty. These results suggest that the analogy and antonym item types are useful for maintaining accuracy of the verbal score scale at the upper levels. Eliminating these items might have a serious impact on the validity of the GRE verbal score in the upper regions of the scale. Studies of the validity of item types at the upper score range using external criteria would be necessary to understand the exact contribution of the item types to the validity of the test.

Such criteria are continuous in nature, binary dichotomous, or multichotomous. In this paper, discussion is limited to the continuous normally distributed criterion scenarios. For both cases, it is assumed that the predictor variables are continuous multivariate normal. For the binary variable case, the multivariate normal assumption is conditioned on the binary criterion, that is, for each value of the binary criterion, the predictors are multivariate normal with a common covariance matrix, but different centroids. In other words, for the continuous criterion case, the correlations model is used, while for the binary case the assumptions associated  with the classic two-group discriminant analysis problem are employed. When these two models fit some population of data, then the use of standard loss functions yields well known population-optimal solutions. A unified framework for classification and prediction problems is presented. Well known and lesser known relationships among correlations, distances and error rates are established. A new population distance, the shrunken generalized distance, and a new estimator of the actual error rate are introduced. (Author/PN)",

This report presents the results of such research for the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). Despite the fact that GMAT data appear to violate a basic assumption of the three-parameter logistic item response model, local independence, the model was able to replicate accurately the observed item responses. IRT-based equating was consistent across two randomly selected samples and four selected subpopulations (male, female, younger examinees, and older examinees) and produced converted scores very similar to those produced by the current GMAT equating method--linear section pre-equating--a method that makes  different assumptions than those required by IRT. It appears that for GMAT item types and populations, any effect of the violation of local independence on IRT true-score equating is negligible. This research has shown IRT equating to be feasible for the GMAT; but, because the local independence assumption of IRT appears to be violated, further experience is needed before other IRT methods--such as optimal test development using item information, or computerized adaptive testing--could be used for GMAT.

Test results used for this report come from: (1) Illinois Inventory of Educational Progress (IIEP); (2) Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT); (3) National Assessment of Educational Progress; (4) American College Test; (5) Decade Study Test; and (6) Second International Mathematics Study. Data collected regarding student performance in mathematics showed that although the achievement of Illinois students is at the national average, the nation as a whole compares unfavorably with other countries. Science scores for Illinois students were at the national average, and the IIEP (used only in Illinois) showed improvement in  grades four, eight, and eleven. Reading achievement scores indicated that no great movement took place, although fourth, eighth and eleventh grades showed a slight drop. Across all curricular areas was the concern that students were not performing well on test items requiring higher order thinking skills (analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and problem-solving). Student factors most important in explaining performance levels were student expectations/standards of performance, number of relevant courses taken, and parental influences. School size was the strongest single influence among school factors and performance was higher in high schools with more than 215 students. The report provides support for at least four major reforms: (1) establishment of learner outcomes at the state and local  levels; (2) need for a statewide assessment process; (3) reorganization and/or consolidation of small high schools; and (4) state initiative for early childhood education to increase levels of achievement.

        "description":"Evaluation as a political arbitration entity is discussed in the case of a multilateral literacy development project in the fourth year of operation in a Third World country. An external evaluation team was invited to evaluate the project when conflict appeared between the funding agency (A) and the technical agency (B) over a project-related issue: the extension of an expired Instructional Materials Expert (IME) position. Agency A felt that IME tasks were completed, while B felt that the post extension was B's decision. The recommendations of the evaluation team were organizational and dealt with personnel issues: (1) an exit date to transfer project responsibility from A and B to government agents; (2) a change from project supervision to government advisor for a technical  agent in preparation for B team exit; and (3) a four-month government funded extension of the IME position. The paper concludes that evaluation is political in its genesis, political as a process, and political in its effects. This means that evaluators must begin with collecting political data of relevance to the evaluation action, and must learn to take account of political intelligence in the process of generating, interpreting, and utilizing technical information.

From a very large sample of students taking the GRE in October 1981, subpopulations were selected with respect to race, sex, field of study, and level of performance (defined by GRE analytical test scores). The variance error of equated scores between the forms was calculated, and conversions were made between the test forms. Departures of the conversions, based on each of these special samples from the population conversion, were calculated and evaluated in terms of the standard error of equating at five selected raw score points on Form D3, adjusted for disparity between the means, as well as variance,  skewness, and kurtosis for these populations and the corresponding total populations. The conversions for the Physical Science subpopulation were significantly different from the total population. When adjustments were made for variance, skewness, and kurtosis, these conversions fell in line for the homogeneous GRE quantitative test, but not so clearly for the heterogeneous verbal-plus-quantitative test. Conversions for all other subpopulations were acceptably within range. The assumption of population-independence for equating was supported for homogeneous but not heterogeneous tests. (Author/GDC)",

This decline may be due to the fact that teachers have come to believe that the kinds of objective items used in national standardized tests are the only item types appropriate for classroom use. The points stressed for improving classroom tests include: (1) teachers should use the item form that is most natural and convenient for a particular academic subject, instead of predominantly relying on the multiple-choice item test; (2) teachers should learn the usefulness of performance and identification items when writing items, especially in courses that include laboratory work; and (3) teachers should use the improved design of  free-answer items (that is, medical diagnosis items, in-basket items, etc).

          "Brand, Alice G."],
        "description":"The Brand Emotions Scale for Writers (BSEW) is a 20-item scale designed to measure the emotions of writers; (1) immediately before writing (state-before), (2) immediately after writing (state-after), and (3) when writing in general (trait). This paper describes the development of BSEW and the factor structure of these three different forms. Common factor analyses (orthogonal rotation) yielded two factors for each of the three forms (state-before, state-after, and trait when writing) accounting for 36 percent, 42 percent and 44 percent of the total variance, respectively. The item composition of the two factors, labeled positive and negative, were very similar across the three forms. The BSEW appears to be an internally consistent instrument. The paper states: (1) that research  using these scales can investigate emotional change due to writing by comparing before- and after-writing emotions; (2) that these emotions can also be measured during the writing process; and (3) that mediating variables associated with any changes can be identified. The appendices contain a demographic data sheet, as well as both forms S and TWW of the BSEW. A five-page list of references is included. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"The comparability of Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) Verbal and Mathematical scores was investigated for one nonhandicapped and nine handicapped populations. The handicapped populations included hearing impaired, visually impaired, learning disabled, and physically disabled students. Special methods of test administration included Braille and large type tests, and administration by a cassette tape. A simple two-factor model based on Verbal and Mathematical item parcels was tested with respect to: the number and intercorrelation of factors; the pattern of factor loadings; and the equality of scale units. The model provided a reasonable fit in all populations, with the mathematical reasoning factor generally showing a better fit. Compared with the nonhandicapped population, these  factors were less correlated in most of the handicapped groups. This somewhat greater specificity implied the increased likelihood of achievement growth in one area independent of the other, suggesting that the two scores be interpreted separately rather than as an SAT composite. The presence of two verbal factors was suggested, particularly for the learning disabled. There was evidence that multiple-choice mathematical items led to different observed score scale units for the learning disabled students taking a cassette administration, suggesting that mathematical scores underestimate the reasoning ability of these students.

        "description":"A method for drawing inferences from complex samples is based on Rubin's approach to missing data in survey research. Standard procedures for drawing such inferences do not apply when the variables of interest are not observed directly, but must be inferred from secondary random variables which depend on the variables of interest stochastically. This method allows reasonable inferences to be made. The key is to represent knowledge about latent variables in the form of a predictive distribution, conditional on manifest variables. It is then possible to obtain the expectations of statistics that would have been computed if the values of the latent variables corresponding to sampled units were known, along with variance estimators that account for uncertainty due to both subject  sampling and the latency of the variables. (A numerical example is presented, using data from the Profile of American Youth (1980). Possible responses to four arithmetic reasoning items from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery were studied for Black male and female and White male and female populations). (GDC)",

        "description":"The increasing use of microcomputers and hand-held calculators has implications for mathematics and science instruction, achievement testing, and educational research. The potential effects of these technologies on curricula involve both content and delivery. In mathematics instruction, the focus may shift from manipulative to higher order skills. In both science and mathematics, instructional delivery will include the use of computers and calculators to demonstrate concepts, teach through experimentation, and teach through programming. The curricular validity of achievement tests may be threatened--in particular, those administered through the Admissions Testing Program and the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. Threats to credibility are  linked to the perception that programs that ignore technology are out-of-date, and to the view that tests dictate curricula. Further research is needed to: (1) survey the curricula in high school and first-year college science and mathematics; (2) analyze the content of Advanced Placement and Admissions Testing Program mathematics and science tests in relation to curricular trends; (3) explore the implications of developing new test items versus new tests; (4) assess the implications of allowing the use of calculators during testing; and (5) develop, administer, and analyze a computer based laboratory science test.

        "description":"A number of hypotheses were tested concerning elements of Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) items that might affect the performance of blacks and whites differently. These elements were characteristics common to several items that otherwise measured different concepts. Seven general hypotheses were tested in the form of sixteen specific hypotheses, most with five or six items. Items were developed in pairs, some with and others without the hypothesized element, and were administered within the GRE analytical, verbal, and quantitative sections. Log linear analyses of the sixteen hypotheses showed interactions between group membership and item version, indicating a differential effect on black and white examinees' performance. A latent trait approach was also used to examine  individual item bias for eight of the hypotheses. The manipulations included context clues, item format, vocabulary, selecting the false rather than the true answer in a multiple choice item, understanding the item writer's inference, test wiseness, location of the correct response, and ambiguity versus structure. It was concluded that the item manipulations did have differential effects on blacks' and whites' performance. However, the complexity of the effects suggested that other uncontrolled factors affecting performance were present. (Author/GDC)",

The models, which approximated the traditional three-parameter model, included: (1) the Rasch one-parameter model, operationalized in the BICAL computer program; (2) an approximate three-parameter logistic model based on coarse group data divided into fifths and twentieths, and using the Quantile modification of the LOGIST program; and (3) a modified three-parameter logistic model with fixed a's and c's, using the LOGIST computer program. The data came from a study of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), which involved the chain equating of a test to itself through five intermediary forms; approximately 2,670 cases were used for each SAT form. Results showed that item calibrations  based on twentieths were closer to the true values and to LOGIST estimates than those based on fifths, but the equating results based on twentieths were not more accurate. Method (2) yielded highly accurate score conversions in equating a test to itself, and all three models yielded very accurate equating results. Questions were raised about the adequacy of equating a test to itself as a criterion for evaluating equating results. Further research was recommended before adopting any of the approximate models. Twelve tables and 22 figures are appended. (Author/GDC)",

Interviews were conducted in six provinces with administrative personnel, principals, and teachers. Employers and post-secondary institutions, as consumers of evaluation, were also surveyed. A model was developed for the relationships between evaluation, teaching, learning, time on task, students' self-concept and school attitudes, and teacher attitudes. Results indicated that achievement testing was common but little use was made of test results. There was increasing reliance on testing, and less on consultants, to assist in educational quality control. Employers were generally more  concerned with attitudes and behavior than grades; banks and insurance companies were most interested in grades. Colleges were concerned about the comparability of schools' grades. The following recommendations were made: (1) raise the status of evaluation; (2) develop promotional materials discussing and explaining student evaluation; (3) establish a task force on evaluation and technological change within each province; (4) organize regional conferences on student evaluation; and (5) conduct a study of teachers' skills, attitudes, and feelings about evaluation.

As defined in this review, differential item characteristics are exhibited when examinees from one group have a lower probability of answering correctly than do examinees of equal ability from another group. An item is assumed to be free of bias if the probability of responding correctly, given total score, is the same for all subpopulations. Other major methods of identifying differentially performing items and their limitations are briefly summarized: analysis of variance; transformed item difficulties; chi-square; and factor analysis. Twelve studies are reviewed. Subjects generally included black and white students; in some cases,  hearing impaired students and Canadians were included. Comments by Petersen, Lord, and Ironson are also summarized. It is concluded that the three-parameter model's advantages include the relationship of the probability of a correct response to underlying examinee ability level and item characteristics; the model's ability to take guessing into account; and the fact that item parameters are sample-independent and invariant across groups. The model's limitations are also described; it is often difficult to use and impossible to apply. Sample sizes must be at least 1,000 and there should be at least 40 items to be analyzed. (GDC)",

Scores are reported by each Skill area and each Essential Competency. A student must correctly answer 28 of the Basic Skills questions and 33 of the Other Life Skills questions to demonstrate mastery of the 14 Essential Competencies. If mastery is not demonstrated on any one Skill area, the entire test must be retaken. Individual Competency scores are reported to assist the teacher in evaluating areas of weakness that must be  attended to for the individual student. Administering the HSTEC to ninth grade students provides an additional year in which to utilize instructional strategies designed to assist students who might be most in need of the additonal time.

Twenty-one controlled studies, that provided sufficient data for the calculation of effect size, were coded in terms of measurement method (toward long- versus short-term goals) and type of achievement outcome (probe-like versus global achievement test). Analogues to analysis of variance conducted on weighted unbiased effect sizes (UES's) indicated an interaction: when progress was measured toward long-term goals, UES's on global measures were higher than on probe-like outcomes; when progress was measured toward series of short-term goals, the reverse was true. As demonstrated in this meta-analysis, short-term goal measurement may  be misleading. Students may master a series of instructional objectives, even though progress may be limited on more global indices of achievement which better represent the true desired outcome performance. Consequently, for special education teachers who monitor mastery of short-term objectives, caution may be in order: curriculum-based assessment of long-term goals may represent a necessary supplementary strategy for validly assessing pupil progress.

Flexible enough to accommodate any teacher education program, it promotes longitudinal research; allows for individual, group and collaborative research; and can be fitted into an administrative schema for decision-making. Five evaluation projects utilizing the framework are briefly described: (1) selection and development of teacher education candidates; (2) teachers' perceptions of their educational programs; (3) the evaluation of the preservice competence of Alberta teachers; (4) becoming a teacher; and (5) alternative practicum experiences for education students.

Part 1, Procedures for Researchers, outlines steps to be used in guiding the research process to achieve indepth, qualitative interviews with a group of the original sample members who were studied over a 15-year period. It includes guidelines and procedures for project management (securing the sample and human subjects clearance, preparing the research materials, planning for interviewers, handling data from taped interviews) and examples of resources (contact and follow-up letters, receipt for cash payment, points for interviewer/respondent contacts, sample transcription segment). Part 2, Interviewer's Manual and Videotapes, is a procedural training guide covering project history,  interviewer's responsibilities, interviewing techniques, survey vs. qualitative interviewing, conducting interviews, location strategies, and the guided interview booklet. It also includes a description of videotapes developed to accompany the manual for use in training interviewers. On tape, regional committee members discuss the manual and show actual interview situations (simulated views and experiences) representative of situations interviewers will likely encounter. The tapes and the manual may be used in group training sessions or read and viewed by individuals. Appendices contain a background sheet for the interviewer, location strategies, and a 30-page questionnaire booklet. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"This study identifies distinguishing differences in lecture delivery styles of lecturers rated by students in a large multi-instructor course: the Introduction to Clinical Medicine Course (ICM). The 20 lowest- and highest-rated lecturers of the 1982 and 1983 ICM courses served as the target group. Non-student raters observing the 1984 lectures completed the 49-item 6-option Lecture Characteristics Scale (LCS). The reliability of consensus ratings was greater than .70, indicating sufficient reliability to be used in subsequent analyses. To examine the relationship of student ratings of lecturers to observer LCS scores, t tests were completed for LCS subscores between the high and low rated lectures. For all six LCS subscores, statistically significant differences between the high  and low lecturers were obtained. Out of 49 LCS items, 31 showed differences in means between the low and high groups that were statistically significant. Conclusions were: (1) student ratings of the most and least positively rated lectures showed a fair amount of stability across the three years studied; (2) independent observers were able to discriminate between lectures which students rated the highest and lowest; and (3) characteristics that discriminated the most effectively between the high and low rated lectures were the qualities associated with introduction/organization and student involvement.

        "description":"The psychometric properties of an instrument designed to assess study behaviors of college and university students were examined. A convenience sample of 1052 undergraduates at a group of midwestern colleges and universities and at a four-year college in a United States Caribbean territory responded to the Study Behavior Inventory (SBI), Form D. A series of factor analyses using the principal components model with iteration and varimax rotations yielded three factors composed of items which appear to deal with feelings of competence, preparation for daily routine academic tasks, and preparation for special academic tasks (e.g., term papers and examinations). Internal consistency reliability estimates for the entire instrument and the items in each of the three factors ranged from  .70 to .88. The findings indicated that the SBI is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing study behaviors. It is suggested that providers of developmental education and other study skills program should consider including a strong counseling component in their offerings and that it may be useful to view study behaviors as consisting of two sets of activities directed toward short term, routine goals and toward long range, specific goals, respectively.

First, the relationship of formative evaluation to the range of special education assessment practice and its importance to the field are described. Then, four critical issues in formative evaluation methodology are discussed: focus of measurement, frequency of measurement, data display, and data-utilization methods. The reviewed research supports the use of ongoing criterion-referenced monitoring systems to improve the instructional programs of mildly handicapped students. Research also provides the basis for several statements on the nature of effective monitoring systems among mildly handicapped populations.  Specifically, the data base supports the use of (1) certain empirically validated critical behaviors as the focus of monitoring activity; (2) long-term goal statements that may encourage teachers to focus not only on the immediate instructional content, but also on maintenance and generalization of skills; and (3) relatively ambitious goals that support task persistence and striving. The literature also provides a rationale for teachers to measure student performance at least twice weekly; to graph data using their preferred convention; and to employ data-utilization rules for determining when, and perhaps how, to modify students' instructional programs.

Although factor analysis is usually used to identify within-set factors, results from this method were used in comparison to those from canonical correlation, or multivariate analysis. Canonical correlation analysis was used with applications of three different orthogonal (varimax criterion) rotation strategies: (1) simultaneous, symmetrical, and joint rotation of two sets of related factors; (2) an asymmetrical rotation of each set's correlations to its canonical variates; and (3)  simultaneous, symmetrical rotation of a single composite set of factors.

Two experimental treatments were used, varying the personalization used in mailing the questionnaire. The six-page instrument concerned the use of achievement tests in the classroom. Two follow-ups were sent. The overall response rate was an acceptable 80 per cent. A log linear model was used to analyze the effects of five variables on survey returns: personalized salutation, original signature, grade level taught, sex, and population of the school's location. The  response rate was significantly higher from rural areas and small towns than from larger towns. The personalization aspects did not significantly affect response rates, but an interactive effect was suggested. There were no significant effects of sex or of grade level taught. However, there were differential responses to the first, second, and third mailings by geographic locale, sex, and grade level taught. General conclusions regarding respondent characteristics would be potentially dangerous, without considering the number of follow-ups as a factor. (GDC)",

The paper outlines an approach that would include having high academic expectations and a strong curriculum, early identification of potential college-bound students, an appropriate information system, adequate preparation for the testing and application processes, and strategies for using teacher, parent, and community resources. The monograph includes a listing of resources such as college guides, financial aid information, and community and professional organizations that serve Hispanics. (CG)",

Changes in average family income are examined, as well as income changes in a variety of socioeconomic groups. Comparisons are provided of current and past economic performance and changes in the sources of family income. The major findings were: 1)average real income increased between 1967 and 1973 and declined between 1973 and 1984; 2) these changes contrast with the 1949-1969 period, when incomes grew rapidly for all families; 3) the period from 1967-1984 was one of rising income inequality, with income declines in the lower 40% of families and increases in the top 40%; 4) poverty in families  with children has increased in the 1967-1984 period due in part to growth of female-headed households; 5) income decreases would have been even greater over the recent past had it not been for the increase in working women; 6) working wives raised mean family income and reduced poverty in the bottom fifth of the population from 1967-1984; and 7) while the real level and poverty-reducing effects of cash transfers have declined since 1973, transfers still reduce poverty significantly. These findings are examined in detail throughout the report and are illustrated in tables of statistical data. (CG)",

        "description":"An historical overview of African and Afro-American music, from the foundations in sub-Saharan African music to the music of the 1980s, is presented in this paper as evidence that Afro-American music is closely intertwined with ethnic identification and follows the direction of Afro-American sociopolitical change. Slave and folk music, minstrel shows, the blues, jazz, rock, soul, and disco are among the musical forms discussed. It is argued that the combination of three main musical forms (folk, popular, and classical) has provided the foundation for all subsequent variations. Black music retains the polyrhythmic, polyphonic, improvisatory nature of its African foundation and was carried in the &quot;ethnic baggage&quot; that the African slaves brought to America. Although styles, and  occasionally structure, have changed since slavery and continue to do so, the basics still apply, however subtly. African music is part of the &quot;race memory&quot; of Afro-Americans and presents itself in contemporary black American music whether or not blacks are aware of it. The history of Afro-American music parallels the history of African people in America. (KH)",

In summary the findings are as follows: (1) there has been a very large increase in educational attainment since 1940 and Americans are substantially more educated than people in other developed nations. (2) Benefits to society were found in reduced inequalities in attainment and contributions to economic growth. (3) The lack of decline in individual income inequality does not necessarily imply that increases in education do not have significant effects on the earnings of individuals attaining that education. (4) Surveys of the achievement score trends showed that there seems to have been a sizeable decline since the mid-1960s as well as large and persisting  differentials by various socioeconomic groups. (5) The quality of schooling seems to have declined in the 1970s, and the current \"back to basics\" movement does not seem very promising. (6) The survey of resource use and education costs discovered a very sharp rise in cost per student in both elementary and secondary schools starting in the early 1960s. (7) The analysis of college education and the economy found that the pecuniary return on college education has declined beginning in the late 1960s; however, recent movements in data on income and occupation, cross-classified by educational attainment, suggest that the positive impact of college education may be on the rise.

        "description":"This paper considers the earnings of refugees and their utilization of financial assistance programs, including Food Stamps and several cash assistance programs. The first section provides a summary of available data on refugee earnings, emphasizing the 1975 cohort of Indochinese refugees, on whom substantial information is available; data on later arrivals is presented as well. The data are presented in the form of statistical tables which are analyzed. The second section discusses what is known or can be estimated about the use of cash and Food Stamp programs by refugees. Factors which appear to correlate with high or low use rates are discussed. The third section considers four policy issues the United States faces in making decisions about refugee assistance utilization: (1)  the nation's motivation in being concerned about Indochinese refugees' utilization of public funds; (2) the treatment of this disadvantaged group as compared to that of other disadvantaged groups; (3) the role of cash and food stamp assistance programs for refugees as compared to the role (and size) of other programs for refugees designed to make them more self-sufficient; and (4) alternative approaches to humanely reduce refugee dependence on assistance programs. The paper includes two methodological appendices which discuss: (1) the techniques used to estimate the total utilization of assistance programs, and (2) the continuing data collection and analysis problems in the resettlement field.

        "description":"This final report describes and evaluates the Favorable Alternate Sites Project (FASP), developed in response to the oversettlement of refugees (particularly Southeast Asian refugees) in particular areas of the country. The project's goals were to reduce welfare dependency, increase the ability of FASP refugees to be self-supporting, and reduce emigration. The findings in this report are based on two-week site visits to Arizona and North Carolina in February 1983 and March 1984 as well as on interviews with various staff involved with the project. Following an introductory chapter, Chapters II and III describe FASP implementation in Arizona and North Carolina, including information on the states' role, the role of private agencies, job placement and vocational training,  English-as-a-second-language classes, FASP resettlement versus other resettlement, and outcomes of migration and employment. Chapter IV analyzes the findings from the two states, concluding that a low welfare dependency rate was achieved in both states (less than 1% in Phoenix, 9% in Charlotte, 13% in Greensboro, and 27% in Tucson as compared to 82% for typical refugees in their first year). Emigration from the sites varied greatly (3% from Greensboro, 52% from Charlotte, 27% from Tucson, and 45% from Phoenix). The meanings of these findings are analyzed. The report concludes with a discussion of the influence of specific design features of the project on outcomes. Extensive appendices give information about the project workers and case histories of the refugees served. (CG)",

        "author":["Meade, Phil"],
        "description":"The findings of a longitudinal survey of the educational experiences of 3043 immigrant secondary school students in Sydney, Australia, are provided in this book. The general aim of the study was to compare the experiences of students of non-English speaking (NES) origin and students born in English speaking countries (ES) in terms of the influences of significant others, students' perceptions, aspirations, and school performance, and equality of educational opportunity. There are seven chapters, the first of which briefly describes the background of the research. Chapter 2 discusses theoretical issues. In Chapter 3, students' family and social experiences are analyzed, and particular attention is paid to the language of communication networks within NES-origin families. The  attitudes of students and teachers toward NES-origin children learning their parents' language are also discussed. Chapter 4 focuses on the educational and occupational aspirations of children and their parents. The influences of parents, peers, and teachers on students' aspirations are examined. In Chapter 5, measures of intellectual abilities and the school accreditation levels and performance of students are reported, and classified in terms of such variables as sex, family socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. The development of strategies to test &quot;equality of educational opportunity&quot; is the focus of Chapter 6. Finally, Chapter 7 summarizes and discusses the study findings, and relates them to those reported in earlier reports on Sydney students' and parents' perceptions of schooling.  (KH)",

The questionnaire instructed respondents to describe their perceptions of research needs and exemplary project needs related to computers in home economics education and to identify and describe computer-related research and exemplary projects completed, underway, or planned in home economics education. The 381 responses (out of a possible 809) included 218 questionnaires and 163 follow-up postcards. Of the 218 respondents, 77% were teacher educators, 15% state supervisors, and 8% &quot;other.&quot; The most frequently cited perceived research needs related to the concepts of  computers and learning and instructional software. The most frequently perceived exemplary project needs were computers and learning and instructional software. Analysis of research projects described indicated that action research studies were the most common, that the most common research subjects were inservice home economics teachers, and that most projects were comprehensive in content covered. Analysis of exemplary projects described showed that most provided inservice for teachers and dealt with software or courseware applications at the secondary level. In general, the directions of research projects identified were consistent with needs identified by professionals. The exemplary projects described appeared to be progressing toward stated needs for such programs. Appendixes  include summary tables and the survey instrument. The attached supplements to this report consist of two lists of respondent names (including institutions and addresses) and two sets of outline descriptions for the research and exemplary projects respectively.

Discussion follows of the social change strategies that possess demonstrated effectiveness and have contributed to the success of the Initiative. They are (1) obtaining support from the highest authority, (2) building a communication and relationship network, (3) obtaining administrative support and developing an administrative structure, (4)  developing a comprehensive plan, and (5) disseminating information about products to potential replicators.

        "description":"A plan was developed to improve followup study response rates by refining techniques for data collection and improving student motivation to respond to daily requests. Factors affecting response rate to followup surveys were investigated, and alternative approaches were recommended. Findings indicated that current procedures--two mailouts of questionnaires to program completers followed by computer-generated postcards--were insufficient. The recommended followup procedure involved inclusion of the Social Security number on the Brevard Community College (BCC) completer and leaver list to make cross-referencing with the feedback list easier and more accurate, continuation of a revised mailed questionnaire that includes only the state-mandated questions, and provision of information  concerning the impact of the new legislation about required placement rates in the cover letter. Another recommendation was increasing the amount of information gathered before a student leaves BCC through use of the accountability form for all vocational certificate programs and student completion of a program pre-completion form that provides employment data and name and address of an alternate contact. Upon implementation of the recommendations, the response rate substantially improved. Increased interest by instructors and division chairs helped in locating more graduates, and telephone calls to non-respondents contributed positively.

Part A describes &quot;Grab a Byte&quot; in terms of subjects (food and nutrition) and hardware requirements (Apple II and peripherals), indicates its suitability for 7th-10th grade individual or small group instruction, and lists accompanying materials (instructor and user guides, food list) and time estimate (25-40 minutes). Availability information includes cost ($30.00) and contact address. Part B  contains the evaluation criteria in eight categories; reviewer ratings appear as yes, somewhat, no, and not applicable, with explanatory comments. Part C summarizes the evaluation. The strengths of this program are its interesting, easy-to-follow game format and topic. A weakness is that answers are provided too readily in the Nutrition Sleuth section. Summary ratings in the eight categories include the following: subject matter, technical presentation, student interaction, and program interaction--yes; documentation--somewhat; and student evaluation, work behaviors and application programs--not applicable. The final rating highly recommends this courseware as a fun way to learn sound nutrition information. (SK)",

Findings were that a decrease in the number of young people (24 years old and younger) was accompanied by a significant increase in the 35- to 49-year-old group. Educational attainments of adults were below state averages. A relatively substantial work force was employed in manufacturing industries, many where application of modern manufacturing methods are pertinent. Projections indicated a 30 percent growth for engineering technicians and technologists. The Indiana Commission for Higher Education favored expansion of needed programs in Southern Indiana and  recognized the need for more technicians who can continue their studies to the baccalaureate level. A minimum annual recurring training requirement was calculated to be for 14 graduates as new labor force entrants into all types of manufacturing industries, plus related training needs for at least 15 adults now in the work force. Recommendations were for authorization to grant the CIM technology associate degree, adult continuing education and service courses to meet the CIM technology training needs, organization of an industrial advisory committee, and liaison with local high schools.

The innovative program selected as the subject of this ethnographic study was Georgia's parenting education program. Data were collected from field interviews of teachers, observations of parenting education classes, and analyses of various documents used in planning and implementing the parenthood education programs. The following eight education factors were found to influence the implementation of the innovations to which the parenthood education teachers were introduced in an inservice workshop: school structure, decision-making power, advisory committees, role of the workshop, resources, teacher commitment, and demands on teachers. The  interaction of the innovation and the school setting resulted in an alteration of both. As individual teachers attempted to implement the parenting class, they tested and sometimes modified existing policies and procedures; conversely, as the teachers experimented with ways of fitting the program into the existing school structure, the innovation itself was adapted to meet local needs.

Ilsley has identified five elements common to all literacy volunteer programs: purpose, scope, organizational control, professionalism, and finance. No single combination of these variables is appropriate for every station; instead, programs should be tailored to the needs of the group or community to be served. Likewise, selecting an appropriate administrative approach is important. Criteria for selecting volunteers, clarification of the  assumptions about volunteers that are held by the organization developing the literacy program, and specification of the relationship between organizational setting and the establishment of a climate for volunteer participation are some of the many considerations that must be addressed. Administrators deciding to incorporate volunteers into adult literacy programs must also consider the myths, advantages, and disadvantages associated with literacy volunteerism. There is no shortage of resources available for those wishing to develop administrative guidelines and procedures for adult literacy volunteer programs, with as much as three-fourths of the literature base being devoted to administrative aspects of program development.

        "description":"Language problems are likely the strongest single barrier to success facing limited English proficient (LEP) immigrants to the United States. Therefore, instruction in English as a second language (ESL) for immigrants must be given a high priority. Vocational ESL (VESL) provides adult immigrants with English skills on an as-needed basis in cooperation with a program of vocational training. The ESL teacher and the vocational trainer coordinate their efforts, thereby allowing students to see the connection between their needs and their English lessons. Because cultural laws have not been codified and are not formally taught, cultural adjustment may be more difficult for many LEP immigrants than learning English. Activities that allow students to experience real-world situations in  a nonthreatening environment are necessary to help LEP individuals build cultural self-confidence and adjust culturally. Techniques that have been found to be effective in VESL include introducing one concept at a time, using a slower pace in introducing information, using shorter lectures and more demonstrations, providing bilingual glossaries, explaining key concepts in the native language, using visual support materials, and modifying tests to evaluate mastery of content rather than English. The work experience and workplace training approaches are also effective in teaching employability skills. (MN)",

In the final analysis, however, it appears that although education does lead to a better job, how much better is determined by one's gender and race. Research on the relative need for training in basic, general employability and transferable skills indicates that training in proper work habits, attitudes, and interpersonal skills is generally considered as important to job success as is training in the basic skills. At least one researcher has hypothesized that although the schools are teaching the transferable skills necessary for employment (mathematics, communication, interpersonal, reasoning, and manipulative skills), students are not being taught how to  transfer these skills from school to work. Many young people and women entering or returning to the work force are not even aware of the transferability of their skills to the workplace. Most research indicates that the workplace remains the site of most learning concerning work. The current public education system must do more to show teachers how to teach transfer skills so that future workers will not see their skills as irrelevant, past accomplishments but will instead view them as tools for the future.

        "description":"Interactive video, a combination of computer-assisted instruction and video technology, is an important new development in instructional media. Because interactive video has its roots in individualized instruction, it is particulary useful in personalizing instruction by allowing students to proceed at their own pace (one of the tenets of programmed instruction) and to receive immediate feedback (an advantage made possible by the advent of computer-assisted instruction). Two main types of video technology are available: videotapes and videodiscs. Despite their higher cost, videodiscs overcome many of the drawbacks of videotapes, including slow access time, poor freeze-frame characteristics, and costly maintenance. Because video technology is fairly new, few programs are  available. For this reason, teachers and trainers desiring to develop interactive video instructional materials will require training in the five-step process of instructional systems design (ISD): analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. A research project conducted at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education illustrated the successful use of ISD in developing interactive video materials to train machine lathe operators. Other examples of interactive video in training include those produced and used by General Motors, IBM, and the American Heart Association. (MN)",

Until recently, most research on career and family patterns has focused on traditional sex roles. Although competition between career and family roles has caused pain in many families, recent research addressing the nontraditional roles of men and women indicates that most women do derive a sense of personal accomplishment from work and that most fathers who are more actively involved in parenting report that they have a better relationship with their children because of this involvement. Persons in dual-career families need to recognize that planning for career roles and planning for family roles are closely related tasks. Career  development programs are needed to help individuals develop career and family goals that are personally satisfying and mutually supportive of other family members. Such programs should focus on increasing awareness of current and future trends affecting the family-career connection, identifying and coping with family and career development stages that carry heavy role demands, addressing barriers to implementing family and career plans, and explaining the personal benefits of combining family and career.

The study found three standards that should be given highest priority for review, and three standards that clearly ranked lowest in priority. This finding indicates that sufficient agreement exists among school representatives  to use their perceptions as the basis for selecting clusters of standards for review and revision. Since only two or three standards can be addressed each year by the Committee on Standards, such information is important for the Committee. The study also found that the assignment of review priority ranks by school personnel is related to one demographic variable--type of school represented--and applies to less than half of the standards. The strategy used in this study offers a methodology that can be used by accreditation organizations to ascertain the perceptions of their clientele regarding evaluative standards and criteria. The results of such assessments can provide an objective basis for determining the sequence in which the review and revision of standards or criteria might be  addressed. (KC)",

        "description":"One hundred vocational administrators in Alabama responded to a questionnaire designed to determine the following: (1) the administrative tasks performed by secondary-level vocational education administrators; (2) the administrator tasks performed by deans of instruction in teachnical colleges; (3) the perceived competency level of administrators and deans to perform the task; and (4) the extent of general agreement among superintendents of education, secondary-level vocational administrators, and the program review reports with regard to the importance of competency areas and the related need for program improvement. The study found that the immediate professional development needs for secondary vocational administrators by task priority included developing a complete plan to  promote vocational education, conducting program promotional activities, developing a community involvement plan, and ensuring continuing communication with the advisory council, while intermediate needs included identifying alternative funding sources, influencing traditional funding sources to benefit the program, using needed data to identify the vocational programs and support services needed, and planning a staff development program. Immediate professional development needs for deans of instruction by task priority include operating an equipment preventive maintenance program and planning demonstration, pilot, and exemplary programs, while their intermediate needs include ensuring continuing communication with advisory councils, constructing a schedule conflict matrix, and organizing  a student learning resource center. The data may be useful in determining content to be included in professional development activities for vocational administrators. Five tables present detailed analyses of the study data.

Eighty-two of 102 recently hired registered nurses were included in the audit sample. The newly hired nurses, whose previous experience varied from less than 6 to more than 10 years of nursing experience, were required to take a 4-hour nursing process class that addressed 12 objectives, including clarifying the relationship between the nursing process and delivery of nursing care, distinguishing between a medical and nursing diagnosis, utilizing interviewing techniques, utilizing assessment information, reassessing patients, documenting the nursing process, and integrating the nursing process  into the unit's delivery of health care. Pre- and posttests were administered to the nurses to assess the effectiveness of the nursing process workshop. Overall, the study supported the position that the educational process for nurses must include not only the theory of nursing practice, but also a practical method of applying the theory to practice. For example, when the charting behavior of the nurses who attended the workshop was compared with that examined in a previous study, the workshop appeared to have a positive effect. (MN)",

Respondents were nearly 10,000 members of the 1980 high school seniors cohort of the High School and Beyond survey data set. Two types of forces expected to influence participation in employer-provided training were distinguished: incentive and opportunity. Five types of factors were components of these incentive and opportunity sets: education and work experience, personal and household characteristics, personal attitudes, location, and industry/occupational affiliation. Findings indicated 40 percent of the respondents had participated in some type of employer-provided training. No important difference in the overall participation patterns in training appeared between females and  males. Females spent 52 percent as many hours and 68 percent as many weeks in training compared to males. Conclusions were that different factors affect the incentives and opportunities upon which females and males acted, education and work experience appear to be more consistent correlates of female participation in training, the industry and occupational affiliation factors appear to dominate as correlates of participation in training, and employers offer training support as a substitute for alternative external sources of work skills enhancement.

The project identified features of the high school experience correlated with initial labor market success/failure of young workers and determined if the conditions of a successful transition have changed in the last decade. Data for the high school senior class of 1980 from the High School and Beyond Survey were compared to a sample from the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972. No clear evidence was found that the high school academic experience has led to the decline in labor market experience. For males, high school vocational programs improved dramatically between 1972 and 1980. Conversely, the cooperative vocational programs successful for  the class of 1972 no longer functioned well by 1980. Only weak evidence supported the notion that better disciplined study habits improved labor market outcomes. Hours spent on a job during the senior year were very important for early work experiences of youth. However, a better academic record was generally rewarded in the labor market. A greater emphasis on academic credit hours consistently was related negatively to wage rates, employment, and earnings. Vocational courses had a positive payoff. (Eleven tables are appended.)

        "author":["Hickey, Delina R."],
        "description":"A study examined the ways in which practitioners in four states were defining the terms coordination/cooperation/collaboration when directing the monies set aside in Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) funding for use in coordination among educators and job training providers. Case studies of the use of 8 percent set-aside monies were conducted in Colorado, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Texas, and practitioners working with JTPA programs in Alaska, Florida, and Washington were contacted. Attempts at cooperation were being made; however, terminology should be clarified to help practitioners understand what is expected of them. Technical assistance between levels of government is necessary to provide effective policy transmission. When this technical assistance is provided, a delicate  balance must be maintained between respect for a state's unique system of problem solving and the general values and goals created by Federal legislation. A circular model representing collaboration, cooperation, and coordination as concentric circles lying progressively closer to the central core of program outcomes was developed during the study. (Appendixes to this report include cross-references in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act and JTPA, a flowchart illustrating state levels of vocational education administration, sample questions asked during the study, information sources on the JTPA 8 percent set-aside, and five pages of references and suggested readings.)

Findings are that existing strategies for adopting computers are appropriate for handling human resource adjustments; careful planning is the key to effective integration; good basic skills continue to be critical; computer skills are an addition to, not a replacement for, other job skills; and education and training institutions should make changes in course  offerings and procedures. The staff report that comprises most of this document assesses some employment consequences of the \"computer revolution.\" Topics include the spread of computers, computers' effects on jobs, the role of human resource decisions, job loss and worker displacement, current estimates and projections of displaced workers, the amount of computer training workers need, and the role of educational institutions.

Chapter I presents an overview of the report, including a summary of findings and conclusions and recommendations for improving the employment conditions of older workers. Chapter II describes the general population and labor force trends over the last several decades and those projected for the future. Chapter III examines older workers' employment, unemployment, earnings, and income. It describes the extent and causes of the employment problems of older workers. Chapter IV discusses employer programs and practices and government programs designed to redress the employment problems of older Americans and to provide increased employment  opportunities for these individuals. Chapter V describes the relationship of retirement decisions to various public and private policies. Chapter VI presents the major conclusions of the study. The report explains that for all older workers, decisions concerning training, employment, and retirement are interconnected; these interconnections are important because policies affecting any one of them have implications for the others. Part B briefly describes completed and ongoing projects, organized according to four National Commission for Employment Policy work groups: Programs and Policies Project, National Employment Policy and Older Americans Project, Changes in the Workplace Project, and Special Projects.

        "description":"This study determined the validity of vocational interest scores for persons with high, medium, and low levels of experience appropriate to their predominant interests. The experiences and interests of a national sample of 1,380 young adults were assessed concurrently with scales paralleling Holland's types. The degree of congruence between inventoried interests and occupation pursued six years later was found to increase as interest-appropriate experience increased. Occupational group members who had a high level of interest-appropriate experience (i.e., those with \"verified interests\") scored as expected on the interest inventory--in sharp contrast to those with a low level of interest-appropriate experience. Implications for counseling include the following: (1) when a  counselee's predominant interests are not accompanied by relevant experiences, caution should be used in interest score interpretation; (2) the counselor and counselee may wish to review the extent to which experience and knowledge were brought to bear on responses to items on the interest scales with the highest scores; and (3) another approach would be to provide counselees with opportunities to engage in and evaluate the experiences they are lacking--and thereby evaluate their interests.

        "description":"A study examined current practices in purchasing nonmedical, vocational rehabilitation (VR) services from public and private VR facilities. Questionnaires were mailed to the 83 State VR agencies. The majority of the 57 respondents used the individual authorization without a contract or written agreement as a primary method of obtaining facility-based services. Most of these agencies offered no assurance with this type of method. Most State agencies indicated satisfaction with the type of service arrangements being used. The most popular method of determining a rate for services involved a facility-specific rate. Purchasing a unit of time was the most popular way of quantifying services purchased. Most agencies allowed facilities to renegotiate costs associated with providing a  service to the State agency after the terms of the service arrangement were agreed upon. Half the general agencies felt that a uniform nationwide system to determine costs associated with facility-based services should be established, whereas most of the agencies serving blind clients did not see a need for such a policy. (Appendixes to this report include the survey form, the survey followup letter, additional descriptive statistics, VR case status definitions, State agencies responding to the study, and a table summarizing sources of data for selected survey items.)

A 10-page, 55-question survey was mailed to the chief executive officers of a sample of 500 corporations on the Forbes 500 list, with a 69 percent return (345 usable responses). The questionnaire was intended to identify what kinds of corporations would be more likely to participate in collaborative efforts with schools, who initiates the collaboration, the kinds of partnerships, the motivations of the corporations to participate, and benefits of the partnership. Analysis of survey  responses showed that 73 percent of corporations work with schools, a majority with Adopt-A-School programs. Banks, utility companies, and insurance companies are the most likely corporate participants, although many other industries also participate. Most of the relationships consist of sending speakers, giving tours, and donating equipment. Motivations of the corporations to participate in school affairs include improving student academic achievement, improving career education, providing business role models for students, and promoting a favorable business image in the community. The study also found that having a relationship with schools improves the schools' image in the corporate mind. The study concluded, however, that business participation in schools is minimal, sporadic, and  has a small effect on education. (KC)",

        "description":"This study was conducted to investigate the attitudinal effects of presenting students with career information in two media forms, slide/tape and print. Subjects were 186 ninth-grade students from a junior high school in a lower-middle-class metropolitan area. Interviews with role models working in careers not traditional for their gender were used as a means of presenting the career information in both the slide/tape and print treatment groups. Students in a control group received no career information. All students completed an occupational survey to assess their attitudes about the suitability of eight jobs for both men and women and their own interest in and confidence of success in the jobs. The data were analyzed using three separate multivariate analyses of variance.  Students in both the slide/tape and print treatments were significantly more positive about the careers being suitable for both men and women than were students in the control group. Subjects also showed more positive attitudes toward jobs they learned about than jobs they did not learn about. Attitudes of students in the print group did not differ significantly from those in the slide/tape group. Students were significantly more interested in and confident of success in jobs traditionally for their own gender, and neither presentation had a significant effect on interest and confidence. Although both types of presentations produced positive changes in attitudes towards suitability of careers for both men and women, more comprehensive programs appear necessary to increase the probability  of changes in interest and confidence of success in nontraditional careers.

Women make up most of the occupational groups identified as \"administrative support,\" and they are particularly affected by the changes taking place in the workplace. The impact of new office technologies on clerical work is a subject of great concern to the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor. This concern extends to a wide variety of issues posed by the electronic office, including the following: (1) quality and content of the new jobs; (2) wages and status; (3) opportunities for mobility; (4) training and retraining; (5) health and safety factors; (6) equal opportunity aspects; (7)  electronic \"telework\" and remote office work; and (8) the quantity of jobs or clerical employment prospects. Current research suggests that clerical workers often are excluded from the planning and implementation decisions leading to technological change. Although office automation promises greater efficiency and productivity, decision makers should remember that these outcomes are not independent of the people who operate the new equipment. (KC)",

        "description":"The Adult Learner Project was a two-phase program in which a total of 10 community-level projects received funding to develop collaborative agendas that would meet the learning needs of adults in their respective communities. During the second phase of the project, the following community-level collaborative councils were also given $20,000 each: the Arizona Business-Industry-Education Council, serving the greater Phoenix area; the Career Development Council, serving the tricounty rural-industrial area around Corning and Elmira, New York; the Industry-Education Council of Contra Costa County, serving an area east of San Francisco Bay; San Mateo County Industry Education Council, serving the area surrounding San Francisco International Airport; and the Metropolitan Washington  Work-Education Council, serving jurisdictions in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. This time, however, grant recipients concentrated on the following areas: expanding adult learning through employment-based tuition aid programs, meeting learning needs of older and retired workers, and improving linkages between vocational-technical programs and economic development efforts. The projects demonstrated that most communities are rich in resources and opportunities to address adult learner issues and that these resources can be linked and tapped. Although communities tend to profess commitments to adult learner issues and support educational institutions, they tend to undervalue neutral third-party efforts to create institutional linkages.

        "description":"More than 2 million adults participate in programs provided by elementary and secondary schools, almost 8.5 million adults receive training from postsecondary schools, nearly 4.5 million participate in private employer-provided programs, and government agencies account for almost 4.5 million adult participants. Demographic data suggest that young, white, well-educated, higher-income, higher-occupational-status, employed adults have the highest participation rates. Reasons for nonparticipation are related to socioeconomic status, race, and prior educational attainments. Examination of training programs that have been successful in removing many of the barriers to participation in training, especially for adults in a career transition, indicate that successful programs are likely  to involve collaboration or partnership among business, education, organized labor, and community agencies; offer flexible curricula and scheduling; offer supportive services; combine modes of instruction; offer remedial instruction; encourage peer support groups; gear programs to the wants and needs of those being served; and provide training for emerging, high-demand jobs or careers. A single, longitudinal database is needed to provide information on patterns, reasons for, and barriers to participation in education and training. Also needed are alternative methods of data collection to improve assessment of the sociopsychological, situational, and structural barriers to participation in adult education and a research agenda providing for hard evaluation of program outcomes.

        "description":"A study examined employment in the fast-food industry. The national survey collected data from employees at 279 fast-food restaurants from seven companies. Female employees outnumbered males by two to one. The ages of those fast-food employees in the survey sample ranged from 14 to 71, with fully 70 percent being in the 16- to 20-year-old age range. The sample had a higher percentage of Blacks than the 1980 census (16 versus 12 percent) and a lower percentage of whites (77 versus 83 percent) and Hispanics (5 versus 6 percent). For the vast majority of fast-food employees, there is no link between job and schooling. Despite employees' strong interest in being promoted to management-level jobs (especially among minority workers), most restaurants recruited their management trainees  from outside the restaurant. As might be expected, the issue of &quot;overworked and underpaid&quot; was a clear concern among employees. On the positive side, employment in the fast-food industry did appear to offer an opportunity to develop a number of transferable, job-related skills. Employment in the fast-food industry appeared to have little effect on performance in school or the highest grade completed.

Data were obtained from a national survey of employees at 279 fast-food restaurants from seven companies in which 194 (4.2 percent) of the 4,660 respondents reported being Hispanic. Compared with the total sample, Hispanic fast-food employees were slightly less likely to be female (62 versus 66 percent) and somewhat younger (75 versus 71 percent below the age of 20). More Hispanic fast-food industry employees were in general rather than vocational or academic programs, with fully 18 percent not knowing which program they were in. The grades of the respondents were fairly high, with only 14 percent reporting grade averages of C or below. The work ethic appeared to be alive and well among the Hispanic  respondents, with 63 percent expecting work to be the central part of their lives and 85 percent saying they would work even if they didn't need to. Most planned to continue their education beyond high school. There was some link between employment in a fast-food restaurant and school for about one-fourth of the Hispanic respondents. As was true for their non-Hispanic counterparts in the survey, the Hispanic employees were able to learn a number of transferable job-related skills. (MN)",

An introduction provides an overview of the project on which the guidebook is based. Chapter 2 compares short- and long-term training programs in terms of duration, philosophy, organizational context, purpose, clientele, instructional staff, curriculum, and linkage with employers. Chapter 3 reviews evaluation models. Various ways to design an evaluation and evaluation criteria and standards are presented. The chapter also offers an  evaluation framework that incorporates evaluative criteria appropriate for short-term programs. Chapter 4 discusses key administrative concerns in planning and implementing evaluation. It presents guidelines for conducting all types of evaluation--evaluability assessment, needs assessment, input evaluation, process evaluation, outcome evaluation, impact evaluation, and cost benefit/cost effectiveness analysis. Chapter 5 presents additional guidelines for selecting an evaluation approach. Two innovative approaches are presented: aggregate program review and peer review. The chapter ends with the postcard model--an abbreviated method of evaluating very short programs. Four pages of references conclude the document. (YLB)",

It notes outstanding practices that may be replicated or transferred to strengthen U.S. apprenticeship. The publication begins by defining apprenticeships and outlining the unique features of U.S. apprenticeship, citing both its strengths and deficiencies. In the remainder of the work attention is given to improvements in seven deficiencies of U.S. apprenticeship: variable quality of training offered, inadequacies in the administration of apprenticeship, inadequate numbers trained, concerns about the cost effectiveness of apprenticeship, inadequate financing for certain apprenticeship programs, limited access to apprenticeships, and  unclear role and relationship to other training. Promising practices are detailed that may help remedy the problems identified. Recommendations regarding the transferability of practices are suggested, including broader training, regular curriculum review and updating, development of trade examinations, establishment of a resource center, Federal leadership, adoption of a system of Industrial Training Boards, recruitment of women, promotion of alternant training, and collaboration between vocational education and apprenticeship. The paper calls for communication and dialogue with other industrialized countries on the subject of apprenticeship and industrial training. Nine pages of references conclude the report. (YLB)",

The remainder of the paper focuses exclusively on educational and training processes that contribute to preparation for work. Section 2 is a descriptive inventory of the extent and nature of such processes. Four major categories of institutions that play a role in these processes are described: formal preschool programs, regular education, adult education and training, and  federally financed employment and training programs. Section 3 reports the best available evidence on the effectiveness of four major systems of human capital development: Head Start, public primary and secondary education, federally financed employment and training programs for economically disadvantaged persons, and training for dislocated workers. Section 4 presents recommendations for public policy: increasing human resource flexibility, expanding compensatory preschool education, increasing the Federal role in primary and secondary education, expanding employment and training programs, and attaining efficiency and equity in social policy.

Data from a survey of 3,412 employers that was sponsored by the National Institute of Education and the National Center for Research in Vocational Education in 1982 indicated important differentials between firms with respect to the prevalence and power of merit-based pay. Although workers' reported productivity relative to peers had important and reasonably rapid effects on relative wage rates at small- and medium-sized nonunion establishments, it had almost no effect at unionized establishments with more than 100 employees and at nonunion  establishments with more than 400 employees. Relative wage rates did respond positively to the large differences in productivity between workers doing the same job; however, these responses were incomplete. When considered against the background of the inevitability of significant errors in measuring productivity, the wage differentials of employees with about 1 year of tenure create a strong a priori case that compensation for greater productivity is often only partial.

        "description":"Wage rates and earnings give misleading signals to public and private policymakers as to the benefits of certain kinds of education and training investments. These misleading signals result from the fact that (1) workers and employers prefer employment contracts that either do not recognize or only partially recognize differences in productivity among workers doing the same job and (2) important dimensions of education and training accomplishment are often not signaled to potential employers and therefore have limited influence on the allocation of workers to jobs. Consequently, there are significant productivity differentials between workers receiving the same pay for the same job, and some of these are related to educational and training achievements that are not efficiently  signalled. In light of these findings, policymakers in the education and training sectors should learn to generate better signals of the learning that occurs in school or on the job on the assumption that if employers have access to information on the competency that job applicants have developed in school they will use it. The second response to the problem should be to restructure the system of rewards and recognition in high schools.

        "description":"A study examined the impact of recruitment policies on the flow of job applicants and quality of new workers. The process of determining a recruitment and selection strategy appeared to be one of considering the trade-offs between engaging in extensive search (high number of applicants per offer) or intensive search (great amount of time spent per applicant) while minimizing the indirect costs of hiring. The number of job-seeker contacts was more responsive to variables describing the probability and number of vacancies than measures of attractiveness of the job. Most firms had a sufficiently autonomous flow of job seekers to avoid undertaking new recruitment efforts each time they had a vacancy. It appeared that since competition forces all firms to pay wages roughly equal to  the market's assessment of a worker's generalized productivity, a firm can profit from hiring a worker only if (1) it has information about the worker not available to other employers that implies the worker is better than the market seems to think or (2) the worker has a comparative advantage in working at that firm.

Data on these questions were obtained from a survey of 2,264 employers that was sponsored by the National Institute of Education and the National Center for Research in Vocational Education in 1982. As hypothesized, stockpiling had a positive impact on extensive search as measured by the number of applicants interviewed. However, intensive search as measured by the number of hours spent per applicant significantly declined with stockpiling. Firms using the stockpiling strategy received 33 percent more phone calls and 35 percent more visits, and they accepted 44 percent more  applications. When filling a job vacancy, larger firms called prior applicants at a much higher rate (58 percent for firms with more than 250 employees versus 27 percent for firms with fewer than 10 employees). Stockpiling was most common for service jobs and least common for professional and managerial jobs. Thus, likelihood of job vacancy and lack of specialized job requirements were associated with use of the stockpiling strategy. Unionized firms were significantly more likely to interview prior applicants. (MN)",

        "description":"This paper contains two addresses on improving the quality of correctional education through vocational education research and resources. In the first part, Osa Coffey, Executive Director of the Correctional Education Association, speaks of the need for research and resources in vocational education for incarcerated persons. She states that the field today lacks clear direction and purpose, but is nevertheless ready for improvement and change. She outlines corrections today, the educational needs of inmates, the scope of current educational service delivery, the cost of corrections, the goal of correctional education, and research and resource needs in correctional education. She concludes that the services of researchers and the National Center for Research in Vocational  Education are greatly needed to ensure that inmates receive the education they need to change their lives. In the second part of the paper, Dianne Carter, a corrections programs specialist at the U.S. Department of Education, presents a summary of some of those characteristics that she believes are common among good correctional education programs. She divides these characteristics into four categories: environmental characteristics, administrative leadership, instructional personnel, and instructional content and strategies. Before discussing these, she briefly describes the offender population. She concludes that partnerships between educational researchers and correctional facilities are needed to improve programs. (The paper includes a record of the question-and-answer session,  criminal justice and correctional education statistics, prison population statistics, a policy statement on correctional education by the U.S. Department of Education, and references.)

Today, vocational education's contributions to economic growth include efforts such as employer demand research, dislocated worker programs, strategies for school/business linkages, and entrepreneurship education. Following a short history and rationale for the connection between vocational education and economic growth, this paper (1) describes a variety of connections between vocational education and economic growth and their underlying theoretical foundations, (2) notes the historical context in which the connections were shaped, (3) lists policy initiatives that were  stimulated by the various connections, and (4) suggests future vocational education policy issues to be resolved in order to maximize the effects of vocational education on economic growth. Throughout the paper, the ways in which vocational education supports growth are divided into four types that reflect different periods in the nation's economic history: traditional, locational, emerging, and potential. The discussion is restricted to vocational education provided by the public sector, on which public policy can have a direct effect. Questions and answers on school-business cooperation, entrepreneurship education, and skill training in relation to economic growth follow the presentation. (KC)",

        "description":"Following some years of eclipse by the basics, imparting thinking ability to students is once again emerging as the primary goal of public education. How to teach thinking skills, is, however, subject to question. For example, not only is the domain of the higher order skills broad and imprecisely specified, there is also considerable naivete in the public's perception of the conditions under which thinking skills are learned. In particular, recent legislative actions are based on unexamined assumptions about the conditions under which these skills are learned. In response to the reform rhetoric, many states have mandated increased science and mathematics requirements for all students for high school graduation. These requirements are based on the belief that reasoning, problem  solving, and learning skills are best taught in these courses. However, there are concepts that educators should be aware of; for example, (1) not all students have the ability to attain higher order cognitive skills; (2) mathematics and science are not the only ways for teaching these skills; (3) high school is too late to begin teaching thinking skills; (4) experiences with physical systems play a considerable part in development of basic mental operations; (5) less able students need detailed instruction; and (6) rote performance is inferior to performance with understanding. It is important that educators keep these ideas in mind as they look for ways to teach thinking skills. Vocational education can play an important role in teaching these skills; science and mathematics are not the  only way. (Several problem-solving examples are provided in this paper.) (KC)",

Data on a national probability sample of approximately 800 adult literacy programs that was collected by the Center for Statistics through its Fast Response Survey System indicated that in spring 1985 adult literacy instruction was provided in an estimated 2,900 adult education programs offered through school districts, community colleges, and adult learning centers, as well as in an estimated 1,300 local adult literacy programs (LALPs), including volunteer groups, community-based organizations, other private literacy organizations, and libraries. About half of the adult education programs and nearly all the LALPs used volunteers. Five types of  programs were offered: basic literacy, pre-General Educational Development (GED) examination, GED, oral English-as-a-second language (ESL), and oral and written ESL instruction. Approximately 729,000 persons received instruction during a 1-month period in 1985. Volunteers were used in the following capacities: one-to-one tutoring, teaching small groups, serving as teacher's aides, and teaching classes. Lack of people to volunteer was cited as the main barrier to using volunteers. Ninety-six percent of the programs using volunteers provided training for them, with 86 percent providing an average of 13 hours preservice training for new volunteers. In 80 percent of the programs training was conducted by program staff or other volunteers. Fifty-nine percent of the programs used Laubach  Literacy Action materials and 43 percent used in-house materials. Forty percent of the programs surveyed rated their volunteers as excellent, 51 percent as good, 7 percent as fair, and 2 percent as poor. (MN)",

        "description":"School desegregation has been promoted as a means for decreasing racial hostility and for raising minority achievement. A study was conducted to explore the effects of school organizational structure on the race/gender composition of interacting social networks of adolescents attending two middle schools. While the schools varied in the opportunities provided for interactions among classmates, each had a student body similar in socioeconomic status and percentages of white and black students. Middle School (MS) had interdisciplinary, multigrade team organization with random assignment of students resulting in a heterogeneous student population. Junior High (JH) had ability tracking with limited student interaction. Data were collected from 345 seventh graders at JH and 332  seventh graders at MS. Students rated how often they talked with all other students in their grade. Factor analysis was used to describe the social networks existing at each of the schools. By controlling opportunities for interactions, school structure was found to affect the size, race, and gender of social groups and linkages between them. The results indicated that: (1) black males were better represented in white social networks at MS than at JH; (2) black females were equally accepted in both schools; and (3) acceptance of whites by blacks was generally better at MS than at JH. These results suggest that a school's structure is important in fostering interracial relationships. References and data tables are appended. (Author/NRB)",

        "description":"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has been receiving considerable attention by the medical community as well as by the public. This attention is due to the rapid increase in cases of AIDS, the uncertain etiology of the disease, and the poor prognosis of the disease. Although some research has investigated the psychological impact of AIDS on its victims, little research has been conducted on the psychological impact of AIDS on the medical staff caring for AIDS patients. In an attempt to examine this impact, eight nurses and four physicians involved in the care of an AIDS patient and a matched, non-AIDS patient responded to four self-report measures which assessed the psychological distress associated with working with each patient. Compared to working with the non-AIDS  patient, the physicians and nurses reported experiencing increased anxiety, greater interference in non-work activities, more frequent negative ruminations, and negative perceptions regarding the patient's behavior while working with the AIDS patient. These findings support previous anecdotal reports that medical staff do experience psychological distress when working with an AIDS patient. Because of the fears and concerns engendered in medical personnel by providing care to AIDS patients, psychological and educational interventions are needed to reduce staff's discomfort and thereby facilitate optimal care of AIDS patients.

        "description":"Child abuse involves more than the use of corporal punishment with a child. Investigators have measured parents' emotional reactivity and attributions in relation to aversive child behavior. A &quot;video recall&quot; procedure has been used for assessing affective responding of adults engaged in marital conflict and has been valid for obtaining self-reports of affect in marital interaction. Another approach to studying emotional reactivity uses imagery to recreate sensory cues that precede or accompany anger and arousal. A third variation for bridging the gap between parental recall and realistic situations precipitating abuse involves a video-simulated stress procedure allowing the examiner to record parental responses to a number of stress-inducing child situations that closely resemble  abusive circumstances. In this technique, eight videotaped scenes of toddlers and preschoolers which simulate stressful childrearing situations in which the child demonstrates either excessive or deficient behavior, are shown to subjects. Subjects viewing the scenes assume the role of the hidden parent in the scene. Responses to the scenes are measured by recording the subjects' verbal and behavioral indices of emotion, coping statements, and physiological changes. Subjects also provide self-reports of negative affect, sense of control, and choice of intervention or discipline. Pilot results have shown promise in detecting differential reactions to common child-related stress. (ABL)",

        "description":"With changes in sex role expectations in marriage, family researchers have begun to examine the concept of machismo. Two characteristics dominant in the study of machismo are aggressiveness and hypersexuality. A biological model of machismo asserts that males everywhere tend to be more aggressive than females, a sex difference which appears to have a genetic base. A modern theory of sociobiology offers another explanation for macho behavior. According to this theory, much of animal, and perhaps human, behavior is influenced by the drive for one's genes to reproduce themselves. A generally accepted psychological theory views machismo as an expression of an inferiority complex. Most research on machismo is restricted to the lower classes. Research from Mexico, Puerto Rico, England,  and the United States suggests that lower class males suffer from job insecurity and compensate for their feelings of inferiority by exaggerating their masculinity and by subordinating women. Other studies point to distant father-son relationships as one factor leading to feelings of inferiority and to the development of machismo. Women may support machismo by being submissive, dependent, and passive. The combination of feeling inferior and acting superior is machismo, a trait that is repeated generation after generation. If men can be socialized toward male parental investment, the incidence of machismo may decline and the incidences of men feeling self-esteem and women feeling equal to men may rise. (NRB)",

        "description":"Standard procedures for teaching child management skills to parents may be inadequate for disadvantaged populations. The Parent/Child Early Education Program was developed to serve parents at risk of child abuse. Parent and child variables were measured at pretest in 41 families referred to this program. A profile of the families revealed that, in general, these families were single-female-headed households living on welfare support. Parents had an unstimulating, noneducational home environment for childrearing, more negative than positive parent-child interactions, a significant number of problems reported on the Child Abuse Potential Inventory, and a significant number of affective symptoms based on the Beck Depression Inventory. Children were described by their mothers as  showing below average levels of adaptive behavior. The most common form of dropouts were no-starts who failed to attend sessions following the pretest assessment period. A discriminant function analysis of pretest data was conducted to determine which factors were the best predictors of finishing treatment. The results suggest that parents who are more likely to follow through with this form of training report more distress at pretest and show a more balanced ratio of positive to negative interaction with their children. In response to these client characteristics, a format for parent training has evolved which is tailored to the compatibility of the therapist, the extent of training/knowledge covered, and the target problems to address.

Counselor self-disclosure may be a useful means of eliciting reciprocal disclosure by the client or communicating that the counselor is willing to share therapeutic control with the client. In addition, self-disclosure can be used to help the client learn how he impacts on others and to normalize and support behaviors or feelings that the client may feel are unacceptable. By revealing information the counselor may be able to prime the client's expectations for changes; moreover, the counselor can manage the image he projects and derive personal benefit by discretely sharing aspects of  himself. Different types of counselor disclosure can be identified in terms of their intimacy value, positive/negative value, and the degree to which the information is similar to the client's experience. Some types of counselor self-disclosure include demographic information, professional identity, world view, attitudes/beliefs, emotional responses, personal experiences, and counselor fantasies. The sharing of information by the counselor must be considered in light of the counselor's style, client expectations, and most importantly, the specific needs of the clients. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"Interpersonal feedback, telling an individual how others perceive and react to his performance or behavior, is often used in skills training to produce some change in the individual's performance. This study investigated the effects of different types of negative feedback on the subjects' ratings of the accuracy of the feedback and their motivation to change their behavior. Subjects were 48 male and 48 female college students who signed up for an experiment involving counseling skills. Two subjects, unacquainted and of the same sex, played roles of therapist and client in each session. One of three bogus, standardized feedback statements was given to the subjects after the session. Subjects rated the accuracy, desirability, and helpfulness of each item of feedback and the  competence of the person giving the feedback. Therapist's and client's ratings of feedback accuracy and effectiveness were found to be similar, contradicting the idea that persons try to enhance their self-esteem. Clients rated feedback about observable behavior as more accurate than feedback about unobservable behavior. Individuals' reactions to negative behavior was influenced by several factors including the observability of behavior and the individual being evaluated. (ABL)",

        "description":"Rural outreach in community mental health centers involves staff commuting from a central agency to surrounding rural towns to provide clinical and/or community service. The problem for outreach staff is how to best provide services to a rural network that is distant and different from the urban network. In general the greater the distance, the fewer the interconnections between the rural community and the city. The amount of overlap between rural and urban networks affects the outreach worker's role. With fewer connections to the city, rural people depend more on the outreach worker's information about and referral to nonlocal services. Rural communities have distinct social networks characterized by close-knit families and homogeneous populations. Rural individuals expect more  personal and informal mental health care and rely more on primary care physicians than do urbanites. Outreach workers must adapt to local procedures, evaluate services in light of the rural clientele, and effectively inform clients about local services. (ABL)",

The Institute of International Education projects that, by 1990, on million international students may be attending colleges and universities in the United States. A study was conducted to determine the needs, interests, and goals of undergraduate international students at the University of Maryland, College Park. Entering undergraduate international students (N=56) from Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Mideast completed an anonymous questionnaire concerning their backgrounds, goals, perceptions, and attitudes regarding their education, vocational plans, social issues, and self-perceptions. The results suggest that the international undergraduate  students come from diverse cultural backgrounds. The students sampled tended to be supported by family members, both economically and psychologically. Students reported feeling that meeting U.S. students and learning to think independently would be difficult adjustments. International students reported high hopes and expectations of success. Since many international students experience financial, personal, and interpersonal difficulties at U.S. institutions, appropriate support services should be provided in order to facilitate their adjustment to the United States.

A study was conducted to examine the current state of interracial attitudes among students at the University of Maryland in College Park, and to determine whether or not th ere have been any changes in interracial attitudes and perceptions among black and white students since the 1970's. An anonymous questionnaire on interracial attitudes was completed by 437 college freshmen. Twelve percent of the sample were black; 88 percent were white. In general, it was found that whites and blacks who had racially isolated backgrounds seemed to have similar  interracial attitudes, while blacks who had racially mixed experiences held different attitudes regarding interracial contact. Subjects who had little interracial contact in their pasts tended to report that minorities were treated no differently by the university than were white students. Blacks who had more interracial contact believed that minorities were treated differently by the university than were whites, and these subjects were more likely than racially homogeneous blacks to feel that the university did not foster respect for cultural differences. These findings suggest that intraracial differences may be more variable than interracial differences. (NB)",

The shift of responsibilities for mental health and substance abuse services from the public to the private sector may constitute a fourth mental health revolution. The public-private issue can be viewed from two historical vantage points: developments in American medicine and specific developments within mental health. The reprivatization of medical care in America involves a change in type of ownership and control; horizontal integration; diversification and corporate restructuring; vertical integration; and industry concentration. In the field of mental health, recent developments have been  toward reprivatization and deinstitutionalization. There are differing views on what values will be emphasized as a result of the reprivatization of mental health, but the reassessment of public and private responsibility should be pursued within the context of history. The sense of realism and caution that history demands should prevail as the public interest in mental health is sought. (NB)",

        "description":"Behavior analysis has contributed dramatically toward educational improvement. It has helped to produce impressive increases in rates and durability of simple and complex learning among students with widely disparate capabilities and levels of preparation. Behavior analysis has demonstrated that: (1) everyone can learn; (2) complex skills can be taught; (3) precise, general, and durable performance can be taught; (4) behavioral instruction can be cost effective; and (5) barriers to learning can be overcome. It has discovered ways to remove barriers to learning, such as inadequate student preparation or interfering behaviors. Its methodological rigor and the generality of its findings lend further support to the value of behavioral analysis for education. Nevertheless, many areas  of concern remain to be addressed. Among others, these include the need for increased emphasis on both basic and applied research on learning and retention, and methods for promoting dissemination and utilization of effective behavioral instructional strategies. There may be several factors currently preventing the wide acceptance of behavioral methods. Many educators are unaware of or misinformed about the advantages of behavioral strategies. Even those who are aware of the benefits of behavioral strategies may lack the skill to implement them successfully. In addition, current contingencies impede or fail to support implementation of behavioral methods. Procedures are needed to inform educators about behavioral strategies, to shape behavioral skills, and to identify and manage various  impediments and supports. An 11-page reference list is appended.

        "description":"Previous research has shown that among married couples, housewives experience the highest levels of psychological distress, employed husbands the least, and employed wives experience levels of stress somewhere in between. This study examines whether employed wives' symptomatology can be explained by the extent of their influence within the marriage relative to that of their husbands. Questionnaires which independently assessed husband's and wife's stresses were completed by 815 dual career couples. Questions measured educational and employment demographics, family and career satisfaction, allocation of domestic and decision making responsibilities, mental health symptomatology, and achievement concerns. Eighty-four percent of the subjects reported equal or almost equal  relationships. For the most part, the more egalitarian the marriage, the greater was the wife's satisfaction with the marriage and the lower was her symptomatology. The exception to this was the finding that the greater the husband's responsibility for household tasks, the higher the level of the wife's symptomatology. Mothers tended to have less egalitarian marriages than wives without children. (ABL)",

        "description":"Consultation describes a collaborative, indirect service that might address a variety of problems. The specific process used depends on the consultant's theoretical orientation. An academic consultation role has been proposed for the school psychologist in which he/she would function as an educational problem-solver who collaborates with teachers to make decisions regarding curriculum and educational program matters. Psychologists functioning in such a role would need skills in the process of consultation and would rely on educational psychology for content knowledge. This study evaluates whether or not school psychologists are trained in the process and content that would prepare them to do academic consultation and whether or not doctoral/nondoctoral differences exist in  relevant training and actual practice. The results of a national survey of 151 training programs and 121 practitioners suggests that more doctoral than nondoctoral programs stress theory pertinent to academic consultation. Overall, however, few doctoral/nondoctoral differences in training and practice emerged. The results generally support the view that a number of training programs are not providing instruction in some of the areas basic to academic consultation. (Author/ABL)",

        "description":"In vivo exposure is the most commonly used and generally the most effective behavioral treatment for agoraphobia. Follow-up studies are difficult to interpret because additional treatment does not necessarily indicate relapse and non-treatment does not necessarily indicate non-relapse. Relapse rates are difficult to estimate because of lack of consensus on the definition of relapse. Relapse factors include reliance on anti-depressant medication and such measures of personality and psychopathology as marital status, locus of control, social anxiety, depression, and early compliance with treatment. Other variables are work satisfaction, negative thinking, socioeconomic status, and frequency of panic attacks. Maintenance of agoraphobics has been shown to be enhanced through the use  of the following techniques: (1) marital therapy for disstressed couples; (2) maintenance homework including exposure and applied relaxation; and (3) panic reduction, especially methods not using medication such as reducing marital conflict and increasing problem solving skills. Finally, agoraphobics need to be encouraged to adopt a healthy life style and to be self-nurturing. (ABL)",

        "description":"Multidimensional scaling (MDS) offers a rigorous approach to many problems in perception, emotion, personality, and cognition, where the stimuli are too complex to be quantified by other means. In these procedures similarity ratings of the stimulus objects are modeled as points in multidimensional space, such that perceived similarity is represented by spatial proximity. The stimulus objects may be physical stimuli or words describing qualities of pain. In this study, Individual Differences Scaling (INDSCAL) was used to examine the dimensions of pain obtained from similarity judgments made to verbal descriptors of global pain by 16 patients suffering cancer-related pain and by 16 healthy volunteers. The INDSCAL analysis yielded similar two-dimensional solutions for both groups.  The major dimension was magnitude of sensory pain: mild pain to intense pain. The second dimension, pain qualities, contained two components: a somatosensory attribute (e.g., burning) and an unpleasant affect attribute (e.g., miserable). The two groups differed in where they located certain descriptors in the space. For example, mild pain was more emotion laden for the cancer patients, but more of a somatosensory sensation for the healthy volunteers. Although much work remains to be done with a wider range of descriptors, it is clear that MDS procedures such as INDSCAL, have much to offer in the investigation of pain and other complex stimuli.

        "description":"The fear of fear present in agoraphobics can be broken down into a fear of the body sensations associated with the panic attacks that plague agoraphobics and maladaptive thoughts about the possible consequences of panic. In a retrospective examination of clinical files, 32 agoraphobic patients were compared to 36 patients with simple social phobias. Fear of fear was more often reported by the therapist for agoraphobics than for the other phobics. Two self-reporting measures were developed. The Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire measures 14 maladaptive cognitions and the Body Sensations Questionnaire measures 17 sensations experienced during panic or high anxiety. These questionnaires were tested in 78 agoraphobics with panic attacks and 197 patients with other disorders  including social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and dysthmic and major depressive disorder. Additional data came from 23 normal subjects. Agoraphobics scored significantly higher on the Body Sensations Questionnaire and Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire than did other subjects. Fear of fear may be related to treatment outcome for agoraphobic patients and imaginal exposure may be important in addressing fear of fear. (ABL)",

The validity of the Relational Communication Coding System, an instrument which operationalizes the constructs of complementarity and symmetry in human communication processes, was directly assessed in a two-factor design. Undergraduates (N=242) who were divided into 10 groups listened to one of five audiotaped interactions. Subjects were told that the persons on the tape were either a husband and wife or a counselor and client. Each interaction was loaded with one type of symmetrical or complementary communication pattern. The effects of pattern, context  (marital versus counseling), and their interaction on subjects' perceptions of the relationship control were examined. The results revealed that interactions loaded with certain types of relational control patterns were reliably distinguished by outside observers. The context of the interaction was found to have little effect on how well observers' perceptions of relational control reflected the actual coded communication. These findings generally support the use of the Relational Communication Control Coding System in counseling process research. (NB)",

A study was undertaken to discover which factors account for the phenomenon of long-term foster care. Four organizations were involved: (1) private social services agency (research group); (2) State Department of Children and Youth Services (study population); (3) a university school of social work (project co-leadership); and (4) the state chapter of a national organization of volunteers (subject interviews). To involve policymakers in this project, the evaluators scheduled meetings with administrators of regional offices to receive their ideas, suggestions, and commitment that findings would be used in  their policy decision-making. To involve state social workers in the projects, evaluators met the social workers face-to-face in friendly meetings, made the social workers' role an active rather than a passive one, solicited interview items of personal significance, attempted to instill curiosity about results, stressed previous successful projects completed together, and read a project endorsement statement from the social workers' central office. These efforts resulted in a project in which the workers, on the whole, were cooperative and gave thoughtful responses to the questions. (NB)",

The new philosophy of juvenile justice holds juveniles responsible for their conduct, emphasizing an accountability or justice model which focuses on what the juvenile merits. This model incorporates proportionality, consistency, and predictability in an effort to provide fairness both to the juvenile and to society. Education is a second strategy being pursued in government efforts to control drug abuse which also focuses on individual responsibility. Education about the dangers of drug use will hopefully reduce the demand for drugs. While statistics on drug use trends show a decrease  in marijuana and heroin use in recent years, the use of cocaine and the dangerous drugs of methamphetamine, PCP, and &quot;designer drugs&quot; has increased. In order to bring the drug problem under control, demand as well as supply must be addressed. The American government must move aggressively and pursue a drug education and prevention program that is both energetic and engaged. Administration efforts will be directed toward students from kindergarten through high school. While the responsibility lies with all citizens, it is especially important for state legislators to exercise moral and political leadership in the fight against drug abuse. (NB)",

        "description":"When children watch television, they can assess the reality of what they are seeing. Content judged unreal may have less influence on viewers than does content judged real. This study examines children's reality judgments about television series featuring families with children. Participants included twenty-seven 7-year-olds, nineteen 11-year-olds, and nineteen 15-year-olds, with somewhat more girls than boys at each age. Measurement instruments included the Realism, Uses and Gratifications, Match Actual, Match Aspired, Television Literacy, and Viewing Frequency instruments. The children defined reality in reference to frequency among real-life American families so that characteristics of television families were judged more realistic when they were believed to be more common  among real-life families. Children correctly recognized demographic differences among families and the lack of differences in portrayed feelings, actions, and general realism. Age of the child alone was never a determinant of adjudged reality. The lack of consistent, strong age effects may be due to the measures and methods employed. Further research should examine the mediating function of perceived realism in the television effects process. Four pages of references, five tables, and two figures are included. (ABL)",

        "description":"Psychologists and educators interested in factors that might influence mathematical ability have examined intelligence, motivation, and attitudes toward mathematics. More recently, sex role and cognitive style have entered the picture. The relationships among intelligence, field dependence, sex role, mathematics background, and mathematical ability were investigated in 66 male and 66 female college students. Subjects completed the Embedded Figures Test, the Bem Sex Role Inventory, and the Slosson Intelligence Test. Subjects were also administered a modified version of a mathematics test measuring ability with basic mathematics facts and word problems, ranging from simple addition and subtraction to first-level algebra. Subjects reported all mathematics and related courses taken  since ninth grade. Although the number of mathematics courses previously taken and intelligence were found to be the two best predictors of mathematical ability, other variables were found to have indirect contributions. The results revealed that field dependence and sex role indirectly affected mathematical ability by influencing the number of mathematics courses taken. For both males and females, higher scores on the Bem femininity scale were associated with lower scores on the mathematics test and a fewer number of mathematics courses taken. Field-dependent students tended to have taken fewer elected mathematics courses than did field-independent students. These findings suggest that there are personality variables that lead students to avoid mathematics courses. (Author/NB)",

        "description":"The field dependent-independent cognitive style has been noted by researchers to be related to mathematical achievement. Researchers have also noted a relationship between field dependence and measures of intelligence, and between sex and mathematical achievement. A multiple regression framework was used to examine the effects of field dependence, intelligence quotient (IQ), sex, and sex role on several types of mathematical ability for 33 female and 35 male college students. Subjects completed the Harris Test of Lateral Dominance, the Embedded Figures Test, Bem Sex Role Inventory, and the Slosson Intelligence Test. Subjects were also administered a mathematics test measuring ability with basic mathematics facts and word problems, ranging from simple addition and subtraction to  first-level algebra. Field dependence was found to correlate significantly with both IQ and some mathematical abilities. Regression analyses revealed that although IQ was the single best predictor of mathematical ability, field dependence and self-reported masculine sex role were also significant predictors. Males and females did not differ in mathematical ability. These findings suggest that biological sex may not be as predictive of mathematical ability as perceived sex role. Based on results of this study, it would appear that classroom practices designed to match mathematics instruction to students' cognitive styles may prove useful. (NB)",

Developmental transitions from gainful employment to retirement or from active parenthood to former parenthood can be difficult. For older adults, religion can be a useful means for organizing the self-concept and developing a context of meaning for one's life in an effective way. Religion can contribute a framework for understanding one's life pattern and present situation. Religion entails a set of goals toward which the elderly person can continue to move and from which he or she can derive hope. Religion provides a supportive social network through a sense of shared beliefs which can aid an elderly person in combating isolation and loneliness. The psychological frameworks of Erik Erikson's developmental stages, Ezra  Stotland's psychology of hope, and the recent view of integration of cognitive, social, and psychological factors provide an approach to understanding the role of religion for the elderly adult. A research approach investigating the antecedent relation of religion and related variables to patterns of coping in the elderly is needed. (ABL)",

Reading measures included tests of phonics (word knowledge), vocabulary (lexical knowledge), sentence comprehension (syntactic knowledge), and passage comprehension (organizational or structural knowledge). Writing measures included assessments of spelling ability (word knowledge), vocabulary diversity (lexical knowledge), sentence structure complexity (syntactic knowledge), and story grammar structure (organizational or structural knowledge). In all, there were eight writing measures and four reading measures. Each  measure was used as a dependent variable in a separate multiple regression analysis. Results did not support the idea that reading and writing are identical in terms of underlying knowledge. The correlations between the reading and writing variables were significant, but they were much lower than would be expected given the assumptions regarding the relationship between reading and writing.

It is apparent that new directions are being explored in the areas of diagnosis, materials development, and computer assisted instruction.

Paired students select reading activities from a set of approximately ten task cards related to a particular reading concept, and must successfully complete eight of the ten tasks in order to  fulfill competency in that area. Each task card contains an aim (give students directive purpose), an activity (a basic reading assignment that all students should successfully complete), and a challenge (an optional enrichment assignment). The REAP approach is fun, effective, inexpensive, and an option for the teacher who is concerned with providing as much individual assistance as possible. (HTH)",

        "description":"Since children who have been abused much of their lives may be unaware that what is happening is unusual, it may be necessary for teachers to take the initiative in educating young children to recognize that abuse is not normal and to talk with someone if and when they realize they are a victim. This education can take place through the use of carefully selected books or bibliotherapy. Through literature, the child can first identify with the character or situation and by doing so can experience the situation vicariously, letting the child experience a catharsis or emotional release. The result of the identification and catharsis is an insight into the problem. Ideally, such an insight transfers to the child's own special set of circumstances. A teacher can help abused children  choose appropriate books for their particular problems. Books can thus be one avenue to help children who are suffering from physical, psychological, and or sexual abuse realize that they are not alone, that someone else has experienced and understands their problem. Bibliotherapy may also alert a child to the fact that he or she is being abused and this does not have to be tolerated.

Two natural expositions were revised in three successive, incremental steps, yielding four versions for each exposition. The most difficult words in each exposition were identified. Approximately 300 eighth grade students read one text version and completed a multiple choice test written to be sensitive to small gains in word knowledge. The results  indicated that both able and less able readers who read text versions in which key concepts and the relations among them had been explained thoroughly learned significantly more word meanings than did students who read any of the other versions.

        "description":"Kindergarten children in three school districts were observed to measure the variance in their abilities upon entering school as well as the variance in the literacy-related instruction they received. The school districts differed in their early childhood education philosophies, as reflected in their kindergarten programs, their choices of materials, and the ways teachers grouped students. The primary goal of the classroom observation system was to measure the time teachers spent in various activities throughout a typical school day and to record sequentially each teacher-initiated instructional interaction, instructional interaction in terms of to whom it was directed, any feedback teachers gave to student responses, and the praise and corrective statement interactions that  teachers initiated to manage their classes. Results showed that teachers of half-day kindergarten programs provided more literacy-related and content area instruction than did teachers of whole-day classes. This suggests that instead of focusing on whether school districts should move to whole-day instead of half-day kindergarten programs, it may be more important to study systematically not only what is actually happening in a variety of programs, but also the long-term effects of various kindergarten programs with an academic focus versus programs that are individualized for teachers and students.

The research paradigm used--based on the work of Vygotsky and Piaget--was called the &quot;second order perspective&quot; and centered on how people describe different aspects of their surrounding world. Data were drawn from transcribed clinical individual interviews with 80 preschool children and a follow-up study of 53 children at the end of the first grade. The interviews with the first grade children were supplemented with reading rate, word comprehension, and reading comprehension tests. Results showed that the children described the function of reading in  two qualitatively different ways: as a possibility (they see reading as useful for themselves) and as a demand (they see reading as something pressed upon them by others). The children described the process of reading in four different categories: contextual, textual, interactive, and body-related. Overall, the study found that children think a great deal about reading well before they have started school and acquired some reading competence. (FL)",

The results suggest that while  visual displays can be used to enhance higher order comprehension tasks, they most often do not in basal texts. Visual displays were more likely to be used for drill and practice or with specialized skills sections in students' workbooks. There was a paucity of higher level questions that required students to interpret and evaluate displays. (FL)",

Lexical status, word frequency, bigram frequency, log bigram frequency, and regularity of letter sequencing were orthogonally varied across a series of experiments. Six-letter words and their anagrams were used as test stimuli in a target-search task. Results showed that words were recognized better than their corresponding equally well-structured anagrams, but that word frequency had little effect. Orthographically regular anagrams were recognized better than irregular anagrams, whereas log bigram frequency did not have an effect. In contrast, post hoc correlations revealed that log bigram frequency did correlate significantly with individual item  performance. In a final experiment, subjects judged which of a pair of letter strings most resembled English in terms of either the frequency or the regularity of letter sequences. Findings revealed an influence of essentially the same dimensions of orthographic structure as that revealed by the perceptual recognition task. The overall results provided evidence for lexical status, regularity of letter sequencing, and frequency of letter sequencing as important dimensions in the psychologically real description of orthographic structure.

The study was intended as a partial replication of work by C. Z. Blachowicz (1977-78), which demonstrated the phenomenon of sentence constructivity as part of reading comprehension among children. Subjects were 44 second grade, 54 fourth grade, and 50 sixth grade students from intact classes in a public school in Victoria, British Columbia. The students read a basal story and completed a sentence recognition task. The task required the students to indicate sentences that were literally identical to those in the story, but not  those that simply meant the same thing. One or two days later, the recognition task was repeated without access to the story. Results were analyzed for sentence types, grade levels, performance levels, and trials (immediate or delayed). Findings indicated support for constructivity in sentence type analysis, a decrease in errors as grade levels increased, no difference across performance levels, and an increase in constructivity after a delay. The results confirm and extend Blachowicz's findings. A five-page bibliography is provided; appendixes include the story used, the recognition test and the raw data presented in tabular form. (FL)",

        "description":"A study compared and evaluated alternative theoretical models of the relationship of learning to read and learning to write at beginning and advanced levels of reading development. The reading dimensions of the three models included word analysis, vocabulary, and sentence and passage comprehension components. The writing dimensions included spelling, vocabulary, sentence structure, and story organization components. The models differed with respect to the sequential orderings of relationships of the dimensions. The interactive model permitted the use of reading knowledge in writing, as well as the reverse. The other models (reading-to-writing and writing-to-reading) allowed knowledge to move only in a single direction. These models were evaluated on their ability to account for  the relationships found in an extensive body of reading and writing data collected from 69 beginning (second grade) and 137 proficient (fifth grade) readers. The findings suggested that the nature of the relationships changed as a result of learning, and that the interactive model fit the data better than the other models at both levels of achievement.

        "description":"A study examined the efficacy of the keyword method of vocabulary instruction by comparing it with five methods designed to increase semantic processing of the definitions of the vocabulary words. Subjects in all five experiments were college students. In the first three experiments, recall of the definitions from the vocabulary words was the critical dependent measure, with the keyword method producing greater learning than any of the semantic-based or control conditions. Also, none of the semantic-based conditions facilitated definition recall, relative to a no-strategy control condition. In the fourth and fifth experiments, the keyword method, two semantic strategies, and the no-strategy control procedure were compared with respect to associative- and response-learning  components of vocabulary learning. Results indicated the keyword method enhanced vocabulary/definition (associative) learning, but not definition (response) learning per se. In contrast, the semantic conditions tended to increase nonassociative learning of the definitions. The results support the case that the keyword method is a vocabulary-learning procedure superior to the semantic-based strategies advocated by reading theorists. (HOD)",

Data describing teachers' professional development were collected from 35 classroom teachers on personal data forms, while time-on-task data were collected by observing 200 individual students in four elementary schools at periodic intervals during the school year. Findings indicated there was no relationship between average student time-on-task in reading and four of the five aspects of  teachers' professional development investigated. One variable, possession of a Master's degree, was negatively associated with student time-on-task at a statistically significant level. Finally, a significant negative correlation was found between years of teaching experience and student time-on-task, suggesting that as teachers acquire additional teaching experience their students exhibit a decrease in time-on-task in reading.

        "description":"Psychological theories have long had a pronounced effect on the diagnosis and instruction of children with learning problems. Traditional theorists emphasized the centrality of global processes assumed to be common to most if not all cognitive tasks. These processes were quite distant from those involved in traditional academic activities, making it difficult to proceed from diagnosis to instruction. In contrast, contemporary theorists concentrate on identifying the specific knowledge and skills underlying performance in academically relevant fields such as reading, writing, mathematics, and science. This trend toward domain specificity has made the task of diagnosis and remediation of school problems more tractable, as the processes thus identified are those needed for  successful performance. At the same time, alternative methods of diagnosis, such as dynamic assessment, have been developed to supplement more traditional approaches by assessing domain-specific processes in action, rather than inferring their operation from the products of prior learning. These advances make it easier to specify the processes that need to be the targets of instruction. Furthermore, current attempts to characterize optimal learning environments have fueled the development of a theory of instruction. (An 11-page bibliography is included.) (Author/HOD)",

        "description":"From the close of the nineteenth century and into the early part of the twentieth century, three aural technologies--the telephone, the phonograph, and the radio--were rapidly disseminated throughout the United States. These technologies brought to the population more aural information than it had ever experienced and created a new environment of structured and meaningful sound. This environment led to a change in perception of sound by those most sensitive to cultural shifts in aural phenomena: the avant-garde composers. Major composers such as Stokowski, Varese, Chavez, and Taylor articulated significant dimensions of this shift with dramatic expressions of their own changing notions of sound, their personal reactions to the new media, and their hopes for an &quot;aural awakening.&quot;  They pointed to radio, the &quot;new musical instrument,&quot; as a source of new relations to the world of sound which, suddenly, was &quot;vastly freer.&quot; The aural media altered their notions of tonal relation and the very concept of &quot;natural sound.&quot; Commentators claimed that the phonograph and radio were inaugurating a social musicalization of sound. With the cooperation of Bell Telephone Laboratories, Varese and Stokowski sought to use radio to extend to the absolute perceptual limit the public's awareness of all aural phenomena. (FL)",

The first half of the paper discusses six compelling reasons favoring writing instruction at the dissertation level and refuting the false assumption that graduate students are rhetorically equipped to handle the idiosyncracies of dissertation writing. The resulting clearer thinking during dissertation writing, and long-term improvement in advising are also discussed. The second half of the paper describes the noncredit dissertation workshop offered to the graduate community at the  University of California at Los Angeles. The nine three-hour sessions, which combine lecture and practical experience in prose analysis and peer editing, are described as follows: (1) overview (identifying the dissertation writing process and assessing support facilities); (2) research and organization; (3) writing and revising the rough draft; (4) workshop activity (students read and comment on each other's purpose statements using a prepared editing tool); (5) style; (6) workshop activities (students read and comment upon each other's revised drafts, then further revise their own manuscripts); (7) documentation, editing, and publishing; (8) workshop activity (students edit each other's proposals); and (9) final proposal tune-up. The paper concludes with mention of the enthusiastic  response to the workshops, and a discussion of two benefits of the program as seen by the instructor. (HTH)",

One writing program encouraged students to write expressively and find their way into print, while the other program used the more traditional or skill-sequenced approach through preparatory steps. It was hypothesized that students using the expressive writing strategy would show measurable improvement in three aspects: (1) the students' understanding of the function of writing, (2) their attitude toward writing, and (3) their regard for themselves as writers. The pretest and posttest instrument consisted of 24 questions that covered writing function, attitude, self-concept, and technical vocabulary. The writing programs  were monitored by collecting samples of work from six randomly chosen students from each of six classrooms. Results showed the expressive writing students improved in their grasp of technical writing terms, and yet the two groups did not appear to differ significantly in their regard for themselves as writers. In addition, the expressive writing classes' positive responses to writing declined over the course of the year while the skill-sequenced class did not grow appreciably more positive toward writing.

The first section of the booklet presents a brief review of current knowledge about how writing may best be taught and how the computer can be used to teach it. The second part of the booklet explores some assumptions about teaching writing with word processors, and then provides practical suggestions for selecting software, teaching word processing while teaching writing, developing computer/writing lesson files, journal writing on  the computer, collaborative writing, and using the computer to search databases for research papers. The appendix includes sample lesson files. (HTH)",

Since most questions are directed toward words and their spellings, the first section of the booklet emphasizes selected historical aspects of vocabulary growth and orthographic change. The second section of the booklet presents exercises designed around actual student questions, providing not only initial suggestions for vocabulary study  activities, but also a rationale for the incongruities of English with an eye toward putting modern usage into a historical perspective.

        "description":"A study investigated whether newspaper mug shots are perceived by readers as being positive or negative in tone and whether the mug shots that are selected match the roles of their subjects in accompanying stories. Twenty-three news and feature stories with associated mug shots were clipped from seven daily newspapers. Pictures and stories were then separated, and the pictures were distributed to 51 undergraduate students who were asked to indicate whether each photo gave them a positive, negative, or neutral impression of the subject. The stories that had originally accompanied the pictures were distributed to a different group of 66 undergraduates who were also asked to state their impressions of the subjects in stories. Analysis of the results indicated that readers agree  significantly on their impressions of subjects in the stories, as did the group who viewed only the mugshots. The fact that the impressions of the subjects were similar whether the story was read or the mugshot alone was viewed indicates that editors may have based their selection of accompanying photos on their subjective impressions of the stories. In the interest of remaining fair and impartial, editors should exercise caution in their selection of mug shots. (Tables of findings are included). (DF)",

        "description":"A study identified the principal ways in which high school newspapers are funded in Ohio, particularly with respect to the public or private nature of the schools, the paper size, frequency of publication, the methods by which papers are printed, and the sorts of staffs that publish them. Of the 1,080 high schools listed for the state, 228 completed the survey, 160 of which reported publishing a newspaper. The results indicated that school size was related to the presence or absence of school newspapers, although there was no clear relationship between community size and publication of a paper. Public schools were more likely to sponsor student newspapers than were private or parochial schools. The most common publication cycle for papers was monthly, but nearly 40% of  respondents published less often. Offset printing was the most popular means of reproduction, and the likelihood of using offset increased with the size of the school. Only 8% of the papers were printed in a school or district print shop. Overall, the greatest percentage of the high school newspaper budget came from single copy sales. Advertising and administration grants were also important sources of income, with fund raising, subscription sales, and student activities reported as less important sources. More than half the papers were published by classes receiving academic credit for the work. The results suggest that high school newspapers are not being published frequently enough, due in part to funding. The long-range problem of financing the newspaper will not be solved until  journalism takes a more prominent place in the curriculum, thus also attracting advisors trained in journalism. (HTH)",

Two hundred randomly selected members of those associations completed a survey, the results of which indicated that collaborative writing occurs frequently among members of those associations. A second survey was subsequently administered and on-site interviews were conducted. Analysis of those data indicates that there is a general shift toward recognizing the importance of both context and interaction in  constructing realities and texts. In addition, even texts produced by one writer are built up or invented collaboratively, and most on-the-job writing is collaborative from beginning to end. The results suggest that perhaps collaborative writing should be encouraged in classrooms, although the tension between those who view collaboration as an enriching, socially constructive act and those who regard it as an abandonment of personal responsibility must first be defused.

Following a brief introduction focusing on the functions of the computer, the paper discusses four aspects of the computer's relation to language derived from an analysis of computer functions. The aspects discussed deal with computers (1) as tools for representing knowledge, (2) as tools for interpreting symbols, (3) as communication devices, and (4) as redefinable tools. The paper next describes a classroom of the future, identifying ways in which current activities might be used to teach reading and writing, emphasizing that it is  appropriate to discuss computer use when thinking of language. The paper concludes with a consideration of several questions for research based on this thesis. Five pages of references are included, and an appendix contains copies of articles written by students using computers and electronic mail. (FL)",

        "description":"While the typical pantheon of journalism history heroes is made up almost entirely of individuals who campaigned for more governmental regulation and increased social liberalism, there is also an opposing tradition in American journalism, one based on the premise that governmental cures are in most cases worse than the diseases they are designed to control or eradicate. In looking at forgotten conservative journalists, it is important to examine the career of Frank Kent (1877-1958), a Baltimore &quot;Sun&quot; writer and syndicated columnist who gained a reputation for opposition to President Roosevelt's New Deal policies. In 1933 popular support for Roosevelt was so great that even Congressmen who had objections were reluctant to speak them. The combination of economic and social crises  with Roosevelt's personal charm made allies of almost every editor and reporter. Frank Kent, influenced by the historical and political science perspective he brought to reporting and writing, was bothered by this uncritical acceptance of the National Industrial Recovery Act and the National Recovery Administration (NRA). Roosevelt and his administration struck back at Kent and other critics, but by 1934, other journalists began to join Kent in opposition to the NRA, and a study by the liberal Brookings Institute did indeed reveal that the economy was not recovering. The NRA system began breaking down in late 1934; by 1935 small businesses were beginning to openly defy the NRA codes; and by the end of 1935, the Supreme Court declared the NRA unconstitutional. Kent was vindicated. Despite  Roosevelt's resounding reelection, Kent's journalistic practice provides a different perspective on the current view of some conservatives that the press should support presidential prerogatives.

        "author":["Sproule, J. Michael"],
        "description":"The issue of whose \"facts\" and whose perspective will control classroom discussions of social questions tends to surface in one of two related ways: (1) in connection with efforts to mandate the content of the instructional matter, and (2) in connection with attacks on teachers whose instructional material contains facts or evaluations offensive to a powerful social group or interest. A historical survey of the political monitoring of those who would give instruction concerning the ethics of social action, with focus on the ethics of communication, indicates a rediscovery after World War I of the importance of the ethical communication practices in democratic politics. The popularity of critical propaganda studies in colleges and universities during the mid-1930s was a  short-lived phenomenon, however, and in the increasingly tense political atmosphere of 1939 to 1941, opponents of education who probed social ethics often branded ethical analysis as part of a conspiracy to undermine dominant American institutions. In the 1940s and 1950s, forces opposed to critical social analysis levied charges against educators and textbooks. The place of ethics in present day classrooms is, at best, ambiguous. While the upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s created a renewed acceptance of inquiries into the nature of modern society, the politics of recent years has seen the anti-critical trends continue, although now in the form of pressure from a variety of social groups harboring strong political opinions about what should and should not be taught.

        "description":"Acknowledging that the Latin American cultural concept of &quot;machismo&quot; influences the way in which Brazilian managers tend to use authority rather than communication when resolving disputes with subordinates, a study compared Brazilian and American male managers' self-reported preferences for resolving disputes with employees and peer managers. Forty American and 40 Brazilian males in middle and top management positions each read a packet of four scripts describing various problems that a manager might have with an employee or another manager of equal status. Subjects were then interviewed to determine how they would resolve the problems. Responses were assigned to one of three classifications: communication, organizational power, or mixed approach. Results indicated consistent  differences between American and Brazilian managers in their preferred ways of resolving disputes with employees and peer managers. American managers appeared somewhat more flexible as indicated by their greater use of communication strategies, while Brazilian managers appeared much more likely to respond rigidly and authoritatively to real and perceived insubordination. The only instance in which Brazilian managers were likely to use communication was when an employee appeared justifiably reluctant to take on a new task not included in his or her job description. Although it appeared that Brazilian managers are more authoritarian in their treatment of employees than are American managers, it should not be inferred that they are less communicatively competent than American managers.

        "description":"Self-report measures of perceived communication competence used properly can help build understanding of communication behavior, but used as indications of communication performance can only retard such efforts. Not all uses of such instruments are either legitimate or appropriate--for example, using self-report measures to determine an individual's actual communication competence. None of the scales currently used to measure perceptions is appropriate because none asks the subjects to estimate their perceived competence level, each is based on differing definitions of communication competence resulting in dissimilar items on the measures, and most are restricted to either an interpersonal or a public speaking context. In an ongoing research program related to willingness to  communicate, it was found that no appropriate measure of self-perceived competence was available. Consequently, the Self-Perceived Communication Competence (SPCC) scale was developed. The SPCC is composed of 12 items chosen to reflect four communication contexts--public speaking, talking in a large meeting, talking in a small group, and talking in a dyad--and three common types of receivers--strangers, acquaintances, and friends. Results of an initial study using the SPCC were compared with those of others completed by the same subjects. The correlations suggest substantial personality influence in individuals' perceptions of communication competence. The strong correlation with willingness to communicate also suggests the potential impact of self-perceived communication competence on  actual communication behavior. While the SPCC appears to be a valid measure of self-perceptions, it is not a valid measure of actual communication competence. (HTH)",

        "description":"A study tested a causal model of international communication media appraisal using audience evaluations of tests of two films conducted in the Philippines. It was the fourth in a series of tests of the model in both developed and developing countries. In general the model posited determinative relationships between three exogenous variables (editorial tone, communication potential, and utility) and appraisal. The two films were documentaries distributed worldwide by the United States Information Agency and intended for showing in informal audience settings and on television. One film was designed to impart the American values of cooperation and teamwork, while the other stressed the mutual interests of all nations. Both films were intended for primarily older, educated male  elites. Results showed the following: (1) a good overall fit of the model to the observed system of intercorrelations; (2) a positive relationship between communication potential and appraisal; (3) a positive relationship between utility and appraisal; and (4) positive interrelationships between the variables of editorial tone, communication potential, and utility. As opposed to findings in the other tests of the model, negative rather than positive relationships were found between editorial tone and appraisal. It was concluded that the model, which was previously supported with research on magazines, could be generalized to other media as well. (HOD)",

The essays were then coded for sexist and incorrect pronoun usage. Two weeks after the writing assignment, the students heard a lecture on sexist pronoun usage, then wrote another essay on the same topic. These essay were analyzed for any evidence of linguistic change. Results showed that 69% of the students used incorrect pronoun forms, primarily the generic \"he,\" on the first assignment. After receiving  instruction on sexist language, only 35% continued to use the forms on the second assignment, and use of the generic \"he\" decreased by 50%. On the first assignment, more females than males used the incorrect pronoun forms and only 60% of the females changed to the correct forms on the second assignment, compared to 70% for the males. This suggests that women are still likely to stereotype men as generally high in status, and that men are more aware of women's increasing visibility in high status occupations.

Despite its lack of direct vocational training, a liberal arts education is the best lifelong career preparation for several reasons. First, liberal arts study provides skills and encourages attitudes that are vital to all careers. With emphasis on speaking, writing, analytical and critical thinking, and awareness and examination of assumptions, liberal arts courses prepare all students for the myriad work situations in which they will eventually find themselves. Second, as we live more in an economic\"global village,\" it is increasingly important to be able to work with understanding and appropriate skills across national and language boundaries. Third, narrow vocational skills become obsolete quickly, but skills in liberal arts, do not become outdated. Fourth, liberal arts study provides students with a broader perspective on problems and decisions, serving them well in their personal and professional lives. Finally, while science and technology are, in a narrow sense, neutral, their application involves profoundly moral issues. Liberal arts study in its best form provides dynamic opportunities for continued examination of difficult ethical questions. (HTH)",

The student speakers--two female graduate students and a female graduate teaching assistant--were given one week to prepare an informative speech. The speeches were then videotaped, along with the instructor's oral critiques. While viewing the tapes, the students identified statements they perceived as helpful in improving their speaking ability and those that either increased or decreased their self-esteem. Students most frequently identified as helpful the feedback that was directed toward them personally and which focused on  specific features of the speeches. They perceived complimentary feedback as promoting good feelings about their speaking abilities, but of limited usefulness in helping them learn how to improve their skills. Critical statements were sometimes perceived as promoting negative feelings; however, in some cases, these statements were perceived as enhancing self-esteem. This was most likely to occur when the critical comments were accompanied by positive nonverbal immediacy behaviors, such as smiles and reassuring gazes. (FL)",

The paper first offers an overview of humanistic psychology, examining some of the basic assumptions and postulates that serve as a foundation for &quot;Third Force&quot; psychology, an orientation emphasizing meaning and value in human life. It then discusses selected concepts that have been incorporated into listening theory, such as emphatic listening, mutual engagement, feedback, attending behaviors, and nonvaluative listening. The paper also presents an analysis of potential areas of further contributions for listening studies that have gone untapped or been given only cursory attention,  including symbolization of experience, skill training, response studies, and perceived listening. The paper concludes with a call to scholars, theorists, and researchers to tap the potentially rich contributions of not only humanistic psychology, but also many other disciplines that relate directly and indirectly to the field of listening.

        "description":"A study analyzed statistically the monotony of all-news radio listening and identified stylistic figures that elicit attention in listeners. Subjects were 30 graduate students whose experience with radio news ranged from occasional listening over several months to regular listening five or seven days per week for several years. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of four groups, each of which listened to one of two 30-minute spans of an all news station in an informal &quot;coffee-and-doughnuts&quot; setting. After listening, each participant was isolated in a cubicle with two tape recorders, one of which ran continuously. As the other replayed the broadcast, the subject identified content items and stylistic figures that had elicited attention in the initial listening and rated  these elements on a nine-point scale. The similarity of patterns of attention to the two newswheel spans indicated the monotony of all-news listening. While statistical comparison of how relatively few auditors listened to two segments of programming can only be suggestive, it bolsters the impressions of casual monitoring, the findings of content analysis, and the extratextual evidence of all-news programmers' descriptions of the newswheel format. The statistical findings were particularly interesting because they objectively reflect listeners' experience of radio news as familiar and predictable--that is, monotonous.

        "description":"This study was conducted to determine what vocational counseling strategies are used with students who enroll in vocational education programs, their effectiveness, and their perceptions of helpfulness by graduates and employers. Different surveys were developed and sent to the following groups in Colorado: 60 high school counselors, 60 principals, vocational directors of 60 high schools, 30 secondary vocational education graduates who completed programs in 1984 and 1985, and 30 employers of such graduates. Some of the results of the surveys were the following: (1) 27 vocational strategies were identified, and respondents saw all of the studies as helpful and being used; (2) little time is spent counseling vocational students; (3) five strategies are being used with a majority of  vocational students: talk with counselor, class discussion of jobs, personal counseling about career goals, information given about postsecondary training, and feedback about deficiencies in work habits; (4) complete job shadowing was seen as one of the most helpful strategies by students but as one of the least helpful by the other groups; and (5) some differences were noted between employers' and other groups' perceptions of helpfulness of various strategies, but on the whole, answers were similar among the groups. Recommendations include: more time devoted to vocational advising; structured guidance programs during the pre-enrollment process; and greater use of technology such as video and software to disseminate information if counseling time cannot be increased.

Results included the following: (1) the personal interview is still the dominant tool used by counseling personnel as they work with students who enroll in vocational education; (2) 63 percent of the schools use other assessment tools--the larger the school, the more frequent the use; (3) no particular test or tests emerged as favorites; (4) the Colorado Occupational Computerized Information System  (COCIS) is not used in some of the schools surveyed because of cost; (5) counselors and state supervisors were very positive about the use of tests and assessment tools; (6) because of the limited use of assessment tools reported by school counselors, no generalization nor strong comparisons can be made about either the degree of usefulness or degree of effectiveness of assessment tools used with students who enroll in vocational education.

It also charts out a general overview of the vocational training situation in rural areas in the Member States of the European Community and in Spain and Portugal. Part One identifies the major objectives of training--those which derive from the component parts of the rural milieu and those which derive from the activities peculiar to rural life. Within the full range of the needs identified, the major part of all publications on rural vocational training attach priority to training for farming personnel. Part Two examines the development of this type of training. It addresses training supply  and demand, objectives and methods of training in agriculture, and special target groups for training in rural areas: women, and individuals with a nonagricultural background. Part Two also looks at the question of the training inputs made in connection with local rural development projects that are expected to supplement the sectoral training by dealing with the social dimensions of life in a rural community and to cover the needs experienced by people engaged in other occupational fields. Part Three offers conclusions. A five-page bibliography is included. (YLB)",

        "description":"A study examined existing provisions for educational leaves for employees in various countries throughout Europe and the impact of any such existing provisions on labor market development. Present provisions for educational leave in the countries studied appeared to have a worker withdrawal effect that was generally well under 0.1 percent of the total labor force. Women and unskilled or semiskilled workers were poorly represented among those enjoying an educational leave, and the same was true for employees of small businesses. Public service employees, union officials, and the middle and senior management of large businesses benefit most from present provisions. Despite the varying approaches to educational leave and the differences in the experience gathered, the problems  associated with its setup and implementation are similar regardless of subject matter. It was concluded that European nations should take steps to develop policies facilitating educational leaves for employees of all sectors and skill levels. Such a policy should provide that 2 percent of all employees be allowed to go on educational leave during the same period for a total of 10 working days per year, all workers over the age of 18 should be allowed to take an educational leave, and employees should continue to receive pay while on leave regardless of the subject matter of any courses taken during the leave.

        "description":"A conference examined the socioeconomic challenges of technological and educational change throughout the European community. One hundred fifty representatives from a cross section of countries and agencies involved in education, training, and employment gathered to discuss the following themes: the transition from initial training to employment with specific reference to the new technologies and the need for vocational education; training needs of management, employers, and employees in regard to new technologies; information technology and a changing society; and polarization or depolarization of qualification structures. The following were the main conclusions of the conference. Qualifications are not directly and narrowly determined by technical innovation. The relationship  between present and future job contents and training is indirect and complex, and a new relationship between education and training is needed to master skills in a future job. Although they may be unaware of it, politicians, trade unions, and employers play an important role in exercising choices shaping education and training arrangements and technological change. The considerable need for adult training and retraining has made consideration of new training methods an urgent matter. Small and medium-sized enterprises are faced with special problems, including greater difficulties in administering systematic training, and often a lower capacity for technical innovation. (MN)",

Information collected from interviews with spouses of business owners in Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and Italy confirmed the original hypothesis that in the kind of enterprise studied it is the man who owns the business and the wife who assumes various duties without having the necessary training. In Belgium, Denmark, West Germany, and France special educational opportunities, consisting mainly of courses in administrative functions, were available for the co-working spouse. Although actual statistical data were not available, the consensus among the co-working spouses interviewed was that they do not avail themselves of existing educational  opportunities to a satisfactory extent. Reasons cited for failure to participate in available educational programming included lack of time, distance to school or college, time and form of courses, price, course content, and attitudes toward education. The general picture concerning the role of the children in these enterprises was that they do not wish to follow in their parents' footsteps.

        "description":"Alternance training and employment policy should improve youth employment prospects in the European community in three ways. It should enhance young people's employability, improve youth's motivation and clarify vocational options, and better prepare youth to adapt to abrupt changes in job content. Because alternance training is concerned with young people's transition from school to work, the supply of alternance training places should be geared to the number of those leaving the school system. Guidance, acquisition of skills, and social integration are the three primary aims of alternance training. No single formula can be applied throughout the European community to determine who will need alternance training. Training needs must instead be determined on the basis of school  experience, employment situation, socioeconomic attributes, and local labor market requirements. Alternance training schemes must combine in-school learning and in-plant experiences in a way that is more than a mere juxtaposition, but is rather mutually reinforcing. For this, the efforts of teachers and trainers must be coordinated and mutually reinforcing as well.

        "description":"Ten years after institution of the multiservice effort to develop a common doctrine and procedures for systematic development of training and education curricula, which became known as Instructional Systems Development (ISD), a U.S. Army Training Board report declared that the Army's military occupational specialties were devoid of serious analysis, design, and developmental work. One reason for ICD's lack of success may have been the Army's failure to establish a fully trained professional corps of civilian training developers led by training managers who were deeply grounded in ISD. At the school level, neither the active duty military nor the civilian specialists were well grounded in ISD. At the same time, civilian specialists found their jobs to hold little prestige, and  commanders and service school commandants failed to grasp the ISD concept. Like competency-based education, ISD had strong behaviorist roots. Many educators, on the other hand, tend to follow a humanist philosophy. Part of this problem with educational philosophy may have been rooted in ISD itself since the system was cumbersome, bureaucratic, and too time-consuming to follow. It must also be remembered that at the time of ISD's implementation the Army was also experiencing serious problems with recruitment. Notwithstanding all of these possible causes for the failure of ISD, perhaps the key reason for its failure was an inability to come to grips with the Army's real training needs. (MN)",

        "description":"Traditionally, the road to good jobs for young persons in West Germany has been the &quot;dual system&quot; of vocational education and training (VET), similar to apprenticeships in the United States, but practiced on a much wider scale. A large percentage of West German youth usually enter such programs after high school in order to prepare for skilled trades--indeed, for most jobs except casual labor. In recent years, however, the world-wide problem of unemployment has been making entry into the apprenticeship system much more difficult. Today, only about half of West German youth can go directly into the VET system after high school. A small number go on to universities for higher education, and some go into casual labor, but for about 20 percent of the youths, there is no easy road to  good jobs. Many of these young people participate in a year of vocational training sponsored by the state as a stopgap measure, then reapply for an apprenticeship the following year. In this way, many of the youths do eventually get into the VET system, but the majority of them do not train for the jobs in which they are most interested, or even for their second choices. Although the problems in the system are a result of structural unemployment, youths tend to blame themselves for their problems in finding a place in the system; most then work harder to try again the next year. Those who fail still blame themselves rather than society. The government, schools, and private enterprise in West Germany need to work to expand the employment sector and the opportunities for young people to get  into the &quot;dual system&quot; in order to ensure a better future for these youths and for the country.

It then examines three general models of corrections education service delivery: educational programming under institutional superintendents, statewide programming facilitated by a state director or coordinator of corrections education, and a statewide correctional education district structure. Strengths and weaknesses of each approach are cited. The report then addresses the pros and cons of contracting for education and training services with local education/training institutions. Some data are provided on relative costs. A number of basic principles that might be considered for program improvement are suggested. Five  recommendations for short- and long-term action are made: identification of a purpose statement for education and training, funding of a position with responsibility for planning and monitoring consistent services across institutions, establishment of an interinstitutional curriculum committee, discussions on contracting education and training services to local community colleges, and drafting of legislation and implementation of policies/procedures for an Oregon corrections education district. Appendixes, amounting to approximately one-half of the report, include corrections education commission recommendations, a 1981 report on Oregon corrections, strategies for correctional vocational education, and characteristics of exemplary programs.

        "description":"This document was written for junior and senior high school students to help them learn to cope more effectively with their problems. It is intended as a quide for helping adolescents explore and solve problems through constructive critical thinking. Ten steps in the process of constructive critical thinking are presented with personal and social examples and activities. These 10 steps are: (1) clarifying goals; (2) obtaining information; (3) identifying problems; (4) asking questions; (5) searching for answers; (6) predicting consequences; (7) making a plan; (8) practicing solutions; (9) evaluating results; and (10) noting progress. Common personal problems of young people are presented for critical analysis and discussion. Then, examples of how some famous persons dealt with  different problems and concerns are described to offer the reader further challenges for exploring constructive critical thinking. Suggestions for practical applications of constructive critical thinking in real life situations are listed. This guide begins with a short pretest and concludes with a posttest on constructive critical thinking. (NB)",

        "description":"Research has consistently shown that among the non-institutionalized elderly, prevalence rates of heavy alcohol use and problem drinking are relatively small in comparison to younger age groups. This study examines how maximum annual alcohol consumption and problem drinking change as a concomitant of the aging process. This study of alcohol-use habits of the elderly helps to complete the understanding of how drinking styles evolve across the life span. A subsample (N=85) of 246 males who were first interviewed as a part of a random household drinking study in 1964 were reinterviewed 19 years later. The results revealed that decreases in drinking were likely to occur at the heavier levels of maximum number of drinks taken on a single occasion during the past year by the men in the  longitudinal sample. Among the men who changed their drinking patterns, decrease was 8.6 times more likely to occur than increase. Of the men who had experienced at least one alcohol-related problem prior to 1964, one-half reported having at least one such problem during the follow-up period. Initiation of problem drinking among some men who did not report alcohol-related problems in 1964 was an unusual pattern. Despite limitations of this study, the findings are useful in interpreting the much-replicated cross-sectional finding of a decrease in problem drinking and heavy consumption during the latter part of the life course.

        "description":"Because the literature suggests that aerobic exercise is associated with physical health and psychological well-being, there is a concern with discovering how to improve adherence to such exercise. There is growing evidence that self-motivation, as measured by the Dishman Self-Motivation Inventory (SMI), is a redictor of adherence to regular exercise. Since self-motivation may be amenable to skills training, it is important to understand what skills constitute self-motivation. A study was conducted to identify correlates of self-motivation in a group of persons enrolled in a marathon clinic. Volunteers (N=220) involved in a 9-month adherence study completed the SMI, Heiby's Frequency of Self-Reinforcement Questionnaire, Wallston's Health Locus of Control Scale, Zung's Self-Rating  Depression Scale, Speilberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and an exercise scale. The exercise scale assessed enjoyability of exercise, perceived ability to exercise, current exercise habits, motivation to exercise, education, and physical characteristics. The results provide concurrent and construct validity support for the SMI. It was found that scores on the SMI were positively related to measures of self-reinforcement and internal locus of health control, and negatively correlated with the adverse emotional states of anxiety and depression. If self-motivation is amenable to skills training, norms for the SMI must be developed so that persons with low self-motivation skills can be identified for training in an attempt to enhance compliance to a prescribed activity. A three-page  list of references concludes the document. (NB)",

        "description":"Adolescents struggle to establish their own identities and become independent in making the transition from childhood to adulthood. Adolescent alienation can result from changes in family structure from traditional two-parent families to one-parent families, decreased family stability, increased mobility of society, population increases, dehumanization of the individual, increased adolescent unemployment, and new standards of sexual behavior. Truancy, dropout, pregnancy, and suicide rates have increased for teenagers. This study attempts to develop a valid and reliable instrument to measure three components of alienation: social isolation, powerlessness, and normlessness in young adolescents ages 10-14. After a literature review, examination of existing instruments, input from  middle school personnel, and content validity testing, a 30-item instrument was created. Reliability was established in a two-phase study using 477 middle school students in Massachusetts. The instrument included statements such as &quot;My future does not look good&quot; and &quot;When I need help, I can find someone to help me.&quot; A measure of alienation could have practical applications to educators, school psychologists, school social workers, administrators, and parents by allowing them to identify socially alienated students and then to help those students.

In these relationships there is a complementarity between differential constraining of information by an expert and progressive empowerment towards learning of the novice. The expert organizes information for the novice so that the novice can assimilate the knowledge of the expert. The extent of expert-influenced learning by a novice depends on the expert, the novice, and the organization of their interaction. Characterizing teacher-student interactions as emerging, complementary, and dynamic processes emphasizes the importance of constraining in knowledge acquisition. Reconceptualizing interactions between teachers and students in terms of constraining  enriches both research and instructional strategy. This approach emphasizes the joint interaction of teachers and students, rather than the individual actions of either. (ABL)",

The objective of this study was to identify other antecedents of the status of the elderly, especially those involving the familial and religious domains. The presence or absence of ancestor worship was used as an indicator of the religious aspects of the society. A sample of nonindustrialized societies from the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) and the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS) provided cross-cultural data. The dependent variable (status of the elderly) and two independent variables (the value of conformity versus self-reliance in socialization and ancestor worship) were coded from the HRAF. These data were used to test the hypothesis that the status  of the elderly varies according to predominant social norms and the practice of ancestor worship. The basic patterns of effects of the independent variables were found to be similar for both sexes. The results showed that the status of the elderly was higher in societies where conformity was emphasized in the socialization process. The correlation between elderly status and the practice of ancestor worship, however, appears to be spurious. A multivariate analysis revealed that ancestor worship had no significant effects on the status of the elderly. (References and data tables are included.) (ABL)",

Perception of life changes was measured by the way in which older adults perceived their life situation over time. Results showed that perceptions of change in life satisfaction among older adults could be classified  as either better or worse according to a combination of physical and social variables. Good health, possession of a confidant, sufficient income, and filial association were factors which distinguished positive and negative aging.

One of the problems in measuring the importance of societal variables is the difficulty in finding children whose social environments have differed for most of their lives in well prescribed ways. An exception to this are kibbutz- and city-raised children in Israel who represent different social environments in the same society. Subjects were 112 city children and 64 kibbutz children in first and third grades. Interviews with the children at three 1-year intervals provided an overlapping longitudinal design with data on first through fifth graders. Each year the children were interviewed in two group sessions. Children chose two programs they watched from a list of  current programs and stated how often they watched them. The violence of the programs was rated and thus a child's television violence viewing score was derived. Identification, aggressive character identification, overt aggression, peer popularity, and aggressive fantasy were also measured. Among city children a significant positive relationship was found between television violence viewing and amount of aggressive behavior. Relations between exposure to media violence and aggression were not obtained from kibbutz children. Mitigating effects of television exposure for kibbutz children may have included patterns and amount of viewing, group viewing, powerful peer group norms, and the lack of popularity of aggressive children.

        "description":"Although the military health care system is the second largest in the nation serving approximately 6,000,000 people, little research has examined military reproductive health care services or their quality. Medical services can be provided by regional military medical centers and by base infirmaries and dispensaries. Often base infirmaries and dispensaries lack specialized care for pediatrics and gynecology. Military families tend to be young and in need of obstetric and pediatric services. Satisfaction with health care is critical to the military family's sense of well being and security. Reproductive health services suffer from a shortage of obstetricians and gynecologists and an increasing patient load. Studies of military bases have found that obstetric services seemed  adequate, but that access to family planning and birth control services was lacking. Elective abortions are no longer provided. Since 1981, Family Advocacy Programs have been developed in all service branches which describe protocols for reporting, assessing, and responding to child and spouse abuse. Military policymakers have failed to see the relationship between reproductive health and family violence. Military families experience the stresses of low income, frequent moves, and deployment of husbands. Comprehensive, accessible, and outreaching family planning and reproductive health services on a continuum for all military spouses are needed. Further research is needed on access to reproductive health services in the military and on the relationship between family planning and family  abuse. (ABL)",

Almost one-half of the mothers did not consider parents to be sources of guidance. A comparison study used students (N=409) in high schools in the same neighborhoods as the welfare mother sample. More teenage mothers saw themselves as single parents or married in 10 years than did non-parents. Non-parents expressed more perceived control over their lives and were less likely to have no specific career goals.

However, recent research has demonstrated the connection between lack of career goals, low self-esteem, perception of narrow options, and risk-taking behavior as factors leading to pregnancy. A 3-year research project was undertaken to survey 1207 urban teenage women regarding their aspirations, values, and motivations for career and other life choices. Data on feminist values was obtained as well. The project was carried out as part of a multi-year foundation funded research and demonstration effort to stimulate and support career oriented motivation for young women as an alternative to early motherhood. The target population consisted  of female students enrolled at four urban high schools which had high dropout and early pregnancy rates. In the 1981-1982 study, students ranked education, financial independence, and self-worth as the most important life aspirations, with motherhood ranked as a lower priority. In the 1982-1983 study, most teenagers expected to complete high school and to attend college. The expectation of working was almost universal, regardless of marital status, and most respondents envisioned themselves as working mothers. The results of this study suggest new strategies for prevention of unwanted pregnancy and for maximizing alternatives to early parenthood. These strategies are preventive, developmental, and self-help in nature and are seen as appropriate to an era of economic retrenchment for human  services. Recommendations for program strategies include targeting resources to those at risk, expanding cognitive teaching awareness of life options, building family support, teaching birth control, legitimizing parenthood as a life choice, and emphasizing feminist principles.

Three types of clerical authority have been identified: charismatic, traditional, and legal-rational. The common assumption that people select power strategies that are consistent with their perceptions of their authority was tested in 50 Southern Baptist Convention pastors and 46 Roman Catholic priests. Also examined were the relationships between institutional factors such as denomination, individual differences such as variations in moral philosophy, and the power strategies used by clergymen. Subjects completed a 3-item measure of clergy authority, the Survey of Ethical Attitudes, a measure of power strategies, and a background  questionnaire. The results indicated that authority type was significantly related to charismatic strategies and to legal-rational strategies, but not to traditional strategies. Denomination was significantly related to charismatic and legal-rational strategies, with Baptists scoring higher than Catholics in the use of both strategies. The relationship between denomination and traditional strategies was not significant. Ethics of Responsibility/Conscience was significantly related to charismatic and legal-rational strategies, but not to traditional strategies. These findings suggest that identifying one's power base is not equivalent to understanding one's power strategies.

A study was conducted to examine the extent to which development and persistence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) could be predicted on the basis of the victim's demographic characteristics, objective indicators of the crime's dangerousness, the victim's cognitive appraisal of the crime's dangerousness, the type of crime experienced, and the cumulative impact of crimes occurring throughout the victim's lifetime. Subjects were 295 women who had been victims of one or more crimes of rape, attempted rape, molestation, attempted molestation, other sexual assault, aggravated assault,  robbery, or burglary. Objective and subjective indicators of dangerousness were reported for subjects' first victimization, most recent victimization, and worst victimization. For subjects who had experienced more than one crime, a cumulative lifetime index of victimization effects was created. Subjects also reported demographic data and were classified by a clinical psychologist as having had PTSD, never having had PTSD, currently having PTSD, or currently PTSD-free. Analysis of data revealed that: (1) developing PTSD could be predicted by type of crime, objective threat, and cognitive appraisal of threat; (2) rape appeared to be more stressful than other crimes and to have more persistent effects; and (3) type of threat and number of rapes both had a positive cumulative effect on the  probability that PTSD would be developed and sustained.

        "description":"Guidance counselors believe that all students, regardless of sex, race, handicap, or national origin, have an inherent right to make informed career decisions, and to manage their own lives. A variety of barriers sometimes prevent the realization of this ideal for women, minorities, handicapped persons, and ethnic groups. Counselors must address these barriers to occupational equity. These barriers include negative beliefs, cultural blindness, white male standard, occupational stereotypes, limited role models, lack of occupational skills, lack of career management skills, inadequate counselor preparation, weak career guidance programs, little adult guidance, discriminatory employment practices, and biased materials. Activities which may prove useful to address barriers include:  (1) increasing counselors' awareness of cultural differences; (2) analyzing enrollment data to identify disproportionate enrollments in vocational programs; (3) ensuring that counselors can communicate with limited-English and hearing-impaired students; (4) training counselors to identify and remedy discriminatory career guidance practices; (5) reviewing career guidance materials for stereotypes; and (6) developing an affirmative action program for employing minority and handicapped counselors. State and federal laws and regulations require districts to implement a combination of career development and career guidance activities to overcome barriers to occupational equity.

        "author":["Rabin, Adele S."],
        "description":"The research looking for cognitive factors specific to depression has resulted in the consistent finding that memory in depression is selective. The phenomenon of selective memory for negative events in depression was investigated using signal detection methods to separately examine the contributions of information processing deficits and response biases. The recognition memory performances of three psychiatric inpatient groups and a control group were compared for stimuli of depressed and nondepressed content under conditions of subject bias and experimenter bias. Subjects were 16 currently depressed, 16 previously depressed, and 16 nondepressed voluntary, female psychiatric inpatients at a private hospital in New England and 16 nonpsychiatric, nondepressed female hospital staff  members. Subjects made self-descriptive ratings on 20 depressed and 20 nondepressed content adjectives which comprised the target memory set. Adjectives were then randomly assigned to one of two lists with each list containing equal numbers of depressed or nondepressed content targets and distractor adjectives which were semantically related to target adjectives. Adjectives were presented for recognition and subjects indicated whether the adjective was one they had rated. The findings suggest that a liberal response bias may explain selective memory for depressed content material in both depressed and previously depressed groups and appears to be depression specific. However, the selective memory of nondepressives for nondepressed content material appeared to be due to an information  processing strategy which differed from that of depressives. (NB)",

Human resource development (HRD) provides an organization's personnel with cognitive experiences designed to improve job performance and productivity. Counselors are often employed in HRD programs for work in: (1) career development; (2) employee assistance programs (EAPs), and (3) training and development. Career development stresses the importance of matching the individual to the job. Full scale career counseling is the most complete and desired method for assisting with career development, and counselors are well equipped to perform assessment interviews, psychological testing and interpretation, and  behavior observation. Counselors working in employee assistance programs involve themselves in activities which include needs analysis of the individual client or group of clients, behavior modification programs, referral sources, and therapists. Tasks that counselors might perform in the training and development field include professional self-development, needs analysis, individual development, group and organizational development, planning and counseling, and managing work relationships and counseling. Counselors who enter business and industry via training and development, EAPs, and career development programs may find themselves in demanding roles which test their creative and professional skills.

A study was conducted to determine whether employees in the United States differ from Canadian employees in their evaluation of computer-based technology due to the type of equipment used, hierarchical level in the organization, and the employee's sex. Twenty-eight Canadian and 15 United States employers from large firms, medium-sized firms, educational institutions, and government agencies selected equal numbers (3-6) of successful managers and support personnel from various departments. A total of 196 Canadian computer users and 95 U.S. computer users selected in this manner completed an  anonymous questionnaire assessing their attitudes toward computer-based technology, how it supports individuals at work, whether they liked using their computers, and if such use made them more effective. Preliminary analyses provide some support for the hypothesis that employees working with intelligent workstations may perceive their computers differenly from peers working with main-frame terminals. In addition, the study investigated if men and women would differ in how they perceived computers at their workplace. Women in both countries differed from men in their attitudes toward computers. Moreover, the results obtained showed that women in the United States had different concerns relating to computer-mediated work than did their Canadian peers.

Despite increased use of computers in offices and the belief that employee attitudes toward the technology may be crucial when trying to achieve technological effectiveness, few studies have examined these issues. A study was conducted to investigate how an individual's perception of career success might be related to his/her attitude toward a computer-based technology. Twenty-eight Canadian employers from large firms, medium-sized firms, educational institutions, and government agencies selected three to six successful managers and an equal number of support personnel from various departments. Employees (N=196) who used computers at work were selected and  administered an anonymous questionnaire to assess their present positions in terms of success and their perception of the technology available to them. The results confirmed the hypothesis that computer attitudes would explain employee perceptions of job and life success. The results also demonstrated that employees assessed computers differently depending on whether they used intelligent workstations or main-frame terminals. Respondents felt that the effect of intelligent workstations upon communication was positive. Other data showed that the perceived effect of computers upon control differed strongly according to gender. Women reported feeling less in control when working with a main-frame terminal than did men, while the perceptions of control when working with an intelligent  workstation were about equal for men and women. These findings suggest implications for both researchers and practitioners. (NB)",

A study was conducted to identify factors of a construct measuring attitudes toward technology and to examine the patterns of perception of various technologies to see whether each is perceived differently. Employees (N=82) of 10 organizations in two metropolitan areas of the United States chosen on the basis of technologies in use at different levels completed questionnaires on how the kinds of office technology they used affected their work. The results revealed that there were substantial  differences in the respondents' perceptions of office technologies and various types of computers. The computer (personal computer, word processor, terminal), telephone, and typewriter were most frequently cited by respondents as their primary or secondary technology at work. The telephone was seen as helpful for communication, but also as a source of interruption. All three technologies were perceived as contributing to worker effectiveness. Moreover, the data revealed that the perceived effect of personal computers upon control and quality of work life was positive and that personal computers were perceived to have effects statistically different from word processors and main-frame terminals.

During law school and after graduation, symptom levels were found to be significantly elevated from those of the normal  population. Elevated symptom levels increased as law students continued through law school and did not lessen in the first 2 years of practice after graduation.

A study was conducted to identify factors related to substance use by a preadolescent and early adolescent rural and small town population. Data were collected from 496 middle school students in rural Northern Michigan during October, 1981. Student responses concerning drug knowledge, personal drug use, peer drug use, moral issues, and drug health beliefs and attitudes were analyzed. The results of the survey suggest that a multitude of mood-modifying substances are being used by the early adolescents studied. Age was found to be the most important single indicator of drug use, but sex differences were also  found to be related to drug use. A steady increase was found for alcohol and cigarette use in this sample with respect to age, while marihuana consumption increased significantly betwen the seventh and eighth grades. Sex was an important variable when related to the use or non-use and to the extent of use of certain drug substances. Girls reported more substance use than boys, possibly due to the earlier maturation of girls. Because drug use behaviors in general are perceived as &quot;adult&quot; behaviors by adolescents, usage increases as peer group expectations of adult behaviors increase. These results suggest that sex and grade level strongly influence an individual's decision to use a particular substance. (NB)",

Only 1.5% of the total sample reported using marihuana with any frequency, and 1.9% of the students reported using cocaine. Posttest results indicated that alcohol use increased substantially over the study year, while cigarette smoking and marihuana use increased slightly and cocaine use remained the same. A positive correlation between peer drug use and personal drug use was established. In addition, a relationship was found between health beliefs and personal substance use.

In process groups, the emphasis is on the process of growth and interaction. Counselors face obstacles they must overcome in order to organize effective group counseling programs in secondary schools. Gaining staff and administrative support for group counseling is one priority. Support can be gained by offering staff members a positive personal experience with group counseling within the school setting and by making effective presentations to staff at in-service sessions. A second priority involves addressing the logistics of time, place, and scheduling for group sessions. An optimal number of group members in secondary schools appears to be  between 7 and 10 and one 90-minute group session per week appears to allow for continuity without disrupting schedules. More growth may occur in a process group of limited, defined duration. A school semester provides a convenient time frame. A rotating schedule may work well because it prevents students from missing the same class each week. The location must assure privacy, informality, and intimacy. Counselors must advertise the group counseling, recruit participants, and conduct pre-group interviews with students. The initial group meeting provides a time to establish ground rules, assure confidentiality, and make acquaintances. There are many strategies for maintaining a focus in group sessions. Whatever strategies a counselor uses to begin and end each session, it is critical to  hear from each group member at both of these times. Participation in a process group can reduce students' social isolation, increase their self-esteem, and teach them that conflict is healthy and can be resolved in a productive manner. (NB)",

The program described offered the young men a range of services to increase their potential for contributing to the financial support of the child, the social and emotional development of the child, the child's health, and family planning. It is noted that the young men who used the program came from a wide variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds; were poor, often uneducated, and often unemployed; and were committed to their female partners and children. Components of successful programs are discussed,  including a committed administrator, comprehensive services, and a realistic caseload. Counseling, assistance in returning to school or completing diploma requirements, and job training/referral are presented as highlights of the program. This report is divided into sections discussing the problem, goals, participants, documentation process, development of the collaboration, myths surrounding teenage fathers, and critical ingredients of service programs for teenage fathers. A reference list and agency/funding source descriptions are appended. (ABL)",

        "description":"This book focuses on the prevention of drug and alcohol use by children. It is intended for use by parents, teachers, students, religious and community leaders, and others interested in drug prevention. The book, which begins with a letter by Nancy Reagan and an introduction by Secretary of Education, William J. Bennett, stresses the seriousness of the drug problem. A section on children and drugs examines the extent of drug use among young people, explains how drug use develops, describes the effects of various drugs, and discusses drug use and learning. Two fact sheets, \"Drugs and Dependence\" and \"Cocaine: Crack,\" are included. The section on a plan for action contains separate recommendations on what can be done by parents, schools, students, and communities. Suggestions for  parents involve instilling responsibility, providing supervision, and recognizing drug use. A fact sheet on signs of drug use is included. Schools are given recommendations on how to assess the problem, set and enforce policy, teach about drug prevention, and enlist the community. Fact sheets on legal questions and selecting drug prevention materials are included. Five school programs are profiled to illustrate how communities can develop and implement effective drug education and prevention policies. Suggestions for students involve learning the facts and helping to fight drug use. Communities are encouraged to provide support and to use tough law enforcement. Three special sections conclude this report: (1) teaching about drug prevention; (2) how the law can help; and (3) resources,  which contains information on specific drugs and their effects, sources of information and numerous references under 11 headings. A four-page news release summarizing the book is also included. (NB)",

The mnemonic strategy represented a combination of three pictorial techniques: the method of loci, the pegword method, and the keyword method. Subjects were randomly assigned in equal numbers to one of two experimental conditions (mnemonic or control) and to one of two list orders (chronological or alphabetical). Before the study, students in all conditions were told that at test time half of the time they  would be given a name and asked for a number, while the other half of the time they would be given a number and asked for a name. Results showed that students taught according to the combined mnemonic strategy out performed the control subjects, whether provided with a well-ordered set of presidents during input (presidents presented in their proper serial order) or a more complicated set (presidents presented in alphabetical order).

        "description":"Using a semantic mapping technique for vocabulary instruction, a study explored how children of diverse groups bring different cultural backgrounds and prior knowledge to tasks involved in learning new words. The study was conducted in three sixth-grade classrooms--one containing rural Native American (especially Menominee) children, another containing inner-city Black children, and the third containing suburban Caucasian children. The 20 words chosen for semantic mapping instruction were chosen from four categories: animals, recreation, health care, and environment. It was anticipated that the subjects would learn the vocabulary words by relating the target words to words already in their vocabularies. One 30-minute semantic mapping vocabulary lesson was taught each of four  days. Analyses were done through interview procedures designed to examine the linkages between cultural background, prior knowledge, and the acquisition of new vocabulary. Measures of dominance indicated that (1) Caucasian subjects offered the highest average number of categories per map on all maps, and the highest average number of words on all but the health care map; (2) Black subjects offered the lowest average number of categories on all maps, and the lowest average number of words on all but the environment map; and (3) Native American subjects offered the highest number of words on the health care map, and the lowest average number of words on the environment map.

        "description":"Francis P. Robinson's 1946 text, &quot;Effective Study,&quot; first presented his Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review (SQ3R) study system, which is held to be the most widely advocated textbook study system. This paper traces the development of the ideas behind the SQ3R. SQ3R's theoretical foundation began with work in scientific-management, and continued with Seashore's 1939 study of work methods, which deemphasized native intelligence and prompted Robinson to design a higher-level study-skill system. Whipple's 1927 study-skills texts included each of the steps later included in SQ3R, while Kornhauser's 1924 study-skills booklet contained all the basic tenets of SQ3R. Finally, Cole and Ferguson's 1935 &quot;Student's Guide to Effective Study&quot; recommended study rules that stressed (1)  surveying the material, (2) attending to graphic and textual aids, and (3) reading carefully, then reciting to assess understanding. Practical application of Robinson's thinking consisted of the logical organization of five distinct study activities, each including between two and seven explicitly identifiable substeps, into a total system of study and the assignment of an acronym. This development of SQ3R served as a capstone for the foundation of research findings and pedagogical practices pertaining to college reading programs of the prewar era. Future study systems, however, will be evaluated against a more sophisticated knowledge base. A seven-page list of references is provided, as well as a diagram of the empirical support of SQ3R and a master list of College Reading and Learning  Assistance Technical Reports. (SRT)",

        "description":"Content and critical analyses of 40 speed reading books were undertaken to determine to what extent discussion and teaching reflected current research. Particular attention was given to the information provided on eye movements, span of recognition, and the upper rates of speed attainable through practice. Content analysis revealed the following: (1) 72% of the 32 books that dealt with the span of recognition encouraged readers to process phrases of three or fewer words in a single fixation, while 28% discussed expanding the field of vision to include clusters larger than three words as well as entire lines or large blocks of print; (2) 15% of the 27 books in which eye regressions were discussed indicated that they were useful in some cases, while 52% advocated the total  elimination of regressions; and (3) 57% of the 28 speed reading books reporting upper rates of reading proposed rates above 1,000 words per minute (WPM). However, it is concluded that research supports the following: readers have a span of recognition physiologically fixed at about two or three words, regressions are sometimes necessary and useful, and rates above 1,000 wpm are not achieved with what is usually thought of as normal reading; skimming or scanning are employed instead. In an effort to improve speed reading books, collaboration between researchers and writers is recommended.

        "description":"Since the precise nature of the effects of notetaking encoding has not been clearly specified, a study involving 111 suburban seventh graders (southeastern Idaho) explored the differential effects of traditional notetaking and of episodic organizers (a type of semantic web or map) on the encoding of complex narrative passages. Subjects were assigned to one of four groups and, after reading the experimental passage, were instructed to perform one of four tasks: construct an episodic organizer, study a provided episodic organizer, take traditional notes, or reread the passage. The next day they were asked to provide a written recall of the story. The two active notetaking methods enhanced recall of high-importance story elements: notetaking through a selective attention effect and  episodic organizer construction through a reconstructive effect. The results confirm those of previous experiments with regard to the benefit of taking notes when reading, provide additional support for the encoding view of the function of notetaking, and reveal a positive encoding effect for the completion of an episodic organizer when reading complex narrative passages. These results are contrary to other research findings that support the position that review of notes is more important than is the process of recording them.

The paper first reviews some of the theoretical claims concerning a variety of group learning procedures and the evidence that supports their efficacy. Claims discussed include the following: (1) group participation aids learning, (2) group settings force learning with understanding and thus produce conceptual changes, and (3) individual thought processes originate in social interaction. The paper then examines a program of guided cooperative learning--reciprocal teaching,  which combines expert scaffolding, guided practice in applying simple concrete strategies, and cooperative learning discussions. In particular, the paper explores the impact of the program on the listening and reading comprehension strategies of first grade students. The paper concludes that reciprocal teaching is a successful method of improving both listening and comprehension, and discusses possible extensions of the techniques to instruction in specific content areas.

Two factors, entering reading level and use of interspersed postquestions, were combined factorially to form six experimental groups. The dependent variable was the children's score on the comprehension subtest of the SRA Achievement Series. Results showed that while questioning instruction had little effect on the above average reader, both average and below average readers made significant gains in comprehension when instructed in the use of postpassage questions. Students, therefore, must develop a strategy for dealing with textual material  and so must be provided with experience in using a questioning strategy. This approach may begin to help students internalize a strategy that will offer them the skills necessary for independent reading.

        "description":"To address the questions of whether writers create their audiences and, if so, how, a case study of three skilled student writers sought to elicit the students' tacitly held knowledge about composing and audience. The students wrote an essay that they were told would be published in a campus anthology, and then responded to questions in taped &quot;ethnographic&quot; interviews an average of six times, discussing essay drafts brought to the meetings. Students also listed their composing decisions and grouped them. Each student's material was separately analyzed by marking off, comparing, and grouping all reader-related episodes and from this the descriptions and hypotheses for the research were developed. Analysis showed that the writers allowed their audience to change as it assimilated  itself to their purpose and that the newly evolved audience was an idealized version of the writers' selves. Writers need not always analyze and accommodate a uniform audience, but rather, they should write effective prose for a broad, indefinite, and unknown audience. From a pedagogical standpoint, writing for a general audience encourages varied perspectives and more in-depth exploration of the subject. (SRT)",

        "description":"A study analyzed the revision practices of 25 children in a third grade classroom, half of whom received LOGO instruction, to determine if the revision practices inherent in LOGO programing sponsor revision practices in the composing of autonomous texts of young children. It was hypothesized that the revision strategies in LOGO, both engendered and supported by the building of graphic models, would be a stepping stone between highly contextual revisions (drawing) and the more abstract revision required in writing words alone. The design of the study was three-tiered: a field experiment, a field study, and case studies. Revisions were analyzed according to observed changes in composing, features of the written products themselves, and the writers' thoughts about revision. The  findings revealed an influence of LOGO revision practices in the paper-and-pencil composing behaviors of the students. The LOGO group increased its percentage of textual revisions by 20%, while the control group increased its percentage by only 8%. In addition, the frequency of rereading behaviors in the LOGO group increased more than 300%, while there was a 48% decline in the frequency of this behavior for the control group.

The frame of reference for this evaluation is an &quot;old paradigm,&quot; which treats the computer as if it were paper, but new paradigm aids should be based on the uniquely electronic strengths of computers. As more and more people use computers as a primary means of creating texts, electronic media are also changing how information is being created. Commercial software offers a potential source of new technological paradigms. For instance, the emphasis on the fluidity of information in electronic forms means that information is more malleable; parts of one  electronic document can become parts of another. Other technological developments that may have promise for computer aids to invention are simulation, interactive videodiscs, advanced workstations such as the IBM PC RT and the software that runs on them, and interactive computer games. In terms of invention theory, new paradigms might be found Walter Ong's &quot;secondary orality&quot; and Herbert Simon's and others' work on artificial intelligence.

The program user is placed in the role of assistant newsletter editor, facing a series of decision-making situations. Each choice the user makes affects the subsequent reality created by the program, which is designed to provide (1) a high degree of movement for the student user, (2) first-hand experience with high technology, and (3) a novel way of learning and applying course material in a realistic manner. The \"Simulator\" program was tested with two groups of students at the Pennsylvania State University in 1985. Students who used the program then completed a survey to help evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Results indicated that student users found  the program interesting and educational. Although there are limitations to this type of computer assisted learning, it has the potential of making great contributions to public relations education. (DF)",

        "description":"A research project investigated the relationship between cognitive development in college students and their rhetorical maturity. Viewing the problem of audience in composition instruction in terms of cognitive development reveals that it may not be enough to tell students that they must consider audience if they do not have the cognitive maturity to act on that instruction, or if they deny the validity of any viewpoint other than their own. Furthermore, audience has different meanings for oral and written communication, with the difference between the two being context--the set of elements held in common between the message generator and the message receiver. The more the two have in common, the more context-dependent the message can be and still be effective, but the less the  two have in common, the greater the need for the message to be context-independent. Students most often have to write for a constructed audience and so must construct a context. A measure of context for assessing audience awareness was used to study and evaluate students' writing samples and to analyze the relationship between writing ability and cognitive maturity. (The paper includes a chart of context measure criteria and examples, and three sample student essays.) (SRT)",

All stories that were greater than four square inches, including all graphics and headlines, were examined. Each of the 899 stories was coded for the date, page, headline, square column inches, graphics, source of story, type of sport(s), primary nation-actor(s), whether the story contained political assertions, and whether it was treated as a  standard sports-news story, feature, or column. It was found that the large majority of stories did not contain political assertions. Nevertheless, among those stories that did interject political assertions into sports coverage, most of the assertions evaluated the impact of the Soviet-led boycott of the Olympic games, suggesting that the boycott was politically successful.

        "description":"A text is the locus of many intersecting processes, the origins, character, and operative principles of which should be the main focus of its discussion in a writing class. These processes can be classified into the four major components of the communicative act: the writer, the reader, the social conditions of communication, and the historical and rhetorical context. In terms of process, a text records the writer's decisions, but students need guidance in making these rhetorically, contextually motivated choices. Text analysis in a writing class should focus critical attention on systematic relationships, ordering principles, and schemata, while critical reading of a text should lead students to an awareness of the interpretive conditions that our community imposes on a text.  Composition readers tend to ignore the &quot;writing&quot; of the text, or its working. A review of some popular composition readers in light of current discourse studies and text theory revealed that the majority do not reflect, except sporadically, recent advances in these fields and that they operate on static, nonrhetorical conceptions of the text and on aesthetic and normative assumptions about the role of sample readings in composition class.

The paper first identifies three dominant interpretations in the writing across the curriculum literature: (1) affective dimension, (2) social dimension, and (3) cognitive dimension, and cites research that explains each of these dimensions. The paper states that two qualifications should be added to the claim that writing is a way to learn, the first being dependent upon what kind of writing is discussed and the second being dependent upon the individual doing the writing. The paper then discusses studies that look at the effects of  different writing tasks on learning and studies that reveal individual differences among writers. Finally, the paper concludes by stating that writing across the curriculum has generally been perceived as a pedagogical and administrative concern rather than as an area for research, a perception that may have caused the concept to suffer in terms of both public relations and personal growth.

The newspaper sample, stratified on the basis of ownership and market structure, included 113 daily newspapers from 39 states and the District of Columbia for one randomly constructed representative week in November 1984. Content analysis began with measurement of the total content area of each newspaper front page, minus the area for the nameplate. The quantity and area of all graphic elements were measured, as was the area of color. The analysis revealed that maps, photographs, charts, and  illustrations represented 27% of the front page's total area. Color was used by 32% of the newspapers regularly, while 59% occasionally used some front page color. Results also showed that the number and area of graphics and space devoted to color increased with increased newspaper competition, but not with television competition. It was also found that as the size of group ownership increased, the number of graphics used on the front page increased. (HOD)",

The news service used was the Lutheran World Information (LWI). Religion writers and editors for the 42 daily newspapers that receive the Lutheran World Information weekly news packets were surveyed by telephone. Completed interviews were obtained from 35 respondents, who indicated their definition of religion news, their preference for stories about certain types of religion news, their use of LWI news, and their evaluation of the LWI news service according to a number of journalistic criteria. Results suggest that use of a particular religion news source depends for the most part on the news judgment of the religion writers and editors and on characteristics of  the situation in which they work. The data indicate that the strongest predictor of use is the religion journalists' belief that the news source is an accurate source of information. Although the extent to which personal beliefs influence story preference and perception is beyond the scope of this study, it does seem to indicate that the question of whether a religious or a nonreligious person should cover the news may be too simplistic.

        "description":"Drawing from articles appearing in several national publications about the dioxin contamination found in Midland, Michigan, in l983, a case study examined how the publications handled the phenomenon of expert disagreement concerning the nature of dioxin. Specifically, it examined how the publications handled expert disagreement about (1) the way dioxin gets into the environment, (2) whether it causes cancer in humans, (3) whether it causes birth defects or miscarriages in humans, (4) the significance for human health of studies showing dioxin has severe and acute health effects in animals, and (5) the implications of regulation of the substance. The study discovered that some of the publications obscured the existence of disagreements among scientists or made no attempt to  account for it, while others attempted to explain it by suggesting that one side or another was irrational or psychologically disturbed, that the science used by one side was incompetent, or that the science used was corrupted by politics, economic pressures, or a commitment to corporate power. The study concludes that journalists can benefit from the review of studies in disciplines other than journalism showing that expert disagreement is a normal aspect of science that can be accounted for in a number of ways.

Results of 148 completed surveys indicated that, in terms of judges' cooperation with the news media, judges' age and experience, time, and work and ethical constraints are important factors, along with the mere presence of local media. In addition, it appeared that accountability most affects judges' use of the media to receive information from the public rather than to send information to the public. One unexplained finding is the positive  correlation between cooperativeness and judges' having experienced adverse publicity. One theory is that judges who are victims of bad publicity may be unresponsive when asked for help, but they may volunteer assistance to defend themselves or to keep the flow of information as much as possible on their own terms.

Traditional principles of design--the focus of the course--are based on more fundamental gestalt theory, which relates to human pattern-seeking behavior, particularly how the eye tends to group parts into wholes. Just as verbal communication is governed by rules of grammar, graphic expression is governed by the gestalt principles of similarity and contrast, attraction and continuity, and isomorphism, the basis of symbolism. A visualization strategy should begin with the search for a lead that will dominate the design and then continue with three or four elements used in such a way as to create an  overall harmony, or gestalt. Two exercises are given: an abstract layout demonstrating the importance of spatial organization and a logo design using one letter that focuses attention on the shape of space. The simplicity and universality of gestalt makes its use relevant to teaching creativity, and its integration of the visual and verbal aspects of messages enhances the effectiveness of total communication. Two class exercises are provided, as well as a brief bibliography and a list of textbooks surveyed. (SRT)",

Respondents were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: working for a public organization or working for a private organization and deciding about the firing of a coach, and working in either situation and deciding about about nuclear waste disposal. Based on these situations and similar earlier research by Ryan and Martinson (1984), the two hypotheses proposed that (1) responses to the situations will differ significantly depending on whether or not the situation is public or private, with those responding to  the commercial interests less willing to give information to the public; and (2) responses to the coach firing will differ significantly from responses to the nuclear waste situation because the \"need to know\" about nuclear waste will compel subjects to release information. Responses did not support the first hypothesis, though the second was supported. However, the students indicated more uncertainty than the public relations practitioners in Ryan and Martinson's study, which suggests a need for teaching ethics in university-based communication programs.

        "description":"The interplay of historical, technological, legal, and economic events that surrounded the strident controversies involving two competing 1890s composing machines--John R. Rogers's Typograph and Ottmar Mergenthaler's Linotype--is examined in this paper. Using patent copies, court documents, trade journal reports and newspaper articles of the era, and press association accounts, the paper identifies and analyzes the role of the combatants, their machines, and patents, and the underlying forces involved in technological change. The paper first introduces briefly the economic and social concepts that had a bearing on the Mergenthaler-Rogers controversy and on the diffusion of the Linotype. The paper recounts the technological progress of typography from Gutenburg's movable type  through the 1890s, and provides biographical information on Rogers and Mergenthaler. This is followed by accounts of the injunction brought by Mergenthaler's company against the Rogers's machine, on the claim that the letter infringed upon the Mergenthaler patents, and of the competition ensuing from introduction of Rogers's Typograph. The paper then discusses an impression-type composer developed by J. W. Shuckers, with whose company Rogers subsequently merged, and the counter-infringement suit brought against Mergenthaler for use of Shucker's spaceband mechanism. Finally, the paper discusses Mergenthaler's acquisition of the Rogers firm in 1895 and the particulars of the purchase, as well as Rogers's subsequent work in the Mergenthaler organization and Shuckers's obscurity once the  patent for his spaceband mechanism was bought out. (Copies of ads for the two machines are included.) (HTH)",

Questions were designed to determine the degree to which people would buy into the new technologies without dropping interest or money spent on the old ones, and whether people who bought a VCR, for example, would drop their cable subscription, or their Home Box Office (HBO) or Showtime services. Results found little impact of the new technologies on the expenditure of time or money. No relationship between the time and money spent with media was found, except for the people who reported having the lowest income. Low income  respondents spent the largest percent of their income on mass media and also spent the largest amount of time with the media. Penetration of the new technologies into this market was found to be similar to national statistics--almost one-third of the respondents owned VCRs and about 17% owned computers. (HOD)",

        "description":"In the past, books for children treated death fearfully, morbidly, and didactically, but now children's literature treats death in a more realistic manner and is sensitive to its emotional aspects. Current theories suggest that children perceive death differently at various ages. G. P. Koocher (1973) used J. Piaget's cognitive stages as the basis for a theory of the development of children's feelings about death. M. Nagy (1959) proposed three conceptual stages of children: death as sleep, death as permanent, and death as permanent and universal. E. Kubler-Ross (1969) identified five stages that occur when one is confronted with death: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. The overall theme of death in children's books can be divided topically into  pets, parents, grandparents, siblings, and peers. A sixth grade class that was exposed to four books on death, to bring out the students' attitudes toward it, liked the books because they thought death should be understood, but at first they were uncomfortable discussing these books and their own perceptions of dying. (Authors and titles of books are provided, with a description of the basic story line, to demonstrate the existence of books that can help children understand and cope with death.) (SRT)",

        "description":"Different writing voices are linked to early adult developmental issues that are gender-related. Research by Donald Graves has shown that gender affects topic choice in girls' and boys' writing as early as age seven. Adult developmental theories provide frames for looking at the growth potential of writers and locating gender-related issues. The work of Erik Erikson suggests that identity is the main concern of most college-age students. Centering workshop discussions, therefore, in a composition class not only on a writing problem but also on a life-stage experience involves more students and encourages higher level thinking. In addition, William Perry's schema of intellectual development used in a writing course challenges the students to examine their own thinking processes.  An examination of the differences in choice of topics between men and women reveals that men tend to write about abstract topics, the ethic of rights for instance, whereas women tend to write about more personal topics, such as relationships with others. Nona Lyons's research suggests that male students describe themselves in terms that are separate and objective, while females describe themselves in terms of connectedness. If writing assignments are predominantly about personal experiences then male voices will not be heard at their best, and no voices should be left unheard. (SRT)",

Recently, this experience has also been made available to faculty members at San Diego State University through a faculty writers' workshop. In the workshops, listeners give constructive criticism while at the same time pointing out what works well and what is effective. Because participants in the workshops are members of different departments, they are sometimes more comfortable sharing unfinished, imperfect drafts in this situation than they would be if they were showing an incomplete product to members of their own department knowledgeable in the subject area. On those occasions when papers are not comprehensible to non-experts, the basic issues of audience, focus, and clarity emerge  and authors are able to revise their work. Very often, the group concludes that the first few pages of an article could be deleted or drastically cut in order to bring the main idea directly into focus. Although finding a time to meet that is convenient for a majority of people is not easy, the pressure on college faculty to publish serves as an incentive for teachers to attend the workshops. Overall, the response has been positive and members of the workshop share a common bond. (DF)",

Instead, simpler combinations of news media that mimic the characteristics of print may replace advertising in newspapers, causing them to downgrade journalism or increase subscription cost, thereby decreasing circulation and social impact. The danger to journalism is based on five propositions: (1) teletext can mimic the interactivity of two-way videotext at a fraction of the cost; (2) by the mid-1990s, teletext will offer advertisers a print-like medium at a cost far below that of newspapers; (3) retailers are learning that many kinds of advertising need not appear between news columns to be read by consumers; (4) the marriage of interests between readers  and advertisers will dissolve; (5) faced with a loss of advertising revenues, newspapers will either reduce the quality of journalism or maintain service only at high subscription rates for those who can afford it. Society will be affected adversely because the kind of news that exposes the problems in society and gives voice to those aggrieved is expensive journalism, the existence of which is threatened by these impending changes.

Some newspapers encouraged the migration while others discouraged it. Considered to be the newspaper that revolutionized black journalism, the Chicago &quot;Defender&quot; ran cartoons satirizing the pitiful conditions of blacks in the South and success stories were printed of southern blacks who had been successful in the North. It also counseled migrants on dress, sanitation, and behavior, and initiated fund drives for needy families. The  conservative principles of Washington, D.C., were reflected in the content of the Norfolk/Tidewater &quot;Journal and Guide.&quot; Its stance against migration was reflected in a series of articles, cartoons, and editorials that stressed the poor living conditions, racial discrimination, and false job hopes that existed in the North. The different stances of black newspapers concerning this migration reflect the diversity of a group of people striving for social and economic progress. End notes and a bibliography are appended.

A cluster sampling technique was used to select six random agricultural zones in the Dominican Republic. The six zones were subdivided and farmers from 20 small to medium-sized farms were selected from each of the 12 subzones for interviews. Data were collected on the farmer's use of mass media, interpersonal contacts with extension agents, activities in local organizations, main crop of the farm, and  demographic information. Results of data analysis suggest that for farmers in the Dominican Republic use of print, radio, and interpersonal sources of information are closely interrelated, with a particularly close relationship between print and interpersonal source use. Among other conclusions are that elements of the information system work together and that adoption behavior is closely linked to interpersonal source use. (DF)",

The study sample was a simulated &quot;week&quot; of issues, consisting of one day from each month for the first seven months of 1981 and 1985. (Argentine democracy was resorted in 1983). Photographs from each issue were categorized by source and by content. To determine content, two categories were used: photographs considered politically sensitive, such as pictures of political or governmental activity, and &quot;all others,&quot; which included spot news, mug shots, and public relations photographs. The results indicated notable differences in the  types of photographs published, depending on the government under which the paper was operating. The photo sources indicated an editorial move away from substantial reliance on photos of people and events outside of Argentina (Reuters News Service) toward the use of domestic Argentinian news photos by two Argentine news services once democracy was restored. The cross tabulation of photos by content under the two governments was equally interesting, but less clearly defined. A rather small number of photos was judged politically sensitive in the samples from both governments, but the use of politically sensitive photos doubled under democratic rule. (HTH)",

        "description":"In order to discover reader reactions to color on a newspaper page, specifically eye movement and overall opinion of the paper, identical pages were created and printed by the \"St. Petersburg Times\" (Florida). The content of fifteen front pages, six lifestyles pages, and three sports front pages were nearly identical, differing only in the kind and amount of color used. These were presented to 83 representative readers from three cities: Richmond, Virginia; Fresno, California; and St. Petersburg, Florida. Subjects' verbal responses to questions about where their eyes first fell and where they fell next were coded by trained interviewers. To test opinions, the subjects rated the pages on 20 word-pair scales, which were divided into five general factors: evaluative, ethical,  stylistic, potency, and activity. In another test of opinions, the readers were presented with the five pages in all possible pairs (10) and asked to select one page over the other on a word of interest, such as \"important\" (e.g., one of the pages would be \"more important\"). Color clearly made a difference in eye movement, and even though the main photo on all the pages drew the most attention, color reduced its power. The use of color does not seem to lower opinion about the ethical nature of the newspaper, and readers did not make assumptions about believability or importance based on the appearance of the paper alone. But because color does make a paper appear more interesting, pleasant, exciting, and powerful, a publisher might do well to use color, providing that the quality is good.  A literature review of the psychological effects of color is included. (SRT)",

In addition, the study analyzed what Bennett's religion coverage reveals about the man, his work, and his times. A content analysis was conducted of randomly selected issues of Bennett's &quot;New York Herald&quot; from 1836 to 1844. Each issue in the sample was read and all items, exclusive of paid advertisements, that mentioned a religion, religious person, or word commonly associated with religion was considered religious coverage. Each item was then coded using a content analysis scheme that called for recording the  length, author, style of writing, geographic location of the newsworthy event or situation, the primary religion discussed in the item and the image of that religion created by the coverage. Examination of the 224 religion items identified in the study indicates that religion coverage in the paper was more complex and less easily stereotyped as irreverent and critical of religion than some historians suggest, and that, although the coverage of religion did change over time, the change cannot be ascribed to an attempt to allay criticism of the paper that followed the Moral War.

        "description":"The two current approaches to teaching academic discourse are conventional and collaborative; in practice, they overlap because both are based on a &quot;conversational model&quot; of learning to write in college. Taxonomists and collaborationists disagree on the relative emphasis that should be placed on the various pedagogical methods: collaborationists fear that taxonomists adhere too rigidly to conventions and taxonomists fear that collaborationists ignore the problem of how much--or little--students know about these conventions in the first place. The conversational model emphasizes the social context for writing which helps teachers to diagnose student writing problems as systemic conditions, involving the whole academic community, and not as local deficiencies in the students  themselves. Students can be motivated to participate in academic discourse by pointing out that if they do not, they lose access to academic knowledge, and hence limit their future social, economic, and political options. Both taxonomists and collaborationists take the conversational model too literally; in order for a conversation-as-dialogue to foster initiation into a particular conversation-as-discourse, the participants in the dialogue must have some knowledge of the discursive practices of the larger conversation. In recognition of this inherent conflict, an in-depth, comparative, ethnological study of discursive practices in and out of school needs to be performed. (SRT)",

        "description":"Noting that television network coverage of hostage crises tends to emphasize the same topics while depicting them in similar ways, and that networks may be unwittingly granting legitimacy to terrorist grievances, a study investigated the nature of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; coverage of the Trans World Airline (TWA) hostage crisis. Specific questions addressed by the study dealt with the percentage of news time devoted to the crisis, the topics emphasized, types of stories and formats used, and types of sources interviewed. A content analysis of videotapes of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; broadcasts indicated that extensive coverage was devoted to the 17-day ordeal. Approximately 67% of news times and 61% of news stories were devoted to the crisis. Most stories were reporter stories, rather than  anchor stories, and approximately 63% of all stories contained interviews, most frequently with average citizens and public officials. Stories relating to the status, location, and health of the hostages represented the dominant topic of coverage, while topics relating to the hostages' families and official United States reaction to the crisis also characterized coverage. The findings suggest that NBC coverage was dramatic and reactive, as well as extensive, although limited attention was devoted to historical, cultural, and other factors which may have given rise to the TWA hijacking.

Males and females differed significantly in the amount of U.S. television they watched and in the implications of their viewing. Females were more likely to endorse nontraditional Korean viewpoints regarding roles, norms, and values. For males, the more they watched U.S. television, the more protective they became toward Korean culture, valuing the Korean over the U.S. family system and concerned  that Western culture might &quot;reduce Korea's cultural uniqueness.&quot; The findings suggested that heavy viewers of U.S. programs are more likely to take liberal positions on various social issues than are light viewers and that U.S. programs are contributing to the Westernization of traditional cultures.

The paper has been owned and operated by members of the Edward Lawrence Goodwin family since 1938 and has been staffed by excellent journalists over the course of the years. A review of copies of the &quot;Eagle&quot; from the last 9 years reveals a number of consistencies. The paper was normally neat and well edited, and contained many ads, particularly in the 1970s. Generally, the paper provided significant news. A member of the Goodwin family listed five factors that have enabled the paper to survive: (1) quality staff; (2) advertising success; (3) size of community; (4) sound  relations with the community; and (5) family commitment. Eight years have passed since the death of E. L. Goodwin, and the family-owners have undertaken changes, but they have yet to find solid management footing. The problems of the &quot;Eagle&quot; are typical of the Black press today, and other papers may benefit from the &quot;Eagle's&quot; experience. (DF)",

In addition, the students completed a general knowledge questionnaire one week later about a variety of news topics and about the space program. In the second part of the study, 40 students were asked to monitor the news on only one of three media--radio, television, or newspapers.  Findings showed that television-reliant students were more knowledgeable about the disaster than were newspaper- or radio-reliant students. The television-reliant students also possessed more accurate technical information and were more likely to recall accurately the details of the explosion.

To assess the effects of the training program, data were gathered in four ways: (1) teachers graded the same essay at the beginning and at the end of the semester; (2) each wrote a brief analysis comparing the two gradings; (3) three students from each teacher's class completed a questionnaire about their teacher's grading; and (4) the experienced teachers evaluated the new teachers' grading.  Results of training showed that the number, purpose, focus, and format of the comments changed positively, while the grades on the paper decreased. The teachers' responses to their own grading revealed a new confidence in their grading skills and the student questionnaires reflected satisfaction with teacher comments and grades. The evaluations by experienced teachers exhibited concern about inflated grades and unmarked grammatical and mechanical errors. Training sessions for new teachers can influence how they mark papers; however, new teachers themselves may require writing instruction. More research is needed to determine the role of grading in current pedagogy. A student essay for grading by a new teacher is included in the appendices, as well as a coding system for graded essays.  (SRT)",

Those developing the program should insist on collaboration among all participants in organizing and planning. The focus of the program should be on specifics that may be translated successfully into practice. Inservice should be designed so that it reflects the developmental stages of the teachers involved. For instance, beginning and developing teachers are willing to accept information and advice from authorities, but experienced teachers usually see little need for outside &quot;experts&quot;  and would prefer to set up and carry out their own inservice programs. Effective inservice programs will provide opportunities for teachers to reflect and to discuss the merits of what they do and will encourage the establishment of a peer support system that will carry forward the benefits of the inservice.

Using dramatic texts in a composition class can broaden student exposure to language contexts and rhetorical situations in a way that benefits their writing and thinking generally. Students can learn to focus their writing perspective and construct a rhetorical \"voice\" by assuming a role from a play and arguing from a specific character's point of view. To develop an understanding of ethos, and shared cultural assumptions, students \"translate\" a play such as Sheridan's \"The Rivals\" into modern terms,  with roughly equivalent contemporary characters and settings based on the local area. Students learn to understand genre expectations by asking whether \"Oedipus Rex\" is a murder mystery or a detective story, or whether Peter Shaffer's \"Equus\" is a problem-solving or therapy/ catharsis play. All discourse is in some sense dramatic and all writing and speaking are dialogue; therefore, drama can expand student writing skills. (SRT)",

The respondents included in the subsamples listed their occupation as reporters or editors, worked 35 hours or more a week, and were employed in one of three industries: newspaper printing and publishing, nonnewspaper printing and publishing (periodicals and books) or radio and television broadcasting. The 1970 subsample had  757 respondents, while the 1980 subsample had 1,080 respondents. The data revealed that the representation of women in the media labor force rose substantially from 1970 to 1980 and that women were paid less than men, although this difference appeared to be shrinking. For racial minorities, the data also revealed growth in representation, although minorities appeared to be paid less than whites. Taking education, gender, and age into account, minority status did not significantly contribute to variance in wage and salary income. Since these findings differed from noncensus studies, the study concluded that differences in sampling strategies can substantially affect the picture of the labor force presented.

Subjects, 48 college juniors and seniors enrolled in an introductory advertising class, were administered a pretest to determine product involvement. In addition, subjects viewed commercials they had not previously  seen and completed both a pretest and a posttest to evaluate message appeal. Finally, subjects viewed half of the commercials with no distractions and half of the commercials with distractions to gauge the effects of distractions on viewers. Results indicated that product involvement enhanced memory and evaluation of commercial messages, that positive emotional message appeals enhance evaluation, and that distraction harms both memory and evaluation.

The newspapers examined were the Atlanta &quot;Constitution,&quot; Arkansas &quot;Gazette,&quot; Chicago &quot;Tribune,&quot; Dallas &quot;Herald,&quot; Dallas &quot;News,&quot; Los Angeles &quot;Times,&quot; New York &quot;Journal,&quot; New York &quot;Times,&quot; New York &quot;Tribune,&quot; San Antonio &quot;Express,&quot; San Francisco &quot;Examiner,&quot; and &quot;Washington Post.&quot; The most surprising finding was the explicitness of many suicide stories. All of the newspapers surveyed, with the occasional exception of the Arkansas &quot;Gazette,&quot; gave prominent display to suicide stories, and included mention of base motive  and/or bloody detail. The message provided by suicide stories was straightforward: suicide was wrong, socially and theologically. Today, greater concern for invasion of privacy and awareness of potential lawsuits sometimes keeps journalists from being explicit in their judgment of suicide's rightness or wrongness, regardless of their personal feelings. Some reporters, influenced by the sociologist Emile Durkeim, stress societal and environmental causes of suicide, rather than personal failings. It is suggested, however, that journalists, when they approach their next suicide story, might keep in mind recent sociological studies that suggest religion is the central explanatory factor in suicide rate changes.

The two objectives for this simulation are to solidify students' understanding of various sampling techniques and of how these techniques can affect communication research results. The simulation follows instructional units on communication models and theory, and involves several steps. First, students respond to a few survey questions--such as their  political affiliation, religious preference, music preference, and so forth--the class period before the simulation. On the day of the simulation, students work in groups and analyze one question at a time, using various data sampling techniques (random, quota, purposive, systematic, and convenience). Students have found that the simulation helps them to develop an understanding of sampling bias and to differentiate among the sampling techniques through their examination and comparison of results.

Although previous non-empirical investigations of community college faculty have suggested an overall lack of communication between part-time and full-time faculty and between part-time faculty and administration, this study only partially  supported that supposition. Results revealed that even though part-time faculty did not express significantly more overall information uncertainty than did full-time faculty, part-time faculty wanted much more face-to-face communication with other faculty members as well as more contact with their immediate supervisor. Eight suggestions for improving communication for part-time faculty based on the study are offered. Data tables and references are appended. (DF)",

The 2-year study sought to (1) describe local district activities and operations under Chapter 2, the first federal education block grant, in the program's third year, noting changes occurring over the 3 years and changes from antecedent categorical grant programs; (2) assess the program's achievement of such federal legislative goals as educational improvement, reduction of administrative burden, and increased local discretion; (3) determine the influence of block grant mechanisms on local district activities; (4) identify local and state methods for evaluating Chapter 2 programs; and (5) develop recommendations applicable to  future federal policy. The study was organized around eight topics, each representing a purpose of the legislation or a set of issues regarding block grant mechanisms: (1) fund allocation and expenditure; (2) education service delivery; (3) local program administration; (4) local decision making; (5) parent and citizen involvement; (6) evaluation; (7) participation of private school students; and (8) intergovernmental relations. Data were collected through a nationally representative mail survey, a followup telephone survey, and site visits to 24 school districts and 8 state education agencies. This report is introduced with a discussion of the block grant, existing research on the grant, and a conceptual model of the grant and its implementation. The report then summarizes the findings  of the study, except for those concerned with evaluation methods.

Systems based on evaluations may fail if employees are not convinced that the systems lack bias. Research on the characteristics of successful merit pay systems was conducted in 6 public school districts that had used merit pay for at least 5 years and either used pay differentials of at least $1,000 or served over 10,000 students. Only 7 of 11,500 school districts originally surveyed in 1978 met these criteria in 1983, out of 47 that reported using merit pay. No urban districts met the criteria. The strategies used by the six districts to make merit pay  acceptable included providing extra pay for extra work, making everyone feel special, keeping the program inconspicuous, and legitimizing the program through employee participation. The research findings suggest that the uses of merit pay in education may not differ significantly from those in other industries, that workers' responses to merit pay systems may be sensitive to factors other than the merit incentives themselves, and that workers' participation in system development and revision is critical.

        "description":"Merit pay for teachers is often proposed as a compensation system that will enable public schools to motivate teachers to pursue organizational goals. Yet the promise of merit pay is dimmed by knowledge of its history: most attempts to implement merit pay for public school teachers over the last 75 years have failed. The first part of this paper uses microeconomics to explain the failures of most merit pay plans, and to show that merit pay, even taken on its own terms, does not provide a solution to the problem of how to motivate teachers. The second part investigates why merit pay survives in a very few school districts. The analysis is based on interviews with teachers and adminstrators in six school districts with enduring merit pay plans. The interviews indicate that in these  exceptional districts, merit pay contributes to solving problems quite different from the problem of motivating teachers. These problems include (1) how to support good teachers who differ in their relative needs for income and free time; (2) how to encourage meaningful dialogue between teachers and administrators on issues such as instructional evaluation, and (3) how to build community support for schools.

        "description":"A study of six selected school districts that had been using merit pay plans successfully for at least 6 years provided insight into administrative strategies associated with merit pay program success. The researchers visited the districts, interviewed teachers and administrators, and studied local documents. Each district used a unique combination of strategies from a list of four: the programs can involve (1) providing extra pay for extra work rather than for higher performance, (2) involving teachers in the establishment of merit criteria, (3) minimizing the impact of awards by keeping them small or distributing them widely, or (4) keeping the program profile low by limiting publicity or making participation voluntary. In the districts studied, teaching quality was generally  high, relations between teachers and administrators were good, morale was high, the communities were economically and socially advantaged, teacher salaries were good, and teacher evaluation criteria were broad and not tied to student performance. The merit pay programs examined seemed to encourage work outside the classroom and useful evaluation of teachers, but appeared to have little direct impact on instructional practice. The programs also seemed to encourage community support by adding to the district's aura of accountability. This report discusses three of the districts in some detail and concludes with a discussion of the ironic finding that merit pay programs may be most successful when conditions exist that are likely to lead soon to the elimination of the programs' value--that  is, when most teachers exhibit comparably high merit.

These issues involve the proper roles of the agencies concerned, the characteristics appropriate for a teacher salary and evaluation system, and suitable processes for implementing and maintaining the program. The second  section of the report discusses implementation of the career ladder system. The teacher survey found that attitudes concerning the quality of communication about the program were mixed, that those concerning &quot;fast-tracking&quot; to place established teachers higher on the ladder were generally favorable, and that those concerning the teacher evaluation processes used were generally unfavorable. The report concludes with a discussion of the findings and with recommendations addressed to those considering implementing statewide career ladder programs. (PGD)",

        "description":"All 24 of Maryland's county school systems participated in a voluntary school improvement program that involved the adoption and implementation of one or more of four research-based, instructional processes: Active Teaching, Mastery Learning, Student Team Learning, and Teaching Variables. A 5-year study of this program produced findings on a number of research topics. Findings in two of these topic areas are discussed in this paper: identification of the characteristics associated with institutionalization of innovations, and identification of the factors best predicting the institutionalization of innovations at the school and district levels. The paper briefly reviews related research, then describes the study methodology. Data collection methods used in the 180 schools  involved in the program included analyzing local and state documents, observing training events and classroom implementation activities, evaluating annual questionnaire responses from representative program participants, and interviewing project coordinators and implementers. Successful institutionalization was associated with three types of factors: procedural, policy, and organizational. The strongest predictors of institutionalization were administrative support and instructional gain. Districtwide institutionalization correlated strongly with school institutionalization. Institutionalization failed where there was little evidence of instructional gain in the first year and where staff, program, or organizational changes were prevalent. (PGD)",

The paper's first section describes the Swedish educational system's structure, noting the roles played by the national government, local governments, and the National Board of Education. The second section of the paper looks at Sweden's history of interest in educational improvement, discusses changes in the national curriculum, and describes the policies (and their costs) for professional development of teachers. The third section of the paper describes three studies providing longitudinal information about the effects of these professional development programs. One of these studies, conducted in 1979, replicated another study, conducted in 1969. These 2 studies obtained  information from students and teachers in upper grades in 12 locations around Sweden. The data showed relatively few changes in classroom teaching styles, some decreases in student and teacher workloads, and little increase in student feelings of independence. The third study, a 4-year study in three school management districts, found the schools' decision-making system a major cause for the schools' resistance to change. The findings of all three studies suggest that research results may not be broadly generalizable even in centralized educational systems. (PGD)",

(2) To what extent have these policies been implemented in practice? (3) What types of appraisal policies are most effective? and (4) What processes have school boards used to develop and implement their appraisal policies? To answer these questions, policies for the appraisal of teachers, principals, superintendents, and directors were requested from all 126 public boards of education or county and district Roman Catholic separate school boards in Ontario. Based on the responses, typologies were developed for appraisal practices for each of the roles under study, and questionnaires based on these typologies were administered to  teachers, principals, superintendents, trustees, and directors in a stratified sample of 30 representative school boards. Percentage distributions were prepared for all characteristics included in the typologies of performance appraisal policy, revealing which practices were most widespread, and the characteristics of appraisal systems were correlated with their effects on the attitudes and behavior of those evaluated. Finally, individual case study reports were used to prepare a comparative analysis. Findings, reported in detail, suggest that formal appraisal systems can be effective, but that more effort must be made in implementing policies, and that stronger linkages are needed between performance appraisal and school boards' goals, organization, and job descriptions.

Teachers portrayed effective principals as creating environments around the classroom that minimize uncertainty and maintain a positive atmosphere. The principal's role thus focuses neither on inspiring effective teaching nor on proposing innovations, but on limiting the factors that impede the teacher's own abilities to teach effectively. This view of the principal's role conforms neither to the research-based vision of the principal as a somewhat powerless middle manager nor to the view in the effective schools  literature of the principal as actively involved in classroom affairs. Focusing on the needs of a varied staff in a given school requires principals to provide leadership based on problem-solving rather than on conformity to research-generated prescriptions. Agreement among teachers and principals on the principal's role will enhance the potential for concerted efforts at school improvement. (PGD)",

        "description":"This report describes a technique for establishing relative priorities among policy issues that have been systematically identified in and extracted from written documents. The method involves assigning values to five factors that affect an issue's priority. These factors are: uncertainty, or the degree to which information is lacking; imminence, or the degree to which responses must be made quickly; the probability of change in the policies or practices affected by the issue; the scope of the change; and sensitivity to information, or the degree to which new information can alter decisions. Each factor is given values on a scale from 1 to 3 (low to high degree of impact), and the values are simply multiplied by each other to provide a score. The report reviews the background to  the development of the technique, discusses briefly the identification of policy issues, describes the reasoning behind selection of the factors incorporated in the technique, considers modification of the technique by weighting critical factors, comments on assessing the values to be assigned to the factors, provides two examples of application of the method, and notes strengths and weaknesses of the process. An appendix provides further information on the system for identifying and prioritizing policy issues as developed by the Statistical Analysis Group in Education. (PGD)",

An argument for identifying and rewarding merit schools, rather than merit teachers, is presented by Walter I. Garms of the University of Rochester. Garms  discusses methods of measuring merit and specific indicators of merit, arguing that schools need freedom to manipulate resources to achieve desired results. Gene Dawson of the School of Education at Berkeley describes how data are collected for the California Basic Educational Data System, and offers suggestions for improving reliability. Edward Haertel of Stanford University discusses general problems of measuring the effects of reform, and David Stern of the University of California at Berkeley further explores the merit school concept and discusses issues related to California's new &quot;quality indicators&quot; program.

California has experienced a roller-coaster pattern in funding support since 1978, the year of Proposition 13. School financing declined from a position of national leadership in the 1960s to below the national average--a level inadequate for the increasingly high-technology economy. The state began working toward improved educational quality in 1983 by demanding more of teachers and students and by providing new funding, achieving a constant funding level during 1983-85. The second section analyzes educational issues for the next five years: implementation of reform, changing student  demographics, high school dropout rate, decline in quantity and quality of people entering and remaining in teaching, and capital construction. The final section summarizes revenue needs for these issues, including growth projections and strategies for raising revenue. In spite of the beneficial effects of the reform, the present challenge is to maintain a high priority for education, and to continue additional funding. (CJH)",

This report contends that careful analysis of proposed changes of teacher reward systems has been omitted. The issues requiring attention involve incentive rationale and incentive system design. Chapter 2 considers rationales on which recent proposals for performance-based teacher pay and promotion are founded, including behavioral assumptions, mechanisms to enhance educational quality, and conditions under which mechanisms are likely to work. Chapter 3 focuses on questions concerning the teacher evaluation component of an incentive system, putting forth criteria that evaluation methods must  meet, applying them to evaluation approaches, and assessing adequacy of prospective performance measures. Chapter 4 deals with such design issues as structuring of rewards. A final chapter consolidates the report's major findings; recommended are performance-contingent pay increases, universal coverage, differentiation among multiple performance levels, and predetermined reward criteria.

Organizational research demonstrates the importance of meaningful work and authority relationship factors in determining employee attitudes. This study examines effects of career ladders on teachers' work, careers, and relationships with principals. Field data were gathered in the Provo school district (Utah) after the first year of a career ladder plan. A survey instrument tested attitude interaction patterns emerging during implementation. Teachers were asked open ended questions. The final survey includes 51 declarative statements to which teachers responded by a Likert scale. Survey results indicate that teachers  feel basically, but not overwhelmingly, positive about most aspects of career ladders. Groups of teachers differ in attitudes about job redesign features; for example, teachers able to make experiential comparisons feel the new process promotes collegiality. Plan implementation is a crucial stage because traditional egalitarian work norms and authority relationships are affected. Teachers, nonetheless, respond favorably to career ladder effects on their work. Because these data are pertinent to national debates about quality of work life policies, longitudinal and qualitative research methodologies are recommended. Eight tables summarize survey results. Forty references are included. (CJH)",

Findings included that students in all schools were similar in degree and onset of hearing loss, although incoming students' academic achievement varied as did the number of types of secondary disabilities. The federal share of total costs ranged from 29% (California State University, Northridge) to 85% (NTID). Schools offered a wide range of academic subjects and granted various combinations of certificates, diplomas, and  degrees. Available data on employment revealed that the number of graduates employed or attending further schooling ranged from 74% to 97% for school year 1983-84.

        "description":"The project explored the assessment of vocational decision-making capacities of handicapped students within the educational system, specifically the Decision-Making Interview (DMI) instrument. The adaptability, reliability, validity, and utility of the DMI with handicapped secondary students were investigated. Under an instrument adaptation phase and three separate studies, the DMI was modified and then its test-retest reliability and discriminant validity were investigated. A further study investigated the characteritics of the students within these settings, and then determined whether any of these characteristics of the students were related to particular strengths or weaknesses in DMI scores. The results suggested that the DMI is an appropriate instrument for use with special  education students. The instrument was reliable in term of correlations between test and retest, utilizing intervals ranging from 2 weeks to 1 full school year. Furthermore, the DMI clearly distinguished between handicapped and non-handicapped special education students, and demonstrated that non-handicapped students scored significantly higher on the DMI scales than handicapped students. A second study demonstrated the criterion-related validity. Significant consistent correlations were found between scores on the DMI and parallel but independent judgements of student on the same dimensions of the DMI provided by evaluators working with the students. Lastly, a study identified a number of salient personal and demographic characteristics of the students significantly correlated with high  or low scores on the vocational decision-making dimensions. The appendixes provide the Vocational Decision-Making Interview form and the Evaluator/Counselor form. (Author/CL)",

Mother-infant interaction sessions were videotaped and motor evaluations conducted. Data collected included behavioral ratings of infant affect and of infant looking patterns, ratings of maternal behavior in play with her child, and questionnaire responses regarding maternal depression. Results revealed that handicapped and nonhandicapped infants significantly differed from one another in the frequency and type of behaviors exhibited. Handicapped Ss demonstrated more negative affect and more looking away than did normal Ss in interaction with their mothers. The two groups of mothers were also significantly different in their interactive styles.  Mothers of handicapped Ss received higher ratings in the amount of their interactive behavior but did not differ from mothers of normal Ss in the quality or appropriateness of behavior. The only infant characteristic associated with maternal interaction was neuromotor risk. However, when the influence of early intervention was considered, the type of intervention services received was significantly associated with mothers' interaction ratings. Finally, none of the infant characteristics measured was significantly associated with maternal depression scores. Sixteen pages of references are provided.

In phase I of the project, 101 children (including 12 nonhandicapped, 57 mildly, 28 moderately, and 4 severely handicapped students) participated in an examination of the relationship between task persistence and four variables: handicapping condition, social functioning, intellectual ability, and school-related achievement. The effect of teacher behavior on task persistence in small group, large group, and free play settings was also examined. In phase II, intervention materials and procedures for teachers were developed and their effects on student achievement measured. Two extensive sets of tables  give preliminary summaries of teacher and child behaviors. Revision of the materials will be completed in phase III, and long-term effects on school achievement measured. Significant increases in appropriate teacher and aide behaviors were noted along with significant increases in covert engaged behavior of the children and a significant decrease in off-task behavior. The five appendices consist of training outlines and instructions for preparing teachers to improve students' task persistence (in verbal and fine motor activities) and test-taking skill (maze test and block test).

Structured assessment procedures and behavioral coding of free  play sessions were used in two studies. Among results were indication of group differences in the total occurrence of three of four potentially communicative infant behaviors; no group difference in the frequency of maternal attributions of communication; a positive within-handicapped sample relation between degree of handicap and maternal tendency to attribute; and a positive within-handicapped sample relation between degree of handicap and maternal responsiveness to communicative behaviors.

EMG effects on muscle relaxation/contraction and thermal information collected by sensors were analyzed. Ss were treated twice a week for 6 weeks. Results indicated that changes in muscle tone, due to either trunk rotation or slow rolling, could be measured through use of EMG. The change was statistically significant when measured just prior to intervention and immediately thereafter. No significant difference was found on skin temperature  readings. EMG did not discriminate between the effects of trunk rotation or slow rolling on a ball. Variables that may have influenced the results are noted, and a 12-page reference list is provided.

        "description":"The study, involving 15 Indiana high school resource room teachers, focused on three aspects of resource room programming: (1) teachers' perceptions of their roles as resource room teachers and perceived concerns regarding the provision of services to mildly handicapped adolescents; (2) role-related activities of secondary resource room teachers; and (3) the amount of academic learning time (ALT) provided within secondary resource room programs. Interviews with the resource teachers and resource room observations yielded data that indicated that, despite some common features, programs varied widely in characteristics and operation. Data are summarized for salient characteristics (such as number of students served, program components, and resource room scheduling). Among findings  were that two-thirds of the programs were multicategorical; the numbers of students served ranged from 7 to 70; resource rooms could be classified into six types based on the nature of teacher activities (tutorial, prevocational, content-area, basic skills, coping skills, and consultation); tutorial services existed in 73% of the programs, but only two programs had provisions for systematic consultation with regular class teachers; and ALT data showed that target students worked independently, without any direct teacher involvement for 22% of the time. Among the 10 recommendations made were: that teacher education programs should more adequately prepare secondary school special educators; that certification should be distinct for secondary special educators; and that secondary school  resource room teachers should be given more control over their schedules, caseloads, and grouping practices. Six pages of references are provided, and appendices consist of interview topics, interview documents, and sample teacher observations and category descriptions. (CL)",

The book describes the difficulties handicapped children face in learning to use and enjoy such reading materials as braille books, large print books, and audio cassette recordings. The interviews focus on reading enjoyment and skills, library use, information needs and satisfaction with or improvements required in service from their own network library. Interviews with the children and their mothers provide information about the types of home environment that stimulate reading as well as the types of influences that limit reading. Teachers are asked about their use of the  National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) and about their approach to reading in the classroom. Interviews with counselors focus on what handicapped children must overcome to become healthy, happy, and well-rounded. The importance of the preschool years to a handicapped child's development is also stressed. Reading specialists respond to questions about the effects of mainstreaming on reading. Staff librarians offer suggestions on improving the NLS program for print-handicapped children. (CL)",

Information is drawn from literature reviews, telephone surveys of over 50 programs nationwide, and visits to 5 community service systems in 4 states. An initial section outlines basic principles for community integration, followed by a review and critique of the continuum concept, the notion that persons with a range of disabilities need to live in a range of most restrictive to least restrictive settings. Analysis of the nonrestrictive concept stresses the importance of supporting children in natural, foster, and adoptive families. Ways in which good families for children can be found are considered and illustrated by examples. Types of support that must be offered such  families are noted - including staff and professional support and case management. Participation in community life is stressed as is the need for integrated and individualized vocational services. Commitment flexibility and accountability are emphasized. Guidelines for operating group homes are presented, including avoiding institutional trappings and teaching functional life skills. (CL)",

Georgia were compared on numerous variables related to preplacement evaluation, classification and placement in special education, and reevaluation. On nearly all variables black and white mildly mentally retarded (MMR) students were essentially the same. The few statistically significant differences were relatively small, suggesting slightly greater impairment on the part of white students classified as mildly retarded. Findings suggest the equal treatment notion of fairness was achieved in these defendant school districts. However, other legal notions of fairness, such as equal results, were not achieved and probably cannot be achieved without using  different placement criteria for white and black students. Examination of these records indicated that only one student was clearly misplaced. Although the placements for 68 of the 69 students seemed appropriate, some aspects of many of the preplacment evaluations were below reasonable standards for best practices. Assessment of adaptive behavior was frequently not discussed explicitly. Some improvement in assessment practices was apparent from the original preplacement to the triennial reevaluations.

Results are depicted in table form and summarized according to five major objectives: (1) to determine types of regular education remedial services available to LD students (speech therapy was the most frequently provided special service); (2) to determine selection procedures of LD students (the most common reason for referral was academic difficulties); (3) to determine the percentage of time per day that LD students received special services (the majority were served through resource programs with an average of nearly 6 hours per week); (4) to determine areas of emphasis  in LD programs (the goals established were primarily academic in nature); and (5) to determine if there are demographic or other variables associated with the identification process (there was no discernable pattern in the procedures used by districts to classify children as LD). Findings suggested the need for the state to take action to bring consistency to the classification and service provision process. Three options are offered for consideration: (1) to allow all theories a fair test on the premise that one would eventually win out; (2) to adopt the state's own classification criteria; or (3) to provide services solely on the basis of demonstrated need regardless of arbitrary classification.

Self-monitoring procedures included counting and recording units of work completed and the amount of time spent working daily on assigned tasks. Ss were trained on a strategy for evaluating their rate of work performance on job tasks and for soliciting supervisor feedback. Analysis of task errors revealed consistent patterns of errors only on the task involving scrubbing pots and pans. Findings suggested that practitioners should establish a measurement system, create a self-monitoring system that is manageable by individual workers, establish a  system for self-evaluation and self-solicitation of supervisor feedback, implement a self-solicitation procedure when a maintenance problem is present, and periodically check the accuracy of worker self-monitoring.

It is suggested that more detailed research, especially sociolinguistic research relating to Latin American Spanish, might approach the analysis differently. The forms of &quot;le&quot; indeterminacy that seem not to conform to the standard treatment include: cases in which &quot;le&quot; appears as a sociolinguistically determined substitution for &quot;lo,&quot; the form standard explanations would dictate; pattern conformity; and structures involving ambiguity or semantic overlapping in addition to these patterns. An  alternative analysis viewing certain verbs as homonymic predicates, either communicative (of the &quot;decir&quot; class) or agentive (of the &quot;hacer&quot; class), is proposed and illustrated, and it is suggested that structural symmetry is a confounding pressure in these cases. It is also proposed that &quot;le&quot; functions as an unmarked third-person pronoun and grammatically acceptable compromise. (MSE)",

The first exercise contrasted sentences showing normal number agreement with virtually identical sentences in which a number anomaly had been introduced. The second exercise used differing assignments of reference relations. Evidence of the pronoun bias effect was found using this technique, and while it is not thought to be conclusive, it is distinct from the earlier experiment's results. This result suggests a different underlying link to the  comprehension process; it suggests also that the pronoun bias effect is not an artifact of interruption of the context material in those experiments done with auditory contexts and the naming task.

Theory and research on transfer are discussed as they relate to item versus system learning processes, perceived language distance or relatedness, the learner's receptive versus productive competence, and the learner's stage of learning. It is concluded that the four most important variables in relation to the role played by the first language in learning the second language are: (1) the learner's age and mode of learning, with adults using transfer more than children and with more transfer occurring in a  foreign-language learning situation than in a second-language learning situation; (2) spontaneity of utterance, with more transfer in elicited utterances, particularly when much time is available for response; (3) the learner's proficiency in the second and other languages; and (4) differences in individual learning styles. More quantitative research on the role of these factors is recommended. A three-page list of references concludes the study. (MSE)",

        "description":"A comparison of the usage of English articles and prepositions by native speakers of Finnish and of Finland-Swedish studied the word frequencies of these grammatical categories in three levels of English essays written by school-leavers in Finnish-language and Swedish-language schools in Finland. It was hypothesized that the poorest essays written by Finnish-speakers would show lower frequencies in the use of English articles and of prepositions where simple one-to-one correspondences are difficult to establish. The frequencies of these words were expected to rise somewhat in intermediate essays and to rise to almost native-speaker level in the good essays. Because Finland-Swedish is grammatically closer to English, the figures for Finland-Swedish learners were expected to be  higher than those of the Finns at the lower levels, but the figures for the best essays were not expected to differ very much. One hundred fifty essays on three levels of proficiency written by Finnish-speaking and the same number written by Swedish-speaking students were chosen to test the hypothesis. The data supported that hypothesis. It is concluded that the pattern of learning articles and prepositions in English where there are no easily established Finnish equivalents represents an avoidance by the students of linguistic features that are absent in the first language and perhaps considered redundant by the learner at early stages. The process should be considered a lack of transfer rather than indirect negative transfer of knowledge from the first language to the second.  (MSE)",

The examinations were those graded by a native Swedish-speaker during a 7-year period. It was hypothesized that learning Swedish, a language similar to English, would influence students' knowledge of English. Few examples of grammatical influence were found except for word order errors, many of which could be the result of interaction between Finnish and Swedish. The clearest examples of probable Swedish influence on word order were found in subject-verb inversions. Two major Swedish  lexical influences were found, one in which formal similarity between existing Swedish and English words led to a negative influence on the learner, and another in which the learner's search for an individual English lexical item activated a Swedish item. The data support a hypothesis of non-native language transfer to the other non-native language being learned. Such transfer differs from native-language influence. (MSE)",

The study drew data from a simple productive and receptive English skills test administered to 74 pupils at that level in four Swedish-language schools in Finland. A relatively good knowledge of English vocabulary was found, especially in instances of similarity between English and Swedish forms. On the receptive (listening comprehension) portion of the test, the average of correctly identified words was 52 percent, and for expressions it was 58 percent, with recognition being best for words referring  to family, pets, parts of the body, and colors. On the productive test, in which students were asked to write as many English words as possible and their Swedish equivalents in 20 minutes, the pupils produced 246 different words, with 25 percent of those occurring in more than two pupils' lists and referring to aspects of everyday life, such as numerals, colors, animals, and days of the week. It is recommended that teachers of English to Swedish-speakers take advantage of the linguistic similarities to facilitate comprehension. (MSE)",

Among the conclusions drawn from it are the following: (1) bilingual education is superior to submersion education in many contexts;(2) one major bilingual education goal should be development of the full repertoire of English linguistic skills, in preparation for mainstreaming; (3) time spent learning the native language in bilingual programs is not time lost in developing English skills; (4) children can become fluent in a second language without losing the first language, and maintenance of the first language does not retard second language development; (5) there is no cognitive cost, and there may be advantages, in the development  of bilingualism in children; (6) bilingual education programs should have the flexibility of adjusting to the large individual and cultural differences among children, including need for lengthy bilingual education; (7) educators should understand that for primary grade children second language learning may be a slow process and that older learners can learn languages quickly and efficiently; (8) reading should be taught in the native language; and (9) actions upgrading the status of limited-English-speaking children's culture and language contribute to their opportunities for friendship with native English-speaking children.

As the focus in writing instruction turned from product to process, the emphasis has turned away from the teaching of grammar and prescribed patterns of organization. This has been interpreted by some as a shift away from rigor and as a split between form and content and between grammatical accuracy and fluency. The two approaches, however, can be reconciled. A review of 10 recent ESL writing  textbooks reveals no real change in approach. Rather, there is a continued traditional emphasis on prescribed form, enhanced by a few prewriting strategies and group activities intended to focus on process. This survey makes clear that current theory about writing instruction has not been fully translated into practice. Writing teachers would find it helpful to have a comprehensive theory of the acquisition of writing ability and instructional materials that attend to concerns about product in the context of a process approach to writing. Some indications on a textbook analysis are appended. Included are the features examined and bibliographic information on the textbooks. (MSE)",

The sample of 334 colleges was made up of 127 public and 207 private institutions, of which 180 were small, 120 were medium, and 34 were large. Of the colleges, 20% had experienced declining enrollments during the last 5 years, 42% had greater than 5% growth, and 38% were stable between plus and minus 5%. Questionnaires were completed by 3,406 respondents  (department heads, administrators, and trustees). Schools were categorized as declining based on: (1) reported decline with 100% agreement among respondents; (2) actual data indicating declines in enrollments and revenues (adjusted for inflation) between 1977 and 1981; and (3) findings that there were more years of decline than of growth during the period and that the overall change was negative. Multivariate analyses of covariance were used to compare declining and stable institutions on the 12 attributes, using the three definitions of decline. (SW)",

        "description":"The types of merit pay increments and arguments for and against merit increments are reviewed, along with important variables a college should address when considering merit increments. The least common system at colleges and universities today is that of determining the entire faculty salary on the basis of merit. Most common at the university level is the merit increase that is combined with cost-of-living increments (COLA). In this system all faculty members receive a salary increase and those recognized as meritorious receive an additional increase. The greatest difficulty with this system is in determining the percentages of the increases of the COLA and merit raises. Another merit system complements salary increases by yearly percentage of bonus increases. Arguments in  favor of merit increments suggest that merit is both a reward and incentive for excellence. Arguments against merit increases make the case that measuring instruments do not evaluate quality, merit evaluators are too subjective, and fair merit systems are difficult to develop. Additional considerations that are important to the success of such a system are: the amount of the faculty's base salary in comparison to similar colleges, the relationship of the faculty to the college's administration, and the profitability of spending the necessary time and energy to conduct an evaluation.

Perceptions of administrators about institutional resources and performance were studied, along with the effects of institutional structure and three types of strategies: (1) a linear model based on methodical, sequential planning that is oriented to accomplishing stated goals; (2) an adaptive strategy involving assessment of the external environment and the capacities of the school, and adjustment of either or both; and (3) an interpretive strategy that is based on the idea that the organization is a social contract among individuals who freely agree  to cooperate. Dimensions of perceived organizational performance include investor confidence, leader credibility, faculty quality, and ability to get resources. The study involved 474 administrators who perceived high levels of unpredictability in revenues and enrollments and 209 administrators who perceived low levels of unpredictability. The results suggest that administrators' perceptions of resource unpredictability are unrelated to perceptions of institutional performance.

The basic assumption is that it is easier, more accurate, and more beneficial for individuals and organizations to identify criteria of ineffectiveness (faults and weaknesses) than to identify criteria of effectiveness (competencies). An organization is defined as being effective to the extent that it is free from characteristics of ineffectiveness. The technique for assessing and improving organizational effectiveness is called &quot;fault tree analysis.&quot; Seven steps used in fault tree analysis when assessing organizational effectiveness include: answer seven critical questions to limit the scope of the assessment, determine the top fault  and contributing faults, analyze specifics to identify a change strategy, determine weights for the faults through subjective judgments of importance and frequency, compute primary and secondary strategic paths through logic gates, and identify prioritized change strategies for improving organizational effectiveness. Advantages and disadvantages of fault tree analysis are considered, and an example of a private liberal arts college is used to identify indicators of ineffectiveness.

Correlation analysis was used to examine differences between respondents' perceptions of institutional environments,  form and functioning, and outcomes in declining and nondeclining institutions. Finally, regression analysis considered the extent to which institutions engaged in across-the-board versus selective cuts as they experienced declining revenues, and the extent to which resources were reallocated among different areas of institutional operations. No implicit hierarchy of response that reflected the severity of decline was found. Additional findings are presented, along with study questionnaires. (SW)",

A performance profile for individual organizations and a preference profile for different constituencies of the organizations were obtained, using the same dimensions of effectiveness for both types of profiles. Each of the 29 institutions was found to hold unique performance profiles. Five unique preference profiles were found among seven major constituencies (faculty department heads, student affairs administrators, financial administrators, academic administrators, general administrators, trustees, and representatives of major funders). Comparisons of each institution's performance profile with the  preference profiles of the seven constituencies revealed that some institutions satisfied multiple constituencies whereas others did not, and some constituencies tended to be satisfied more often than others. It was found that the most effective organizations tended to satisfy multiple constituencies, whereas the least effective organizations tended to satisfy no constituencies. In addition, some organizations were highly effective even when they satisfied no major constituencies. (SW)",

In some studies, learning approaches in different academic disciplines and across a range of academic activities (e.g., reading, essay-writing) have been assessed. The inventories include the Approaches to Studying Inventory and the Inventory of Learning Processes. Findings of both qualitative and quantitative studies indicate that different forms of motivation are associated with the three main approaches to learning (deep, surface, and strategic). Intention and process in  student learning seemed to be inseparable. Learning approach was strongly affected by assessment procedures, workload, freedom in learning, and by what students perceived to be good teaching. Definitions are provided for the following learning approaches and styles: deep approach, surface approach, strategic approach, comprehension learning style, and operation learning style.

The effects of academic variables on persistence from fall to spring semester were also assessed for transfer and native students. The model accounted for 49% of the total variance in persistence, while separate models for transfers and natives accounted for 55% and 51%, respectively. The variables having the greatest direct or indirect effects on persistence were practical value, academic integration, academic satisfaction, academic performance, and intent. The results indicate that academic factors represent an important component in student persistence models. Although persistence rates of transfers and natives were not significantly different, the  following differences between the two groups were found: academic performance had a greater effect on persistence for natives, academic difficulty was a factor only for natives and educational aspiration only for transfers, the effects of external factors on academic satisfaction and the effects of academic satisfaction on performance were positive for transfers and negative for natives, the students' gender and class level also contributed to these differences. It is recommended that this causal model of transfer student persistence be used in further research. References, figures and data tables are appended. (Author/SW)",

The importance of community colleges in the education of Mexican Americans is noted. Reasons for declining college enrollments for Hispanics are identified: high college costs, the change in financial aid from grants to loans, more difficult admission standards, and the increased use of assessment. Three misuses of educational testing that have implications for Mexican Americans include: heavy reliance on testing for admissions, testing to predict college success, and teacher testing. It is suggested that the net result of the increased use (and misuse) of testing is a sharp decline in the enrollment of  Hispanics in colleges and a reduction of Hispanics seeking to become teachers. The educational prospects of Mexican American children are not encouraging. Hispanics are poorer than the general population and their educational level is considerably below non-Hispanic Whites. Recommendations for the future include: providing access for Mexican Americans to social and economic mobility, increasing the number of Mexican American and minority teachers, improving preparation for college, and scrunitizing testing.

The outlines of a theory of the mechanisms of transfer are presented, the theory is used to examine the contrasts between certain studies that did and did not obtain positive transfer results from programming, and a discussion is presented of the kinds of transfer that can be expected from programming and when. Two roads to transfer are identified (high and low) and examples of each are provided. In addition, six broad categories of transfer that might occur with programming are described: (1) mathematical and geometric concepts and principles; (2) problem solving, problem finding and problem  management; (3) abilities of formal reasoning and representation; (4) models of knowledge, thinking, and learning; (5) cognitive styles; and (6) enthusiasms and tolerances. It is concluded that although programming instruction can improve cognitive skills under the right conditions, implementing such conditions on a wide scale may be difficult, and programming will have to compete in the intellectual and economic markets with a number of other approaches to the same general problem.

Those who teach with this idea in mind can be said to be thinking-skills centered or procognitive; those who teach without this idea in mind can be termed content-centered or procontent. The procognitive viewpoint is based on seven assumptions: (1) all subject matter can be taught procognitively; (2) subject matter and critical thinking skills can be taught at the same time; (3) all subject matter serves some purpose; (4) it is a teacher's responsibility to encourage discourse (thinking) by providing examples that arrange subject matter to show its purpose by revealing the relationships and interconnections which exist in all subject matter; (5) it  is the learner's responsibility to understand and apply such example arrangements to new subject matter; (6) students must be actively encouraged to present subject matter in a procognitive manner; and (7) all modes of educational technology can be delivered procognitively. These assumptions derive from an integrated view of subject matter, critical thinking, teaching, educational technology, and learning. In turn, these five major procognitive concerns form a three-part model which consists of the resource, the process, and the result. The application of procognitive methodology is illustrated using this three-part model to plan a discussion of the topic, how to do well in college. A list of nine references is provided. (JB)",

A message system analysis performed on a sample of  prime-time dramatic programs broadcast between 1973 and 1983 revealed that, if medicine is included, the images of science and technology appear in 7 out of every 10 of these programs, and that, in addition to news and occasional documentaries, the average prime-time viewer will see 11 doctors and one or two other scientists each week. The results of a national telephone survey of adults (N=1,643) indicate that heavy watchers of television have less favorable attitudes toward science than those who watch television less, especially in groups whose light viewers are the most favorable (such as those who went to college); television viewing is associated with a less positive adults (N=1,643) view of scientists and new technologies; and heavy viewers show more willingness to place  restrictions on science and evidence the opinion that scientists are odd and peculiar. While television appears to inhibit interest in science among the best informed, it also reduced the amount the most interested think they know.

        "description":"This case study of the acquisition and utilization of microcomputers for administrative purposes at Chipola Junior College, Florida focuses on the reactions of faculty and staff. After a brief review of the college's prior microcomputing activities from 1981 to 1985, the report is divided into four major sections: (1) how administrators involved in microcomputer technology affected management information systems/data processing (MIS/DP) operations at the college; (2) how microcomputers could best support the administrative process; (3) whether to provide staff with computer inservice or information management skills training; and (4) the bottom line: a better management information system. Additional topics addressed include the need for cooperation between the MIS/DP department  and microcomputer enthusiasts, optimum utilization of microcomputers by midlevel management, and the role of the secretarial/clerical worker in the process of downloading from a mainframe. It is pointed out that knowledge of computers and software packages does not insure that personnel understand the broader perspective of information as a &quot;commodity&quot; that needs to be managed carefully throughout the organization; and suggestions are made for changes in procedures that are routine for MIS/DP departments and necessary for administrative microcomputing support staffs.

        "description":"A survey of computer scientists was conducted to identify factors that affect software complexity. A total of 160 items were selected from the literature to include in a questionnaire sent to 425 individuals who were employees of computer-related businesses in Lawrence and Kansas City. The items were grouped into nine categories called system planning, system characteristics, system design, system testing, system documentation, system correctness, system clarity, programming style, and system management. Factor analysis and central tendency measures were used to analyze the data. Based on 147 respondents, 98% of the items were found to affect system complexity. Large item variance was attributed to the lack of formal education or experience of respondents in some areas of  software development. The factors extracted in this study were found to be useful in regrouping items to determine the complexity of system attributes, system components, or of various phases of system development. The need for a weighting scheme to add component complexity to determine the overall system complexity was identified. It is suggested that replication of this study on a larger scale would prove useful and that the complexity of various system components be weighted to determine the overall complexity of the system. A list of references, a copy of the questionnaire, and factor matrices are also provided. (JB)",

        "description":"This document consists of an interim report and a final report which describe the second and third phases of a project designed to determine the utility and utilization of sophisticated hardware and software capabilities known as advanced instructional features (AIFs). Used with an aircrew training device (ATD), AIFs permit a simulator instructor to control, monitor, and fabricate simulator training missions. Phase II of the project asked 273 instructor pilots, flight engineers, and radar/navigators from Air Training Command (ATC), Military Airlift Command (MAC), and Strategic Air Command (SAC) to rate each of 16 AIFs on five seven-point rating scales. Phase III extended the survey to 155 electronic warfare and aerial gunnery instructors from ATC, SAC, and TAC training  facilities. Based on utility and utilization ratings, the T-5 and T-4 trainers were the most favorably rated by the respondents. They were followed, in order, by the F-4G simulator, B-52 weapon system trainer, and A-10 simulator. The level of AIF use was affected somewhat by hardware and software unreliability, implementation time, functional limitations, and design deficiencies; however, the perceived value of a feature was the most important determiner of its use. It is recommended that: (1) a formal intensive training program be established to teach simulator instructors how to use AIFs more effectively, and (2) future procurement of AIFs be preceded by a detailed front-end analysis that clearly relates AIF capability to training needs. Appendices contain the instructional features,  questionnaires, and five data tables. (JB)",

Topics addressed include: (1) how teachers fit computer instruction into their existing practices; (2) status of the subject in their school; (3) principal's attitude toward the educational value of computer awareness activities; (4) ways in which teachers actually use computers (computer awareness, programming, etc.); (5) methods of computer education, including the &quot;teach yourself&quot; method; (6) student reactions to computer instruction, including specific software packages; (7) teacher opinion about the demands of teaching a separate computer subject; and (8) teacher needs, e.g.,  more time to prepare, adequate hardware, support personnel. Problems of integrating computer experiences into the curriculum are addressed and five questions are presented which illustrate the difficulty of establishing computer literacy courses in the elementary school. Finally, the topics of teacher education and preparedness are discussed, and an agenda for teacher education is proposed. It is suggested that teacher education and curriculum are closely tied, and that how the computer is conceptualized as a subject in the elementary school will have an important bearing on the agenda that is set for teacher education.

Questionnaires were sent to 271 small colleges and universities (i.e., enrollment under 5,000 students); the net usable responses totaled 103, or 38% of the institutions surveyed. Responses indicated that the majority of colleges and universities (52%) had one officer responsible  for directing both academic and administrative computing; full time faculty were responsible for most computer instruction (83%); 60% reported that professional computer center staff did not serve as teaching faculty; 47% said computing was mentioned in their master plan and 48% said it was not; 73% indicated they had access to national or regional computer networks for library and other uses; 38% indicated their central computer budget had lagged; and the prevailing source for academic computing was on-campus minicomputers in 42% of the responding institutions, followed by microcomputers (27%), and the campus mainframe (26%). It is recommended that a similar study be conducted which would focus on larger institutions. A 13-page bibliography, a list of survey respondents, and a copy of  the questionnaire are provided.

The program was demonstrated at two libraries--one rural and one urban--and an evaluation was completed to determine its applicability in enhancing the on-going tutoring programs at these sites. Prior evaluations had shown that LaSCAI does improve functional reading ability, so the main focus of the library demonstrations was to determine the value that the tutors and students placed on the LaSCAI program. The qualitative evaluations consisted of pre- and post-interviews with students and tutors to reveal their attitudes toward literacy, tutoring, computers, and the LaSCAI program in general. Results of this evaluation  indicate that the program should be very successful when integrated properly into the adult literacy programs in current use in libraries. Specific conclusions are: (1) the LaSCAI program can be used to advantage in a library setting using microcomputers and volunteer tutors to raise the reading level and increase the literacy retention of adult students; (2) a certain amount of program modification, revision, and documentation is still required to extend this program to other libraries without extensive personnel support; and (3) a single source is needed to administer the application of this program for other libraries, to serve as a clearinghouse for subject matter prepared on disks, and to obtain resources and direct continuing research and development needed to improve and expand the  use of the program.

Prior to development of the manual, a thorough study of the existing arrangement in the Northern Illinois University Music Library's catalog was undertaken and staff members were interviewed to determine the extent of &quot;unwritten&quot; rules, if any existed. The rules in this document were designed to conform as closely as possible to existing filing practice in the Music Library; the new elements are principally more detailed explanations of the basic rules, and many new rules governing problematic situations such as uniform titles are introduced. The general emphasis of these rules is literal; the major exception is the treatment of subject headings, in which a traditional hierarchical  approach is applied. There are also special rules to allow interfiling of some AACR1 (Anglo American Cataloging rules, 1st edition) and AACR2 (Anglo American Cataloging Rules, 2nd edition) uniform titles. There are no rules governing the filing of printed versus recorded manifestations of music or works by authors versus works about authors. Many of the examples illustrating the rules were contrived especially for this manual, and do not necessarily represent valid AACR2 headings or Library of Congress (LC) subject headings. (THC)",

        "description":"Asserting that few teachers can provide examples of how they actually used educational research to shape an instructional decision, this position paper argues that as presently structured, the educational research institution does not appear to be effective in communicating products of its work to practitioners. The paper examines obvious barriers to communication between researchers and practitioners including the tendency of researchers to focus on abstractions (hypotheses, theoretical implications, statistical analyses, etc.) versus practitioners' needs for clear descriptions of instructional methods and curriculum materials, including how well they worked and with what types of student. The formation of a Professional Resources Information Network Computerized for Educators  (PRINCE) is proposed to provide teachers with practical information and materials directly tailored to meet specific instructional needs. PRINCE would parallel ERIC (the Educational Resources Information Center), the existing information network available to researchers. Following a general discussion of the problem, this document includes the following sections: (1) The Research/Practice Dilemma in ERIC; (2) The Current ERIC System; (3) Barriers to Practitioner Use; (4) Attempts to Make the System More Accessible to Practitioners; (5) Can an Information System Help Improve Schools? and (6) PRINCE: Professional Resources Information Network Computerized for Educators.

        "description":"Designed to assist Illinois public community colleges in satisfying state and federal reporting requirements, this handbook provides guidelines for conducting vocational education follow-up studies and reporting data. Following introductory information, an overview is presented of the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB) Management Information System and the ICCB's role in the follow-up survey process. Next, the handbook sets forth the purposes of the follow-up survey, which include determining the employment status, job location, and job-entry salaries of occupational program completers and leavers by specific program area; and obtaining an evaluation of both program completers' and non-completers' training at the community college by the employers of these students. The next  sections explain the ICCB's guidelines for classifying program majors and provide definitions for occupational program completers and leavers. The handbook then offers procedural guidance on conducting the student survey (including information on the use of standardized student survey items) and on conducting the survey of employers of students who responded to the student follow-up survey and were employed in fields related to their community college program. A time schedule of submission dates is followed by discussions of community college responsibilities and ICCB responsibilities for statewide coordination. Appendices present standardized items for the student occupational follow-up survey and the employer occupational follow-up survey; coding and data entry format instructions; and  operational definitions of program completers and leavers used in the survey.

        "description":"A review of 48 follow-up surveys of two-year college vocational education graduates conducted at the institutional and state levels reveals some common findings regarding the graduates' employment experiences. Most survey respondents (70% to 80%) reported that they were employed full-time; 66% to 96% indicated that their jobs were in some way related to their programs of study at college; and most indicated satisfaction with the technical knowledge or job skills they gained at college, while expressing less satisfaction with the colleges' helpfulness in providing knowledge about career opportunities or in preparing them for career advances. In spite of the commonality of these findings, survey limitations and methodological weaknesses make it difficult to assess the extent to  which graduates' career outcomes can be attributed to their vocational studies. Among these weaknesses are the fact that most studies were conducted on a &quot;one-shot&quot; basis; many studies were conducted too soon after graduation to provide a long-term view of students' career lives; many surveys obtained low response rates; and many suffered from a lack of control groups against which to assess graduates' employment experiences. To improve vocational follow-up studies several steps could be taken, including: (1) reduce the size of the survey instrument to improve response rates; (2) solicit information on graduates' educational goals and prior employment experiences; (3) gather longitudinal data to trace career develpment patterns; and (4) base studies on well-chosen samples as an  alternative to surveying all program graduates.

The study population consisted of all students who completed class registration for spring 1984, broken down into eight enrollment categories determined by full-/part-time status and time and location of courses taken. In-person and telephone interviews were conducted with a total sample of 442 students. Study findings included the following: (1) 91% of the full-time students expressed a willingness to replace at least one desired class on their study list with another class; (2) only 43% of the part-time evening students  attending at North Campus were willing to allow changes to their schedules; (3) the flexibility of full-time students was not significantly different from part-time students when the number of units in their schedule which they were willing to replace was considered; (4) faced with an inability to enroll in a desired class section, a student was more likely to take a different course at the desired time than find an open section of that course; and (5) the scheduling flexibility of students for whom work or child care responsibilities did not affect the time and place of their course differed little from those who had such constraints. The study report includes a literature review, recommendations for class schedule planning and student counseling, and the survey instrument.  (RO)",

Next, a model for approaching a research problem is presented which calls for the following steps: (1) identify and define the problem; (2) explain the significance of the problem; (3) set forth the purposes of the study; (4) examine related literature; (5) formulate hypotheses; (6) decide on the type of information  needed; (7) decide on the methods to be used in gathering the data and in analyzing it; (8) carry out the research plan; (9) compile the data and analyze the findings; (10) interpret the results and draw conclusions; (11) write a report and make recommendations; and (12) prepare a follow-up study. The next section discusses prerequisites for the study of business research methods such as basic statistics and college algebra. The last sections list required readings and recommended supplements, ideas for learning activities, and a bibliography. (RO)",

        "description":"In early 1983, a survey was conducted among the presidents and board chairpersons of the 14 public community colleges in Pennsylvania, asking respondents to rate the level of importance of 20 presidential roles based on their institution's needs during the 1982-83 academic year. During a joint annual meeting of Pennsylvania community college trustees and presidents, the identical survey was completed by attendees, based on projected institutional needs for 1986-87. Respondents rated the importance of the president's role as public relations specialist/image builder, financial manager, student liaison/mentor, marketer/salesperson, fund raiser, labor relations specialist, academic planner/innovator, administrator/executive, symbol/ceremonial official, consensus builder/mediator,  community leader, trustee rapport builder/advisor, government liaison/resource stimulator, visionary/long-range planner, scholar/teacher, physical plant/property overseer, alumni liaison/motivator, faculty advocate, educational advocate, and interinstitutional diplomat. Study findings included the following: (1) in both 1983 and 1986, there was very strong consensus between trustees and presidents about the relative importance of roles; (2) for three roles, there was consistent dissensus for both survey periods (i.e., financial manager and community leader, which presidents perceived as more important; and interinstitutional diplomat, which trustees viewed as more important); and (3) in 1986, there was less consensus than in 1983 over the relative importance of the following roles:  government liaison/resource stimulator, consensus builder/mediator, symbol/ceremonial official, and marketer/salesperson.

        "description":"Background information on the history and use of quality circles is provided in this paper, along with a discussion of the applicability of this management technique to the community college setting. First, introductory material is presented on the development of the approach in the early 1950s, its widespread use in the industrial and business community in Japan, and the effect of the technique on quality control. In the next section, a quality circle is defined as a group of workers from the same area who meet each month to discuss their problems, investigate causes, recommend solutions, and take corrective action when authority is in their purview. Next, a profile of the quality circle is presented, focusing on factors such as costs, training, group membership, the roles of  facilitators and steering committees, philosophical considerations underpinning the concept, commonly used techniques (e.g., brainstorming, problem solving, data gathering, and theme development), and pitfalls to be avoided. After pointing to the features of the quality circle approach that make it applicable to an educational setting, the paper sets forth fundamental principles to assist in implementing quality circles (e.g., creative problem solving is used; the purpose of the problem solving is improvement of the product, production, etc.; and the problem solving has positive consequences for the group and is future oriented). In the next section, ways of overcoming administrative resistance are discussed, and classified, maintenance, and custodial staffs are suggested as initial  target groups. Concluding comments stress the importance of training and actual decision-making power to the effective use of quality circles. (EJV)",

        "description":"Research indicates that leaders tend to be remarkably well-balanced people who embody four areas of competency: vision, the ability to communicate that vision, positive self-regard, and the ability to build trust with associates. The process of creating a vision of the future requires an understanding of the opportunities and threats present in the external environment, and of the strengths and weaknesses characterizing the internal environment. The technology of strategic planning and management, including both internal audit and external assessment, offers a model for developing this requisite understanding. Developing a vision of the future also requires a commitment to key concepts about the study of the future and a planning horizon. By tracing the development of social  systems (e.g., business and industry, health and human services, government and military, and education and training) through the post-industrial, early technical, and advanced technical phases of society, one can begin to specify possible, probable, and preferable futures. These visions and preferred scenarios must then be transformed into a multi-year plan of action. The ability to implement this plan requires that the planning, research, and development function of a college be located near the top of the organizational structure in order to assist the chief executive officer in creating a long-term vision for the institution.

The studies have focused on trends in the numbers of transfers and the ethnicity, majors, and age of transfer students. Findings from the study of fall 1985 transfers, contrasted with findings from previous years, indicated that: (1) fewer students transferred from the community colleges to the UC and CSU systems in fall 1985 than in fall 1984, with a 6.2% decrease in UC transfers and a 1.5% decrease in CSU transfers; (2) community college districts and campuses varied widely with respect to the number of students and the magnitude of the change in the number of students who  transferred between fall 1984 and fall 1985; (3) Hispanic transfer students increased in both numbers and percents in both the UC and CSU systems, while fewer Black students transferred to either segment, continuing a 3-year decline in their numbers and percentages; and (4) the percentage of Asian and Filipino transfer students in both segments continued to increase, though the number of Filipino transfer students remained small. Two factors were seen as possible influences on the decrease in transfer rates: the relatively new practice on some university campuses to admit as transfer students only those applicants who have met all requirements for junior standing; and the large decrease in first-time community college freshmen 2 years earlier.

Chapter 1 chronicles the history of LAMC and the LACCD's attempts to secure approval by the California Postsecondary Education Commission (CPEC) for a permanent campus for the college. Chapter 2 discusses the proposed facility in light of relevant criteria in the CPEC's \"Guidelines and Procedures for the Review of New Campuses and Off-Campus Centers,\" focusing on enrollment projections, alternatives to new campus construction, community support, enrollment capacity of existing campuses, impact on  adjacent campuses, and commuting time. Chapter 3 presents CPEC's findings and conclusions, including the following: (1) LAMC has met most of the criteria in the CPEC Guidelines; (2) certain aspects of the LAMC proposal are compelling; (3) the service area of the college is isolated for those who rely on public transportation; (4) a permanent campus of LAMC should not simply duplicate other institutions, but should demonstrate its uniqueness and effectiveness; and (5) the permanent building currently proposed for LAMC should be of sufficient size to house the existing programs. Chapter 3 also includes the recommendations that the proposed instructional/administration building be approved as a permanent home for LAMC with the understanding that the state not fund additional facilities for  LAMC until a thorough evaluation of the effectiveness of the new building is conducted.

The first set of observations was a simple description of the structure and content of children's peer interaction during 15 minutes of free play. Questions addressed focused on: (1) the contribution of age-related mechanisms to the growth of peer skill over the latter part of the second year; and (2) children's social accommodations to a partner differing in age. The second set of observations focused on toddlers in cooperative problem solving situations. Research issues addressed, in a somewhat preliminary way, include the need for a more detailed and elaborate data  base of research on infants and toddlers, the need to examine in much more detail the contexts in which particular peer competencies are manifested, the need to study the social understanding the child brings to peer interaction, and the need to build and test explanatory models for the early acquisition and growth of peer social skills.

        "description":"This paper focuses on possible relations between early peer skills and developing cognitive abilities. One promising area for discovering relations between cognitive development and peer interaction appears to be related to the young child's developing ability to differentiate self from other, that is, decentration. Decentration is typically indexed by the child's representation of the agency of self versus others in pretense play, and it shows regular developments over the second year. It seems conceptually appealing to think that this growing differentiation of self and other might go hand in hand with growing skills in peer interaction over the second year. A second possible relationship between early peer developments and decentration comes from toddlers' shift from proximal,  object-supported peer contacts, to distal, symbolically-mediated contacts. Third, some investigators have recently begun to study the toddler's and preschooler's understanding of rules that regulate social interaction, particularly rules regulating object exchange. Findings of preliminary observations focusing on the development of such rules among toddlers suggest that 18- and 24-month-old children begin to differentiate rules that focus on their own rights as a possessor from rules that also take into account another child's status or rights as a possessor; however, toddlers in the second half of their second year clearly do not operate altogether under shared rules.

        "description":"Development of toddlers' combinatorial skills was examined in the domains of object manipulation, symbolic play, motor imitation, language, and peer interaction. Additionally, task demands that might produce variations in age-related patterns within or between domains were examined. Data were collected in free play sessions and during structured imitation task performances from children ranging in age from 18 to 22 months and 24 to 30 months, who participated in three 15-minute sessions. Imitation items were simple combinations of two or more discrete behaviors and were distinguished within domains on the basis of familiarity, number of components, and whether a single scheme or multiple schemes were used. Findings indicated that older children produced more complex language,  more complex peer social overtures, and more combinations than did younger children. These data are discussed in terms of developmental correspondences in combinatorial skills, with emphasis on peer social skills. Regarding task demands, children at both ages produced more combinations in manipulative and symbolic play than in social and motor play. Across domains, differences were found between two- and three-component combinations. More single- than multi-scheme and more familiar than unfamiliar combinations were successfully imitated. These results are discussed in terms of toddlers' processing limitations and development, and research needs. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Observations suggest that 12-month-old children show little evidence of possession rules, while 18- and 24-month-olds are still coming to differentiate purely personal possession rules from shared possession rules that take into account the other child's status or rights as a possessor. Children 12 months old exhibited the highest frequency of attempts to take one another's toys and the lowest frequency of positive object contacts such as sharing, joint play, and cooperation. For 24-month-olds, the pattern was reversed; children 18 months old fell intermediate between the youngest and oldest children in the sample. Oldest children more frequently mediated their possession exchanges with language, particularly with self-possession related language. Children 12 months of age were  equally likely to resist attempts to take their toy, regardless of how long they themselves had been in possession of it or whether the taker had previously played with the toy. Children 18 and 24 months old were more likely to resist an attempt by another to take possession of a toy when the taker had not previously played with it, and least likely to resist if the taker had played with the toy extensively during the previous 30 minutes. The 24-month-olds also resisted more intensely if the taker had not had prior possession, and they additionally differentiated between whether the taker had played with the toy only briefly or for an extended period.

        "description":"Based on interviews, research workshops, and discussions with corporate executives throughout the United States, this study investigated increased diversity in family structure and its impact on corporate personnel policies, employee benefits and services, and the attitudes of management. Part I provides a backdrop of recent trends in the family composition of the work force; an overview of companies particularly receptive to family-suppportive programs; and some general observations about how changes in corporate policies are initiated, implemented and evaluated. Part II focuses on personnel policies, benefits and services: how they are being affected by new labor-force constituencies; how some are becoming more family supportive; and how employers are reacting to these trends.  The study findings suggest that family-supportive human resource programs are more likely to be adopted by companies that have relatively high proportions of young, female, technically skilled, and/or nonunion workers, and firms that reflect a family origin, a consumer orientation, or a strong sense of social responsibility. In most situations, corporate motives for responding to the family needs of workers tend to be more pragmatic than philosophical. A majority of the new programs and services currently being offered by corporations appear to have found only limited application within their host firms. (RH)",

        "description":"Two areas of social action in developing nations that have received attention in the last decade are the survival and healthy development of children, and the social and economic well-being of women. In both areas, there has been concern about the relation between women's work and child welfare, but from two different points of view. One view comes from the Women-in-Development (WID) community. Focussing primarily on women's productive roles, WID programs tend either to downplay women's child care responsibilities or to assume that adequate substitute child care is available. They are also likely to assume that children will benefit from women's increased earnings and from the greater control by women over the use of resources that women's work can bring. Another view is typical  of policy makers and researchers concerned with child health, nutrition, and development who assume that women should devote themselves primarily to their reproductive and child care roles and that they are available to do so. A corollary is that if women take on a productive role, particularly one outside the home, the welfare of children will suffer. Often, there is little recognition of the additional burdens child survival and development programs may place on women. Or, there is an assumption that seemingly minor burdens will result in longer-term benefits for women through savings of time and money associated with reduced child illness. These summaries of background papers and discussion examine available research evidence related to the above propositions, and report program and  policy implications. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This paper questions social interaction studies that use frequency or duration of behaviors in mother-infant relations as reliable measures of infant interactive competence. An infant's high score on frequency and duration tests may falsely indicate that the child is more communicative than other subjects. Such results may suggest that mother and child actually influence each other's behavior and consequently produce deceptively inflated scores. A methodological solution to this problem of mutual influence is proposed and the results of a study on the interactions of mothers and handicapped infants are used to illustrate the utility of this solution. In order to understand the relative influence of each actor in a social situation, it was deemed important to define and measure  the stable, intrinsic characteristics each actor brings to the interaction. These \"variables of independent influence\" were measured by methods that prevented the immediate influence of the nontarget actor. Measures of independent influence were used to define how the degree of infant handicap influenced the frequency with which mothers of handicapped infants said their infants communicated. Researchers found that severely handicapped infants exhibited fewer communicative behaviors than their mothers supposed, indicating that mothers were predisposed to mistake pre-linguistic infant behaviors for communication, thus compensating for the scarcity of infant communication.

The subjects comprised three age groups: 6-7 years old, 8-9 years old, and 10-11 years old. Each subject was interviewed on the basis of three stories. The stories depicted a hypothesized violation of trust in a moral context (lying), social-conventional context (dress code), and psychological context (helping a friend in time of psychological need). Each story presented a hypothetical situation in which the subject played a central role. Each story-trust interview included questions pertaining to the children's (1) evaluations and justifications of the rightness or wrongness of trust violations, (2) how trust can be reestablished after it is broken, (3) how trust helps  maintain children's friendships, and (4) whether trust violations result in the victim having negative feelings toward the trust violator. Within each context it was examined whether, and if so how, each trust violation would lessen feelings of friendship. Results showed that moral and psychological trust, and not social-conventional trust, were qualities that comprised criteria by which the children maintained both intimate and casual friendships. In addition, moral trust, once violated, was more difficult to re-establish than social-conventional and psychological trust. A list of references, nine tables of data, samples of stories used in the interviews, descriptions of responses, and examples of each justification category are appended. (HOD)",

Pointing out that the majority of pediatric patients with AIDS are preschool children, this paper describes the child and adolescent ill with AIDS, characterizes the child's understanding of his/her condition, anticipates developmental problems associated with AIDS, and considers the effects of stigmatization on those having AIDS or in association with those having the disease. Implications for clinicians are discussed.

In addition, parental social networks have been thought to influence child outcomes directly. Few studies, however, have examined all three areas concurrently. In the present study, which focused on the associations between parenting and children's competence in preschool, mothers and fathers in 30 families reported on stressful life events and social networks. Family interactions were assessed by home observations, observer ratings, and parent self-reports. Children's competence in preschool was assessed by teacher ratings. Findings indicated that losses (by death) were associated across methods with decreased warmth and increased control among parents. Correlations suggested that the  developing social abilities of children 3 to 5.8 years of age may influence the composition of their mothers' social networks. Only a few aspects of parenting were consistently related to social network variables. Kin social support appeared to buffer the effects of stress; however, contrary findings emerged for support from friends, especially fathers' friends. Partial correlational analyses were consistent with the view that the effects of parental stress on child behavior are mediated by parent-child interactions, while social networks influence children directly, and strongly.

The chemical and pharmaceutical industries that hold important positions in agricultural inputs are consolidating their positions by purchasing other input producers such as seed, bioinsecticide, and inoculant companies. Recently the role of the land grant universities and the entire agricultural research system has become an issue of intense debate; multinational corporations have been urging the universities to shun &quot;applied&quot; research and conduct &quot;basic&quot; research, i.e., the type of research that is suitable for commercialization by multinationals. Meanwhile private universities  such as Harvard, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford are becoming interested in agricultural research, and there is an effort under way to open the United States Department of Agriculture research funding to these new entrants in the field. In all of this debate the farmer has been largely ignored, and the ultimate effects of biotechnology on the farmer have yet to be considered. Although the transformation of agricultural research is already underway, it is in no sense determined, and the debate over the purposes and social consequences of biotechnology will continue.

The unit focuses on 11 occupations in manufacturing, marketing, and distribution: union representative, welder, machinist, assembly worker, textile designer, chemist, buyer, sales representative, accountant, commercial artist, and trucker. An introduction to each job contains vocabulary words pertaining to the job and instructions for conducting the lessons. Student workbook pages contain language arts and mathematics activities that utilize crossword and word find puzzles, matching, true-false, fill-in-the-blank, and scrambled word exercises. The activities are intended to provide occupational information while reinforcing the skills of matching, fact  finding, determining the main idea, outlining, spelling, and logical validity. A pre- and post-test with student test leaflet, teacher guide, and answer sheet utilizes matching and multiple choice questions to measure the extent to which students understand the tools needed and the work performed in the 11 jobs.

Chapter 1 identifies the Hispanic origins of Kansas' 63,339 Hispanics who represent 2.7% of the state's population and presents vignettes describing conditions of minorities/Hispanics on the Great Plains in the three decades following World War I. Chapter 2 traces the Hispanic thrust into Kansas in the 1920s, discussing Anglo mental syndromes especially about Mexican workers, urban clustering, and the railroad influence. Chapter 3 addresses the public relationships, policy questions and illegal alien issues of today's Wichita Hispanic  community of 9,902 persons emphasizing relationships with law enforcement agencies, medical services, and educational needs. Chapter 4 presents social and attitudinal profiles of 31 prominent Wichita Hispanics compiled from their responses to a questionnaire. Chapter 5 offers some preliminary conclusions on the continuing Hispanic immigration into Wichita and the impact of clandestine Mexican migrants and includes commentaries on the study from local observers. An appendix contains notes on Central American refugees and the sanctuary movement. (NEC)",

Findings showed fewer than 50% of migrant children under age 16 received recommended annual physical examinations. Only 33% received an annual dental checkup as compared to 50% of children in the total United States population. A comparison between levels of chronic health conditions for migrant children and those reported for children in a national survey suggested that incidence of chronic conditions was several times greater among migrant children. Younger children were more likely to receive checkups, while older children were more likely to receive immunizations. After  controlling for the child's age, no significant association was found between preventive care and any characteristics of the mother. Mothers who spoke English were more likely to report that a child had a chronic condition. The level of mortality was proportionately lower among women who spoke English and higher among those who gave birth to a low birth weight child. The most important characteristic related to loss of children was whether or not a mother smoked. (NEC)",

As a means of illustrating the kinds of impacts that may be expected and the application of the model, recent research into the psychological, social, demographic, economic, and fiscal impacts of rapid economic decline is reviewed. The research indicates that impact varies with conditions in the community, the extent of change in needs or demands outside the community, and characteristics of the source of impact. It is recommended that communities monitor for signs of change and  organize for local control when decline is anticipated. The model suggests four options for local leaders to consider when economic decline is anticipated/occurring to minimize negative and maximize positive impacts: (1) political action to influence state and federal legislation, policies, and programs; (2) negotiation for impact assistance from the source of impact; (3) changes in the setting, such as worker ownership; and (4) passive nonaction.

Mental health resources are typically inadequate in rural America, and the comprehensive roles of well trained school psychologists are frequently misunderstood in rural schools. This paper discusses the rural education context and contrasts the settings of rural and nonrural practitioners. Rural factors that inhibit comprehensive service delivery are discussed as are the difficulties involved in recruiting and retaining qualified school psychologists. An overview of the historical and current use of school psychologists in rural areas is presented. Emerging rural service delivery models and variables  to be used in designing appropriate models are discussed, including establishing special education cooperatives and other collaborative structures, interfacing with university training programs, interagency collaboration, training paraprofessionals and existing school personnel to fill multiple roles, and fully using parent and community resources in the schools. It is recommended that preservice training attend to the unique skills and knowledge required of the rural practitioner and that positive inherent rural attributes be fully utilized. It is also recommended that the growing interest of the profession of psychology in rural service delivery include an interdisciplinary focus. A 26-item bibliography is appended. (Author/NEC)",

Relevant findings of research conducted by the National Rural Project, American Council on Rural Special Education (ACRES), ACRES Futures Task Force, and National Rural Education Research Consortium are included. Higher poverty ratios, educational disadvantagement, inadequate prenatal care, and lack of early intervention programs for disabilities are found to contribute to the socio-familial factors that make mental retardation more prevalent in rural than in urban areas. Value differences, lack of prevention-oriented programs and failure to  understand, value, or use available programs are found to inhibit prevention. Principles and suggestions for implementing retardation prevention programs in rural areas are given, including recognizing diverse rural subcultures and designing programs to consider their values and needs, recognizing and using local communication and power structures, using inherent positive community attributes, transforming negative attributes into facilitating factors, and initiating realistic interagency collaboration in rural service agencies. These principles are related to a tabular presentation of causes of mental retardation, preventive approaches, and specific rural factors which inhibit prevention. (LFL)",

Hispanics made up 13% of the work force, and Blacks and other minority groups made up 14%. There were significant regional differences in racial/ethnic composition. Hispanic workers were concentrated in the Southern Plains, Mountain, and Pacific farm production regions. Blacks and others were predominantly located in the Southeast, Delta, and Appalachian regions. Only 16% of hired farm laborers lived on farms. Their median level of education was 10.7 years. Their average number of days of farmwork was 100. Regular and year-round farmworkers (those working 150 days or more) made up only one-fourth of the work force but  accounted for over two-thirds of the worker-days. Overall, hired farmworkers earned an average of $4,815 from both farm- and nonfarmwork, of which $3,138 came from farmwork. Only 9% of hired farmworkers were migrants. The number of hired farmworkers did not change much during the last decade. However, the composition of the work force did change: workers in 1981-83 were older and did more days of hired farmwork than workers in 1971-73. (JHZ)",

        "description":"Two training procedures were constructed to teach children with learning deficiencies to solve simple addition and subtraction word problems. Each training procedure was evaluated in a separate multiple baseline design across subjects. The experiments were designed to prepare for the development of computer assisted training programs. Two female mildly retarded children (age 14) participated in the first experiment. They were taught to work systematically through the problem task and to pay attention to several important components of the problem text. The training procedures turned out to be effective. Research was continued with a computer assisted training experiment. The computerized training procedure is described in relation to the findings of the first experiment. The  second experiment was run with three male disabled children (age 10-11). They were taught to draw a diagram as an external representation of the problem. The diagrams reflected the properties of &quot;change,&quot;&quot;combine&quot; and &quot;compare&quot; problem types. This training method appeared to be effective as well. The differences in the nature of the efficiency of these two training methods was discussed. The results were analyzed by graphing correct problems, mean response time, number of errors, and mean percentage of correct steps over training sessions. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Fifty-two fourth and fifth grade students, randomly assigned to three groups (1) competitive, (2) individualistic, and (3) no feedback control, received differential feedback regarding their performance in two 40-minute computer assisted mathematics sessions per week over six weeks. Attributions regarding academic outcomes in computer assisted mathematics were assessed prior to and following treatment, as was academic locus of control. Measures of rate of progress and achievement were also taken. Children receiving competitive feedback showed an increase in attributions to ability for success, as predicted. A predicted increase in attributions to effort for children receiving individualistic feedback was not found. Contrary to previous findings, gender differences in academic  locus of control were not found, although all subjects showed an increase in internal responsibility for academic outcomes over the treatment period. Predicted increases in rate of progress and mathematics achievement by the individualistic feedback group in comparison with the competitive feedback and control groups were not found. Feedback conditions were found to differentially affect males and females with males exhibiting a significantly higher rate of progress than females within the competitive feedback group. Attributions were found to account for a moderate, significant portion of the variance in rate of progress and mathematics achievement. (Author/JM)",

The role of computer simulations in helping students acquire the strategic knowledge necessary to solve realistic transmission genetics problems was emphasized. The Genetics Construction Kit (GCK) was the simulation program used to generate transmission genetics problems in this study. The two sources of strategic knowledge required to solve these problems came from the rational analysis of each class of problems and from the analysis of the performance of experts solving such problems. The rational analysis and the analysis of the performance of experts were used to modify and supplement each other in order to  construct a description of desired performance for solving realistic, computer-generated transmission genetics problems. Information presented on these two sources included: (1) a general description, (2) data redescription, (3) solution synthesis, and (4) solution assessment. It appears feasible that a computer tutoring system together with an expert system can be designed and implemented to enable students to solve realistic computer generated transmission genetics problems.

The purpose of this study was to relate children's cognitive processing capabilities and their grade level to performance on addition and subtraction test items. Two sets of data were used to assess memory capacity and cognitive processing capacities. Six groups of children were then identified with different specific cognitive characteristics. A sample of children in five classes at Grades 1, 2, and 3 was selected and a set of addition and subtraction problems was administered on three occasions. Items were scored correct or  incorrect, and data were summarized for each administration by grade and cognitive level. Differences were found for specific objectives, for instruction over time, and for grade level. Importantly, children who differed in cognitive processing capacity consistently performed differently regardless of other salient factors. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This study considered the meaning that was given to knowing/doing mathematics in classrooms comprising the observational study conducted by the Wisconsin Center for Education Research during 1978-81. The study interprets the work of teachers and students, and considers what constitutes appropriate mathematical knowledge for children to learn. A field study was employed in two schools where revised topics of Developing Mathematical Processes (DMP) had been taught. Data were gathered from ten teachers using classroom observations and interviews. This study had access to interviews conducted after each topic had been taught. Results showed children learn not only subject matter, but also appropriate forms in which to cast knowledge. Teachers predominantly saw their role as managing  efficient transfer of a body of subject matter to students, and children had limited opportunities to engage in creating and testing mathematical knowledge as a result. Teacher modification of DMP activities to meet student needs was predominantly adjustment of instructional procedures rather than content modification. Content was modified when teachers displayed a sense of ownership and control over what they were teaching. In those cases, children were helped to bring personal meaning to what had been learned. The management approach to instruction is related to a center-out model of curriculum, viewing teachers and students as consumers of knowledge. (Author/JM)",

Experimental studies with these and other teachers indicate that, if teachers become more sensitive to their students' thinking and need for conceptual change and modify their verbal instruction accordingly, student understanding and learning of science can be improved. Textbooks and other curriculum materials can either help or hinder this process. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper analyzes data from High School and Beyond, a two-stage nationally representative study of goals, attitudes, experiences, and achievement patterns of high school sophomores and seniors in 1980. The present study provides an indication of levels and patterns of sex-differentiated attrition from high school mathematics courses by determining specific points at which students in general, girls in particular, leave college preparatory mathematics sequences. It identifies predictors of persistence in terms of course numbers and transition from course to course. The relationship between course-taking in mathematics and the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT-M) quantitative scores is examined with the aim of providing evidence on the extent to which gender differences in  mathematics course enrollment &quot;explain&quot; gender-specific scores. The final sample (N=8321) had at least some experience in academic courses in mathematics, representing those for whom skill in mathematics is likely to be required for future success. The findings show greater attrition of females as compared to males in less advanced courses with the reverse at advanced levels. The grade in the students' last mathematics course had a negative relationship to persistence and was greater for females than males. Results showed a strong relationship between socioeconomic status and persistence in mathematics. Evidence reported indicated that mathematics course-taking had a strong positive influence on SAT-M scores. (JM)",

The survey results indicated that conservation and environmental education are a relatively low priority in current practice, but that respondents believe that a greater emphasis should be placed on such  education in their schools and districts. The educators felt that a summer teacher institute would be valuable and expressed interest in learning more about a variety of environmental topics and teaching methods.

The purpose is to describe and propose some images or metaphors for depicting the processes associated with the enactment of tasks in these classrooms. Discussed is the development of an analytical language to deal with curriculum as a central dynamic of classrooms, rather than a context variable, specifying that students learn by processing information in subject matter domains. The cognitive levels of tasks were evaluated and related to educational outcomes. Data consists of narrative accounts of classroom events and processes, copies of materials used in class, and completed student work  that had been graded by the teacher, as well as interviews with both students and teachers. Observer training and data collection techniques are described, and analysis procedures are reported. Class descriptions, commonalities across teachers, commonalities within subject areas, and task analysis are discussed. The paper concludes with an examination of anticipatory management of classrooms, reviewing how teacher, student, curriculum, and management variables intersect in constructing educative events in classrooms.

Interviews were conducted with 90 grade 2 and grade 3 students to determine whether they understood the logic of borrowing and whether the construction of the logic was related to procedural expertise or corresponding conceptual knowledge. Of 34 students identified as proficient, only 12 recognized that the value of the first number in the subtraction problem is conserved during the borrowing procedure. Responses to questions about the values exchanged during regrouping suggest that conceptual knowledge does not distinguish those who understand the logic of borrowing from those who do not. Students who demonstrated procedural proficiency with the subtraction algorithm also demonstrated  higher levels of conceptual and logical knowledge about borrowing than those who were less proficient.

Perinatal deaths refer to the sum of spontaneous fetal deaths occurring after 20 weeks gestation plus infant deaths occurring during the first 27 days following birth. Discussed in the first part of the report are the emergence of the concept of a perinatal period, the three definitions of the perinatal period, and the use of rate or ratio as measures of perinatal mortality. Discussed next are the distribution of fetal and infant deaths and trends in fetal and infant mortality. Finally, the report presents data on perinatal mortality  ratios for the white population and for races other than white for each of the years 1950-1981. The differential in birth weight distribution, sex differentials, and geographic variations are also discussed. Also included are references, technical notes, four figures, and eight tables. (TRS)",

The studies were commissioned during 1984 and were conducted by interdisciplinary teams: two in Australia, two in India, one in Japan, one in Malaysia, and one in the Republic of Korea. Chapter 1 of this study stresses that the role of interface studies is to illustrate the interdependencies between education and other sectors (political, economic, social, and technological) in the formation of the future. Chapter 2 examines three case studies. The first, &quot;Secondary Education: A National, Regional, and School Issue,&quot; reveals that secondary education in Australia  provides a valuable but unfinished case study on the interaction between education and polity. The second, &quot;Language, Education and Polity: A National Language Policy for Australia,&quot; emphasizes the problem created by the a diversity of language varieties that exist in Australia. The third, &quot;Resource Planning, Addressing National Priorities through the Planned Allocation of Resources,&quot; identifies the interfaces, with budget allocations seen as the result of several forces: political, socio-cultural, economic, demographic, legal-governmental, and technological. A brief historical review of funding arrangements for education in Australia is provided and the role of the Commonwealth is investigated. The document concludes with attention to four scenarios for the future of resource planning in  education. Six pages of references are appended. (RSL)",

The size of the sample and the breadth of the questionnaire allow an  assessment of predictors of both cognitive and attitudinal outcomes. The results of the survey suggest that some programs falling under the general categories of global education do make a positive contribution to the global awareness and concern of secondary school students. The effective programs appear to be those which have been established for several years, those which combine curriculum with extracurricular activities, and those which have stressed teacher training. Although this survey provides strong evidence that global education does work, its interpretation also suggests that simply creating a course and calling it international relations or world studies will not ensure the desired outcome.

        "description":"A collective assessment of the comparative study of foreign policy as a field of scholarly inquiry is presented. An effort is made to interpret the field's boundaries, to review its accomplishments, and to propose some future directions. The first section, in which the field's scope and boundaries are discussed, asserts that the boundaries are relatively fixed, with the field's central focus being on the policies and actions of national governments that are oriented toward the external world. In the next section, nine ways in which the field has grown and developed are summarized. Problems of comparative foreign policy are then discussed with particular emphasis on five methodological issues and three substantive issues. New initiatives in the field are proposed, drawing upon  some of the developments in the international political economy. Because of the relatively impoverished state of theory development, the last section of the paper suggests modest strategies that may encourage scholars to think theoretically. A six-page list of references is included. (Authors/TRS)",

Two related questions are then addressed: (1) Are the characteristics of women compatible with the dominant mode of operating in organizations or institutions? and (2) How much of the nature of organizations is bound up with masculinity? The answer leads to another question: How can women survive and succeed in masculine organizations and still value and nurture their own differences? Since the operational mode in organizations is clearly masculine, the popular literature advises women to think, talk, and dress like men in order to succeed. Several suggestions are offered to women who wish to nurture their  own way of seeing and reasoning and their own sense of connectedness. It is suggested that if women speak out and share their perceptions they can help humanize the organizations that many men as well as women find alienating. A 16-item bibliography is included.

        "description":"This document chronicles major developments in post World War II Japanese educational policy. The focus is mainly on the way in which world events, social structure, religion, cultural values, and official policy initiatives influenced Japanese educational practices. Developments covered in the first period, from 1868 to 1945, began with the reforms of the Meiji period. The influence of World War II and the occupation of Japan are reviewed. Educational policies which followed World War II and the accompanying occupation of Japan, including goals of democratization, demilitarization, and decentralization of government power are described. The post-occupation period, from 1950 to 1960, saw the re-creation of a centralized education ministry, a closer integration of school boards  into the local governmental structure, the expansion of educational opportunities, and the reinstitutionalization of moral education. These reforms are seen as further supporting the democratization of Japanese society. The expansion of education during the 1960's and 1970's stresses how the interests of industry and the wide consensus on the need for future economic development influenced educational policy. A major focus is the spread and improvement of higher education. Reforms which took place between 1978 and the present, the shrinking of the school age population, the increase in school drop-outs, the refusal of education syndrome, and the emergence of an international youth culture are described. An extensive bibliography is included. (JDH)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to clarify the characteristics and current issues of the Japanese educational system by examining the relationship between income distribution and education. This relationship is not simply a one-way effect of education on income distribution, but an interaction between the two. Thus, we must consider the reverse effect of income level and equality on educational demand. This paper examines survey data from studies on education's effect on income distribution. The major focus is placed on an economic analysis of educational systems in Japan rather than an analysis of factors determining income distribution. The structure is as follows: the first section gives a brief description of recent trends in the distribution of income by time series data. The  second section discusses possible factors determining these trends and points out the characteristics of income distribution within the framework of human capital theory. The third section is a discussion of measuring the internal rate of return to education and an economic analysis of educational demand. An attempt was made to clarify the economic structure underlying Japan's high level of education. These results were used to point out the need for a more serious consideration of the influence of the income factor on the educational system in addition to examining education's effect on income. The fourth section considers the income redistribution effects of educational finance systems and proposes criteria for sharing the cost of education and the subsidizing of private universities.  The final section consists of a summary and conclusions. The role of educational planning in addressing the current debate on educational reform in Japan is discussed. Numerous tables are provided.

This paper treats especially this latter environment, that of the family, and analyzes through a review of the literature and the author's own field experiences, the role of the mother in child rearing. Further, school and juku are treated briefly as themselves psychocultural artifacts, and the similarities and differences between home and school are noted. Finally, some concerns about children's welfare and the future of Japanese school achievement, in the context of change and reform, are  stated, as well as a caveat concerning existing diversity in family and learning environments.

        "description":"The successful educational and industrial systems in Japan are related to the social and historical condition of the country. A society that receives ideas and technology of education from other societies must go through the process of adoption, assimilation, and self-transformation. Students of society do not fully recognize the strengths and weaknesses of their own system of education. Therefore, it is a very fruitful endeavor to exchange ideas and views on educational processes and their outcomes, with full recognition of one's total social system before one embarks on the reformation of the present system.

Information from both English and Japanese sources about cognitive, non-cognitive, and behavioral characteristics of students and factors influencing them was sought regarding students from both elementary and secondary levels and for special populations of dropout, gifted, learning disabled, and private education students. Beyond the literature analysis, a judgement was made concerning the quality and credibility of each citation source. Two major bibliographic sources were searched: ERIC and the Social Science Citation Index; popular accounts, best sellers, the press, major books, and comparative studies were also  examined. Japan emerges from these studies as a multi-dimensional society with elements that are both unique and comparable to other modernized and industrialized nations. What does not emerge from these studies, however, is any clear indication or data to explain the inordinately high levels of achievement of Japanese students.

Drawing on relevant literature and preliminary results of an 18-month ethnographic study of Japanese preschools and first grade classrooms, this paper traces the roots of the inculcation of classroom discipline, the management strategies of behavior control, and the early socialization of attitudes toward learning activities. The second section discusses the nature of preschools and day care centers as an environment for the acquisition of basic classroom routines and attitudes. The third section examines the methods used by  Japanese first grade teachers during the first weeks of school to train efficient and orderly classroom routines and to establish expectations and sanctions for appropriate classroom behavior. The paper concludes by considering the continuity of these routines and disciplinary approaches over the remainder of the child's public school career and offers some observations on the relevance of the Japanese approach to the United States system.

Approaches to the measurement of creativity are presented and criticized, and different meanings of creativity (i.e., originality, deviation from the group, self-expression, and achievement) are discussed. Second, evidence is reviewed from Western psychological and educational research on the factors which promote or inhibit the development of creativity. Third, Japanese education is discussed in light of the Western research findings on the factors which promote or inhibit creativity. Finally, creativity is discussed as a larger societal issue in Japan, with a view to the societal indicators which might  be used to measure creativity. A number of factors are identified which may encourage the development of creativity in Japanese children, including: relatively non-controlling early child rearing, high development of basic skills which provide the basis for creative accomplishments, an emphasis on persistence and repeated practice for mastery, and educational practices which foster intrinsic motivation. Other factors are identified which may inhibit the development of creativity in Japanese children, including the rote memorization required for examination preparation, the possible impact of the examinations in undermining intrinsic motivation, and the possible low tolerance for deviation from conventional thought.

The results of a detailed analysis of Japanese and U.S. mathematics textbooks for grades 1 through 12 are reported. Two international studies (1964 and 1981) and the Dallas Times Herald study are used as the basis for comparison. The first part of the research study contains a discussion of elementary school children in Japan and the United States, similarities and differences in Japanese and U.S. elementary school textbooks, and the differences between the two sets of textbooks when concepts and skills are introduced. The study concludes that material contained in the Japanese  elementary school textbooks is somewhat more advanced than in the U.S. texts and concepts and skills are likely to appear earlier in Japanese textbooks. The second part of the study discusses an analysis of secondary school textbooks in the United States and Japan. The paper concludes that U.S. textbooks may form an obstacle to the learning of mathematics because they are long, wordy, and repetitive. Two extensive appendices (over 70% of the document) contain exhaustive summaries of the contents of the Japanese and U.S. elementary and secondary mathematics textbooks chosen for the study, arranged by concept and skill.

The Japanese school curriculum for the elementary and the lower secondary schools consists of three areas: (1) regular subjects; (2) moral education; and (3) special activities. The special activities component consists of student activities, such as student council and club activities; school events, such as ceremonial events and cultural performances; and class guidance which includes instruction on better personal relationships and assistance on motivation. Comprehensive examples of long-term homeroom activities, student council manuals, and yearly calendars of cultural event activities illustrate this mandated  aspect of Japanese education.

College enrollment has peaked, but attendance at post-secondary specialized schools and vocational training centers continues to rise. Youth unemployment hardly exists since 95 percent of all high school graduates are employed within a month after graduation. A wide variety of formal and informal patterns of on-the-job training exists and employees of larger firms appear to have more  opportunities for broadening skills than their United States counterparts.

Part 1 provides a brief history of Japan's rural legacy and describes its urbanization process. Part 2 reveals trends in the nature and extent of the economic activity of Japanese women using data on cohort age-groups at 5-year intervals beginning in 1950. Part 3 describes the constraints and opportunities for women in the evolving Japanese labor markets, and part 4 focuses on the relationship between education and labor force status of women. Such trends as the increasing proportion of younger Japanese women in clerical positions, the under representation of women in upper-level corporate positions, and the use of older women in manufacturing are documented. It is concluded that  further erosion of the &quot;breadwinner&quot; system in Japan is inevitable and that continuing transformation of Japan's economic structure will both reflect and affect the evolution of sex roles in the economy in future years.

Differentiations are seen between students choosing to enter the labor market directly from school and those choosing to attend a trade or vocational school. Variations in educational systems and questionnaire design generate a distinction in the United States between attending a junior college for vocational and academic courses, while in Japan a distinction is noted between those attending private and national universities. Sex is an important defining factor in both countries. In Japan, 89 percent of students planning to attend junior colleges are female and the percent  of Japanese females planning to attend four-year colleges is about half that of their United States counterparts. In both countries, higher family income and higher educational attainment of the father is associated with higher postsecondary aspiration levels for students. Pronounced differences in the role of private and public schools and the impact of these differences is noted. In the United States, educational level of postsecondary aspiration is positively related to attending private school; in Japan, it is negatively related. Simple path modeling of the impact of family income, father's education, high school grades and time spent doing homework reveal a great deal of comparative similarity in the social process of postsecondary aspiration in the two countries.

        "description":"This analysis originally prepared for the Japan Study Meeting, held November 1985, compares high school graduates in the United States and Japan who will not attend college, and includes directions of vocational training in both countries. Vocational training in the United States involves five areas: secondary schools, post-secondary schools, proprietary schools, formal apprenticeships, and employee training programs. Course areas divide into types of institutions, race, and sex. Females are represented most in office and health occupations. Males are over-represented in agriculture, technical trades, and industrial occupation training programs. Transition to the full-time labor force is discussed. Information on Japanese youth cites fewer public vocational opportunities and  similar sex ratios in curriculum choices, but finds the employees to be the main source of vocational education rather than post-secondary training institutions, and mentions greater use of employment services to secure post-school employment. The report finds there is not a close relationship between types of training received and the occupation in which an individual is engaged. The report concludes with 19 tables of data and four pages of references. (CC)",

        "description":"Examining the transition from high school to the work place of third-year high school students in Japan who expected to assume jobs upon graduation, this study conducted interviews with placement counselors at four different schools: an urban public school with a general focus, an urban public high school with an industrial focus, and urban private high school with a general program, and a rural public high school with a general focus. The counselors discussed their relationship to the Public Employment Security Office (PESO) and their roles in conducting employment education, in surveying students concerning counseling needs, in organizing counseling room materials, in collecting and maintaining recruitment cards, in counseling students concerning employment choices, in finding  available jobs for students, in practicing for interviews and entrance examinations, in maintaining contacts with prospective employers, and in finding second companies for students who failed on the first round of employment entrance examinations. Graduation and employment statistics for each of the schools were reviewed. Approximately 15 students from each of the 4 schools were interviewed about: finding jobs; counselor, teacher, and parent advice; company entrance examinations and their number; feelings about the new job; special skills required, salary, and fringe benefits; and outlook for their immediate and long-range future. Finally the study interviewed four former students about their jobs and inquired about the job's purpose, their progress on the job, special duties, and the  appropriateness of the past curriculum for the present job. Sample company recruitment cards and a list of reference materials conclude the document. (JEH)",

        "description":"The summative evaluation of student teachers allows decision makers (college and school district supervisors, State Boards of Education) to make judgments about the student teacher's qualifications for teacher certification. In addition, district personnel officers use this type of evaluation in making decisions about hiring prospective teachers. The intent of this project was to develop a summative evaluation instrument to be used in evaluating student teachers at the secondary level at Utah State University. The instrument was based on skills and indicators of effective instruction and attributes of teachers as represented in the effective instruction and effective schools literature. Responses of 59 administrators, university supervisors, and teachers who normally have student  teachers within their schools and classrooms identified the characteristics of an effective teacher. These characteristics were then used in developing the evaluation instrument. This paper discusses why the new instrument was needed, explores the instrument development literature, describes the construction of a data base of effective teaching research from which the new instrument was developed, and presents an assessment of the content validity and usability of the instrument. Appendixes include the completed summative evaluation forms, a summary of findings concerning effective teaching skills and indicators, a seven-page reference list on effective teaching skills and indicators, and the final Summative Student Teaching Evaluation Instrument.

The second session provides guidelines for setting standards for goal mastery, deciding how performance standards are to be applied to slow and fast learning students, and giving feedback to students on test performance that highlights what has and has not been mastered. In the advanced training  program, participants review and refine the elements mastered in earlier sessions. Outlines are provided for designing an assessment plan for a course of instruction, linking grading criteria to performance, and reaching departmental and school-wide agreement on grading criteria. Guidelines and work sheets are offered for participant mastery of: (1) using information about student goal attainment in course planning and presentation; and (2) managing goal-based instruction for students working at expected levels of accomplishment, students who need assistance, and high-achieving students.

Data from the review and study, which involved the observation of 14 student teaching experiences, indicate that student teaching is the most important aspect of preservice teacher education. However, not enough attention is paid to the role cooperating teachers have in influencing student teachers and setting up models for the student teachers to follow. There is a great need for articulate and consciously reflective cooperating teachers for the student teaching experience. Cooperating teachers need to be able to analyze and articulate the ways in which their students have been socialized into the classroom  routines and the effect of this socialization on the student teacher's performance. Schools must understand their roles not only as reflective and self-renewing places, but also as places for beginning teachers and student teachers to become socialized into such settings. In this way schools could become ideal places for student teaching and could, thereby, achieve the goal of helping to empower the teaching profession through well educated and socialized new teachers.

The study follows the direction set by Alutto and Belasco (1972), but extends their work by assessing the practicality of considering decisional participation as bidimensional, consisting of the frequency (rate) and extent (quality) of subordinate involvement.

It was found that interviewers who received less than one day of basic training generally displayed inadequate interviewing skills. A program of tape recording as part of the supervision of household interviewers was associated with more precise and less biased data if interviewers were more than minimally trained. Training and supervision were found not to be compensatory but, rather, to interact so that if either was inadequate the data were adversely affected. The results also point to the value of designing questions to minimize the need for probing, a significant source of  interviewer effects, and the value of procedures to communicate the importance of accuracy to respondents. Overall, attention to a variety of aspects of interviewer management--their training and supervision, the design of questions, the procedures they are to use, and the size of their assignments--are cost-effective ways to improve the quality of survey-based estimates.

Teachers and counselors from three selected junior high schools were assisted in the development of a mentoring academy for academically able girls. The 15 teachers and 30 girls were involved in a series of training activities throughout the yearlong project. Affective and cognitive changes among teacher/mentors and students were measured by three pre- and post-test survey instruments. Significant differences on several variables were found in knowledge and attitudes of the Mentoring Academy  population when compared to the control groups. Project: AIM had a positive impact on the knowledge of how mathematics and science courses provide access to many career opportunities. Both teachers and students gained an awareness of the factors which limit female representation in advanced mathematics, science, and technology courses. The results of this project support the premise that teachers can develop mentoring skills, adopt attitudes supportive of the need to encourage girls to excel in mathematics, science, and technology, and influence girls' career aspirations.

        "description":"The State Department of Public Instruction of North Carolina has implemented a training program designed to increase the skills of principals, observer/evaluators, and others in the application of the Teacher Performance Appraisal Instrument (TPAI). This report focuses on the effectiveness of that training. In all, a total of almost 900 individuals from 140 schools have been trained. The TPAI requires the evaluator to make judgments about the quality of a teacher's performance on five functions of the teaching act: (1) managing instructional time; (2) managing student behavior; (3) instructional presentation; (4) monitoring instruction; and (5) providing instructional feedback. This report explains how the rating system is used for these functions, and describes the activities of  the 27 training workshops. An analysis is presented of how each of the functions should be observed. A brief discussion is given on differing abilities of individuals in utilizing the TPAI, and on the relative success of the training sessions. Data gathered from the workshops on participant performances are presented. (JD)",

Information was collected through approximately 28 hours of interviews in each school with students, faculty, and administrators. Additionally, the kinds of changes being proposed in some of the major national and state commission reports were analyzed and compared with the changes underway in the study schools. The changes identified in the study were divided into three categories: schoolwide, subunits, and individual. The kinds of changes being made involved: (1) changes related to regularly scheduled curriculum or instruction; (2) changes in  school-sponsored activities that are not a part of regularly scheduled curriculum; (3) changes directed at school personnel; (4) administrative changes; (5) changes in school facilities; and (6) changes in school relations with external groups. Data from findings in each of these areas are presented in tables. Findings indicate that major changes are not being made in the structure or organization of the schools, or in the processes of schooling. A majority of changes were directed specifically to improving student achievement. (JD)",

Rather than presenting a study-by-study review of the literature, major themes are delineated that are present in the body of research about teaching, and a limited number of studies are reviewed. Two broad lines of inquiry on the process of learning to teach are evident in the research. One point of view considers mainly how teachers adapt to and acquire the teaching role. Earlier research in this vein tended to regard the new teacher as shaped by a system and reactive to it. More recent research, while not denying the potency of socialization forces, has emphasized the individual nature of teacher development and the ability of individuals to affect their own destiny. A second point of view is  that of teacher education as a process of skill acquisition. This type of research examines conditions that facilitate the learning of particular teaching behaviors or knowledge about teaching. The accumulated findings from this research provide a basis for designing training programs to achieve short-term behavior changes. (JD)",

Each teacher had been \"riffed\" (reduction in force) and recalled at least once in the previous 10 years, and most had been laid off and recalled more than once. An analysis of the interviews indicated that four aspects of the riffing experience creating a perception of crisis among the teachers were: (1) the unpredictability of the phenomenon; (2) the arbitrariness and instability; (3) the adaptational demands; and (4) the dehumanization of the situation. Several coping responses were evident in the teachers faced by the  crises: (1) active problem-solving; (2) fatalism (acceptance); (3) disinvestment; (4) cognitive and affective responses such as cynicism, distrust, anger, blame, anxiety, and reevaluation; and (5) dysfunctional and denial responses including absenteeism, depression, alcohol consumption, and sleeplessness.

Rather than offering a cookbook procedure for obtaining accurate equating results, the paper provides some practical suggestions for practitioners to follow when equating and describes some needed research. More research is needed toward improving the use of analytic techniques for smoothing or modeling marginal and bivariate frequency distributions. More testing programs  need to evaluate the extent to which their operational equating results are population invariant and to examine the similarity in equating results for major population subgroups taking the test forms at different administration dates. An investigation is needed of how lack of content representativeness of the linking items, or the differences in ability levels of the new and old form groups affect: (1) item parameter scaling and their interaction with the number of linking items, (2) the position of the linking items, and (3) the scaling procedure used.

Experiment two tested the effect of questionnaire format (multiple-choice versus short essay answers) and experiment three tested the effect of the numerical content on the responses of students from different age groups. Analysis of the data indicated that method of task presentation  had effect only on young students (grade seven) performance, while numerical content had effect on the majority of the students, in all grades. The only students which were indifferent to numerical content changes were the formal reasoning students. The implication of these findings to science education and cognitive level assessment indicates the importance of concretization in the instructional process of young students and the importance of the mathematical aspects behind a scientific problem.

One format requests assessment by marking detailed criteria without an overall judgement; the second format requests only an overall judgement without the use of detailed criteria; and the third format combines detailed criteria with an overall judgement. Results are interpreted from a cognitive processing theoretical framework. Subjects were five full-time and three part-time dental faculty members. The experimental task was to evaluate five crown preparations during six trials using each of three different rating forms, but raters were not informed they were reevaluating the same teeth. Raters were assigned code numbers to maintain  anonymity, and teeth were identified only by code numbers. Data analysis was based upon ratings of five teeth from trials one through six; the trials were six weeks apart. Inter-rater agreement among the eight raters was distressingly low, but was in the range of one previous report. The study suggests that the traditional practice of scoring performance ratings by summary across multiple criteria may reduce intra-rater reliability. Rating forms which are structured to parallel rater cognitive processes may result in more reproducible scores than traditional summation scoring methods. (LMO)",

The Higher Level Assessment Study Group discussed ways to further MEAP testing goals: expand testing into additional subject areas, for every pupil, on a cyclical basis; set higher standards encouraging student performance beyond the minimum; and assist local districts in developing their own assessment program. Four recommendations were made: (1) revise mathematics and reading testing of every pupil in grades 4, 7, and 10, including assessment of thinking skills and understanding concepts; (2) evaluate every student's writing skills annually; (3) use matrix sampling to annually administer some items to every pupil in health, science, social studies,  career development, and thinking skills; and (4) implement these goals in grades 5, 8, and 11. Additional ideas for helping students excel included: assessing high school students' preparedness for college; providing information on advanced placement programs and tests; improving the career development curriculum; and providing a state-developed assessment model for local school districts.

This paper presents the results of a study that attempted to develop and refine the methodology for constructing a state education service requirements index and to develop alternative indices based on these methodologies. Two methodologies used to develop the indices are presented. The first involved a regression analysis which measured the effects of different student characteristics on student achievement. The second methodology involved the computation of indices based on the excess cost of  educating children with special educational needs. Developed indices included: (1) base indices limited to three student characteristics: poverty, handicapping, and non-English-language background; and (2) comprehensive indices that included the three base characteristics and two additional characteristics: single-parent-family status, and mother's low educational attainment. Data were obtained from the 1980 Census and the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services in the Department of Education. Both methodologies produced indices of state education service requirements that were consistent in their state rankings. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"This paper deals with test fairness regarding a test consisting of two parts: (1) a \"common\" section, taken by all students; and (2) a \"variable\" section, in which some students may answer a different set of questions from other students. For example, a test taken by several thousand students each year contains a common multiple-choice portion and a common essay portion but also a variable essay portion, in which the test-taker may choose to answer any one of five questions. On this test the questions that the test-taker may choose from are intended to be of equal difficulty. When the scoring has been completed and the results tabulated, the data occasionally suggest that two or more essay questions may not have been of equal difficulty. If there had been no reason to believe, a  priori, that the questions on the variable portion were of equal difficulty, the scores would need to be adjusted in such a situation. Problems arise with the two adjustments: option A leads farthest away from the assumption of equal difficulty when the evidence against it is weakest; and option B is equivalent to assuming that the questions in the variable portion are, in fact, equally difficult. A compromise is proposed that is closer to option A when the common portion predicts the variable portion accurately and closer to B when it does not. (PN)",

The Type I error of three multivariate tests were examined. These were the doubly multivariate F test, the multivariate mixed model F test, and a recently proposed multivariate extension of Mauchly's sphericity test. The study examined the efficacy of using the latter test as preliminary test to evaluate the tenability of the multivariate sphericity assumption made by the multivariate mixed model F. The study also examined the impact of violations of the multivariate sphericity assumption upon the Type I error control of the multivariate mixed model F. The  results indicate an analysis strategy for the researcher confronted with the task of analyzing data gathered using this research design. Example data sets are presented to illustrate three likely patterns of behavioral data. The data analysis strategy is discussed as it relates to each data set. (Author)",

        "description":"The stability of teaching behavior was examined by observing student/teacher interaction over one academic year. One teacher was studied using a time-series analysis. He had 14 years experience and taught physical education in grades K-6 in a single school. Data were collected over one academic year using the Cheffers Adaptation of Flanders Interaction Analysis System (CAFIAS). A total of 52 classes were observed at equally spaced teme intervals throughout the year. Reliability of the data was confirmed using both intra- and interobserver reliability estimates. The 20 CAFIAS categories served as dependent variables and were subjected to univariate Box-Jenkins time-series analyses to determine stationarity. Autocorrelation functions indicated that five of the 20 CAFIAS categories  demonstrated significant stationarity: teacher directions (verbal); student initiated responses (verbal and nonverbal); silence; and confusion. These five variables accounted for 28.5% of the total student/teacher interaction. Finding less than 30% of the behavior stable over a year's time led to the conclusion that the teaching behavior observed in this study may lack the stability necessary for making the inferential generalizations common to research conducted under the natural science paradigm.

        "description":"School effectiveness indices (SEIs), based on regressing test performance onto earlier test performance and a socioeconomic status measure, were obtained for eight subject-grade combinations from 485 South Carolina elementary schools. The analysis involved school means based on longitudinally matched student data. Reading and mathematics achievement data were gathered from the South Carolina Basic Skills Assessment Program tests, the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, and the Cognitive Skills Assessment Battery. Grades one through four were included. The resulting SEIs were found to be somewhat unstable across subject areas and very unstable across grades. Grade-to-grade correlations of the SEIs measuring mathematics performance, although small, were largely significant whereas  those measuring reading performance were generally nonsignificant. This suggested that school effects may be more readily discernible in some subject areas than in others. Implications were drawn for effective schools research and for school incentive award systems based on student test performance. (Author/GDC)",

The ten procedures included: (1) O'Brien's (OB); (2) O'Brien's with adjusted degrees of freedom; (3) Brown-Forsythe (BF); (4) Welch-James test on O'Brien's r transform (WJOB); (5) unaligned Klotz; (6) median-aligned Klotz; (7) mean-aligned Klotz; (8) unaligned Siegel-Tukey; (9) median-aligned Siegel-Tukey; and (10) mean-aligned Siegel-Tukey. Type 1 error rates and power estimates were compared using simulated data. The present results in conjuction with previous research indicates that no one procedure for comparing variances is uniformly  the best strategy. With equal-sized samples a strategy that will yield appropriate Type 1 errors and reasonably powerful tests is to use OB unless there is evidence of heavy tails. In that case BF can be used to increase power while retaining appropriate Type 1 error rates. With unequal sample sizes and when the evidence suggests a direct relationship between the sample sizes and population variances the strategy might be modified to use WJCB in place of OB. (PN)",

        "description":"The reading achievement test scores of 239 low-income, southern, urban black students in grades three through eight were compared with their ability to comprehend the social studies books used in their classrooms. Achievement scores were obtained from the reading subtests of the Stanford Achievement Tests. A cloze passage was developed based on the social studies textbook for each grade level. The Dale-Chall Readability Formula was used to determine the readability at the designated grade level. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means, medians, modes, and standard deviations were computed. Pearson product-moment correlations were computed between the results of the Stanford and the cloze procedure scores. In spite of moderately high correlations such as those of other  studies between the Stanford and the cloze results, only a small percentage (15 percent) of the students were actually able to demonstrate the ability to read the grade level text with success. These data dramatize researchers' concerns that recent emphasis on raising test scores is resulting in curriculum distortion in favor of low level skills and away from comprehension of content. Worthy of further study are questions as to whether the teaching of narrow reading skills is enough to develop readers who can comprehend content text. (PN)",

        "description":"This paper summarizes and highlights some of the critical developments, issues, and trends which impact the work of survey research. The issue of preventing or minimizing nonresponse bias by successfully obtaining cooperation from people being surveyed continues to be of concern to survey research professionals. The most effective response rate stimulating strategies are those that are creatively designed to fit the people being surveyed and flexible enough to meet the changing characteristics of different populations. Regarding the effect of people who are unreachable by telephone, the important issue is making certain the sample is not different from the population in some way that will affect the results. An approach to obtaining truthful answers to questions of a sensitive  nature is the randomized response technique, which presents the respondent with more questions then just the sensitive question. New developments in technology have impacted survey research in data collection and data analysis, specifically with the use of Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing and the personal computer. Certain emerging trends might endanger the quality of research efforts: (1) over-emphasizing quick results: (2) allowing technology to substitute for human quality; (3) restricting options; and (4) misusing qualitative methods.

The studies were coded according to substantive and methodological characteristics, including type of outcome, type of treatment, and degree of internal validity. The dependent variables were measured on final status to achieve greater comparability. Studies reporting results using difference scores or residuals were not included, nor were studies that reported statistics from which effect sizes could not be recovered. All of the studies in the final set used a control group as the  reference for contrasting various suggestology treatments. The distribution of effect sizes over all categories and outcomes was leptokurtic and positively skewed. The overall performance of subjects under suggestology was three-quarters of a standard deviation higher than the average performance of subjects under control conditions. The evidence seems to support the conclusion that the Lozanov method with explicit suggestion is more effective than untreated controls relative to foreign language acquisition, foreign language retention, affective attributes, and cognitive achievement and creativity.

Two types of correlation matrices were analyzed; one containing Pearson product-moment correlations and one containing tetrachoric, polyserial, and product-moment correlations as appropriate. Using continuous variables generated according to the equations defining the population model, three cases were considered by dichotomizing some of the variables with varying degrees of skewness. When Pearson product-moment correlations were used to estimate associations involving dichotomous variables, the structural parameter estimates were biased when skewness was present in  the dichotomous variables. Moreover, the degree of bias was consistent for both the maximum likelihood and unweighted least squares estimates. The analysis of mixed matrices produced average estimates that more closely approximated the model parameters except in the case where the dichotomous variables were skewed in opposite directions.

The Student Self-Efficacy Instrument was designed from a widely used questionnaire administered to children, the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire, with the goal of measuring students' level of self-efficacy. Two other instruments were also developed, the Teacher-Self-Efficacy Instrument and the Principal Self-Efficacy Instrument. Two problems with the original scale required adjustment: (1) stability of cause needed to be considered; and (2) the strength of the locus of control needed to be incorporated into the instrument. The forced choice format was maintained. Eight  subscales were generated as a result of 32 situations. Strength of self-efficacy was obtained by asking after each forced-choice item, &quot;How sure are you that this would be the reason?&quot; The student instrument required three major revisions in the process of determining the readability level, the content validity, and reliability of the different scales. Sixteen items were generated to measure teachers' level of self-efficacy and were tested for content validity and reliability. The original Principal Self-Efficacy Instrument paralleled the format of the teachers' instrument. The instruments were tested by 758 fourth grade students, 35 teachers, and 19 principals in 20 Michigan public elementary schools. A two-page list of references and the three instruments are appended. (LMO)",

This report summarizes the results of this study which were reported in detail in three previous technical reports. The tests were found to be content valid and reliable when administered to students in USVI public schools, even though the tests were designed for curricula used in the continental United States and were standardized using a sample of examinees attending continental U.S. schools. Item  analysis revealed differences between the local and standardization samples based on the cognitive complexity of items on all subtests of the batteries which were administered. There were also indications of effects of local dialects on responses to the language subtests at all levels. Finally, the data indicated that most students were unable to complete the reading comprehension subtests in the standard time allotted. (Author/LMO)",

Thus, the mean change for the total sample is influenced both by mean change in the score for each group--in this case, a test score--and by change in the proportional size of the group. A decline or gain in mean test scores has both a subgroup mean component and a population shift component. In addition, how much a particular subgroup may contribute to the total change can be shown to depend on what might be called its weighted  distance from the original total mean. How these simple concepts can be used to decompose score gains or declines is demonstrated by means of data from the seniors in the National Longitudinal Study (NLS) High School Class of 1972 and High School and Beyond (HSB) 1980. The presentation should be of both methodological and substantive interest. (Author/LMO)",

        "author":["Zeuli, John P."],
        "description":"This critical analysis examines the claim that learning within the student's zone of proximal development is enhanced by &quot;making connections to what the learner already knows.&quot; It is argued that Rogoff's and Gardner's use of Vygotsky's theory to explain learning in school-like tasks places primary emphasis on how the adult should connect the task to children's everyday, familiar concepts. Their analysis, however, is inconsistent with Vygotsky's characterization of school learning. Vygotsky emphasized that school learning in the zone of proximal development is advanced by helping the student understand decontextualized concepts within a discipline. Connections to students' everyday concepts come later. In the critique, examples are drawn from Vygotsky's work and more recent  research on instruction to support this position. The analysis also draws on current research in science education to support the view that students' everyday concepts may interfere with learning unfamiliar, scientific concepts. Since Vygotsky's zone of proximal development continues to serve as an influential framework for understanding learning in everyday school contexts, it is important that researchers applying it to school settings incorporate his analysis of the limitations of everyday concepts. A three-page list of references concludes the document. (LMO)",

        "description":"This paper reports the findings of an investigation of the effects of school organization and ability grouping on students' academic achievements in Great Britain. Data for the study came from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) conducted by the National Children's Bureau (NCB) of London. The NCDS surveyed virtually every child born in England, Scotland, and Wales during the week of March 3-9, 1958, and the present study included data from follow-up studies conducted when the cohort was 7, 11, and 16 years old. Types of schools attended by the cohort were: (1) comprehensive; (2) grammar; (3) secondary modern schools in the state sector, and (4) private schools. Some, but not all, of the schools practiced ability grouping. Measures included as control variables were social  background, parent influences, and school influences. Results of the study showed that separation of students into ability groups had an effect on achievement test performance in both reading and mathematics. The four types of schools received students whose average earlier test performance varied systematically in ways that were consistent with the social definitions of the schools. The several types of ability groups included students whose earlier performance suggested they had the designated levels of ability. (LMO)",

The survey was designed to obtain measures of school goals and processes that effective schools literature indicates are important in achieving objectives of effective education. A consortium of five centers funded by the National Institute of Education was formed to prepare the questionnaires and collect the needed data. Five types of questionnaires were prepared for five types of respondents: high school principal, teacher, vocational coordinator, head of guidance, and community service coordinator. Data collection for the supplemental survey occured in the spring of 1984 and  was divided into two continually overlapping phases: (1) request for school rosters and subsequent sampling; and (2) questionnaire administration. An automated receipt control system was used to track Phase I and Phase II progress by school outcome within sample type and by respondent category within cooperating schools. Nine tables illustrate the data for the different stages of the survey. Appendix A includes instructions for the designated administrator form, and Appendix B includes samples of the five questionnaires. (JAZ)",

        "description":"Random samples of 1979 and 1980 entering freshmen were given the Non-Cognitive Questionnaire (NCQ), which was designed to assess noncognitive dimensions predicting minority student academic success. The validity of the NCQ in predicting graduation after five and six years was determined. The graduation rate was found to differ significantly for black and white students, with black students showing lower graduation rates. A trend was found with respect to black students taking slightly longer to graduate than whites. The relationship of each of the NCQ dimensions and the traditional predictors of SAT scores to graduation was examined separately for each year x race sample using step-wise discriminant analyses. SAT scores were not found to be related to graduation in any of the  samples. The NCQ dimensions were found to be fairly predictive for both races, but especially for the black samples. The dimensions of academic self-confidence and community service were found predictive of graduation for both black and white students. In addition, expectations of difficulty due to racism, support for academic plans, perseverance, and academic motivation were found to be predictive of eventual graduation for black students.

        "description":"Construct validity of a prototype baccalaureate generic problem solving skills test was explored through a structural analysis. The assessment method used three real-life problem situations crossed by six generic skills, namely Decision-Making, Communication, Analysis, Synthesis, Valuing and Execution. There were six written responses for each skill for each problem situation. The structural model included 18 skill/task observations with 6 latent skill variables, 3 latent trait variables and a higher order general factor (g). A multitrait-multimethod design was employed using a confirmatory factor analysis (LISREL VI). The data set moderately conformed to the model with most of the variation in performance attributed to the general factor. Factor loadings were neither consistent  across skills nor across tasks. Therefore, generic skills, as measured by this procedure, possess little independence from the general factor. The weaknesses in the assessment method and implications for test methodology and research in the assessment of generic problem solving skills are discussed. Descriptions of the three real life problem situations are appended. (Author/LMO)",

        "description":"Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Seniors Class of 1972 (NLS) and from High School and Beyond (HS&amp;B), this study documents changes in the academic achievement of high school seniors between 1972-1980. It also identifies the school and student factors related to these changes. Its purpose is to inform policymakers about the sources of current educational problems and to identify educational practices important for educational excellence. The findings indicate declines on all three achievement tests, with the largest declines in vocabulary and reading. Numerous and significant changes were identified in the characteristics of seniors, their homes and families, their schools, and their attitudes and behavior. A &quot;step down&quot; analysis of covariance was  used to estimate how these changes separately affected the average score decline. Path analysis was employed to explore differences in the educational processes experienced by 1980 subpopulations with larger score declines and their 1972 counterparts. Results indicate that the changes from 1972 to 1980 at both the school and student level that contributed most to test score decline were: (1) a greater likelihood of being in a general or vocational curriculum rather than an academic one; (2) a drop in the frequency of taking traditional college preparation core courses; (3) a decrease in homework; and (4) increase in student dissatisfaction with the lack of academic emphasis in schools. Findings support the policy recommendations of recent national reports in regard to curriculum, course  content, homework and programs for special populations. (BS)",

Great variations were found among the different programs studied but the following general characteristics were noted: (1) Title I was the primary sponsor of compensatory services; (2) student eligibility was based on standard achievement tests and teacher judgments; (3) total amount of time students received services varied widely from school to school; (4) follow-up monitoring of  students receiving compensatory services was not found in schools; (5) CE students received more reading and mathematics instruction than did other students but less regular instruction; and (6) 56% of the schools provided health services and 80% provided some compensatory nutrituon services. In general it was found that principals were well-satisfied with the effectiveness of the CE programs, students had positive attitudes toward the programs, teachers had mixed attitudes, and there was little evidence of stigmatization of program participating students.

        "description":"This report of a study on the influence of education on student achievement finds that while schooling does have some tangible effects, they are not enough to significantly counterbalance the effects of students' social backgrounds. The report is part of an extensive series of studies on compensatory education and its long-term effects. The study sample consisted of 15,579 first through sixth graders attending 242 public schools in the fall of 1976. Of these schools, 95 were studied over the next two years and their students were followed for up to three years. Data on students' home environments and outside activities were collected as well as information on the characteristics of each school. Basic academic skills were assessed by a set of standardized achievement tests. The  data gathered were used in a series of structural-equation models of the schooling-achievement process. It was found that the effects of schooling are too modest to overcome the academic advantages of socioeconomically privileged students, and even in the early years when schooling is most effective, the linkage of school resources to background works to sustain if not increase the background-achievement relationship. It is suggested, however, that while compensatory education may not be able to alter this relationship substantially, it may make a difference to disadvantaged students by reducing the link between ability and resources and may increase their chances of completing school or enough school to participate successfully in society. Numerous data tables are used in the report.  Supplementary tables, as well as detailed analyses of the study sample and of cohort patterns, are contained in the appendices. (CG)",

The eleven separate classes of drugs distinguished are marijuana (including hashish), inhalants, hallucinogens, cocaine, heroin, natural and synthetic opiates other than heroin, stimulants, sedatives, tranquilizers, alcohol, and cigarettes. Separate statistics are also presented here for several sub-classes of drugs: PCP and LSD, barbiturates and methaqualone, and amyl  and butyl nitrites. Occasions of medically supervised use of the psychotherapeutic drugs were excluded. Attention was focused on high frequency levels of drug use and an indirect measure of dosage per occasion was introduced to differentiate levels of drug use. The &quot;Other Findings&quot; section includes data on the use of non-prescription stimulants, daily marijuana use, effects of post high school environments and role transitions on drug use, and the issue of distinguishing maturational change from period effects and class cohort differences.

Real median family income rose for the second consecutive year. Increased employment and higher real earning levels contributed to the 2.8% increase. The increases were experienced  by both white and Spanish-origin families, leaving the median for black families unchanged. The number of men and women with earnings rose substantially--an increase of 1.5 million over 1983 for men and an increase of over 2.1 million for females. The proportion of people working year-round, full-time increased for men while it remained the same for women.

Section I reviews existing literature and data on the size, characteristics, and needs of homeless youth. Section II summarizes New York State's current efforts on their behalf. Section III analyzes obstacles to serving this population. Section IV outlines an action plan for New York State to improve its services. Although New York State has been a leader in recognizing the needs of runaway and homeless youth, the scope and methods of the present service delivery system fail to meet the magnitude and nature of the crisis. Probably the greatest deficiency is the lack of services available to older homeless youth as compared to those for youth and children under 16. Other gaps and barriers include  the unavailability of transitional services which address long-term rather than emergency needs; inadequate coordination of services such as education, health care, and housing; and limitations of current funding sources. The recommendations address five areas: (1) coordination between state agencies; (2) implementation of a formal mechanism to ensure coordinated planning and service delivery at the local level; (3) development of transitional services; (4) improved preparation for independent living of youth in residential child care; and (5) evaluation and research in developing and improving the service delivery systems.

Chapter 5 (continuing  from chapter 4 in volume 1) traces the policy's development and offers an analysis and discussion of the concept of race that emerged. Chapter 6 examines the implementation of the policy, including a description and interpretation of the Race Relations Committee's activities, and board members' actions to ensure the policy was reflected in curriculum materials.

Chapter 2 examines a number of aspects of the relationship between poverty and achievement. Chapter 3 describes characteristics of children whose families meet the official census definition of poverty, as well as those who experience long spells of poverty, those who live in areas with high concentrations of poverty, and students who are not high achievers in school. Chapter 4 examines  characteristics of those students who actually have been served by Title I or Chapter 1 programs. Appendices include: (1) the statute for the National Assessment of Chapter 1; (2) a list of contracted studies on Chapter 1; (3) the Administrative Status Report of the National Assessment; (4) two reports on the effects of poverty on student attainment; (5) two statistical reports based on the Current Population Survey and the 1980 Census; and (6) three reports providing data on participants in Title I/Chapter 1 programs.

        "description":"Major theoretical approaches to the study of career mobility were reviewed, with particular emphasis on those that focus on the organizational-structural level of analysis, on careers as structures of organizations. In particular, internal labor market theory was explored as a framework through which to study administrative careers in colleges and universities. Three elements (a job ladder or career line, entry ports, and movement up the ladder or career lines) identified as constituting an internal labor market provided specific focus of attention. Colleges and universities are special types of organizations with no clearly defined career lines. Consequently, there are few clearly defined steps in the line to the presidency or to the top-level position in a functional area such  as student affairs. Using data from \"Today's Academic Leaders: A National Study of Administrators in Community and Junior Colleges\" (Pennsylvania State University, 1984), career paths were charted for four positions--president, chief academic officer, chief student affairs officer, and chief business officer. An analysis of the data found that top-level administrators were likely to have come from within two-year colleges rather than from outside or from four-year colleges; however, most had held positions in four-year colleges at some point. Chief business officers often moved directly to their current positions from outside postsecondary education. This study shows that career lines do develop over time. Further research on career lines in higher education is needed so that persons  going into academic administration, particularly women and minorities, can gain a clearer picture of what steps to follow in order to advance to top administrative positions. Three tables and a reference list of six pages are provided. (KC)",

The methodology of the study was as follows: (1) establish a small stakeholder group that represents constituencies with a stake in the research outcome (vocational education administrators, higher education officials, and business and industry representatives); (2) in collaboration with this group, identify profile-specific individuals to be interviewed and conduct interviews; and (3) interpret and analyze data. Issues identified through the study include the following: fiscal resources and management; program service profile and capabilities;  supporting organizations and administrative structures; professional development, qualifications, and selection; evaluation of program and professional activities; the vocational education program role in larger economic strategies; and equity and access considerations. These issues were considered by the individuals contacted; their comments and reactions are profiled in the numerous tables in this document. The study concluded that more research and evaluation of programs and philosophies will be necessary to help the United States move into the role of a post-industrial society.

        "description":"Increasing demands for human services and current government fiscal policies may make volunteerism the major way of improving the individual living conditions and society as a whole. Extension agents are in the front line of persons capable of developing volunteerism at the local level. They have a direct link with local citizens and are familiar with existing local socioeconomic environments and needs. The leadership of extension agents in planning and implementing programs has already given them visibility in communities. Extension agents have also gained a great deal of expertise through working with millions of volunteers in program areas such as agriculture, 4-H, home economics, and community resources development. Recently, a panel of extension agents were asked about their  activities in the area of volunteerism development. The panel suggested that funding, training, and evaluation are crucial for volunteer development at the local level. Objectives that are short-term and perceived to be relevant for the given group have the best chance of attainment. Although service to volunteerism adds job responsibilities that increase agents' workload, involvement in volunteerism development can have many benefits for the extension agents themselves and for the extension system as a whole. Accommodation of the voluntary sector in Cooperative Extension Service programs could have many mutual benefits for agencies in human service-oriented activities. (MN)",

Policy recommendations formulated as a result of the study included the following: (1) a formal functional relationship should be established between agricultural extension and the higher education institutions; (2) policy decisions should be made by appropriate government agencies to free extension  personnel from performing nonextension activities; (3) the number of subject-matter specialists should be increased; (4) advisory committees should be organized at each hierarchy level of the organizational structure of the agricultural extension; (5) an evaluation unit should be organized as a part of the agricultural extension organization; (6) extension programs should be carried out through organized farmer groups; (7) personnel competency levels should be improved through systematic staff recruitment and development; (8) promotion criteria should be established for all extension personnel; and (9) adequate working relationships should be established and maintained at local levels between agricultural extension and other public and private institutions.

Such training is especially needed at the village level since nearly 60 percent of the village population are peasant farmers.  Village-level extension agents must have a thorough understanding of the complex hierarchy of village society. Instruction for agents should be provided both in class and under field conditions through such techniques as group discussion, panels, field visits, camping, and on-site demonstrations. Improving the physical, economic, social, and cultural environment in which extension workers live and interact; participating in social and cultural activities; and maintaining functional relationships with other social institutions are additional ways through which social competence could be developed among village-level extension workers who have direct and immediate links with their clients.

        "description":"A study examined the current status of state governance structures for vocational education in the United States. A survey instrument was sent to the chief officer for vocational education in each state, district, and territory in order to identify the type of governance structure in place in each area, the amount of time the structure had been in place, whether the structure was currently being studied, and whether any changes in the structure were being contemplated. State boards of education were responsible for administering vocational education in 41 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Separate boards for vocational education were in existence in seven states and in the Virgin Islands, a university board of regents was responsible for administering vocational  education in Hawaii, and the state superintendent was the sole agent and executive officer of the state board in Montana. At the time of the survey, studies of the governance structure were either planned or underway in nine of the states/territories, and changes in the existing governance structure were anticipated in three states and in Puerto Rico.

        "description":"A study examined the reproduction of authority relations in a cooperative office education program at an urban, primarily working-class high school in a midwestern city. The subjects of the case study were 16 current program enrollees, 17 program alumnae, and a female teacher who described herself as a pro-union feminist. Study participants, all female, were interviewed concerning their family backgrounds and influences, experiences during the cooperative office education program, and their working life and perspective after high school. It appeared that both the school and workplaces engage in practices to transmit a work ethic and docile respect for authority and to accommodate young workers to their place in a hierarchical division of labor. The young workers studied often  exhibited loyal, dependable, and docile behavior even while they were quite critical of the work behavior of their superordinates. Those individuals studied appeared to be good workers not so much because they had internalized the expectations of their employers and the lessons of the school, but because they had their own psychological and cultural reasons for producing high-caliber work. Although the main process at work in their lives was one of social and cultural reproduction rather than transformation, it is argued that their insights and actions did more than recreate oppressive structures and relations. These individuals worked hard because they experienced work as: (1) helping their supervisors (whom they liked); or (2) helping the consumer (with whom they identified).  (MN)",

        "description":"County government has a large stake in the creation of employment and training systems at the local level to insure that Federal, state, and local dollars are spent effectively. The door to the creation of an employment and training system has been opened by the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) through the establishment of Private Industry Councils (PICs). These PICs should be given tools to carry out employment and training development through strategic planning. Of the various methods of strategic planning, Strategic Issue Management is the most likely to result in success. It allows for broad environmental scanning to identify strategic issues and detailed scanning and strategy formulation for each issue. By adding to this the requirement that strategic planning address  issues that cut across organizational lines, county elected officials, working with their PICs, will be able to move into the realm of system building. County leadership is needed to move PICs in the direction of Strategic Issue Management. Careful attention should be given to having PICs plan their outcomes and to deciding who will be responsible for the various stages of the issue management process. To carry out this process, PICs should conduct an organizational inventory to determine what human resources exist within the community and carefully select the specific issues that they want to address. Issues must be understood in detail, specific change targets must be identified, and implementation plans must be put in place. Strategic Issue Management is a powerful tool to aid county  government in the development of a local employment and training system. (KC)",

        "description":"The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) mandates that service delivery areas shall expend 40 percent of Title IIA funds on training and employment programs for youth. To ensure quality programs, a substantial portion of resources should be targeted to the most seriously at-risk youth. The most effective youth programs take a comprehensive approach to dealing with youth. Instead of seeking single, one-dimensional solutions, they provide a continuum of services aimed at addressing a broad range of employment-related needs. What works best is an approach that seeks to integrate a broad range of training elements, including basic education, job skill training, work experience, and pre-employment orientation. The approaches that seem to work best and are consistent with the lessons of  experience are the following: (1) stress academic remediation; (2) opt for quality, comprehensive training; (3) concentrate on at-risk youth; (4) use a competency-based framework; and (5) seek a coordinated, collaborative working arrangement. However, producing better trained, job-ready youth is not simply a matter of offering more effective training programs. A coordinated effort is needed among the educational community, the business sector, local government, and community groups. Such cooperation is crucial to produce and maintain effective training initiatives. A brief resource list is provided. (KC)",

The guide is organized in four chapters. Chapter I provides background information on the legislative and administrative history and evolution of performance standards. It provides an overview of the performance standard system as set forth by the U.S. Department of Labor and discusses performance standards within the context of overall program management. Chapter II examines performance standards as an integral part of the program planning process. It reviews the functions of strategic and operational planning and the ways that  program officials can select their strategies to meet local needs and circumstances. Chapter III provides the framework for a negotiated approach to setting performance standards and examines the Department of Labor's adjustment model, its major limitations, and the key issues for undertaking a negotiated approach. Chapter IV focuses on the negotiation process, discussing several important issues that states and service delivery areas (SDAs) must resolve when negotiating their performance standards. These issues include establishing the basis for negotiation; developing tools for further quantifying adjustments to the model-predicted performance scores; negotiation and its relationship to 6 percent incentive funds; establishing a framework to support a negotiation process; and state and  SDA roles in establishing a negotiation process.

        "description":"Although projecting what the labor market will be like in 10 years is extremely difficult, it is useful to consider what is in store for the nation in terms of employment. In 1985, the civilian labor force of the United States averaged 115 million persons, with 8 million (7.2 percent) unemployed. Unemployment was much higher for young people and minority groups. It is expected that the labor force will grow by 15.6 million people between 1985 and 1995. The growth rate will vary considerably, however, among various demographic groups. The labor force is projected to be concentrated among prime-age workers, with a slightly higher median age than in 1984. The majority of growth is expected to result from increasing labor force participation by women. Employment opportunities will  not change dramatically over the next 10 years. Although some professions will have substantial growth, the demand for labor among most professions will remain constant or increase slightly. Demand and supply should hold steady. One clear trend that is emerging is that persons entering the labor force have more years of schooling than those they replace. Although this fact should mean that workers are more adaptable to change in the workplace, this may not be the case, since the quality of schooling has declined. With the changes taking place in technology, the labor market needs more responsive educational institutions to meet the demands of the next 10 years and beyond. (KC)",

The strengths of this program are that it provides logical steps to understanding and writing a nursing diagnosis and that it differentiates between nursing and medical diagnosis. Weaknesses are that it requires spelling and typing skills, and that the list of possible answers is too prescribed. A summary section shows that this courseware received overall ratings of \"yes\" in the categories of subject matter, technical presentation, student interaction, program interaction, and documentation, and \"somewhat\" for student evaluation  and work behaviors; the category of application programs was not applicable. The program was recommended as a useful tool in making nursing diagnosis easier. (SK)",

        "description":"Ohio's commitment to vocational education is stronger than ever. Vocational education programs in Ohio reflect the fact that not all high school graduates go on to higher education; job training programs offered in Ohio schools provide young people with marketable job skills. To determine these skills, the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) makes a strong effort to communicate with business and industry and make changes in vocational programs. Ohio's vocational education progrms reflect the state's understanding that the nation's economic performance can be enhanced if job training programs are tailored to meet economic needs. To combat the nation's decline in international trade, vocational education will have to emphasize state-of-the-art technologies and emerging skill areas  to produce workers technically equal or superior to foreign workers and emphasize the development of good work attitudes to produce American workers psychologically prepared to meet the highest standards of productivity. Throughout 1986 the ODE will pursue such state-level objectives as meeting vocational education needs of special populations, implementing a statewide core competency testing program, and creating a vocational education leadership academy.

        "description":"Scottish initiatives have been directed at improving the vocational relevance of education. Besides attempting to achieve balance in the curriculum between academic and vocational subjects, a new approach also has significant implications for methodology, involving experience-based and student-centered approaches. International developments impinge upon Scottish educational policy. First, the European governments have collaborated on a number of projects for transition from school to working and adult life. Second, governments have identified particular neighboring countries whose circumstances are similar and whose policies are worth imitating. The position of vocational education and training in Scotland today can be surveyed by referring to three particular client groups:  full-time secondary students, young workers, and vocational students involved in further education. Among the strands presently apparent in Scottish vocational education research are development of computer-based career guidance systems, the sociology of vocational education and training, and collaborative research to develop better quality vocational education. The government is beginning to recognize that its traditional policy of gradualism is not sufficient to restore economic health and to keep up with changes in education and training. A model based on people's &quot;ownership&quot; of change is likely to move vocational education in a direction that benefits society. (YLB)",

        "description":"Adult education is now seen as an integral part of lifelong education. Adult education has become an instrument of policy that helps forward the goals of social and economic development. In many countries, adult education is being used to promote a greater sense of community and understanding across cultural and ethnic divisions. The tasks of adult education have been defined as development of vocational skills, improvement of the quality of rural life, and activation of civic responsibility. Although policymakers identify women as a target group of adult education, women are not often involved in policy decisions. Throughout the world, a great debate about the value of literacy education and its relationship to social and economic development, especially that of women, is  beginning to emerge. Skepticism about policymakers' emphasis on target groups is also becoming evident. Because of the development of women's movements, women are beginning to ask for new types of training, including vocational training for nontraditional jobs and women's studies programs that revalue women's place in human history and enable women to revalue themselves. (Appendixes to this report include the definition of adult education that was adopted by the UNESCO general conference in 1976 and a diagram of a model for overcoming barriers to adult development.)

        "description":"A study of employee turnover in the Federal government showed that in 1984, about 195,000 full-time, nonpostal Federal workers with permanent appointments left Federal jobs or transferred to other Federal agencies--representing a turnover rate of 11.5 percent. The turnover was about three percentage points higher for white-collar workers than for blue-collar workers. Among white-collar workers, turnover varied by occupation and length of time on the job. Based on a review of voluntary separations, clerical workers showed the highest turnover among the government's major white-collar occupational groups--with rates standing at nearly twice that for all groups. Workers with few years on the job also showed high turnover. Those with five years of service or less had a turnover rate  more than twice that for all workers and more than 20 times that for workers with more than 25 years on the job. Comparison with the private sector showed that Federal turnover is relatively low, but the differences depend on what data are used and the different structures of opportunity in the government and the private sector. The private sector may have only a two percent higher quit rate when all factors are taken into account. Turnover data can be used in management decision making. Costs associated with turnover can be large; however, using lower-cost new employees may offset the costs of training. The effectiveness of quit rates as a management tool will depend on how they are used; factors other than pay need to be taken into account in adjusting for turnover.

        "description":"A study investigated the feasibility of developing school-related packages to assist secondary school students in their movement through secondary school, into and through postsecondary occupational preparatory programs, and ultimately into the world of work. Three phases occurred simultaneously. The first determined the approach to be followed--the generic skills approach. A second phase assessed business, health sciences, and technology programs offered in the community colleges to determine skills/competencies required for entry. The third phase involved an analysis of available curriculum outlines. The outcome of the research was that school-related packages were judged to be feasible. Rather than using a generic skills approach in its purest form, the 13 packages guided  students toward occupational families in three fields: business, health, and technology. Research showed that, as students moved from secondary schools into colleges, gaps existed in students' background in communications, computation, problem solving, and knowledge of responsibilities associated with the preparation for a specific vocation or group of vocations. Overlaps were found between the two systems, particularly in course and text duplications. Pilot testing of package drafts with secondary school and college officials provided feedback to ensure package relevance, usefulness, and ease of use. (The school-related packages are appended.)

        "description":"Skill deterioration and retraining needed to support mobilization were determined for Individual Ready Reservists (IRRs) in 16 critical Navy ratings. Mailed questionnaire were used to obtain job performance information (tasks performed and proficiency associated with their performance) from IRRs and active duty personnel. Skill deterioration was determined by differences in proficiency reported by IRRs for two different points in time: when they were separated from active service and at the time they completed the questionnaire. Retraining needs were derived by comparing IRR estimates of their current proficiency on job tasks within their rating to the same type of estimates made by current active duty personnel. Study results indicated that skills previously acquired on active  duty deteriorate during the time personnel are assigned to the IRRs. Much less deterioration occurred for individuals who work in civilian jobs related to their Navy rating. For most of the ratings, the current proficiency levels of IRRs compared favorably with the proficiency levels reported by individuals currently on active duty. It appeared that the typical IRR should be able to perform most job tasks of his/her rating at mobilization after brief familiarization such as would be provided by direct, corrective supervision. (Appendixes, which form the bulk of the document, include job descriptions, cover letters, and study results for 16 ratings.) More than 100 data tables are contained in the document. (Author/YLB)",

The guide uses as background and examples in the planning process the coal employment project that began in 1977 to make intensive efforts to help women get jobs in the coal mines of Appalachia. The 12 steps of the planning and implementation process are discussed in individual sections of the guide: (1) assess the need for a program and document the facts; (2) develop media strategies; (3) structure the organization and develop the program framework; (4) develop a proposal and seek funding; (5) establish an advocacy position; (6) develop support networks; (7) design training components; (8)  develop and collect training materials; (9) recruit and screen applicants; (10) conduct the training; (11) assist in finding jobs; and (12) provide ongoing support. Appendixes to the guide provide: suggestions for developing a nonsexist training program, a contents outline of the coal mine project training manual, information on local mines (form), checklist of suggestions for making job application at coal mines, and a job application form.

        "description":"What is the current role played by schools in helping their students who choose to enter the job market after high school graduation? An examination was made of the role of schools at four critical stages in students' transition to work--the career preparation stage, the job candidate stage, the job entry stage, and the job promotion or job shift stage. The study linked data about jobs from a nationally representative sample of 4,078 employers with National Longitudinal Survey data about the school experiences of young adults who held those jobs. The survey results suggest that the role of education is often very important for jobs that are usually filled by those with college degrees, somewhat less important for jobs filled by those with some college, and surprisingly  unimportant for jobs usually filled by high school graduates. For jobs at the high school level, the current role of schools seem weak in terms of the following: (1) job preparation--academic skills are not among the most important traits that employers require, and other important traits are not acquired in most high schools; (2) job recruitment--high school placement services are not frequently used by employers; (3) job entry--current educational information from high schools is not very available, useful, or important to employers in hiring; and job promotion--accomplishments in school have little bearing on who will be promoted in most firms to jobs that do not require a college degree. These findings should be used to help the schools improve their roles in these four areas.  (KC)",

The role of nontechnical information in the decision making process is addressed first, to help professional engineers and planners consider its importance in planning and implementation. In a chapter on value clarification, leadership skills for group meetings are described. The paper also outlines a process for developing an actual community involvement plan. Techniques discussed include publicity and information distribution, public meetings, advisory groups, flow of information to and from the public, conflict management, and relationship building. Work sheets and checklists are included as aids in this process. A rational planning model for  implementation is described. Finally, an extensive list of involvement techniques is presented. These techniques are discussed individually so that planners can choose those best suited to the planning situation. A public meeting checklist is appended. (Author/KC)",

More than 90 percent of families planning to leave farming were viable under economic conditions at survey time. Almost half of Wisconsin dairy farm households were not viable. Higher debt, younger operator age, and lower farm production efficiency were typical of the least viable households. Less than 20 percent of families with part-time farm operators and nondairy farms were not viable. The most severely stressed operated the largest and least profitable farms. Of families with full-time operators and smaller nondairy farms, 55 percent in Mississippi-Tennessee and 32 percent in Wisconsin were not viable. The typical farm was too small to  support a household. Forty-two percent of families with full-time operators and larger nondairy farms were not viable. Production inefficiency and high interest costs aggravated income problems. Options suggested to improve farm family well-being included development of nonfarm job opportunities, vocational training to help younger operators change occupations, greater availability of credit, and commodity programs.

The training concept was quite different from traditional programs in that NWEE's thrust was to move women quickly into jobs. The program focused on employment readiness skills or referral to skills training. The target population served by NWEE was composed primarily of Hispanic female heads of families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The program identified specific job opportunities, recruited women interested in those jobs, prepared the women for the jobs, helped place the women, and provided follow-up and support services for a full year after the initial  training program. The program thus included five major components that are described in this guide: job development, outreach, employment readiness training, job placement, and follow-up services. A section on program management, with attention to staffing, recordkeeping, and evaluation, is also included. The NWEE project is described as an example that others can use in designing and implementing similar projects. A large part of the document consists of appendixes that contain materials needed to develop such a project. Materials include the following: forms used to implement/evaluate the NWEE project, sample skills discovery exercise, employment readiness class schedules, and a curriculum guide for an employment readiness training class.

The Simulation Systems Technical Area of the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences performed the research. Special consideration is given to a family of models known collectively as TRAINVICE. These four models differ in several important ways, although they are all intended to provide an index of transfer potential. The variables considered in the calculation of the indices are assigned different degrees of emphasis in each model. In selected cases a variable is completely ignored: e.g., the instructional features of a training device. The preparatory analyses employed to estimate the values of each variable change from model to  model. The combinatorial procedures used to calculate an index of effectiveness from the variable values are different in each model. The principal points of difference among the various predictive models are presented to facilitate a comparative assessment of their merit. Results of the analysis and subsequent validation will provide a basis for the selection and refinement of one or more of the models for incorporation into a defined set of procedures for specifying training device effectiveness.

The current study presents a quantitative review of the literature with respect to the empirical and theoretical evaluation of these principles of item-writing. Fifty-six studies that addressed at least one of the 45 item-writing rules were identified. Twenty-one of the rules have been studied empirically; 24 item-writing rules have no empirical basis. The optimal number of options was the most frequently studied rule, with 18 studies cited. The major generalization from these studies is that three options maximize test reliability and efficiency. Type-k items were evaluated in eight studies. Results suggest that compared to  single-answer multiple-choice items, type-k items are more difficult, provide clues to some examinees, and decrease test reliability and efficiency. Eight other studies suggest some empirical basis for keeping the length of the keyed option about the same as other options. This review suggests that the majority of the common principles of multiple-choice item writing are not empirically based. (Author/DWH)",

After providing background on the French educational system, this paper discusses two areas of secondary school level (ages 11 through 18) assessment change: (1) the 1975 replacement of the 16+ Brevet d'Etudes du Premier Cycle (the qualification examination at the end of compulsory education) with a continuous assessment and guidance process called &quot;orientation&quot; by Rene Haby, then Minister of Education; and (2) the current pressure for reform of the traditional Baccalaureat examination at the upper secondary education level due to both the higher  value given the &quot;Bac 'C'&quot; (mathematics and physical sciences) form by universities and its general &quot;devaluation.&quot; As in other countries, the general trends of assessment reform in France are: (1) postponing the key point of selection as educational levels expand; (2) making assessment more comprehensive by incorporating more personal qualities and skills; and (3) increasing the delegation of assessment responsibilities to teachers. French teachers, however, are neither committed to, nor prepared for, these new responsibilities and the accompanying exposure to public censure. Assessment may become a major casualty of a heavily centralized education system torn between tradition and change. (BS)",

Incorporating earlier staff development programs into a single statewide system, TECCs provide: (1) computer technology instruction, including classroom applications; (2) teaching methodology training; (3) mathematics and science training; and (4) strategies and training for site-based staff development programs, including administering the AB 55l staff development grants. In addition, the SMERC (San Mateo Educational Resources Center) Library Computer Center (San Mateo County) provides an educational software library and clearinghouse to assist TECCs with software evaluation. This mandatory annual  evaluation report describes the TECCs major accomplishments and challenges using data from site visits, interviews (with TECC staff, policy board members, and State Department of Education and Legislative staff), evaluation surveys, data base services and training documentation, and document analysis. While the TECCs are already a high payoff investment in educational reform, this report recommends (1) reallocating funds within TECCs to increase curriculum and capacity-building services; (2) strengthening the TECC Network through comprehensive planning, closer cooperation with the State Department of Education, and an improved data base for service documentation; and (3) legislative action to increase staff development incentives. Appendices contain: (1) TECC statutory authorization; (2)  three evaluation instruments; and (3) a summary of 1983-84 TECC evaluation survey results. (BS)",

        "description":"Although many school districts and classrooms have desegregated since the 1954 Brown decision, desegregation is neither complete nor uniform. Moreover, racial isolation is growing in some regions and cities, and new forms of separation are arising within desegregated schools. New desegregation strategies and policies are needed, but these will be constrained by current demographic trends (such as the general move away from Northeastern cities to the suburbs and to the South) and economic phenomena, such as the growing poverty of cities. Similarly, citizens' changing political preferences are cause for pessimism, especially the decline in fervor for civil rights initiatives. Even among blacks, doubts are increasing that mandatory desegregation is either possible or advisable. Yet  civil rights proponents should not despair: surveys reveal that Americans strongly and increasingly endorse racial integration and deplore segregation and racism. Policy makers must attempt to resolve debate over interpretation of the Brown decision. Of the three main interpretations--a &quot;color-blind constitution&quot;; &quot;desegregation first&quot;; and &quot;educational quality&quot;--the first must be ruled out as politically, morally, and constitutionally flawed. The other two are also unsatisfactory, but this does not mean that desegregation is doomed. If they are linked together, both quality education and desegregation can be achieved. Successful desegregation means avoiding resegregation, magnetizing all schools, fostering constructive interracial activities, and above all, desegregating on a  metropolitan-wide basis. (KH)",

        "description":"Using the 1976 Survey of Income and Education, and focusing on Hispanics aged 14 to 25, analyses were conducted to assess when in the schooling process Hispanics drop out. Findings suggest that over 40 percent of all Hispanic dropouts leave school before reaching the 10th grade, with most of the pre-high-school attrition occurring at the junior high school level. Dropping out among Hispanics peaks in the 11th grade (30 percent of all Hispanic dropouts), followed by a sharp decline in the 12th grade (7 percent). Analysis of descriptive statistics regarding pre-high-school attrition and delay suggests that regional differences in policies regarding school leaving and delay may exist, that sophomore-aged Puerto Ricans are most likely to experience delay among Hispanic subgroups, and  that socioeconomic, language-related and immigration factors are related to delay and pre-high-school attrition. In view of these findings, it is important that researchers focus on the junior high school period in which significant numbers of Hispanic youth drop out of school and/or experience substantial delays in their educational progress. Furthermore, pre-high-school attrition statistics should be regarded as social indicators and analyzed on a regular basis for Hispanics and other relevant subgroups, in order to review trends regarding the attrition issue.

        "description":"The Innovation Configurations approach is a way of measuring what aspects of a staff development training program are actually being put into practice. Unlike other methods of measuring implementation (and particularly those used in the evaluation of bilingual program implementation), it does not focus on outcomes but instead answers the questions: (1) &quot;What is the innovation?&quot; and (2) &quot;How is it being used?&quot; The procedure involves five basic steps: (1) reading descriptive materials, interviewing the developer or program facilitator, and developing a tentative list of components and variations; (2) interviewing and observing users to get a concrete image of how they implement and interweave the components; (3) in new discussions with the developer, clarifying the most important  components, verifying variations, and resolving discrepancies between developer and user viewpoints; (4) collecting data through interviews, observations, and/or self-administered checklists; and (5) analyzing data. Following these descriptions of the Innovation Configurations approach, the document presents a case study of its application to an ongoing bilingual education trainer of trainers program in San Diego, in order to determine what aspects of the training have actually been implemented by trainees before a &quot;coaching&quot; treatment is applied. (The school district profiles thus derived are to be used as baseline data after the coaching component has been completed.) The training program is described, the development of a checklist is outlined (two drafts are appended), and results of  interviews with and observations of trainees are presented. And finally, unresolved problems with the approach are discussed and conclusions and recommendations are presented. (CMG)",

The guide is organized in seven sections. The first section summarizes steps identified as most relevant to success in building bilingual capacity and commitment. Section 2 explains the rationale for the Title VII interest in capacity and commitment as a key element in the operation of successful bilingual education projects. The next four sections address substantive areas in which bilingual capacity and commitment can be fostered in most school systems; these areas include the bilingual instructional approach, staff  development, parent and community involvement, and administration and funding. Section 7 suggests ways to describe capacity and commitment building efforts in a Title VII grant application, and also explains how applications are reviewed when they reach Washington. An appendix contains a list of Title VII funded providers of special assistance to bilingual projects that were operating in 1981-82. (KH)",

First, the acceptance of foreign nationals into the Swedish labor force and communities and the elaboration of social policies toward those persons are outlined. The assumptions underlying bilingual education in Sweden are discussed along with four alternative forms of classroom organization that are being tried and the level of social integration of immigrant groups. Second, bicultural education in Australia is considered in terms of Aborigine education;  education about the Aborigines; the induction of immigrants; ESL instruction; supplementary bilingual education programs; social studies and foreign language education; the response of education departments to the need for teacher training; and the debate over multiculturalism versus social integration. Third, the following dimensions to bilingual education in the Federal Republic of Germany are reviewed: policies toward guestworkers, political refugees, and European Economic Community nationals; the change from segregationist to integrationist approaches to the education of guestworkers' children; difficulties in integrating foreign students academically and socially; the problems of inner city enclaves of immigrants; and the question of repatriation.

The students, who were from Hartford, Connecticut, and were nearly all Black, were traced from their first desegregation in elementary school until after high school graduation. It is concluded that, compared with similar minority students who attended segregated Hartford city schools: male participants were more likely to graduate from high school (the effect on females was weaker); (2) male, but not female, participants completed more years of colleg; (3) male, but not female, participants perceived less discrimination in college and in other areas of adult life in Hartford; (4) male, though not female,  participants have experienced less difficulty with the police and have gotton into fewer fights as adults; (5) participants have closer social contact with Whites as adults, are more likely to live in desegregated housing, and had more friends in college (the colleges were always predominantly White); and (6) female participants were less likely to have a child before 18. The last four conclusions serve to explain to some degree the positive effects of desegregation on educational attainment. (Author/RDN)",

        "description":"This study's major purpose was to examine intergovernmental relations in the context of compensatory education through an investigation of how far selected Title I operative goals were institutionalized, and the implications of such institutionalization (or lack of it) for stability or change of practices under Chapter 1. Three categories of goals were examined: (1) those changed substantially by Chapter 1 legislation; (2) those that were expected to change greatly but did not; and (3) those that Chapter 1 legislation did not change greatly. Analysis of the available data (from existing research reports and databases and from interviews with Federal, State, and local officials) yielded three major findings. First, of the category 1 goals--comparability, evaluation, parental  involvement, and State monitoring and auditing--all of which were highly specified under Title I, only evaluation was sufficiently institutionalized to be retained in the Chapter 1 era. Second, although the category 2 goals--targeting of services to low-income areas and to educationally disadvantaged students--were never precisely defined under Title I, and the practices Title I administrators put into place fell short of meeting those goals, there is little evidence that these practices are changing under Chapter 1. And finally, the category 3 goals--services to nonpublic students, &quot;supplement not supplant,&quot; and concentration of services--were never fully implemented under Title I and there is little evidence regarding changes under Chapter 1. It is concluded that although specific  Federal requirements may lead to greater compliance, they do not necessarily lead to institutionalization. (CMG)",

        "description":"This report details the theoretical framework, methodology, and findings of research into the impact of Parent Advisory Councils (PACs) on the management and administration of Title I programs at the local level. The eight school districts studied were selected because they varied in their orientations toward PAC involvement in Title I, and in geographical location, urban/rural character, and local education agency (LEA) size. Chapter I provides an introduction. Chapter II contains a description of the theoretical framework underlying the study. In Chapter III activities related to data collection are described. Included in the discussion are descriptions of the sample of school districts and respondents within them, data collection instruments, data collection procedures, and  issues surrounding the interpretation of data. Chapter IV presents the study's findings. These findings are organized around the theoretical framework set forth in Chapter II; discussion thus focuses on the impact of PACs, PAC activities, PAC membership, characteristics, PAC responsibilities, recruitment of PAC members, external constituencies of PACs, and LEA and state education agency orientations toward PACs. In Chapter V the conclusions and implications of the findings are elaborated. Volume III of the study consists of three appendices. Appendix I documents the study's instrumentation. Appendix II shows in tabular form the variations in responses to questions contained in the interview schedules. Finally, appendix III provides 67 tables of statistical data to support the findings  detailed in volume I. (RDN)",

        "description":"The Government Accounting Office (GAO) conducted an examination of patterns and causes of fraud in Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs to determine how implementation of Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs might be made less vulnerable to exploitation. GAO's investigation found that fraud and abuse in CETA programs often occurred because of weaknesses in internal controls, particularly in accounting and reporting at the service delivery level. JTPA's programs are similar to CETA's in that most funds are spent by locally-based program delivery systems; thus, strong internal controls at service delivery level are needed. A Department of Labor Inspector General (IG) audit of State system designs prior to JTPA implementation revealed numerous weaknesses  in the procedures the States planned to use to ensure the adequacy of controls of service delivery area subgrantees. The IG recommended that Labor's Employment Training Administration (ETA) review all the States during the first few months of JTPA operations to determine whether planned procedures and controls were adequately completed and all necessary systems were implemented and working effectively. ETA's follow-up determined that nearly all critical State systems have been developed. As the Department of Labor monitors JTPA in the future, it should verify that the procedures have been fully implemented and work effectively. (CMG)",

Section I describes the major concerns about Minnesota education (centering on excellence and student performance, system accountability and responsiveness, and efficient and cost-effective school service), and reviews the major reform proposals. Section II provides an historical overview, from 1847 to the present. Section III discusses why the public school system contracted during the 1970s and 1980s and, at the same time, took on additional responsibilities. Section IV considers the impact on the schools of a changed student population (focusing on changes in family life, alcohol and drug use,  sexual activity, reading habits, employment, and student attitudes and behavior), teacher dissatisfaction, continuing financial disparities, use of the new technology and adoption of school effectiveness research, and changes in the political climate. Section V presents a policy framework which attempts to describe key elements of the structure of Minnesota public education. Finally, Section VI summarizes major findings and conclusions. Appendices include a chronology of K-12 education in Minnesota; a table comparing the average school staff salaries in 1973-74, 1978-79, and 1982-83; and highlights of a survey of the educational attitudes of Minnesota high school students in the early 1980s.

The questions asked dealt broadly with the following areas: educational quality; teacher employment conditions; State financial support; State educational guidelines; and educational vouchers. Major findings, for the sample as a whole and for various subgroups were as follows: Of the total sample, 79% rated the schools as good or excellent; 69% felt that the schools were as good as or better than they were 10 years ago; and no subgroup fell below majority support for the schools, though support was lower among central city respondents and those with children in private schools. Two subgroups felt that quality was worse than it was 10 years ago--parents with  children in private schools and residents of Minneapolis; however, there was general satisfaction with the way the system is run. Only three questions asking about possible changes received endorsement from more than 55% of respondents: (1) 83% favored modifying teacher tenure to make it easier to replace teachers doing unsatisfactory work. No subgroup fell below majority endorsement. (2) 82% would provide more State aid to poorer school districts. No subgroup fell below majority endorsement; and (3) 76% would require that all public schools teach similar classes and use similar materials. Only those with a graduate education fell below majority endorsement. (CMG)",

        "description":"This report presents 1980 census data on the geographic distribution of Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States. The 1980 census was the first one to identify the total Asian and Pacific Islander population and its subgroups. Information on the total Asian and Pacific Islander population is shown for the United States, regions, divisions, and States. Data for the same areas are also presented for the Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Asian Indians, Vietnamese, Korean, Hawaiian, Guamanian, Samoan, and &quot;Other Asian and Pacific Islander&quot; populations. The introduction discusses (1) the distribution of the total Asian and Pacific Islander population and its status as one of the fastest growing groups of the 1970's; (2) the composition and distribution of the Asian population; (3)  recent arrivals from Southeast Asia; and (4) the composition and distribution of the Pacific Islander population. A chapter on definitions and explanations is provided, along with an appendix discussing the accuracy of the data. In addition to ten text tables there are five detailed tables: (1) Asian and Pacific Islander Population: 1980; (2) Percent Distribution of the Asian and Pacific Islander Population: 1980; (3) Total Asian and Pacific Islander Population by Rank: 1980 and 1970; (4) Asian Population: 1980; and (5) Pacific Islander Population by Type: 1980.

        "description":"While the implementation of adult literacy promotion can best be handled at the national level, some important things can be done at the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) level. A persuasive argument can be made on behalf of adult literacy in the SADCC development strategy. The people need to be educated in the political economy of oppressive systems and be helped to understand how they must think and act to break out of their bondage. Adult literacy provides an excellent opportunity for social mobilization. The teaching of literacy in the SADCC region can include content that will reinforce SADCC vision and policies. (Following this overview of the topic, individual discussions are offered of adult literacy policy and performance in the nine member  states of SADCC: Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Angola. These general statements are made: (1) near-universal adult literacy is essential for development of each individual country in the SADCC region; (2) near-universal adult literacy is possible to obtain; (3) without near-universal adult literacy, economic liberation from South Africa will not come; and (4) near-universal adult literacy will bring the common man &quot;inside politics.&quot;) (YLB)",

Two models of articulated curriculum development efforts in the areas of vocational and technical education that are worthy of particular consideration are articulation projects currently underway in the State of Hawaii and in the Dallas Community College District. Articulated curriculum efforts such as these have a number of  benefits; for example, they frequently result in enhanced communication and coordination among professionals, in the awarding of postsecondary credit for the mastery of courses taken at the secondary level, and in an overall increase in schools' productivity. In light of these and other benefits to be derived from articulated curriculum development, it is recommended that funding be provided for the development and implementation of a similar articulation project in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas.

If vocational education is to meet the critical skill needs of industry, Federal policies providing for broader governance and an incremental approach to the planning and delivery of vocational education programs are necessary. Rather than relying on government corrective action to adjust curricula after skill needs have already changed, vocational education planners need to build adjustments to changing technology and labor markets into the system. Federal vocational education policy must encourage States and local school districts to deal with all elements of the school-to-work transition, including job placement, job search education, and employment  assistance services. When planning for the delivery of occupational education to adult learners, Federal policymakers need to focus on efforts to assist adults in making occupational adjustments and to aid employers in upgrading their labor force. It is imperative that Federal policymakers take steps to meet national skill shortages, promote entrepreneurship, and integrate the multitude of Federal human resource development efforts currently underway.

During the first phase of the study, the researchers reviewed the literature pertaining to the phenomenon of job aspirations as it pertains to or explains the disproportionate enrollment of disadvantaged students in low-level programs. Next, data were collected from 2,348 students from 29 secondary and postsecondary vocational and technical schools, and telephone interviews were conducted with 201 parents. These data pointed to four potential barriers to enrollment in high-level programs--parental influence, the prestige value of a student's occupational environment, the nature of the student's personal development, and sources of information for making educational  choices. The following conclusions emerged from the study: the negative effects of disadvantagement are rooted in the experiences of students before they pursue vocational programs; the negative effects of disadvantagement are reinforced by the educational system; and recruitment procedures sometimes alienate disadvantaged clients. (Appendixes to this report include the survey instrument, descriptions of the data collection methods used during the study, and responses to 10 open-ended questions included on the survey instrument.)

        "description":"A project was conducted to develop a series of interactive microcomputer-controlled videotape training programs in chemical analysis of water quality for the fisheries technician program at Peninsula College (Washington). Improved color video equipment was obtained during the year for development of the training films. Interactive instruction and testing for each training film was developed using a random-access videotape recorder controlled by an Apple IIe microcomputer. Software developed by BCD Associates was purchased for computer program development. Software updates received from BCD late in the year improved the quality of the interaction and program development. Through these activities, eight video training films in chemical analysis of water quality were prepared, and  instruction and testing were developed for these training films using a microcomputer and random-access videotape recorder. The expertise gained in this project will be used to develop more interactive video instruction to encompass all chemical tests performed in the fisheries program. (A description of each of the eight videotapes is included in the report.) (KC)",

        "description":"This paper presents an analysis of the sex equity provisions of Public Law 98-524, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984. It is intended to assist parents, students, educators, and activists to ensure that the provisions of the Act are fully implemented throughout the country. The two major purposes of the new vocational education law are (1) to assist the states to expand, improve, modernize, and develop quality vocational education programs, and (2) to assure that persons who are inadequately served under vocational education programs have access to such programs--especially disadvantaged students, disabled students, men and women who are entering occupations that are not traditional for their sex, adults in need of training and retraining, homemakers, single  parents, persons with limited English proficiency, and persons in correctional institutions. Authorized for five years, the statute has five major sections or titles. Title I describes how funds are to be distributed and sets up administrative requirements for the states. Title II, the heart of the Act, is divided into two parts: Part A describes how funds are to be used to improve access, and Part B describes how funds are to be used to improve quality. Title III describes programs that are funded separately from Title II, including programs for community-based organizations, consumer and homemaking education, adult training and retraining, career guidance, and training in high-technology occupations. Title IV defines programs in research, data collection, and demonstration carried out  at the national level through the U.S. Department of Education. (Title V is not described in this paper.) For each of these titles, this paper describes the provisions, comments on potential problems that may arise, and suggests actions that can be taken. The final section of the paper lists four steps that sex equity advocates can take to ensure that the new law is carried out on the state and local levels. (KC)",

Division of courses into modules is also discussed. A sample seven-quarter RAST program course sequencing chart is provided. Following the five-page narrative are extensive appendixes. Appendix A lists the competencies--both terminal and enabling--required of a RAST. Appendix B, Section 1, contains course descriptions for the core of courses common to  several areas of specialty. A description of each specialty course is included in Appendix B, Section 2. Each course is described by a brief narrative stating purpose and goals for student learning. Course outlines, a listing of student competencies, and a list of recommended texts follow. Sample modules are provided for specialty courses. Appendix C contains brief descriptions of physics modules changes to include principles required for RAST training. (YLB)",

        "description":"The Robotics/Automated Systems Technician (RAST) project developed a robotics technician model curriculum for the use of state directors of vocational education and two-year college vocational/technical educators. A baseline management plan was developed to guide the project. To provide awareness, project staff developed a dissemination plan (articles in major publications), prepared and mailed a project abstract, presented three papers at conferences, and delivered a product report. A panel of experts was assembled as a project advisory committee. The project produced a state-of-the-art report, robotics/automated systems task analysis and job competency report, and teaching/learning modules and new module outlines for a RAST curriculum. Recommendations were the development of  modular instructional materials to support the six specialty courses in the RAST curriculum and the undertaking of similar curriculum projects to provide national models for technician education/training on other emerging, advanced technology areas. (Appendixes, amounting to approximately four-fifths of the report, include samples of visibility activities, information activities (project fact sheet, project brochure, and conference papers), advisory committee meeting minutes, robotics/automated systems task analysis listing, and core curriculum explanation.)

        "description":"Three experiments were conducted in order to clarify the encoding/retrieval dilemma in older adult students; and the recognition/recall test issue was also explored. First, a mnemonic technique based on the &quot;key word&quot; method of Funk and Tarshis was used; secondly, a semantic processing task was tried; and lastly, a repetition task, based primarily on the work of Nelson was used. Two forms of tests were also used in the third experiment, a basic multiple choice test and a free recall test. The material to be learned was vocabulary words chosen from Funk and Tarshis and used in other vocabulary learning experiments. An average of about 65 students, with group mean ages in the late 30s-early 40s, was used in the experiments. The results of the three experiments showed that older  adults, when left to their own tried and true past memory devices, will outperform those using other novel mnemonic and semantic processing strategies and far surpass those using rote repetition strategies. The experiments also showed that even when given later cues to enhance recall, the memory trace of older adult students appears to decay rapidly in spite of later review-retrieval assistance. Finally, the experiments showed that mnemonic devices appear slightly better than semantic processing devices, and repetition does not appear to facilitate processing in older adult students. Further, recognition tests, rather than recall tests that restate the original learning context, appear to be most facilitative of recall. (KC)",

        "description":"This report discusses ways to determine why female Federal employees earn less than male Federal employees. Two general approaches are discussed: economic analysis and job content. Economic analysis attempts to measure and explain existing wage differentials between men and women using characteristics of individuals, occupations, and the workplace. Such an analysis could indicate the extent to which factors such as education, work experience, and occupation account for wage differences by sex in the Federal Government. The job content approach focuses on the characteristics of jobs in seeking to identify wage disparities. A job content study could provide a measure of the value of various Federal jobs to the government and a corresponding comparison of the present grades or  salaries for those jobs. The General Accounting Office (GAO) believes that each approach has merit. Accordingly, in GAO's view, the most comprehensive and effective means through which to conduct a pay equity study at the Federal level would be to include both approaches. (Appendixes to the report include summaries of pay equity studies conducted in various states, legal issues, pay issues in the Federal service systems, and a list of organizations/individuals contacted and participants on panels for the formulation of this report.)

During the hearing, testimony was given from four panels of Vietnam-era veterans who represented a cross-section of those who served their country in that war. Some of the witnesses also represented veterans groups or worked in veterans programs or outreach centers. Minority veterans comprised two of the panels. During the hearing, witnesses testified about the many problems that Vietnam veterans face in attempting to get loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) to start or purchase a business. The problem is especially acute for minority veterans, according to the testimony, because they have less capital, or they have language barriers and nobody  in the SBA to speak their language (primarily Spanish), or they are the victims of prejudice. The veterans who testified cited the need for more outreach programs, more money for loans, and less red tape in the SBA in order to provide some economic opportunity to Vietnam veterans who thus far have been penalized for their service to their country.

        "description":"After Botswana became independent of British rule in 1966, a series of five-year plans for economic development were written and put into action. Education was always seen by development planners as essential for development; by 1977, the government was promoting education for human resource development. Every child in the country was to be given a good basic education in a primary school provided by the government. In 1977 the government also established the Department of Nonformal Education within the Ministry of Education to provide basic education to illiterate adults. Botswana's Third National Development Plan (1973-78) involved literacy programs in the development strategy of the country. 1980 was to be an experimental year when programs would be designed and put into  place, personnel would be trained, and materials would be produced and field tested. The goal was for the total eradication of illiteracy by 1985-86. However, leaders in the country did not make literacy education a priority, and little money was budgeted for the effort. Nevertheless, the educational structure is in place, with District Adult Education Officers and Literacy Assistants trained to implement the program. It is estimated that 65,000 persons have been served by the program, with 20,000 made literate. Much more work is left to be done to help the approximately 223,000 illiterates in the country. (KC)",

        "description":"A study examined programs and practices geared toward retraining middle-aged and older workers to cope with technological change. Literature pertaining to business and gerontology was reviewed, and interviews were conducted with managers responsible for the administration of 12 training and retraining programs across the country. Seven of the 12 programs examined were to be employer based. Generally, these programs were created for internal reasons associated with the immediate need to keep pace with the rapidly changing technologies of the given organization. Eligibility criteria for participation in the 12 programs appeared to have the potential for working for and against older workers; for example, years-of-service requirements favor older workers, whereas the administration  of screening tests might place older workers at a disadvantage inasmuch as their education is less recent than that of their younger co-workers. All 12 programs combined the use of lectures with either simulation or on-the-job training to retrain workers. Managers of the employer-based programs noted that their training programs benefited their organizations in a number of ways. Each manager interviewed planned to continue their organization's existing training program, adapting it to meet new needs and populations. (Appended to this report are case illustrations of the 12 organizations examined.) (MN)",

        "description":"A study examined national trends and state policy in Washington State pertaining to the administration and funding of area vocational skills centers. During the study, key persons associated with Washington's skills centers were interviewed and surveyed concerning the following areas: policy and planning, curriculum and instruction, student services, staff development, public relations, and financial support. The researchers concluded that with fine-tuning, the existing administrative procedures at Washington's seven vocational skills centers will be even more effective. Unless funding patterns were to change radically, administrative councils composed of participating superintendents should be retained. To maintain local options and flexibility, centers need only general  blueprints and technical assistance from the State; each center should be allowed to develop its own policy and procedure. The cooperative factor should be reinstated to allow sending districts to receive reimbursement for ongoing costs incurred by enabling students to attend an area center. State funds should be provided for replacement of equipment separate from funding available for new program start-up. Furthermore, the allowable hours for students attending skills centers should be increased from five to six per day. (Appendixes to this report contain a list of districts participating in skills centers, a list of 1984-1985 skills center offerings, and a summary of the survey findings.) (MN)",

Performance data were collected from soldiers in operational units and from soldiers attending One Station Unit Training (OSUT) in Armor Military Occupational Specialty (19E). Soldiers in the operational unit sample had been out of OSUT entry training for up to 72 months. Soldiers in the OSUT sample participated in a series of task learning trials for two tasks followed by a retention trial four weeks later. The operational unit soldiers took a one-time performance test on all eight tasks. Results were consistent with previous skill retention research. Multiple regression analysis was used to predict the slopes  of the retention function for each task for the combined sample. The prediction equation accounted for a large proportion of the variance when number of steps in the task, daily practice rate, and measures of complexity and interference were used as predictors of skill decay rate. Results of the OSUT, unit, and combined samples supported a representation of the skill retention curve in which rapid decay occurs soon after training with little change in performance for samples tested later.

        "description":"A study examined the impact of time allocation on the performance and satisfaction of special needs and nondisabled students enrolled in a vocational home economics community and home services program in one Ohio school district. During the study, researchers compared the performance and attitudes of disabled and nondisabled students enrolled in six community and home services classes taught by four different teachers in three schools. Three of the classes were 180 minutes in length (the current State mandate); in these control groups were 27 disabled and 17 nondisabled students. Three experimental groups of 34 special needs students were given classes of 135 minutes in length. Student achievement was measured by a paper-and-pencil cognitive test and by performance on five  selected tasks. Satisfaction was measured by questionnaires administered to students and by interviews conducted with classroom teachers. Although no statistically significant differences existed between the two groups with respect to task performance, the nondisabled learners did score significantly higher on the paper-and-pencil test. Students in both groups were generally satisfied with time allocations in their classes; moreover, the teachers interviewed felt that student learning would remain about the same whether or not current time allocations remained the same or were decreased.

        "description":"This booklet provides a brief overview of some of the major trends most likely to influence vocational education during the remainder of the 1980s. It is directed to all vocational educators, particularly planners and policymakers, who want a better understanding of the conditions under which their programs will operate. It considers the nation's economic and political climate, including these influences on the dollars available for vocational education: the stability of the dollar, phases of the business cycle, and competing demands for public funds. The impact of technology, especially robotics and office automation, is surveyed. Demographic changes in the population and labor force to which vocational education must adapt are examined, and job growth and openings are  projected. Trends in enrollments and funding for vocational education are then summarized. Finally, these implications for vocational education are advanced: shifts in curriculum emphasis, changes in instructional methods, and the redirection of vocational education and of the content of jobs due to increasing advances in new technology.

Diagnostic tests were administered to 800 vocational students to identify those with critical mathematics deficiencies. All instructors were taught interpretation techniques and provided resources for remediation. Twenty-three vocational shops used related mathematics text material to help students improve performance. Over 50 students with identified mathematics deficiencies were helped with the utilization of computers and remedial software. Student safety deficiencies were addressed by introducing extensive audiovisual material into regular vocational safety classes. The increased emphasis on safety instruction  also included the formation of safety committees with extensive student involvement. Improving student self-esteem was accomplished by acknowledging student achievement through publication of the vocational honor roll and youth organization publicity. (Supplementary materials include the Long Range Planning Strategy, a list of the computer software used, a list of mathematics books, and computer operating instructions for staff.) (YLB)",

        "description":"A review of research literature pertaining to locus of control in older adults and its application to social and educational settings indicates that reliable generalizations about the self-concept of older adults require a careful consideration of both personal and situational variables. Four separate processes are useful in understanding the formation of the self-concept in older adults: self-attribution, reflected appraisal, social comparison, and identification. Research relating personality factors to locus of control suggests that loss of control is often associated with feelings of helplessness and with physical decline and can even lead to learned helplessness. Mindlessness is another attribute frequently associated with age and occurs when cognitive activity is habitually  and automatically reduced. Research on cognitive and noncognitive interventions and educational outcomes, although not conclusive, does suggest that intervention with respect to cognitive performance in elderly individuals can be facilitated through training. Forms of therapy that provide adults with some sort of responsibility (such as horticulture or pet therapy) seem effective as well. One area that seems particularly promising is that of gerontological counseling. (MN)",

        "description":"Recent and projected advances in and commercial applications of lasers and laser technology were examined in order to assist vocational planners in responding to skill needs that will be created by lasers in the next few years. Until recently, most laser applications were in research and development settings; however, in the last several years lasers have gained widespread acceptance in such commercial settings as the manufacturing, medical, entertainment, printing, and communications industries. For the remainder of the decade, it is expected that commercial laser sales will average a 20 to 25 percent growth rate. The increasingly widespread application of lasers suggests that postsecondary schools may wish to begin programs to train laser electro-optics technicians (LEOTs).  Those planning such programs should be sure to identify employer demand for LEOTs, attain a strong financial commitment for equipment and facilities, and recruit qualified faculty. (MN)",

        "description":"Current efforts and methodologies to evaluate vocational education programs are plagued by a number of problems. Included among these are the following: disagreement over the primary role and function of vocational education, too great an emphasis on summative and product evaluation as well as on labor market outcomes as indicators of program effectiveness, insufficient consideration of the educational and community setting, and overreliance on positivist evaluation inquiry. A new approach is needed to overcome these problems and deficiencies. One such approach is that of critical evaluation. A method based on the assumption that persons bring different perceptions and vested interests concerning an issue to the evaluation process, critical evaluation is concerned with both the  process by which a decision is reached and the outcome or action itself. The critical evaluation approach directly addresses the issues raised by individuals in the local setting as being necessary for program change and relies upon quantitative and qualitative data to develop action plans and change strategies for program improvement.

        "description":"Two factors likely to have an impact upon vocational education are the career plans of high school seniors and recent immigration into the United States. Analysis of recent literature pertaining to these two issues reveals that the educational reform movement is affecting all secondary education, with 45 States having already increased their requirements for high school graduation and 3 more considering similar action. The number of high school seniors who planned to acquire a bachelor's degree declined in the 1970s. Although undocumented aliens receive most of the attention, it was estimated that at least twice as many documented as undocumented aliens were residing in the United States at the time of the 1980 census. These factors make it imperative that vocational education  demonstrate its contribution to the attainment of broad educational goals or risk being squeezed from the secondary curriculum. If fewer high school graduates go on to college and fewer acquire vocational training in high school, it is likely that enrollments in postsecondary vocational programs will increase dramatically in coming years. Major efforts must be directed toward improving the employment preparation of minority teenagers from disadvantaged families. (MN)",

Male (N=184) and female (N=221) students of a rural Maine high school responded to a questionnaire designed to examine sex differences in interactions between adolescents and their grandparents. The results showed that female grandchildren were more likely than male grandchildren to have learned a specific skill from grandparents, but there were no significant differences between male and female grandchildren on six other types of interactions: doing work for grandparents, having personal conversations with grandparents, talking about family history, grandparents telling stories about adolescents' parents, grandparents  and grandchildren going on trips together, and grandparents giving advice. Female adolescents were no more likely than male adolescents to report being encouraged by parents to visit or talk to grandparents. Adolescents of both sexes reported that the majority of skills learned from grandparents had been taught by a same-sexed grandparent, and sex of grandparents was a stronger predictor of skill transmission than was maternal or paternal lineage. The specific types of skills learned from grandparents were largely in conformity with current sex role stereotypes. Eighteen reference items are listed. (Author/NRB)",

The relationship between adjustment and biosocial, demographic, social, and personal problems, political participation, retirement, income, and other pertinent variables was investigated along with interactions by gender. Biosocial (health and physical disabilities), social isolation, housing, feelings about work and retirement, and social control all contributed significantly to adjustment. Sex role interacted with social isolation, biosocial factors, and retirement, but there were no significant differences  among most demographic variables, perceived personal problems, and self-reported social-personality factors. Health, retirement, marriage, and income played a more important role in psychological well-being for women than for men; the women respondents were older, more likely to be unmarried, and had much lower incomes than men. For both sexes, personal problems played a major role in maladjustment. Some sex differences were found in self-reported levels of health, number of physicians seen in the past year, religiosity, and feeling part of the neighborhood. All of these factors were more important in the negative affect of women than of men. (NRB)",

To suggest variables predictive of in-hospital discharge planning, and of emotional well-being after a severe incident of ill health, the Posthospital Support Study examined emotional well-being among elderly patients (N=132) who had been hospitalized for arteriosclerotic heart disease or for an operation following hip fracture or for replacement of a hip joint. These conditions were chosen because patients required some help or services from others (both formal and informal) after hospital discharge. Patients were interviewed just prior to hospital discharge and again within three months, on the  average, after discharge to the community. Emotional well-being was measured by the Bradburn Affect Balance Score and anxiety and depression were measured by the Profile of Mood States. Additional data were obtained from hospital medical records, informal interviews with hospital staff, and caregiver (N=80) interviews. The results showed that only the indicators of health and severity of problems directly predicted well-being. Ill health was associated with and predictive of a poorer mood state. Severity of health problems predicted negative mood in the form of high anxiety. Some measures of poor health predicted lessened emotional well-being. The provision of services, formal or informal, did not compensate for or relieve poorer physical health or more severe health problems; rather,  these services appeared to be indicators of need.

        "description":"Although there is consensus in the mental health literature that women report more distress and depressive symptoms than men, it is not clear if this applies to all age groups. To examine the relationship of gender and distress among older adults, two methods were employed. First, a review was conducted of all random community surveys conducted since 1950, which included older adults and reported prevelance rates by age and gender. Results showed almost as many studies (9) providing evidence of no differences or more male distress, as studies verifying more reported female distress (10). In the second approach, interviews were conducted with a random probability sample of 476 older adults living in Middlesex County, New Jersey, including 163 bereaved persons whose spouse died 6  to 24 months prior to the interview, and 313 persons with no known recent stressful life events. Psychological distress was measured by the Johns Hopkins Symptom Checklist and a modified version of the General Well Being Scale. Data analysis revealed that on five measures of distress, gender generally was not related to either moderate or severe distress symptoms for bereaved or non-bereaved respondents. For community respondents, there were no significant gender differences for individual symptoms, nor was gender significantly correlated with any of the symptom scales. The data did not support the view that older women are more distressed than older men. (Appendix A provides detailed information on the 13 studies reviewed for the first section of the research.

        "description":"The transition to junior high school can be a positive step toward increasing maturity, and a stressful period of adaptation as well. To investigate the contribution of friendships to children's adjustment after the transition to junior high school, students (N=101) from four elementary schools were tested during the spring of sixth grade, in the fall of seventh grade at the junior high school, and in the spring of seventh grade. Measures of adjustment, self-esteem, school attitudes, and friendships were obtained from structured questionnaires, individual interviews, teacher ratings, and school records. Scores on the Perceived Competence Scale, social self-esteem subscale, decreased significantly after the transition to junior high school, and did not increase between fall and  spring of seventh grade. Attitudes toward school as measured by the Classroom Environment Scale also decreased during the transition and did not improve in later testing. Student responses to open-ended questions about their feelings toward junior high improved from spring of sixth grade to fall of seventh grade. Although students reported fewer close friendships after the transition than before, the quality of student friendships seemed to increase after the transition. There were no significant correlations between friendship stability and the measures of adjustment, but there were significant correlations between measures of friends' contact and closeness and measures of adjustment. The findings suggest that the formation of close friendships during the early part of seventh grade  could contribute to students' adjustment. Thirteen references are listed. (NRB)",

        "description":"Values enter into the consideration of chronic care options at both the macro, or policy level, and at the individual, decision making level. The ethical dimensions of these decisions, however, have been largely overlooked. A model of long-term care (LTC) decision making is proposed which incorporates an empirical foundation into an ethical framework. It begins with the assumption that there are three relevant parties, the elderly person, his or her family, and the professional provider group. The model allows for conflict which arises from the implicit consideration of one party's values by another party in the decision making process. In order to investigate the accuracy and relevance of this model for application in actual cases of LTC decision making, a pilot project was  developed in which participants were interviewed during or shortly after their involvement in an LTC decision. Interviews were completed with 15 family decision makers, five of the impaired individuals, and, in five cases, with the primary physician. In order to identify value-based conflicts that arise in LTC decision making, open ended interview schedules specific to each of the three parties were developed. Four moral principles were found to be relevant to the determination of what is in an elderly person's best interests for the satisfaction of needs, the amelioration of risks, and securing benefits of LTC. These four principles: beneficence (maximally satisfying need and producing benefit at the lowest possible risk), respect for autonomy, filial responsibility, and justice,  together constitute an ethical framework for LTC decision making for the elderly. This framework expands the context in which students of gerontology and practitioners of geriatrics should understand the process of LTC decision making, and shows it to be a process inescapably marked by moral conflict.

        "description":"Earlier research has shown that young adults exhibit less favorable reactions to older speakers than to peers, especially on the competence dimension. To examine the role of speaker effectiveness in modifying evaluations of younger and older adults, undergraduates (N=80) received a map of a hospital floor plan and listened to either an effective or an ineffective taped text describing a route on the map. Texts were read by older and younger adult males. Subjects estimated the speaker's age and rated the speaker on accuracy of directions, competence, benevolence, social class, perceived belief similarity, and social distance. Results showed that along the competence dimension, the overwhelming difference in communication effectiveness was the only significant factor. Thus,  concrete information about an individual's abilities largely outweighed any initial impressions related to age stereotyping. Along the benevolence dimension, however, communication ineffectiveness did not lead to significantly less favorable benevolence judgments of older adults. For this second key interpersonal dimension, age stereotyping did attenuate the influence of communication performance. This influence occurred even though speakers were perceived, on the average, to be middle-aged. The particular downgrading of the young ineffective speaker was as predicted. Contrary to expectation, no evidence for upgrading the older effective speaker was observed. (NRB)",

Current efforts emphasize direct questioning of the child and quantification of parents' observations. One scale used to study childhood depression, the Personality Inventory for Children (PIC), correlates with many of the characteristics associated with childhood depression. A cluster analysis of 1,800 PIC profiles has revealed 11 replicated patterns or profile types. The PIC Depression scale enters into the identification of three of these types. The first, Type 3 Profile, suggests a child or adolescent with chronic cognitive deficits and academic failure who has difficulty adjusting to change. For  these children the Depression scale reflects the effect of social incompetence. The Type 7 Profile represents a combination of depression and externalization symptomatology. These children are often angry or insecure, have poor relations with their parents, and often come from disrupted, chaotic families. Type 9 Profile children are likely to be referred for help due to an observed disturbance of mood and/or somatic complaints. These children feel competitive or angry with siblings and depend on parents who are often viewed as clinically depressed and in need of individual treatment.

The adaptive implications of sex role orientation were examined on constructs reflecting intrapersonal functioning, i.e., ego identity achievement, mood, actual-ideal self-concept congruence, and cognitive complexity. Male (N=92) and female (N=94) college students completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory, the Ego Identity Achievement Scale, a form of the Rep Grid, and a mood self-report item. To test among the four formulations and to allow a more precise comparison of the effects of gender and sex role on the adaptation measures, six groups were formed: masculine males,  androgynous males, feminine males, masculine females, androgynous females, and feminine females. Although the masculine male group showed the most effective functioning on the adaptation measures, the feminine female group showed the least effective functioning, indicating lack of support for the traditional formulation of sex typing for both genders. The formulation that psychological androgyny is most adaptive for both genders was not supported, since the androgynous male group consistently showed the least effective functioning on all adaptation measures. The formulation of a gender by sex role interaction in adaptation, with an advantage of androgyny for females was not supported since the female androgynous and female masculine groups performed equally efficiently. The formulation  that level of masculinity is the most important determinant of adaptation for both genders was provided considerable support. (NRB)",

Teams competed against one another by developing various business strategies and carrying them out within the computer simulated game. Success  was defined as the net profit and capital stock and surplus over eight \"quarters\" of the game. Regression analyses indicated that multidimensional achievement motivation, need for power and influence, and needs for external reinforcement had complex relations to success at various periods of the game. Results from the initial stages of the game were similar to those reported for survey data of owner/operators of businesses in the field. Differences between the patterns for male and female subjects were found which require additional study both within controlled laboratory settings and in field research with successful male and female entrepreneurs.

        "description":"Previous studies of the relationship between employee participation in decision making and job satisfaction have conceptualized degree of participation as the number of decisions one influences (scope). To explore another dimension of participation--degree of influence--a model was used which emphasizes the balance between how much influence individuals have on the job and the amount they would like to have. Employees (N=760) from 11 divisions of a large western electronics manufacturer were surveyed. Two indices of degree of influence and a four-item scale of overall job satisfaction were used. Three states of balance (saturation, equilibrium, and deprivation), and three categories of desired and perceived influence (high, medium, low) were studied. Results showed that the more  influence employees felt they had, the more satisfied they were with their job. Individuals at an equilibrium state of balance were found to report the highest degree of job satisfaction. The larger the discrepency between desired and available influence, the lower the reported job satisfaction. The present study suggests that a match between the individual's desire for participation and the permitted participation will lead to the most positive reactions to the job. (LLL)",

        "description":"A cognitive-structural model for counselor supervision, derived from advances in cognitive psychology, is proposed for facilitating trainee conceptual development and self-efficacy. Within the model, there are recommendations for matching structure in the supervisory relationship to the conceptual complexity and self-efficacy levels of the counselor-in-training. Matching is accomplished through strategies designed to strengthen conceptual schemata and enhance communication, such as empathy and self-as-a-model, and to create cognitive dissonance and promote conceptual development, such as confrontation and dialectic. Cognitive-structural supervision is discussed in terms of personal practice theory construction. The Freud-Jung relationship is treated as an example of an  incompletely developed supervisory relationship. The ultimate aid of supervision according to the proposed approach is existential-developmental collaboration and equity in supervision. (Author)",

        "description":"Little research has been conducted with adult students to identify their counseling needs. To investigate whether adult student perceptions of counseling needs are related to their developmental stage, and their relative importance, 878 community college students, who were 18 years of age and older, and who attended evening and weekend classes were surveyed. A demographic information sheet and survey of student counseling needs were administered in packet form by the regular class instructors. The results indicated that respondents across developmental, sex, marital, and employment status groups tended to endorse the same 12 needs, although their rank-ordering varied. There were few differences in the perceptions of needs between younger, traditional students and older,  nontraditional students. Younger students assigned greater importance to choosing academic courses and programs, identifying financial aid sources, improving job seeking skills, and coping with leisure time. The older adult students reported greater need of coping with parenting difficulties. The middle groups, those aged 23-27 and 28-37, did not differ much from the younger students. Although the results of this study do not support the existence of many differences in the perceived counseling needs of traditional young adult and nontraditional, older adult students, the findings suggest that detailed analysis of specific subgroups may be warranted in future studies and program planning.

        "description":"While many studies have documented the negative consequences of excessive television watching, few behavioral programs have investigated techniques for reducing television viewing. A 13-year-old girl who watched from 6 to 9 hours of television daily was provided a behavioral program featuring a token-actuated timer in an attempt to reduce her television viewing time. Baseline data were obtained from parent reports of viewing time for 7 days, and by timer assessed viewing patterns for 10 days. This was followed by a 10-day interval when tokens to be used with the timer were earned by prosocial activities. Each token activated the television for 30 minutes. Immediate reductions in television viewing were found when the child was on the token exchange system. During a 9-day return  to baseline phase, increases in viewing were noted, and reductions again occurred with re-exposure to the token condition for 45 days. Following this more extensive intervention, improvement was maintained during the subsequent return to baseline phase. At a 6-month follow-up, when the token-actuated meter was re-attached to the television and the child was given free access to tokens, the child averaged 2.1 hours of television viewing per day.

Cultural norms, help-seeking and help-giving behaviors, and personal values have all been studied as factors in successful lifestyle changes. In this study, subjects (N=119) recruited in an airport waiting area described their health change efforts over the previous year by completing a survey of personal data, health change history, social support, and a cultural norm indicator. Over half (52.1 percent) of the subjects were successful in establishing their health practices. Social support was found to facilitate health change efforts, but only when group norms also  supported the health change. High personal priority for the health change and giving help to others were also related to successful change. Prior attempts to change, medical imperatives for change, help seeking, and participation in formal health programs were not associated with success. The results suggest that congruent social norms may be quite important in achieving health changes. A four-page bibliography is included. (Author/NRB)",

To explore what mechanism may be responsible for restraint effects, college students in two samples (Total N=378) completed the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TEQ), a restraint scale consisting of three factors: cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and hunger sensitivity. Data analysis revealed a small inverse correlation between cognitive restraint and hunger sensitivity. Hunger sensitivity was strongly correlated with disinhibition, while there was no correlation between cognitive restraint and disinhibition. In a second study, normal weight female college students completed the TEQ. Afterwards, subjects' moods were  manipulated using the Velten Mood Induction Procedure and subjects were given candies to eat while completing the Velten procedure. Although interim data on 47 subjects from this 2 (hunger sensitivity level) by 2 (neutral or depressed mood) factorial study appeared to show an interaction, with depressed high hunger sensitivity subjects eating approximately three times as much as other subjects, the level of variability in eating was very high and the interaction was not statistically significant. The results did suggest that hunger sensitivity may be a predictor of negative affect eating. (NRB)",

        "description":"Research into the decisionmaking process of families faced with investigating alternatives to institutionalizing frail aged members could yield valuable information for service planners and providers. To analyze the extent to which its original service plan remained responsive to the changing needs of the frail elderly service population, interviews were conduted with 36 family caregivers who contacted the Council for Jewish Elderly (CJE) for planning assistance in selecting alternatives to permanent institutionalization of their frail elderly relatives. Analysis of interview data revealed six alternatives most frequently considered by families: long-term care, companions, supportive congregate housing, counseling, in-home services, and independent housing. Companions and  supportive congregate housing services were not provided by CJE. The data on barriers to successful attainment of preferred services indicated that one in four families had sought alternatives which they reported were unavailable, and 35.3 percent reported cost as a barrier to services. Over half of the respondents indicated that some option mentioned by the CJE social worker had been unfamiliar to them. Some respondents reported that their elderly relatives had refused at least one option which the caregiver had considered, and some level of conflict between the caregiver and the elder was present in 61.5 percent of the families. In response to these findings, CJE has begun a planning effort to analyze further how the needs for companion and supportive congregate living characterizing  the sample, and the population it represented, could best be addressed.

        "description":"In the Double ABCX Model, family stress is defined as an imbalance in demands (the A factor: stressor event, related hardships, prior strains), and capabilities or resources (the B factor). The family's definition (C factor) of the imbalance influences its impact. When the family is unable to balance demands and capabilities without making a change in its structure and interaction patterns, a crisis (X) occurs. The Double ABCX Model as a theory of family stress presents some problems: unclear definitions of concepts; a structural, static model; and the fact that the theory is actually not a theory, but a scale model. These conceptual and theoretical weaknesses limit the usefulness of this model. Potential solutions to some of these problems can be found in a transactional  paradigm which represents human behavior as a relational process between the person and the environment, and which captures the dynamic process of response to stress. Family paradigms as regulators of family-environment transactions, stages of the coping process, and variables affecting coping are promising areas of study. (NRB)",

The five most prevalent drugs, in order of frequency of mention, were marijuana, cocaine, stimulants, tranquilizers, and hallucinogens. Marijuana was believed to have been grown illicitly in over 60 percent of the reported districts, and illicit drug manufacture was believed to have occurred in nearly half the districts. Schools, streets, and workplaces were seen as the primary locations at  which drugs were abused; schools, streets, parks, and public facilities for entertainment and sports were most frequently cited as trafficking locales. Crimes committed by drug users and juvenile behavior problems were most often perceived as the major problems resulting from drug abuse. Respondents stated that their constituents appeared to express the need for better drug abuse prevention/education programs and for improved drug law enforcement and prosecution capabilities.

Statements are given from an executive involved in a television special about incest, a victim of abuse, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, and representatives from a victim witness program, the United Way, the National Conference of Catholic Charities, and the Police Executive Research Forum. Prepared statements, letters, and supplemental materials are included from these witnesses, other congressmen and senators, and from representatives of the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. An increase in reported cases of family violence in recent years and the need for more resources to deal with  this problem are described. Practical steps to help police departments prevent such violence are discussed; stricter arrest and prosecution policies, improved training programs for police officers, and referrals to battered women shelters and abuser programs are suggested. Allocation of United Way funds to child and adult abuse prevention efforts are outlined. Treatment and prevention programs to combat physical and sexual abuse of children and vulnerable adults are described and difficulties faced by these programs are reviewed. The need for federal legislation to help prevent family violence and for adequate services to family violence victims and their children is emphasized. (NRB)",

To provide federal and state agency planners with information about research, trends, and issues in coordinating youth services at the state level, a three-phase research study was undertaken. First, coordination literature was reviewed and analyzed to extract key principles about the nature and success of coordination mechanisms. Second, a national survey of states (phone and mail) was conducted to identify and examine state level coordination of youth services and juvenile delinquency programs. Third, case studies were prepared on four states' efforts (New York, North Carolina,  Alabama, and Maryland) to coordinate services in order to capture key elements of past experience that could guide future thinking and practice. Chapters 2-5 of this report detail the findings of these research efforts. Thirteen data tables are included to summarize the findings of the literature review and the state survey. The case studies describe the development, organizational structure, specific services, coordination mechanisms, and current issues and future plans for each of the four states. The three appendices provide the state-level survey questionnaire, a list of survey respondents with addresses, and a list of those who contributed to the case studies. (MCF)",

        "description":"The immediate family of an elderly person is often a major social support, and the major responsibility for care of the aged has fallen traditionally to female family members. Since more women today are working, they may have less time for such family responsibilities. To examine the effects of daughters' employment on their helping behaviors toward elderly parents, data from a sample of adults (N=321) living in a rural transitional area were analyzed. Only respondents with daughters were included. Parents (N=142) completed questionnaires covering general information, work and retirement, health, family, activities and roles, and subjective well-being. A multiple regression analysis of data revealed that employment patterns of daughters were of no relative importance to the  helping behaviors given to older parents, when several physical and social variables were controlled (sex, age, marital status, self-perceived health, parent's ability to get around; residential propinquity; filial expectations; and daughter's marital status). Marital status of the parent and filial expectations had a positive relationship with helping behaviors given by daughters, while residential propinquity and the parent's ability to get around were inversely related to helping behaviors.

The coping style differences between Hispanic and Anglo clients and the treatment style differences between Hispanic and Anglo workers were examined through structured interviews with 15 clients and 5 workers at a predominantly Hispanic site, and with 15 clients and 5 workers at a predominantly Anglo site. Differences were found between Hispanic and Anglo sites in terms of sociodemographic characteristics of the clients, client coping styles, and worker treatment styles. The data related to client coping style showed that the Anglos were somewhat more agency-oriented than the Hispanics but the report showed  no appreciable ethnic difference in level of informal support. Both groups expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of familial supports. The data related to worker treatment style suggested that certain features of a case management project made it more effective and culturally relevant to the Hispanic elderly. Those features included the emphasis on paraprofessional involvement, the advocacy role of the agency, the enhancement of the client's informal support system, involvement in atypical functions, and intense case involvement.

Subjects completed the Emotional Expressiveness Scale, answering questions about love, anger, happiness, and sadness; they also designated the target person to whom these emotions were directed by checking responses for people, spouse, or child. The results indicated that females from both SES groups were more expressive in the emotions of happiness and sadness. High SES females appeared to be the most expressive of all groups. Individuals in the  high SES group were significantly more expressive of anger to people and to their spouses, and more expressive of sadness to spouses than were low SES individuals. Low SES females were more expressive of happiness to people than were high SES males. All groups exhibited significantly greater expression of all emotions, except anger, to family members than to non-family members.

An alternative scoring procedure was designed for the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ) to examine the relationships betwen social network structure, types of social support, and determinants of support satisfaction. Undergraduates (N=198) responded to questions presenting situations for which people might need support and listed those people whom they could rely on for support, their relationship to those people, and their rating of satisfaction with the support they receive. The SSQ was scored to yield the number of social network members in different relationship categories for each of the support eliciting questions. Subjects' social  networks consisted of nuclear family, other family, friends, and others. Satisfaction with support was positively related to the proportion of the network occupied by nuclear family, and negatively related to the proportion of friends in the network. Students did not turn to different network sectors for different types of social support. This investigation found a significant difference in results depending upon method of analysis, suggesting that researchers interested in studying the relationships between social network characteristics, type of social support, and support satisfaction might productively analyze the nature of the specific relationships in each subject's supportive network.

The present research used meta-analytic techniques to examine the race effect size for objective measures of performance and to compare the relationship between effect sizes for objective indices and subjective ratings. Fifty-three studies were located that included at least one objective index of actual performance, absenteeism or cognitive test performance and one subjective measure of performance for the same group of black and white employees. The corrected average effect sizes across the 53 studies were relatively low but quite similar for the objective and subjective  criteria. Moderating effects for the objective criteria were found as race effects were much higher for cognitive than for performance criteria. Subjective ratings had a lower effect size than objective cognitive test scores but were higher than comparable objective performance indices. The implications of the results for personnel research practices were discussed and the need for a better understanding of the constructs underlying criterion measures were emphasized. (Author)",

Data from a systematic survey of 500 public and private providers of health promotion services in northern Virginia were examined to see whether and to what extent services were targeted to specific user groups. Primary services were offered by 163 agencies in at least one of seven areas: alcohol/drug abuse, smoking, high blood pressure, fitness, weight control/nutrition, accident prevention, and health education. Health promotion was the primary goal in 29 of these agencies, mostly in the area of alcohol and drug abuse. Among public and private  non-profit agencies, the concentration of services across risk categories was fairly even, with the exception of lower counts for smoking cessation, stress management, and mental health promotion. Among private for-profit agencies, services reported most frequently related to either weight control and nutrition or stress management. Services (N=40) which had specified target user groups were generally nutrition or physical fitness programs for the elderly or recreation programs for the handicapped.

Methods of structural analysis were applied to the problem of the relationships among variables thought to influence the health status of college students. Data were collected from 365 students on personal characteristics, physical features of their college residences, the perceived social climate of the residences, psychological distress, and health status. Canonical correlation analyses reduced the data to five indicators representing four factors: dormitory size, the degree of perceived influence and social support in the dormitory, and reports of academic pressure and physical symptoms. Four sets of  structured equations, representing alternative causal models of the interrelationships among those variables, were tested for goodness-of-fit to the observed data. The first three models were based on the assumption of unidirectional causation. The best-fitting model was Model 4 which included a direct link from perceived influence to physical symptoms and an added reciprocal causal link between psychological distress and physical symptoms. Conclusions drawn about the relationships among the variables examined in Model 4 emphasized the important role played by perceptions of personal control in self-evaluations of health status.

Data were obtained from divorcing couples with minor children: 40 couples had decided that sole custody would go to the mother (traditional); 7 couples had decided on joint custody, and 1 couple had decided on split custody (nontraditional). Subjects participated in structured interviews and completed questionnaires regarding the nature and importance of the criteria that had influenced their custody decisions. Demographic information about the couples submitted to a one-way analysis of variance by custody type revealed no significant differences between the groups in age, education, number of children, and income while married. More often in nontraditional custody  decisions, the wife was more interested in obtaining the divorce than the husband and the post-divorce financial resources were greater. The results on decision-making suggested that couples choosing different custody arrangements used slightly different criteria. Parents who decided on traditional mother custody were most concerned about parental responsibility, the quality of the parent-child relationship, the emotional stability of the parent, the parent's desire for custody, and parenting skills. Parents who decided on nontraditional custody arrangements gave less emphasis to responsibility functions and more emphasis to the importance of parent's values and lifestyle being suited to childrearing.

Context changes in adolescence are examined in the family, peer groups, schools, and society. Three categories of psychopathology in adolescence are presented as the most common examples: anxiety, depression, and conduct disorders. A model for the  development of psychopathology in adolescence is discussed which integrates the evidence from adolescent development as well as psychopathology. Several key features in the development of adolescent psychopathology are considered. These include the individual's coping skills; the dangers of maladaptive, regressive coping styles; biological components of psychopathology; individual characteristics which may elicit psychopathology; eliciting factors of the social context; the cumulative process; risk and protective factors; and stressful life events.

An ICPS model for older children was implemented with 202 low SES fifth graders to test whether ICPS skills function as significant behavior mediators at that age. A series of 55 age-appropriate lesson-games were created for use by classroom teachers to enhance students' ability to apprehend the perspective of others (role-taking) and their problem solving skills. These skills included alternative solution thinking, consequential thinking, and means-ends thinking. The findings following 15 weeks of training indicated that overall  gains in ICPS, but not multiple perspective-taking scores, correlated with gains in behavior, and most consistently with positive, prosocial behaviors in both boys and girls. In both sexes, it was an improvement in number and range of solutions that best related to these behavior gains, and most consistently to teacher ratings of concern for others, peer sociability, and the degree to which the child was liked by peers. In boys only, gains in consequential and means-ends skills also related to prosocial change.

        "description":"Although recent survey findings have indicated a decrease in the percentage of teenage smokers, cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. A social learning smoking prevention intervention, consisting of four sessions which occurred at 2-week intervals, was conducted with fifth and sixth graders in two school systems. Schools were randomly assigned to intervention (N=476 students) or control (N=392 students) conditions. Students in the intervention groups learned about the physiological effects of cigarette smoking, the pressures which influence adolescents to smoke, ways to resist peer pressures, and the techniques of cigarette advertising. All students were pretested at the beginning of the first study year and  posttested at the end of that school year and the beginning of the next school year. The results indicated a significant treatment x sex x occasion interaction with respect to experimentation with cigarettes; and a significant treatment x school system x occasion interaction with respect to recent cigarette smoking. The intervention was effective in reducing the prevalence of experimentation with cigarettes among boys, but not among girls, in both school systems; and was effective in reducing the onset of more frequent smoking among both sexes in one school system, but not in the other. Social learning intervention may not be effective in schools where a certain threshold level of smoking has been reached. (NRB)",

The role that alcohol plays in adult society is presented and its potential danger for causing teenage alcohol addiction is considered. A discussion on why some teenagers abuse alcohol focuses on familial, peer, sociocultural, environmental, personality, and behavioral influences. Fourteen specific behaviors and characteristics which may be symptomatic of alcohol or drug abuse in students are identified. The literature and research in the areas of the current legal drinking age controversy, the problem of teenage drinking and driving, and the sometimes lethal result of mixing alcohol and other drugs are reviewed to help educators become better informed about issues impinging directly or indirectly on  teenage alcohol use and abuse. Finally, the role of the school in the education, prevention, and treatment of adolescent alcohol use and abuse is considered in view of the many potential individual and societal problems caused by alcohol.

        "description":"The concept of scaffolding can be used as a framework to argue that a \"rich interpretation\" in child language is needed in the area of early literacy learning. Child language is the reading-like text language of \"prereading\" kindergarten children. Two threads (internal and external) of the scaffolding process have been identified. The external thread describes how the linguistic community arranges speech encounters so that the young speaker can get a hold on how to make his or her intentions clear and how to penetrate the intentions of others. The internal thread is concerned with how communicative intent is successively transformed through negotiation into increasingly powerful linguistic procedures. After reading picture storybooks to kindergarten children, the children were  invited to \"read\" the books. The readings indicated that children are active learners and that as the children continue to read, they construct texts that are closer to the structure the author has used. These findings suggest that the definition of reading needs to be expanded and perhaps even altered, and that what young children should and could be doing in the name of reading should be reconsidered. (Excerpts of some of the children's \"readings,\" and analyses of these readings are included.) (DF)",

The five experimental programs involved in the study were assigned to second grade classrooms in four Utah school districts. Students in both experimental and control classrooms were  administered pre- and posttests in reading, vocabulary, reading comprehension, phonics, self image, and interest in reading. Reading vocabulary and reading comprehension were tested using the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, Level B, Form 1. The findings suggest that by involving students in a lot of noninstructional reading and by using: (1) an analytical/synthetic decoding approach; (2) phonics to identify words not recognizable on sight; (3) heterogeneous grouping; and (4) children's literature rather than basal readers, student reading achievement is significantly greater than it is for those taught by traditional methods.

During occasional fixations, all letters to the left of the directly fixated letter or all letters more than four to the right of the fixated letter were replaced by other letters. This replacement occurred either for only the first ms. of the fixation or only after the first 100 ms. of the fixation. The eye  movement data indicated that the eyes can respond to change in the visual stimulus within less than 100 ms., and to orthographic irregularity in the text within less than 160 ms. No evidence was found for a left-to-right attentional scan during a fixation. The findings suggest that the response time of the eyes is shorter than usually proposed in theories of visual processing, and that eye movement decisions are made later in the fixation than has often been assumed. In addition, they show that much of the processing takes place too late to affect the immediately following saccade and hence is revealed only later in the eye movement pattern. Thirty-six references are listed. (Author/FL)",

This was done by occasionally removing the text during reading and having the reader report the last word that had been read. Distributions of the locations of the last word read, in relation to the location of the last word on which the eyes were centered prior to the text's disappearance, served as data and were compared for different conditions. The first study compared these distributions when the text disappeared during rather than following a fixation and when the text was simply blanked out rather than being replaced by a masking pattern. The second study  manipulated the time during the fixation at which the text disappeared, and the third study replicated results from the earlier studies. Results showed that, on the one hand, the last word reported as having been read was most commonly the word fixated during the last fixation, or the word to the right of it. On the other hand, the responses were not restricted to these two word locations. Thus, the data did not support an anticipation model of reading nor the acquisition of peripheral cues concerning upcoming words. (HOD)",

        "description":"The comprehension of written stories starts with learning to comprehend everyday situations, but it is the child's direct experiences with written stories that bring the process to fruition. These direct experiences with stories are generally of two types. Initially there is a storybook time, the occasions upon which a literate person, usually the mother, and the child engage in an act of communication with a book as the focus of the interaction. As the child becomes familiar with reading books through story time, the child experiences written story in another way--the independent reenactments of familiar books. The general description of the means by which storybook time helps the child learn to comprehend written stories is L. S. Vygotsky's notion of development from  interpsychological functioning (the parent and the child jointly construct the story) to intrapsychological functioning (the child is able to construct, or comprehend, the story individually). Classrooms should be places where children experience stories. To ensure that children begin very early on to learn to comprehend written language, the teacher can offer the children story experiences through group storybook readings, lap reading, repeated readings, and opportunities for independent reenactments. Included are a three-page bibliography and five transcripts of mother-child interactions during the reading of five stories. (HOD)",

Also, the relatively high level of agreement between  the trainees and both experts suggests the instrument was easy to learn to use.

Goals of the effort were to improve reading and listening comprehension instruction and to improve program consistency across grades, schools, and areas. The first full year of data collection for the reading program was 1982-83. During that year the focus of study centered on descriptive information about the characteristics of reading instruction and problems in the implementation process in the study schools. A sample of 20 elementary schools was selected for the reading study and stratified on the basis of achievement level and length of time the school had been exposed to IPR/LA.  Study findings indicated that while some teachers were able to implement the revised curriculum in a number of areas, some serious problems still remained. Further, the program was not implemented for students at all achievement levels. In addition, no consistent criteria were in use system-wide to monitor program implementation. Neither the training nor the materials provided to schools to support the implementation process were perceived as adequate. Finally, the role of the reading teacher appeared to have changed, which created role conflicts for some school-based reading teachers.

The researcher was observed 32 times during the year; field notes were taken and lessons were audio tape recorded and/or video recorded and then transcribed. Answers were sought for the following research questions: (1) What characterizes the research participant's explanations during reading instruction? (2) What characterizes the teacher-student interactions during the research participant's instruction? (3) How were the lessons organized? (4) Is there any evidence regarding the  effectiveness of explanation in creating student outcomes? Results of the study have provided rich descriptive data to conceptualize the nature of instructional explanation, including three aspects of instructional explanation that go beyond a simple concept of expository teacher talk. Data revealed no relationship between instruction and student gains, and a disparity between what the research participant did when explaining as a practicing teacher and the way he conceptualized explanation behavior for his methods-course students. The findings suggest that instruction is much more complex than models, opinion, or much of the previous research have indicated, and that theoretical models of instruction have little or no reliability as far as identification of essential and critical  variables.

        "description":"Since 1965, first through Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and now through Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, funds have been allocated to supplement regular classroom instruction for children achieving below grade level. Together, Title I and Chapter 1 form a 20-year continuum of a concentrated, sharply focused effort against the sources of educational failure. In Ohio the program is in place in 99% of the state's 616 school districts. Among those helped by the program are migrant children as well as handicapped, neglected, and delinquent youths. In this program, the children typically receive 30 to 45 minutes of individualized reading or mathematics instruction each day. Emphasis is on having the children work independently at  their own speed. They are tested at the beginning and at the end of the school year, after which many are able to leave the program because they are ready to keep up with their regular classes. School districts are helped in implementing the program by consultants from the Ohio Department of Education's Division of Federal Assistance. Parents contribute by participating in parent advisory councils and helping with Chapter 1 classes. (FL)",

Based on the children's readings and on their answers to questions concerning the text, five problem areas were identified: (1) poor decoding or word attack skills (2) conscious decoding or poor reading fluency, (3) unfamiliar syntactic structures, (4) insufficient vocabularies, and (5) insufficient background knowledge. The study concludes that an interaction of reader and text characteristics may cause a young reader's processing system to become overloaded and that comprehension failure will result. It recommends a two strand system of reading instruction: a daily reading assignment of an interesting  but conceptually easy selection, and regular presentation of conceptually more difficult selections grouped around similar knowledge domains.

Specifically, the study examined children's exposure to and participation in the creative, verbal street game called &quot;sounding&quot; or &quot;playing the dozens,&quot; and it studied the effects of a program of creative writing instruction provided by visiting writers. The results indicated that the special instruction tended to improve the figurative language comprehension of the children. Also, those children who frequently engaged in sounding  comprehended figurative language better than those who did not. This latter effect could not be accounted for by differences in general language ability. It was concluded that the use of figurative language in sounding did enhance black school children's ability to understand the more literary uses of metaphor and simile encountered in the classroom.

        "description":"Intensive peer review is a method of teaching expository writing developed two years ago by A. N. Doane and now used extensively in freshman expository writing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Students meet regularly in groups of four three times a week over the course of the term to share and critique each other's writing. The instructor does relatively little direct instruction, and intervention in these groups is minimal. Students taught by peer review make more progress in writing because they see revision as a matter of reconceptualization rather than editing, view their readers as collaborators in a process of communication rather than as judges, give more emphasis to prewriting, have more positive attitudes about writing, and view their composing process as a  process of improvization and experimentation with ideas and text. Talking about writing can help students learn to write because in a good group there will be (1) a collective examination of written texts, (2) a tendency to dwell on the writer's purpose and its articulation with the resulting focus on the sources of trouble and uncertainties of text, (3) a consideration of higher order writing problems such as structure of argument, (4) presentation of arguments, and (5) paragraph development. Peer review requires careful planning, during which the instructor must help students understand what sorts of group interaction will help students learn to write and what sorts will not. (EL)",

Responses were received from 47% of the faculty members. Their responses indicated that in most introductory courses writing was limited to short-answer exam responses. Short documented-research papers were likely to be required of upper level students' papers. Most respondents indicated that part of the student's grade was determined by written work, and the majority considered outlines to be part of the preliminary process of  writing, but not part of the final product. Most required subheadings and other divisions in formal writing, but few assigned a specific grade percentage to correctness, and many overlooked minor writing flaws in work written under the pressure of a time limit. Poor spelling, sentence fragments, and run-on sentences were perceived as serious problems in writing. The kinds of writing done within each discipline was surveyed to enable the English department to plan specialized writing courses. Many indicated a need for students to learn library research techniques, and most felt the students did not write well enough to suit them. (A copy of the questionnaire is appended.) (HOD)",

        "description":"The research orientations and perspectives of people participating in the international dialogue about the redefinition of English language studies have been varied. Two broad and overlapping areas are distinctive to English studies: the exploration of human values and experience through the study of literature and the media, and the development of the capacity to explore values and experience through learning to create literary and media pieces of one's own. A commitment to both is a commitment to teaching children how to deal with experience in distinctive ways, ways of meaning realized in characteristic patterns of discourse. Once suggested to be a \"contentless\" subject, English does--in fact--have a content that involves the various ways in which our English-speaking  traditions take experiences, real and imagined, and shape meanings of them in language. It is language as art that is the distinctive feature of English studies. An investigation of a varied range of literary forms encourages students to learn a number of ways to make meanings. Furthermore, to enter with increasing knowledge and understanding into the ways of meaning valued in a culture is part of the process of learning to operate with independence in that culture. The most important implication for English teachers, therefore, is to be conscious of the nature of discourse patterns that give distinctive character to the various forms or genres of English literature. Only when teachers focus with interest and real understanding on the nature of these, will they be able to guide their  children in writing the various literary forms available to them. (EL)",

Each day they practiced free writing, produced one or two pages of journal writing, and practiced sentence combining exercises. Evaluation was by teacher-written comments instead of a grade, by small group discussions, and by short individual conferences. The pre- and posttest measures--a Likert type attiatude scale, a T-unit analysis, and a holistic evaluation of in-class essays--demonstrated that current writing theory and research  can be implemented successfully into pedagogy.

G. Perry's scale of intellectual development, P. G. Diederich's scale of writing competence, and a measure of audience awareness based on the writer's constructed context. The study addressed the question of why some students write better than others. General language abilities (e.g., vocabulary, gyntactic maturity) cannot account for all the differences between good and poor writing. By focusing on college students who presumably have the necessary preliminary tools to write (spelling, vocabulary, syntactic options), the study sought to examine the differences in the  students' rhetorical maturity with respect to writing competence and context. It was hypothesized that students who had moved through the more complex positions on Perry's model of intellectual development would have internalized the need to provide necessary and appropriate context in their writing. The subjects represented both traditional and older undergraduate and graduate students across a broad spectrum of majors. The results suggested that aspects of intellectual development described by Perry's theory (critical thinking, questioning assumptions, drawing conclusions) were significantly related to the quality of student writing. Results also indicated that levels of cognitive development among college students had a statistically significant relationship to both writing competence  and constructed context. (Author/HOD)",

Almost no choice patterns for book jackets emerged for kindergarten children, whose only consistent choices seemed to be for illustrations depicting deep space. The only preferences of second grade students were the bright colors selected by the males. Third grade students were more discriminating: girls preferred illustrations with bright colors, while boys' preference for bright colors was correlated  only with the illustrations showing no action. Boys also chose illustrations with less detail. The elements for which fourth and fifth grade children seemed to have definite opinions were in the areas related to color, detail, proportion, and space. The study concluded that males prefer bright colors, less detail, and deep space in cover illustrations while females prefer illustrations with more detail.

        "description":"The computer represents an instrument of change for students and teachers alike. For most students learning to use the computer to write, the writing process is temporarily more difficult and stressful and capable of creating a highly charged, emotional trauma for the writer. The constraints of learning what keys to push and how to get out of trouble when the wrong keys are pushed interferes with the writing process. Students must have a fairly strong ego and an even stronger sense of determination to be willing to risk making mistakes, to continue making mistakes, and yet not let these factors interfere with their learning process. Not all students can comply under these trying conditions. Some become demoralized so quickly that rather than directing their energies at the  learning tasks, they immesh themselves in dysfunctional behavior patterns, creating new obstacles to their learning. The teacher's role becomes more like a coach than anything else. The important thing to teach computer using writers is that mastery of a word-processing program requires a willingness to interact, to explore, and to experiment. Rather than requiring that certain activities be done, the teacher can demonstrate processes, make suggestions, and expand the students' awareness of alternatives available to them. (HOD)",

        "description":"Few individuals think of the theatrically exhibited motion picture as supported by advertising like other major forms of mass communications. Cinema screen advertising can be defined as the presentation of individual advertising messages on movie theatre screens in a distinct and discrete fashion. Screenvision ads run prior to the start of each feature film and promote such products as automobiles, videogames and home computers, fashions, beer and soft drinks, travel, cameras, and film. While relatively scarce until recently in the United States, cinema advertising has long been a part of the European cinema experience. Although there is a dearth of movie audience research, the data suggest that cinema advertising does not significantly deter or inhibit attendance, nor do the ads  appear to be especially aversive to a significant segment of the audience. The theatrical environment itself offers numerous unique advantages that should further increase its attractiveness as an advertising medium. The absolute size of the visual is larger than for any other moving image medium. In addition, it offers a more powerful, higher fidelity sound system than TV with stereo. The impact of new technologies may very well make the concept of cinema screen advertising even more attractive. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study tested the uses and gratifications theoretical perspective--that motivations affect media use which in turn influences the effects of that use. The American Student Dental Association targeted its publications to different subaudiences and provided a grant to the University of Texas at Austin to study (1) whether the differentiation between types of students reflected the students' actual motivations to use dental publications, and (2) their actual reading behaviors. Subjects--504 dental students--were surveyed concerning their motivations for reading nine dental magazines, their interest in various kinds of editorial content, and their actual reading habits. Motivations were measured by self reports, in which respondents were asked to rate 16 different reasons for  reading dental publications on five-point Likert scales. Significant differences in motivations for reading dental publications were found between lower classmen (sophomores and juniors) and seniors and recent graduates. The study shows that knowing readers' motivations for reading dental publications can help predict those readers' interests in various kinds of content and their evaluations of and usage of various dental publications. Publishers, advertisers, and academic magazine researchers should be interested in the uses and gratifications theoretical approach because it can help publishers direct the editorial content of their publications to secure their base of readers; it can help advertisers predict where their advertisements will be the most effective; and it can help academic  researchers better understand the needs of an audience.

In other words, the forecasting of invention is not separate from invention itself. Secondly, the inventions of some of the more influential communications technologies will be absolutely unpredictable even by the more serious forecasters. It will also be impossible to predict which communication technology will be dominant (most widely influential) within a technologically advanced society at any significant distance in the future. Furthermore, new communication technologies will not make previous communication technologies obsolete, and  predictions of the future of mass communication should not necessarily be based on the notion that changes will follow an acceleration curve.

Subjects included students enrolled in introductory speech communication classes who had known one another for three and a half months. Subjects were given a form that asked them to list in order of preference those classmates with whom they wished to engage in two activities: working on a class project and attending a party. Next, subjects were given a seating chart asking them where they would like to sit if they attended a lecture and a class discussion. Subjects were also given a seating chart indicating that they  had been assigned to the seat they requested; however, their sociometric choices--their first choice for task attraction and their first choice for social attraction--were identified as having been assigned to sit in a completely opposite section of the room. If the subjects wanted to change their seats based on the information given, they were asked to indicate their new seat preference. Results indicated that attraction had a significant role in the ways students used the space between one another and used such features as rows of chairs to manifest their relations with one another.

Respondents were instructed to suppose that they were to hire a college graduate with a four-year degree that had specifically prepared him or her in oral and written communication, mass media production and analysis, and organizational dynamics. Given this context, respondents were presented with two separate 13-item indices: a performance by the college graduate index and a training of others by the college graduate index. The remaining questions were concerned with the the importance of communication skills  in the respondents' companies. Results indicated that, on the whole, the personnel directors strongly endorsed the value of communication skills to their companies' operations. Mean score differences between those organizations that had implemented a communication training program and those that had not were insignificant. Interestingly, prospective employees' ability to train other employees in various communication skills was rated somewhat higher in importance than was actual ability to perform a variety of communication functions themselves.

Internships begin by being either agency generated or student generated. Objectives of the program include understanding, developing, and applying communication skills necessary for effective performance within an organizational setting. Interns, either speech majors or minors, should be juniors, seniors, or graduate students with an excellent academic record. Other issues to be considered are whether the position should be a paid one, how many credit hours should be allowed, the number of hours a week and the number of weeks the intern should work, prerequisites, and whether grades should be given. An on-site supervisor should be responsible for  assigning the intern tasks and evaluating the intern periodically. The interns should assess their own progress, send in work samples, and keep a daily copy of their activities. Other matters to be considered are assigning a course number, determining the number of internship hours to be applied toward graduation, deciding whether a student's job can result in intern credit, and creating a list of placement possibilities. (Appended are a list of references, a description of the internship position, a form to use in conducting a personal interview with the intern, a list of things for the intern supervisor to remember, instructions for a required internship notebook, sample journal entries, a final report, a professional evaluation of the student intern, a self-evaluation form for the  intern, and a letter to intern supervisors.)

They were aked to respond to the situation in terms of what they would say and not what they would do. The interviews were then submitted to coders to be subdivided and classified according to power types. Results indicated that coercive, expert, legitimate, and referent power were used by the CEOs quite evenly, while reward power was used significantly less than the other  forms of power. CEOs used more expert power and less legitimate power when communicating upwardly/horizontally than referent and coercive power. Conversely, CEOs used more legitimate power and less expert power than coercive and referent power when communicating downwardly. (Author/HOD)",

        "description":"Mary Cunningham, a Harvard Business School graduate in 1979, received more than 30 job offers from major financial corporations. She accepted a positition as the executive assistant to the Chairman of the Board of Bendix Corporation. By October 1980, she had been promoted twice and held the position of vice president of strategic planning. However, Mary Cunningham was forced to resign after two months of public rumors that her rapid promotions in the Bendix company were the result of a romantic relationship with William Agee, her boss and mentor. The case raises fundamental questions concerning two central areas of communication research: mentor-protege dyads and the management of rumors. First, it is significant that Mary Cunningham reported directly to and only to her mentor,  Agee. In that situation she and her mentor were vulnerable to the kind of organizational gossip that is incapable of being proven or disproven. Second, not only did Cunningham's rapid rise attract attention, but the boss seemed to spend an unusual amount of time with her. Participants in male-female mentor relationships must be very judicious in the matter of appearance. As for managing the rumors, Agee's initial comment to the press contained sufficient ambiguity so as to leave additional questions unanswered. His approach to rumor management also reflected his naivete--he underestimated the interest of the press in the rumors. The Bendix case offers clear evidence for additional research and training in the areas of organizational communication. It also raises essential ethical concerns  about the ambiguity of behavior. The lessons of Agee and Cunningham apply to every potential participant in any mentor-protege relationship. (HOD)",

Subjects were 493 college students, who indicated on an eight-point scale the extent to which a series of 70 reasons for movie going matched their own reasons for movie attendance. Three frequency of attendance groups were identified: infrequent--once in two to six months; occasional--once or twice a month; and frequent--three times a month or more. Twelve motives for movie going were identified; the three frequency of movie attendance groups differed on nine of these. Most prominent among the nine reasons were for (l) an enjoyable and pleasant activity, (2) relaxation, (3) arousal/excitement, (4) a social activity, and (5) communication resources. The three movie motives that were not found to correlate significantly  with frequency of movie-going were to relieve loneliness, to pass time, and for behavioral resources. Age was negatively correlated with movie attendance for positive mood enhancement to pass time, and as a social activity. Gender did not appear to affect attendance for any of the three attendance groups. Frequent movie-goers reported greater identification with the motives on the instrument than did occasional or infrequent movie-goers. The findings offer a sense of the multidimensional nature of the motivations for movie attendance. (HTH)",

A checklist, in the form of questions, pertaining to ways of relating with parents, the pastor,  teachers, and children is followed by questions for reflection and suggested scripture readings. \"Guidelines for Relection for Diocesan Office Personnel,\" by Brother Dominic Berardelli, asks a series of questions to suggest practical ways diocesan offices can redirect their school administrators to their authentic purpose as spiritual leaders of the school community.

Third, teachers should include in their own plans time for reading about and reflecting on theories and practices in their subject discipline, the psychology of learning, and religious  education. Teachers should then revise their practices based on their reading and reflection. Fourth, teachers should ascertain if students are reaching out to grasp their destiny. The major part of the book is set up with one page per day, with categories for \"equipment needed,\"\"attendance,\" and \"other\" printed at the bottom of each page. Simulated plans at the primary and secondary level demonstrate ways to use the book and space is provided for outlining the teacher's daily schedule and recording specific information for substitute teachers.

Financing the school is one of the pastors' concerns. Three others touch on relationships: working with the principal, relating the school to the total parish community, and working with parental groups and boards.

A second literature review identified four inservice experiments that used these dimensions to improve students' basic skills achievement. (Appendix B briefly describes these experiments.) Following a foreword and introduction, a table summarizes the findings concerning these dimensions--listing each element,  the effective practice associated with each element, and the research validating the effectiveness of these practices. The four types of research used include basic skills experiments, implementation research, inservice research, and survey research. The bulk of the document expands on these aspects of each dimension, with the dimensions divided into the following six categories: teacher objectives, student objectives, delivery systems, organizational context, governance, and selection and evaluation. To illustrate how theory is transferred into practice, case studies of three successful school district staff development programs are provided. A bibliography lists 56 references. (DCS)",

It then isolates the aspects of this theory that are most relevant to the analysis of school finance. Individual chapters cover the theories of educational expenditures, taxation, and school district governance. This first section provides a conceptual context in which to place the second section's more specific economic analysis of school finance reform.  Chapters in the second part cover the objectives of, the constraints on, and the responses of social institutions to reform. The economic literature on relevant topics is introduced.

In 1982-83, profile data were compiled on 120 students who entered a school district's counseling center during that year. A treatment effectiveness study, involving 28 of these students, was conducted to ascertain treatment-related changes in the affective variables of interest. Pre- and post-treatment data were gathered using instruments designed to measure these variables. Student profile data were summarized and notable characteristics highlighted. For 1983-84, the same basic procedure was followed. However, the sample for both the profile and the treatment effectiveness study comprised  65 students; the counseling program was monitored to verify its conformity with stated procedures; and student profile data for the six schools with the most referrals to the center were assembled for comparison. As in the previous year, increases were observed in all three dependent variables. The difference between pre- and post-treatment means, for both the self-concept of academic ability and locus of control variables, was statistically significant. These and other findings provide evidence to support the counseling center approach to addressing affective needs of disruptive students. (Author/MCG)",

        "description":"This report, one of a series, analyzes states' decisions on how to use block grant funds. Under block grants, states obtained greater decision-making authority to set program priorities and determine the use of funds than they had under the prior categorical programs. At the same time, federal appropriations to states under block grants were generally less than under the former programs. Accordingly, states employed three major strategies during 1982 and 1983 to mitigate the effect of initial federal funding reductions that occurred in most block grants. These included (1) taking advantage of available funds from the prior categorical programs, (2) transferring funds from among block grants, and (3) increasing the use of state funds. However, the applicability of these strategies  varied by block grant. Overall, program areas that had been funded under the categorical programs continued to receive support under the block grants, though changes in funding patterns emerged as states established their own priorities in dealing with limited funds. An appendix lists General Accounting Office (GAO) reports issued to date on implementation of block grants. (TE)",

These public input opportunities were established in response to federal requirements, but also on account of the greater discretion available to the states. The public's opportunity to participate in block grant program decisions has been increased by the availability of more than one forum for public input, such as hearings and opportunities to comment on draft intended-use reports. There has also been greater activity among interest groups and more involvement by state elected officials. However, interest groups were split in their assessment of state  efforts to solicit their input. The report concludes that federal public participation requirements, in conjunction with states' own methods, promote multiple opportunities for public involvement and create settings where different degrees of emphasis were placed on a wide variety of issues. Three appendixes supply (1) a list of General Accounting Office (GAO) reports on implementation of block grants, (2) a description of GAO's data collection methodology, and (3) an analysis of interest group characteristics related to their degree of satisfaction with state input processes.

Suggestions cited the most frequently by EPA,  state, and school district officials and by at least one official at each level of government included: (1) require state certification of contractors and consultants, (2) establish an independent governmental unit to monitor and inspect abatement actions, (3) provide better technical guidance and assistance, (4) establish a definitive standard specifying the level of exposure that should be abated, (5) provide more information about asbestos hazards and remedies, and (6) increase federal funding for abating asbestos.

A process for implementing effective instructional management involves establishing systemwide instructional goals, then setting goals for each school. Curriculum, system supervisory practices, and evaluation instruments are all  reviewed and, if necessary, revised. The final step is an extensive staff development program. A policy statement by the Mercer County (West Virginia) Board of Education is provided as an example. (MLF)",

        "description":"Using nationally representative data generated by the normal, day-to-day operation of schools, this research tested the major conclusions drawn from case studies focusing on principal effectiveness. On the basis of detailed information regarding individual student characteristics and achievements, detailed characteristics of teachers and their instructional choices and methods, and detailed information on the characteristics and behavior of principals, relevant changes in the educational process and in student outcomes were measured in relation to particular types of principal behavior. After the introduction, section 2 reviews the literature on the principal's role in student achievement. In section 3, a general contextual model for student achievement is presented, and the  research methodology is described in detail, including the educational production function approach to the model and the specification of the variables for principal behavior and attributes. The empirical results are presented in section 4. The study concludes that principals directly affect student achievement through providing strong leadership and reducing conflicts among the participants in the educational process.

Three essential questions are treated: (1) Ought educational leaders to be philosophic in their work? (2) Need educational leaders be democratic? and (3) How do these conceptions of leadership, democracy, and philosophic-mindedness interrelate in the context of educational administration? The discussion of these issues focuses on what constitutes leadership in an educational setting, how educational leadership differs from other forms of leadership, and how educational leaders are to be distinguished from other kinds of managers. The argument is presented that an understanding of these qualities (philosophic-mindedness, leadership, and democracy) is  crucial to the governance of educational institutions, and that they merit attention as a philosophical problem.

The manual was prepared to help instructors of the General Services Administration conduct technically sound and comprehensive seminars. For each technical session, the manual provides an introduction explaining the purpose of that session followed by copies of each visual and an outline of the commentary that would accompany that visual. The seminar covers the fundamentals of lifecycle cost, benefit-to-cost ratio, savings-to-investment ratio, internal rate of return, and payback analyses; sensitivity and probability analyses; break-even analysis; replacement decisions;  and the solution of sample building problems that illustrate these economic evaluation methods. The sessions alternate between presentations of economic theory required for evaluating problems and actual problems that illustrate the economic evaluations in practice. Real building design problems with an emphasis on energy conservation are presented for individual and group solutions. The manual describes step by step how to present the problems and how to solve them. It presupposes an existing familiarity of the instructors with the basic concepts and evaluation techniques used in the seminars. (The appendixes contain a sample 3-day agenda and a selective bibliography of 13 citations that describe in detail the economic methods presented.) (Author)",

        "description":"In light of the current increase in elementary and secondary school attendance coupled with a simultaneous decrease in college-age population between now and the end of the decade, this study assesses (1) the role of economic factors in determining the number of teachers certified and (2) the responsiveness of teachers in the \"reserve pool\" to current teacher salaries. Since similar demographic trends existed in the past, time series data from 1950 to 1979 are examined to develop an economic model of the decision to receive teacher certification and the ensuing decision to participate in teaching once certified. Structural parameters of this model are estimated; the results indicate an important role for economic factors in the public school teachers market. The point estimate of  the wage elasticity of the supply of teachers already trained is .72 for secondary school teachers and .81 for elementary school teachers, so that a 20 percent increase in wages would induce a 14.4 percent increase in the supply of secondary school teachers. The short-run elasticity of teacher certification with respect to a permanent change in the expected wage is 1.36 and 1.80 for secondary and elementary schools respectively, allowing for changes in the college-going behavior of students in response to the expected wage for teachers. These results suggest a substantial wage response in the public school teachers market. Two appendixes supply data sources and the calculation of the trained teacher series. Extensive references are included. (Author/TE)",

The survey, containing 1,063 pieces of information in 14 sections, was designed to create a view of the resources, programs, facilities, personnel, and policies of Catholic high schools. Special scrutiny is given to how Catholic schools vary by gender composition (coed versus single sex), size, governance (parochial, interparochial, private, diocesan), and percentage of students from low-income families. Chapters 2-12 give a composite view of Catholic high schools, with each chapter focusing on a particular aspect of school life. Chapters 13-15 look at how school characteristics vary as a function  of percentage of low-income students, gender composition, and operating authority. Chapters 1 and 16 are more thematic and interpretive. The appendixes contain the following additional information: (1) a list of consultants; (2) the survey instrument, instructions, and national summary data based on all 910 school reports; (3) a list of Catholic high schools that report having made significant achievements in each of nine categories; and (4) a list of project publications and procedures for obtaining additional data information.

This year's publication contains the core school, enrollment, and staffing data of the NCEA historical file. In addition, a special feature of this report is the data on minority and non-Catholic enrollment. Where information is available, comparisons are made with other private schools as well as with the public sector. Tables show the percentage of schools in each of six geographical regions and what has happened in recent years. Other tables show types of schools (ownership and administration); location (urban, suburban, and rural); and enrollment sizes. Enrollment in the private  sector has grown to 12.6 percent in 1983. In 1980-81 (latest data available) Catholic school enrollments constituted about 63 percent of the private elementary and secondary sector. The percentage of non-Catholics has increased (from 2.7 percent in 1969-70 to 11.1 percent in 1983-84), as has that of ethnic minority students (from 10.8 percent in 1970-71 to 20.2 percent in 1983-84). At the elementary level, the pupil teacher ratio stands at 21:1 and 79.9 percent of the teachers are lay staff. Pupil teacher ratio at the secondary level is 15:6 and 76.2 percent of the teachers are lay staff.(MLF)",

Challenges that make this goal difficult to accomplish include a changing environment within the Catholic school: staffs that were almost entirely composed of priests or religious are now almost entirely lay, and the tension between the school as an educational institution and the school as a faith community has increased. In addition, both public and Catholic schools experience the loose coupling between the work of the principal and the effectiveness of the school. Finally, high schools are more diversified than elementary schools, academically and geographically. A Catholic school principal must provide both academic and religious leadership to have an effective Catholic school. A  principal can help to make a school a more effective environment by working to develop its distinctly Catholic culture. The keys to leadership are vision and inspiration. To develop a school culture, the principal must be committed, purposeful, and involved in managing the values of the school; painstaking in the hiring and development of teachers; and adept at building coalitions with competing constituencies to reach desired goals.

This study examines the features of an elementary school--Skyline School in the South San Francisco Unified School District (California)--that have contributed to the successful integration of computers in its curriculum. Because implementation of computers must be seen both as an educational innovation and as a distinct educational technology, their successful integration in the curriculum requires unique site, district, and regional supports. Other features conducive to the success of the program have been a favorable school climate, ongoing teacher training, and active promotion by the principal. The analysis concludes with district and regional  policy implications of this example, including issues such as hardware and software acquisition and adequacy, articulation of the curriculum, and provision of training, maintenance, and ongoing help.

Section II, constituting the bulk of the paper, describes three educational improvement programs initiated by the author in his capacity as the superintendent of the Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) Public Schools. (1) Monitoring Achievement in Pittsburgh (MAP)--intended to improve basic skills achievement--includes explicit learning objectives, frequent testing, and individual and class achievement profiles. (2) Pittsburgh's Research-based  Instructional Supervisory Model (PRISM) incorporates personnel evaluation, leadership training, and a &quot;model&quot; secondary school used as a teacher improvement center. (3) The School Improvement Project (SIP) is intended to improve education in selected low-achieving schools and to develop a model for districtwide school improvement. Based on effective schools research, the program addresses instructional, administrative, and discriplinary problems. The booklet presents 10 considerations viewed as essential to effective leadership by the superintendent. A bibliography is appended. (MCG)",

The first step in a practical evaluation process is to determine the evaluation's purpose, and the second is to determine what is to be evaluated. Evaluations should focus on factors that actually affect teaching competence and that can be evaluated without denying constitutional rights. The third step is to select suitable evaluation methods. Nonobjective criteria might not be acceptable in some cases, and the National Teacher Examinations have failed to meet court tests in some situations. The fourth step is to select a qualified evaluator. Fifth, the evalaution process must be publicized and implemented. Administrators must make  sure their evaluations will be useful by including narrative descriptions of substantive facts as well as comments on how unsatisfactory performance can be improved. Evaluation procedures should incorporate the provision of notice of deficiencies to teachers, avoidance of several possible discriminatory practices, and protection of confidentiality. A checklist of evaluation procedures, a humorous test reviewing points made in the document, and a suggested evaluation policy for school board adoption complete the document. (PGD)",

Project WISE FY84 is an outgrowth of project accomplishments in FY83, which included a pilot test of collaborative school-business partnerships at three sites. From these pilot tests models and guidelines were developed for implementing such collaboration. The goal of the WISE project for FY84 was to facilitate the training of inservice education trainers to help meet school needs through the collaboration of schools, businesses, state and higher education agencies, and the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL). To achieve its goal, Project WISE carried out the following major  activities in FY84: (1) arranged for qualified consultants to review the revised models and guidelines and provided constructive suggestions for improvement; (2) tested the models and guidelines at school sites; (3) revised the Project WISE models and guidelines in light of reviewers' recommendations, and of information collected from the project sites, (4) planned and conducted its FY84 working conference; (5) provided collaborative staff development, based on prototype models and guidelines, for local trainers and state officials, and (6) disseminated information regarding results of the project's research and development activities. Illustrative exhibits are provided in the report, along with seven attachments, including guidelines, evaluation instruments, lists of participants,  conference proceedings, and a bibliography.

        "description":"Although there has been a paucity of research on what effective secondary school principals do, two recent studies offer some clues. A 1983 report by William Firestone and Bruce Wilson asserts that a high school principal may best be able to influence the school through bureaucratic and cultural linkages. Bureaucratic linkages are formal enduring arrangements within an organization that allow it to operate. Cultural linkages, the key to productivity in an organization, are the collectively accepted meanings, beliefs, values, and assumptions in the school. Researchers James Russell, Thomas White, and Steven Maurer, in a 1983 study, selected eight characteristics of effective schools and identified specific principal behaviors that appeared to foster these characteristics  effectively. Spotlighted in this article are the effective and ineffective behaviors related to the two following effective schools characteristics: (1) schoolwide measurement and recognition of academic success and (2) an orderly and studious school environment. Researcher Kathleen Fitzpatrick is now introducing effective administrator behaviors as part of a training project in high schools in the Chicago, Illinois, area, and the response has been enthusiastic. Sixteen references are provided. (DCS)",

        "description":"This paper describes an initial effort to provide a carefully reasoned, factually based, systematic analysis of teacher pay in comparison to pay in other occupations available to college-educated workers. It also reports on the sensitivity of these salary comparison estimates to differences in certain characteristics of the labor force, such as sex, age, marital status, and ethnic identity. The data, derived from the individual record file of the March 1983 Current Population Survey of the United States Bureau of the Census, consisted of observations of college-educated salaried workers in the 12 southeastern states: 3,383 nonteachers and 373 public school teachers. Primary analysis of data provides comparisons of average annual wage between teachers and nonteachers, personal  characteristics of the two groups, and comparison of average annual teacher salaries for 1981-82 and 1982-83. A regression equation is then used to relate annual earnings of college-educated workers in nonteaching occupations to various independent variables. Results of the analysis show that current teacher pay levels are inadequate to compete with other occupations. Suggestions are made as to the specific salary ranges within which competitive teacher salaries might lie. References are included, along with six illustrative tables. (TE)",

        "author":["Berry, Barnett"],
        "description":"A case study of teacher attrition in one southeastern metropolitan school system that employs approximately 4,000 teachers was undertaken to determine which teachers left, why, and where they went. Of the 210 teachers in the system who resigned during the 1983-84 academic year, 16 percent were K-6, 13 percent were special education/speech, 13 percent were math, 9 percent were English, 9 percent were vocational, and 7 percent were science teachers. In terms of grade levels, more junior high teachers left than high school, K-6, or specialist teachers. Reasons for resignation included retirement/health (24 percent), dissatisfactions (21 percent), spouse moves (20 percent), family (15 percent), business opportunity (9 percent), break from teaching (4 percent), teaching elsewhere (2  percent), coaching-related (2 percent), and reduction in force (1 percent). Teachers who left because of dissatisfactions stated poor administration, poor student discipline, little teacher control, large classes, &quot;Mickey-Mouse&quot; duties, uncooperative parents, stressful atmosphere, and the &quot;valuing of mediocrity&quot; in schools as the root of their frustrations with public school teaching. While only 31 percent left for other occupations, even fewer left for higher-paying ones. Findings indicate overall that teachers who left out of dissatisfaction did so more because of frustration with working conditions than because of low salaries or lack of career advancement. Instrumentation for the study is included in two appendixes. (TE)",

        "description":"Several experiments were carried out to determine: (1) whether learning disabled (LD) and behaviorally disordered (BD) students exhibit deficiencies with respect to appropriate test-taking strategies and (2) if so, whether these strategies could be successfully trained. In the test-training evaluation, 92 LD or BD elementary-age students representing grades 2, 3, and 4 were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. Treatment subjects received eight training sessions on test-taking skills, with particular regard to the Stanford Achievement Test. All treatment students scored significantly higher on a test of test-taking skills. In addition, third and fourth grade LD and BD students scored significantly higher on the word Study Skills subtest and exhibited descriptive  increases with respect to other subtests. Second grade students were apparently unaffected by the training procedure. A similar test-training package applied to intact third grade classrooms of mostly nonhandicapped students indicated that these materials were effective in improving student attitudes toward the test-taking experience. The document begins with a project overview and contains the following project manuscripts: \"Improving the Test-Taking Skills of LD and BD Elementary Students\" (C. Taylor and T.

Currently, the network is composed of 10 groups which function as a safe place for disabled youth to discuss topics concerning themselves, their disabilities, work skills, and individual potential. Facilitator pairs include a professional service provider and an adult with a disability who acts as a role model. Careful selection and training of co-facilitators are essential to the program, as is recruitment of appropriate youth for the groups.

In the first experiment, this variable was operationalized as coaction; some subjects worked individually in small groups, while others worked alone. In the second experiment, it was operationalized as surveillance; some subjects believed they were being watched while working. Effects of evaluation expectation were consistently strong. On both the verbal task used in Study 1 and the artistic task used in Study 2, creativity was lower in those groups expecting  evaluation. Evidence on the social facilitation or social inhibition of creativity was less clear. Coaction had no effect, and surveillance had only a weak negative effect.

Designed to supplement the existing curriculum, nine units focus on the following skill areas: social skills (self-esteem, self-identity, social communication and interaction, goal development, problem solving, developing sexual identity); health (personal care and hygiene, health care, safety, first aid); home management (house cleaning, identification and use of hand tools, using the telephone, housing options); clothing care (laundry, clothing use and maintenance); cooking (kitchen safety, pre-cooking skills, nutrition, preparing foods, storing and serving foods, kitchen cleaning); travel (preparation, safety, transportation, understanding your community); money  management (handling money, budgeting, banking); leisure time activities (including time management); and career development (planning, preparation for employment, working). Each unit lists objectives, teaching activities, needed materials and resources, adaptations for students with visual, hearing, and/or orthopedic disabilities, and student skills checklists. A separate guide to implementation of the curriculum discusses the philosophy of independent living, provides an overview and description of the curriculum, and outlines resource requirements (equipment, staff, training) and teaching strategies. Appendices to the guide include lists of parent and national resources as well as Independent Living Centers by state. (JW)",

Designed to increase the employability of handicapped students, the program focused upon work experience in the private sector accomplished through coordinated use of training and employment resources at state and local levels. Three state agencies were involved in program planning and evaluation, the State Department of Education, the Employment Development Department and the Department of Rehabilitation. Project activities fell into three main groups, each having a variety of components: project support activities to generate interagency and community involvement (parent and employer involvement); work experience (job development, job placement,  followup); and work readiness (student intake, diagnostic assessment and career exploration). A three part analysis of the program analyzes the impact on student employment, examines program costs by components and project staff ratings of the effectiveness and importance of these components, and addresses cost analysis aspects, dealing specifically with cost sharing by the participating agencies cost savings accruing to these agencies, and reasons for differential expenditures by local districts. Among major findings are that: agencies reduced their per client expenditures because of cost sharing and the exchange of student assessment data or unique services; on-the-job training had significant impact on employers and students; and more than one-third of Work Ability Students began the  transition from school to employment.

Activities have included the development of an interactive process, inservice training and a social skills curriculum component for severely handicapped children and youth. Outcomes have included validated training models for these activities and the social skills curricular strategy packages. Sixty-seven severely handicapped project children/youth--ranging in age from 3-8 years and diagnosed as severely to profoundly retarded, severely multiply handicapped, autistic and deaf-blind--participated in project activities at five public school settings enrolling primarily regular education children. Project staff has included a project director, a curriculum coordinator, a part-time inservice training coordinator, a part-time program trainer at each school  setting, and support staff. Both the University of Hawaii Department of Special Education, College of Education and the personnel who have been involved in the project brought to the project extensive professional experience in the areas directly relevant to project activities--including educational programming for severely handicapped children/youth, school and community integration of severely handicapped children/youth, and inservice training of educational personnel.

Underlying assumptions address the complexity of post-school services, the focus on all students with disabilities, and the goal of employment as an important outcome of education. A conceptual framework of transition views three bridges from school to work: transition without special services, transition with time-limited services (such as vocational rehabilitation and postsecondary vocational education), and ongoing services that allow disabled persons to take advantage of work opportunities. Additional model components center on the high school and employment foundations. OSERS initiatives  related to each component are noted along with several broader research and evaluation issues, such as the need for careful descriptions of current transition experiences. (CL)",

Opportunity to field-test the SNSP was provided by the three replication sites, two second generation sites, and the model classroom. University students, teachers, therapists, paraprofessionals and volunteers were trained. UPSTART disseminated its developed program for severely/profoundly handicapped and offered assistance through awareness, training and consultive activities  on a nationwide basis.

The study focused on financial and programmatic factors and addressed the following purposes: analyzing the reporting system for the expenditures of PL 94-142 funds, and formalizing the relationship between these expenditures and the service needs contained on Individual Education Plans (IEP's). From a random sample of eight South Dakota school districts, data were collected from state and local documents and from interviews with school personnel. The financial phase of the study suggested that the reporting system should be changed to collect more detailed information; supplanting appeared to be taking place in several school  districts; and most PL 94-142 monies have been spent for salaries and fringe benefits for the instructional program. The programmatic phase of the study resulted in the following findings: PL 94-142 funds were being spent on implementation of full services for handicapped children, child identification, and development and implementation of the IEP's; special education staff and students have increased with the staff/student ratio remaining constant; PL 94-142 monies were being used to provide services specified on student IEP's; and most IEP's were not written in a manner that complies with federal guidelines.

Ss were tested three times over a 4-year period, including measures of linguistic and academic performance. In addition, information was collected on the background characteristics of Ss through parent interviews. Among findings were that, compared to Ss in total communication programs, Ss in auditory programs had more residual hearing, were above average in intelligence, and came from families with higher socioeconomic status. Three measures consistently and strongly predicted the level of development: age, unaided hearing loss, and intelligence. Language development was affected by mode of communication, but the effect was different for different areas of language.  Further, the effect of type of program (individual or group) depended on the skill being measured. In general, parent training appeared to be an important component of auditory and auditory/oral programs and was helpful to children with profound losses. The data showed few differences between Ss who were integrated and those who were not. (CL)",

Foreign language education in the 1980s reflects fundamental changes in philosophy and objectives, and leaders in foreign language education agree that the fundamental objective is the ability to use language in meaningful ways. With this shift in approach, changes are necessary in program content, instructional materials, and learning activities. Innovations include elementary school programs emphasizing language use in real-life situations, immersion, exploratory programs,  schools of international studies, the international baccalaureate, and instruction beyond the classroom. The global education movement in social studies has been especially relevant for foreign language study, and technological applications in foreign language instruction are being updated to emphasize communication. Another current emphasis is on assessment of language proficiency. Improvement in preservice teacher education, while indicated, has been difficult, but a variety of inservice development options are available, and professional associations are an important source of assistance. A need exists for additional research and promotion of public awareness of foreign language study. (MSE)",

The proportion in which this space is filled by territorial languages, regional languages, or one of several nationwide languages and the exolect (foreign language that serves as the official language) varies with each country. But in virtually all African states there is a movement toward selection of a single symbolic language. While African countries had an undifferentiated multitude of territorial languages, the imported, official exolect had to fulfill all central public functions. However, with the selection of regional ethnolects or lingua francas, certain public functions are being transferred to the latter. For now, the exolects fulfill three functions as: (1)  the official interethnic communication medium in all central government functions, (2) the chief medium of secondary and postsecondary education, and (3) the main link with the international community. The replacement process is a slow one, and sudden shifts in language emphasis have historically resulted in neglect of the exolect, which proves deleterious to the countries' modernization. Language complementarity of the official exolect and national endolect, a balance of linguistic powers with continuous adjustment, should be encouraged as a means to fill the national language spaces and provide the necessary means of communication at central, regional, and local levels until the process of electing a central national form can be completed.

Two objectives were to learn (1) whether the parents were up to date on the issues, decisions, and directions taken by the administration with regard to language instruction, and (2) whether the parents' ideas were the same across subregions, age, sex, educational levels, and native language groups. A survey of the parent committee members revealed that they preferred instruction in English as a second language to be mandatory and undertaken at the secondary level, with  instruction in other languages elective and with only one other language offered. Classical languages were not desired. Variation in responses was found to be linked first to educational level attained, second to sex, and third, although weakly, to age. In general, parental agreement with the administration about the role of second language instruction was found, but less agreement was found on specific languages to be taught. (MSE)",

        "description":"To develop a more accurate and functional definition of \"real communication\" in the second language classroom, research into the language of teachers and students in their interactions was undertaken through classroom observation. The results show that the assumption that second language classroom language can be described as focusing either on form or on message does not reflect a third language category, \"restricted\" language, such as that of many teacher questions. This form focuses completely on message but transfers no information. It is suggested that the existence of this category may explain in part why teachers are unable to move into true communicative teaching but have stayed in an approach dominated by restricted language questions, which limits student participation  to responding to questions. Examination of one unusual classroom interaction pattern led to development of a classroom activity/approach, entitled \"The Teacher is Unprepared Approach,\" in which the interaction language must be unrestricted and the discourse pattern must correspond to that of native-speaker interaction. The approach is found to work because the conversational initiative lies with the students and all of the language generated is unrestricted. (MSE)",

It casts learners and teachers into new roles that may lead to a variety of benefits, enriching the total educational and social environment. The systematic use of peer teachers and tutors is a much-publicized practice in contemporary education, but information about it has not been widely disseminated. While peer involvement programs are often largely in response to practical needs, they also closely reflect current views about how a second language is learned best. It is widely applicable for learners of all ages and achievement levels and for a wide variety of instructional purposes. The potential pedagogical  benefits include increased individualization, intensified drill practice, and increased communication opportunities. Potential socio-affective benefits include increased motivation, strengthened cross-cultural understanding, self-concept and sense of self-direction, and reduced inhibition. To be successful, peer involvement programs must be thoughtfully planned, carefully structured, and systematically monitored. If this is accomplished, the technique may lead to a new teacher-learner relationship and form the basis for more effective and meaningful second language learning. (MSE)",

Two questions are addressed: (1) to what extent do language proficiency or language differences affect reading and learning to read a second language? and (2) what principles and methods are useful in facilitating the nonnative speaker's acquisition of English literacy? First and second language reading research is examined and compared, and teaching strategies and techniques are reviewed. Finally, some related issues in applied  linguistics and second language literacy are discussed, including (1) the relationship of orthographies, bilingualism, and reading; (2) initial literacy in the native vs. the second language; (3) similarities and differences in learning to read in different languages; and (4) needs in teacher education programs concering language differences and reading.

Information on WASC's accreditation standards for senior- and junior-level institutions is appended, as are lists of accredited schools. (SW)",

The overall economic impact of the university consisted of direct spending impact of purchases, taxes, and donations, plus the indirect impact of that money circulating through the community to be respent on other purchases and payments. The direct impact of five expenditure categories (construction and spending by the university, employees, students, and visitors) was an estimated $628.5 million a year, of which $533.2 million went to local businesses. Considering the circulation of that money, the estimate for the total direct and indirect impact of the university on the county economy was $1.41 billion a year. It was estimated that about 3,000  public sector jobs and more than 9,500 private sector jobs were the result of the university's direct spending, while at least 5,300 private jobs were due to indirect effects. In addition, the university employed 21,677 regular and student employees. Appendices include: information on benefits to the state provided by UW-Madison hospital and clinics; survey questionnaires for faculty/employees, students, football fans, parents, and visitors, and a four-page selected bibliography.

Students entering academic programs at two- or four-year colleges by fall 1974 were studied using findings of the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. College/university variables included college control and level, gender and ethnic composition, socioeconomic (SES) composition, degree of selectivity, percent of students at the graduate level, and tuition/fees cost per year. The analyses controlled for the influence of individual student variables that might account for college effects. In general, more academically selective, smaller, less vocationally-oriented colleges, with high levels of  structural integration had positive effects on student attainment. In addition, colleges with larger proportions of low SES and minority students (which seem to be private four-year colleges) had generally positive effects, partly through more lenient grading standards that encourage persistence of students. Two-year colleges had the most negative effects on student educational attainment. Twelve statistical tables and a seven-page bibliography are appended. (Author/SW)",

Attention was directed to: college control and level, average Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, percent of students with family income below $6,000, the extent of vocational studies offered, school size, highest degree granted, proportion of part-time students, expenditures per student, and average tuition and fees costs. Separate analyses by sex showed the effects of student background on college choice, the correlation of college characteristics with students' college participation versus work and family roles, effects on grades, and  influences on student contact with faculty and satisfaction with college. College characteristics that seem most detrimental to womens' persistence and graduation were high vocationalism, high proportions of part-time students, high costs, and a large proportion of high income students. The most detrimental college characteristics for men were large size, high proportions of part-timers, high expenditures per student, and low costs.

Important prerequisites are a needs assessment and long-range plan and an academic skills improvement program based on theory and existing models. Identifying a set of supportive people with power and resources at an institution is also needed. Examples of such resources are the student affairs office and deans of colleges such as education. Academic skills programs also need to meet the needs of untraditional students through flexible schedules and modes of delivery. A realistic approach to testing issues includes developing new instruments that are sensitive to affective and cognitive domains. A further challenge is to change the perception of learning centers from just being  remedial to places and programs that prepare students for the university environment. A model skills improvement program should be intermediary and interdisciplinary, based on theories (e.g., learning, cognitive, developmental and social psychology, semiotics, and rhetoric). It would also make use of instructional systems technology and instructional psychology and would conduct basic and applied research using both experimental and naturalistic methods. (SW)",

When difficult assignments seem unconnected to any highly regarded outcome, students view them as another hurdle to be jumped to receive a good grade. Three influences that enhance intrinsic motivation are choice, optimum challenge, and positive feedback. In general, the more students see their learning as self-determined, the more likely they are to develop intrinsic motivation for what they are learning. For adult students, college programs should make explicit the connection between what adults are learning and why it is important to their lives and aspirations. Today's college students' massive experience with high-tech stimulation makes the average college lecturer much less effective. Too many  college instructors are like students in wanting to get the class finished. Motivation is an interactive process: what the student brings to the classroom is affected by what the teacher offers. Today, college students are probably less motivated to participate in abstract learning than ever before. Faculty should address such questions as how to help students develop a positive attitude toward what is taught and how to make the subject matter stimulating. (SW)",

The information also provides a basis for analyzing changes in the ethnicity of the first-time freshman class, compared with that of high school graduates. Consideration is given to statewide high school graduation and college-going trends, and participation rates for the University of California, California State University, California community colleges, and independent colleges and universities. Statistical tables are provided on: (1) enrollment rates by sector for California's 58 counties are also compared for 1974-1983 (Appendix A); and (2) the ethnic  distribution by county and sex of 1983 first-time freshmen at the University of California, the California State University, and the California community colleges (Appendix B). While the overall statewide college-going rate fell in fall 1983 to the lowest in 10 years, the University of California increased its rate to the highest in the 10-year period. Fifty-eight percent of the community colleges experienced a 10 percent decrease in enrollment of first-time freshmen who were recent high school high school graduates. Six tables and four figures illustrate the data within the text. (SW)",

Eleven of 19 institutional respondents stated that their orientation program had both developmental and service aspects. The administrators felt that students needed to be aware of the counseling center, career development office, and dean of student affairs. The most common objectives of PCHE orientation programs  were to familiarize students with the physical environment, expose various resources, relieve anxiety, and assist the student in developing an identity and a relationship with peers. A developmental model of orientation was proposed by which an orientation committee composed of students, faculty, and staff would determine program goals and format.

Ten of the tutors had only been employed for 10 weeks, while 10 had been employed for 2 or more semesters. There was a difference in the evaluation of the supervisor by new and old tutors. Old tutors perceived the supervisor/leader's style as more effective than did new tutors. The results support the notion  that the employee's view of the supervisor is more consistent with the supervisor/leader's self-evaluation than is the perception of the supervisor in new supervisor-employee relationships. The responses of both new and old employees to each questionnaire item are indicated. The questionnaire consists of 12 situations and 4 possible actions by the leader.

Although the tutorial function is often a priority, the goal of the peer-tutoring program is to help students become independent learners. To eliminate the need for tutoring, it is necessary to determine why the student is having academic problems. To train peer tutors, a paradigm of the learning process is used that is based on a computer model of information processing. This Integrated Learning Model (ILM) has five phases: preparation, input, processing, storage, and output. In an initial training session, tutors are asked to name activities that relate to the learning process. These activities are grouped according to the five main phases of the ILM. In additional training sessions, tutors are provided case  notes of students that include diagnostic information. The tutor's task is to determine the possible contributing factors to problem areas. Finally, tutors learn interviewing strategies needed to determine in what phase the student's learning is breaking down. A list of key questions that tutors incorporated into their interviews is included. In addition to explaining the learning phases, the paper identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the ILM. (SW)",

Works in the third category, historically important monographs and texts, were not issued initially as historical discussions but have assised the college reading specialist in  understanding trends.

In the item-writing training procedure, students were taught to write multiple-choice comprehension questions based on their reading, while the summary writing training followed Day's summarization rules. Finally, students were introduced to the taxonomy of question-answer relations using the &quot;Will Wends His Way&quot; passage and questions from Pearson and Johnson (1978). All students received 4 to 5 hours of instruction and practice  per week for a month within the context of the class. Three evaluation measures were employed: the Basic Word Vocabulary Test during the first week, a practice form of the state exit reading comprehension examination during the last week, and the actual Regent's Reading examination. Students trained in discrening question-answer relations were more successful on reading comprehension tests than students trained in either summarizing or item writing. (SW)",

In small groups, students generate three statements that come to mind related to the war, and the class identifies statements appropriate to the topic. Next, students discuss a list of connective words and then write a paragraph using connecting words to join together their statements about the war. Finally, students are provided a modified cloze passage from the text with existing connectives removed. Any  sentences that could be connected are separated by a blank space, and students use the list to fill in the connecting words, after which the class discusses connectives that were chosen.

Data were obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of the high school senior class of 1972 for entrants to two- or four-year colleges in academic curricula. It was found that high school, race, and academic preparation strongly affected college selection by blacks, while socioeconomic status (SES) and goals were more important in the college selection by whites. Differences in effects of colleges on grades, faculty contact, satisfaction, and attainment variables were also explored. Compared to black students attending predominantly white colleges, black students  attending predominantly black institutions received significantly higher average grades, and were more likely to persist for a second year and to obtain a bachelor's degree. In general, the attainment of black students was higher in black colleges that were privately-controlled, smaller, less vocational, more cohesive, and with low-SES students. Contact with faculty also seemed highly important for black students. Additional findings are discussed. (SW)",

        "description":"Two methods to improve the teaching performance of clinical teaching physicians were studied: an intensive feedback method and a seminar. Both methods were designed to help clinical teachers analyze their teaching and implement more effective teaching methods. Pre- and post-intervention data were collected early and late in each attending physician's 1-month teaching rotation. In addition to considering clinical teachers' evaluation of the methods and teacher self-assessments, feedback was provided by student and housestaff ratings of the teachers, and videotape ratings of actual clinical instruction made by trained raters. Comparisons were made to teachers who only received written feedback from students and housestaff. The seminar method presented specific examples of clinical  teaching, including viewing re-enacted videotapes of clinical rounds. The method also facilitated discussion of videotapes, teacher's review of student and housestaff ratings compared to self-ratings, and teacher's identification of desired teaching changes. Research results indicate that effective methods of improving clinical teaching can be developed. Five recommendations for use of the methods are offered, including providing educational tools/concepts applicable to the teaching setting. (SW)",

        "description":"Hearings on the reasons for the Pell Grant Program shortfall and possible solutions are presented. The U.S. Department of Education's estimate was for a Pell grant shortfall of $307 million for 1983-1984, which was borrowed from the fiscal year 1984 appropriations. Current funding for Pell Grants is below what is necessary because initial funding for the 1983-1984 academic year was insufficient and because a larger number of students who are financially independent of their parents applied for grants than was expected. An increased number of applicants in the age group 23 to 27 was found; 62 percent of the total increase was for students over age 27. These increases come primarily from family incomes of less than $7,500; the income from the independent student-adjusted gross  income runs around $4,000. About 48 percent of the increase in applicants came from the students who were unemployed, or receiving welfare or other government benefits. The data on applicants indicate that lower income students seem to be taking advantage of the Pell Grant program. Three options are: to seek a supplemental appropriation; to publish a reduced payment schedule; or to seek an increased appropriation for FY 1985 to cover the funds that have been drawn down from the FY 1984 appropriation.

The University of the Philippines was established in 1908, and between 1901 and 1926, eight regional normal schools were established to train public school teachers. In 1949 the Philippine Normal College became a four-year institution and began to grant bachelors' degrees. By 1947, there were 309 college-level institutions, of which 294 were private. Currently, most of the state institutions and many of the private colleges include high school components and postsecondary vocational schools, and in many cases, elementary schools, due to the practice of extending existing institutions  to the college level. Almost half of the public institutions were established, or had collegiate components added, since 1966. During the period of rule by decree, President Marcos made marked changes in public higher education. In come cases, several schools were combined under one administration to form a college or university. Limitations in the development of universities include funding problems and lack of faculty with graduate degrees. (SW)",

To form the basis for a set of first principles for state-level resource allocation, the following concepts are addressed: the link between budgeting, planning, and accountability; governance relationships; production functions in higher education; and key structural components of the budget. The following customary approaches to resource allocation are evaluated in light of these  principles and guidelines: incremental budgeting, formula budgeting, base-plus-increment approaches, and categorical or competitive approaches. The changing environment affecting resource allocation and actual and potential responses to the problems involved are also considered, including buffering and decoupling, marginal costing, and using fixed and variable costs. Finally, key recommendations are summarized, and areas where reform of resource allocation may further the aims of schools and state government are identified. (SW)",

An important distinction is made between the measurement of changes and the values placed on these changes by different groups (students, the college, and special interest groups). After clarifying some different notions about educational excellence, key themes  in the literature on college outcomes are reviewed. A classification of outcomes with four dimensions is covered: knowledge, skills, attitudes/values, and relationships with society. Successful assessment programs at Alverno College, Northeast Missouri State University, and the University of Tennessee are briefly considered. Some common objections to self-assessment, including faculty resistance, costs, and lack of administrative incentive, are also identified.

        "description":"The Individualized Study Program (ISP) at the University of California, Davis, which is designed to enhance retention of students with academic skill deficiencies, was evaluated. The target group was disadvantaged students who had not met the university's entrance requirements. Attention was focused on two aspects of the program: allowing students to reduce their academic unit load and individualized study programs provided through workshops. ISP participants spent 2-5 hours per week in basic skills workshops for one academic quarter. Students who participated in the workshops and who reduced their academic load earned approximately the same grade point averages as two comparison groups: students who attended workshops but did not reduce their load, and students who did not  participate in the ISP. Participants did as well or better than their comparison group, even though they entered the university with significantly lower Scholastic Aptitude Test scores. Intensive remedial assistance during the first quarter appeared to be more beneficial than assistance provided after students had academic difficulty. Appendices include a description of ISP offerings, a sample ISP contract, and information on ISP students who did not return for a second year. (SW)",

The 327 women respondents (41 percent response rate) were undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students. In addition to collecting information about female respondents, including marital status, number of children, career plans, and employment, attention was directed to respondents' problems/needs, as well as the efficacy of university services, particularly the Women's Resources and Research Center (WRRC). While academic problems were the major ones, financial and health concerns were also important to the female students. Services female students viewed as important were: health care, financial aid, career and employment assistance, support for academic planning,  school orientation, and entertainment/recreation/sports. While women's needs for university services were generally being met adequately, certain populations had unmet needs, including divorced and older women in the areas of financial aid and employment, and women with preschoolers in the areas of child care and health insurance. About 67 percent of respondents had heard of WRRC and 35 percent had attended WRRC programs or used the center. The needs assessment questionnaire is appended. (SW)",

Comparisons of academic performance of athletes and other UC Davis undergraduates were also made. Of 1,042 male athletes during 1970-1979, 63 percent were regular admission students, 13 percent were special admission students (had not met the university's admission requirements), and 24 percent were unclassified. It was found that graduation rates of the athletes were high. Of the regularly admitted athletes during 1968-1973, 79 percent graduated, compared to 62-66 percent of regularly-admitted male students who were not athletes. For specially-admitted students, 57 percent of male athletes  graduated during the 6-year period, compared to 39 percent of male nonathletes. At the end of 2 years of college work, cumulative GPAs of the intercollegiate athletes were comparable to those of male students in general. Among the specially-admitted males, athletes had slightly higher grades than male students in general. Three sports had high percentages of specially-admitted students: football, basketball, and baseball. (Author/SW)",

The test's four scales measure ways that students cope with stress and the student's vulnerability to: stress from being frustrated or inhibited; having too much to do; and the presence of compulsive, time urgent, and excessively aggressive behavioral traits. The test involves a point system that gives respondents an idea of stress levels and the relative desirability of their coping strategies. The use of biodots, relaxation, and exercise to reduce stress is also briefly discussed. Biodots are dots connected to electrodes and  finger tips to show stress level based on color codes. The student can be trained to relax and can watch the biodots change color and learn to monitor the body's signals of stress. Students can also learn to relax through muscle tightening and relaxation exercise, as well as by walking, swimming, and other exercise. (SW)",

While both individual and group decision-making are addressed, emphasis is placed on the importance of group decisions on institutional policy planning. The model of Edmund M. Burke (1979) presents specific decision-making strategies in terms of conditions for effectiveness, techniques, the technology of change, and the planning phase. All group decision makers are actively involved and decisions occur through joint problem-solving. The key to the second model, that of James Lipham (1974), is that the college president needs to be aware of the perceptual screen that affects the decision maker (societal, organizational, and individual values). Lipham's model, which can be  used for individual or group decision-making, involves a systems analysis perspective for conducting a needs assessment. The third delegating problem-solving model, by Victor Vroom and Philip Yetton (1973), involves decision methods for individuals or a group, and may involve the college president and a single subordinate. Flow charts and tables illustrate the models, including a graphical depiction of the time line of Lipham's model. (SW)",

While the general criteria for program review and approval were very similar from state to state, differences were found for specific indicators of each criterion and the weight given to each criterion. In general, the criteria related to the purposes of the review and the type of board. Typical general criteria included: quality, need/demand, relation to institutional mission, cost for new programs, and productivity for existing programs. The existing and/or potential duplication of a  program was also frequently included as an evaluation criterion. There was increasing use of simple outcomes measures (e.g., information on program graduates, success on required professional examinations, entrance to graduate schools) in the review of existing programs. For the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, a chart indicates the authority of the state to recommend, approve, or discontinue programs by type of college/university.

The situation in Louisiana is used as illustration. One important consideration is communicating clearly the meaning of general education within the baccalaureate degree, based on cooperation between State Boards of Education and higher education institutions. Statewide definitions of baccalaureate education are needed in order to communicate expectations or requirements to secondary schools. Additional issues of school-articulation that SHEEO agencies should address include: the abilities that high school graduates should possess; the range of postsecondary experiences provided to students; assistance available to  students after they matriculate; standards for new teachers; and the appropriate authority for setting standards and curricula for high school teachers. In many states the overall responsibility for the governance of secondary schools and colleges is organized separately. Accountability for statewide educational policies is best achieved through the diffusion of power, characterized by different pathways to officeholding, multiple jurisdictions, and overlapping responsibilities.

However, such panaceas for educational problems fail because they do not address the real ingredients for successful instruction or the problems of large-scale implementation. Improvement in instruction, computer-based or not, will be a relatively slow, evolutionary process because: (1) attempts to improve instructional quality using systems approaches have shown how difficult it is to do and to manage; (2) use of computer-based instructional tools is in a rudimentary state of development; (3) improvements in instructional design technology depend on still-developing changes in the scientific base provided by the  cognitive and computer sciences; and (4) any widespread use of computer-based instruction (CBI) requires the acquisition and standardization of programs, provision for their distribution, and their incorporation into schooling. Therefore, the prospects for attaining large increments in instructional effectiveness depend on understanding of instructional psychology and cognitive science, and on the ability to implement CBI on a large enough scale to make a difference. The potential for improvement in instructional quality is here, and progress will be made, but it will not be rapid or revolutionary. (Author/LMM)",

Media Design Associates systematically investigated six ways to inexpensively transfer artwork to videodiscs. With each methodology, 204 pieces of varied artwork from the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study archives were transferred to a disc using various combinations of 35mm, and 16mm photography, and 1-inch videography. Analysis and evaluation of the resulting disc demonstrated that organizing the art was very important. Each of the six methodologies produced still frames with an acceptable range, but differences were discovered, and the best image quality and price and shortest time were accomplished using a state of the  art video recorder capable of recording single video frames. Results indicate that quality still frames of artwork can be recorded on laser videodiscs at a reasonable cost for educational use. Cost effective pictures of real objects may now contribute to computer mediated educational experiences. A 24-item bibliography is included. (Author/LMM)",

        "description":"The feasibility of guiding students of moderate aptitude to select appropriate learning strategies while they are learning an imaginary classification system was investigated in a study that contrasted the effect of system-assigned strategies for learning concepts with strategies selected by students. Subject-matter content was based on a set of imaginary particle systems similar to atoms or molecules. The classification system consisted of 10 major categories and encompassed approximately 200,000 unique instances. Subjects were 39 volunteers from a continuation high school, who used a computer program to explore the organization of the classification system by selecting and viewing paired examples of defined concepts and who received varied strategy recommendations. In the  computer system-assigned strategy treatment, students were given strategies for selecting matched examples and non-examples of concepts, remembering concept attributes, and reviewing concept definitions. In the student-assigned strategy treatment, students received non-directive placebo instructions. A 30-item classification post-test, administered immediately after program use, measured concept acquisition. Results showed a borderline treatment effect favoring the system-assigned strategies.

In the first experiment subjects were 52 graduate students from a southeastern university. Recall of information presented in written prose materials was assessed immediately following presentation of a prose-plus-picture (or prose-only) passage and again, 14 days later. The second experiment used 47 other graduate students and was similar to the first, but the delayed test was administered 26 days following the immediate test. Results suggest prose-relevant pictures do contribute to older learners' increased recall of prose materials. In both experiments, students who read prose  passages and viewed accompanying pictures remembered more of the information that was pictured and included in the prose passages than students who read the same prose passages without the pictures. Facilitative picture effects were observed in both immediate and delayed testing conditions. Seven references and one picture are included. (Author/LMM)",

Each of 44 eighth-grade mathematics students was given a self-esteem pretest questionnaire, completed a basic mathematics facts drill and practice CAI program with varying degrees of judgmental feedback, and was posttested on the self-esteem scale. The basic CAI program consisted of three sets of randomly generated multiplication fact drill and practice problems, with factors ranging from one to nine. The systematic feedback in the CAI programs used either affirmation of response only, affirmation plus positive reinforcement for correct responses, affirmation with negative  reinforcement for incorrect response, or affirmation plus positive and negative reinforcement. No statistically significant differences were found among the treatment groups, perhaps because of the short-term nature of the study. On the average, computer self-esteem scores increased somewhat for all the treatment groups, indicating that their attitudes towards CAI improved somewhat as a consequence of their exposure to the program.

A scale was developed to assess the degree to which the child's performance indicated a theory-testing orientation to the task. Part 2 of the study used stop-action video in training sessions with 112 of the subjects who were classified as ego oriented or theory oriented. Children were required to either: predict what the block on the fulcrum--stopped in action on the video replay--would do when the tape was reactivated; predict the placement from looking at the replay of the block stopped in midair just before  placement on the fulcrum; view the entire footage and summarize what they had just seen in the tape segment; or summarize their most recent attempt to balance a block.

        "description":"This paper argues that during the past two decades, research on teaching effectiveness can be identified with three differing paradigms: (1) the technical/&quot;scientific&quot;; (2) the humanistic; and (3) the person-centered paradigms. It is further proposed that if teaching is viewed as an art or craft and learning as an ever present process, rather than an &quot;event,&quot; the real complexity of the teaching/learning experience can be clarified, and that to accomplish this in a way different than the identification of discrete behaviors/outcomes, it is necessary to redefine the problems for analysis. A theory base or rationale is provided for the extensive use of video in the analysis of teaching, in order to clarify the theory-practice dilemma. A model is proposed for the analysis of teaching  through a process of self-reflection and critique, based on the problem-posing, dialogic model of Paulo Freire. It is suggested that use of such a model will require an extensive use of video with actual teaching/learning situations and the development of a framework for analyzing the teaching/learning process. Seventy-two references are listed. (LMM)",

Subjects were 132 undergraduate college students (40 males, 92 females) in professional education courses. The Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT, Wilkin et al., 1971) was used to identify students as field dependents, field independents, or neutral. The visual location task tested the subjects' ability to select a criterion picture from a group of three similar pictures after viewing three quadrants of the criterion picture in random order. In the linear treatment each quadrant of the criterion picture was presented separately for 2 seconds, one after another, followed by presentation of the criterion picture with the two  similar pictures for a total of 6 seconds. In the multiple treatment, each quadrant was presented simultaneously on the screen for 6 seconds. Field independents and neutrals both scored significantly higher on the visual location task than field dependents. Presentation mode did not affect performance, and there was no significant interaction between presentation mode and cognitive style. Six references are listed. (LMM)",

        "description":"The relationship between student personality traits and achievement with either mediated self-instruction or didactic large group instruction was investigated. Subjects were 159 female third-year nursing students at Loyola University of Chicago. Subjects received instruction on tracheostomy care and intravenous (I.V.) therapy through either a lecture or an autoinstructional filmstrip/cassette program. Personality traits were assessed using: (1) the Dogmatism Scale, measuring the openness of the individual's belief system; (2) the Internal-External Scale, measuring locus of control orientation; and (3) the Self-Esteem Inventory, covering peers, family, schools, and personality interests. The filmstrip program was superior to the lecture method for I.V. therapy instruction, and a  significant relationship was found between performance on the I.V. therapy test and high scores on the Self-Esteem Inventory. A very weak relationship was found between the instructional method employed and student performance on the tracheostomy care lesson. Findings suggest that analysis of the interactions between personality traits and type of instruction can assist teachers in assigning students to an instructional treatment. (LMM)",

        "description":"The relationship between teacher burnout and the use of various media in teaching was examined with data collected from 545 elementary and secondary teachers in the Fort Worth, Texas public school system. Subscales measured factors indicating teacher burnout, including teachers' perceptions of the degree of administrative support received, career satisfaction, ability to cope with the stresses related to teaching, and attitudes toward students. The Teacher Burnout Scale (Zager and Seidman, 1983), a demographic questionnaire, and a media utilization inventory were employed. Results suggest that teachers on the lower end of the four burnout dimensions tend to use certain media materials more frequently than teachers who are more burned out. Games, simulations, filmstrips, pictures,  models, and videotapes were more heavily utilized by low burnout teachers, although no discernible differences emerged for motion pictures and computers. The results also indicate that teachers tend to use media materials less, or not at all, as burnout feelings increase. Twenty-two references are listed. (LMM)",

Initial questions investigated the impact of the microcomputer on children's behavior, interactions, and responses to available software; and on the teacher's role. Data were fathered through: weekly observation for 4 months; a 14-hour videotape recording of children using the microcomputer; a student questionnaire about preferences for alternative instructional media, microcomputer software, and partners when working on varied tasks; and interviews. Subjects were 12 students, ages 7 to 9, in a combined second and third grade classroom in a private elementary school in a small rural community in Southern Illinois. Themes emerged regarding differences in  enthusiasm for the computer, sex differences, and age differences: (1) girls and boys alike expressed favorable attitudes toward the microcomputer, but boys were more interested in getting the machine to perform different functions; (2) among the older children, frequency of interaction surrounding the computer decreased during the study; (3) technical and logistical problems were frequent; and (4) introduction of the microcomputer placed many additional demands on the teacher.

Media for delivering treatments were one or more of either motion pictures, videotape copies of motion pictures, or color slide versions of motion pictures. Dependent variables were attitude toward either soil conservation, smoking, or disabled persons. It was found that realistic media, particularly motion pictures, are somewhat better at changing attitudes than non-realistic media; there is a relationship between  field independence and persuasive messages presented by film; attitudes can be modified by using persuasive messages delivered by media; and some types of media may be more effective than others at delivering information designed to change attitudes.

        "author":["Wilson, Brent G."],
        "description":"Computer based instruction (CBI) is composed of individual frames viewed one at a time. Compared to a typical textbook, CBI restricts the adult learner's capacity to access information from different parts of the lesson and to view complex presentations. Designers of CBI must compensate for these limitations by making a concerted effort to synthesize or tie together content parts, resulting in a coherent, stable cognitive structure in the learner's mind. Synthesizing strategies include: (1) using hard copy adjunct aids such as diagrams, figures, and content outlines; (2) implementing learner control features such as the menu and HELP options; (3) using graphic synthesizers such as lesson maps, diagrams, and other figures to periodically orient the learner toward the content  structure; (4) using animation, graphics, sound, and timing to highlight structurally central content parts; (5) using verbal synthesizers such as analogies, stories, and advance organizers to relate content to familiar experience; and (6) providing integrated practice and other opportunities allowing the application of multiple skills to complex problems. This report concludes by relating research on CBI strategies to a framework for instructional science and discussing potential research questions. (Author/LMM)",

A survey questionnaire was administered to a stratified sample of three populations: traditional, on-campus students attending classes in Laramie; nontraditional students attending classes at UW-Casper; and nontraditional, off-campus students attending extension classes throughout the state. A total of 1,022 questionnaires were administered; 80 were  discarded as being too incomplete leaving 942 questionnaires as the basis for the analysis. The results are analyzed by three principal means: overall frequencies, cross tabulations, and discriminant analysis. A discussion of the results and statistical appendices cover demographic data, reasons for attending school, opinions and perceptions of library services, a vocational preference inventory, and results of the discriminant analysis. The study provides information about the differences and similarities between on- and off-campus students and insight into ways library services to off-campus students can be improved. (THC)",

This final report presents project findings in multiple areas including: general usage of the resource directory, ILL volume and workload, turnaround time, routing-in sequence and load leveling, lenders' responses to the Pilot Moncat Project, and ILL protocols and procedures. Recommendations are made in the following areas: training, building the union catalog, the first Moncat, related technology, protocols, network development, public awareness, considerations for the future, and summary of major findings and recommendations.

        "description":"This paper opens with a brief description of three administrative options for implementing bibliographic instruction programs for college level students: (1) composition instructors teach their students research methods without working with librarians; (2) librarians offer separate library skills courses to the general student body; and (3) instructors and librarians cooperate in developing and implementing bibliographic instruction programs. Problems with the first two methods are discussed briefly, and the operations of an administrative partnership between the library and the English Department at the University of Illinois are described. These operations include logistics, benefits, and applications for other institutions. Five major benefits of such a partnership are  discussed. A checklist is presented for the classroom instructor with sections on needs assessment, department organization, library organization, and library instruction and orientation. A selected bibliography is included with sections on bibliographies/literature reviews; periodicals/columns devoted to bibliographic instruction; guidelines and recommendations; handbooks; theory, general discussion, and case studies; and librarian-English instructor cooperation.

        "description":"A study was conducted at LaGuardia Community College (LCC) to gather information on 1982 graduates entering the labor market, which industries were hiring graduates, salary data, transfer information, and comparison of LaGuardia graduates to those of comparable institutions. Questionnaires mailed to all 835 members of the class of 1982, telephone surveys, and additional data obtained from the Admissions Office provided information on 594 (71.1%) of the graduates. Study findings included the following: (1) curricular areas showing the largest increases in graduates over 1981 were data processing (+40%), occupational therapy (+45%), dietary technician (+166%), and secretarial science (+7.8%); while decreases were seen in liberal arts (-50%), business administration and management  (-13.5%), and human services (-32.1%); (2) secretarial science graduates accounted for the highest concentration of graduates in one curriculum (22.3%); (3) the transfer rate to senior colleges increased from 57.5% in 1981 to 58.7% in 1982; and (4) the average salary of a LCC graduate was $12,624, with liberal arts, business, and accounting graduates reporting the largest salary increases and data processing and human services graduates reporting slight salary decreases.

The studies have focused on trends in the numbers of transfers and the ethnicity, majors, and age of transfer students. Findings from the study of fall 1984 transfers, contrasted with findings from previous years, indicated that: (1) after a 1-year increase between fall 1982 and fall 1983 in the number of community college students who transferred to UC and CSU, the number decreased again between fall 1983 and fall 1984 to 35,391; (2) community college districts and campuses varied widely with respect to both the nature and the magnitude of change in the number of students who  transferred between fall 1983 and fall 1984; (3) community colleges experiencing the largest transfer losses tended to be those with a very high proportion of Black or Chicano freshman students; and (4) percentages of Black, Chicano, and Asian students among fall 1984 transfers to UC and CSU changed little from fall 1983, with slight decreases among Black students and slight increases among Chicano students for both segments.

A data file was initiated for the fall 1976 term of all students who had transferred to one of these three State Universities with an associate degree (N=2,459) and a similar group of native students who had entered one of the universities approximately 2 years earlier and had completed their lower division work (N=1,133). Data were collected on each subsequent quarter for the next several years to produce a longitudinal database. Study findings included the following: (1) transfer students had slightly lower term and  cumulative grade point averages (GPA's) than native students; (2) the greatest difference in fall 1976 GPA's was found among social science majors, with the native students having a 2.91 GPA and the transfer students earning a 2.31 GPA; (3) by fall 1977, it appeared that almost twice the percentage of transfer students as native students were no longer attending school; (4) transfer students were suspended at the end of a term at a rate three times higher than that of native students; (5) as of spring 1978, 38% of the native students and 21.9% of the transfer students in the original sample had been granted a baccalaureate degree; and (6) native students took more lower division courses than transfer students.

        "description":"In the context of a discussion of the role of developmental education in the nation's community colleges, this paper responds to criticisms of developmental education that have been made in recent years. First, the paper considers the role of developmental education in promoting literacy, examines definitions of literacy, highlights results of recent surveys showing the level at which particular courses are taught, and cites common reactions from college instructors to the low levels at which their courses are taught. Next, 10 criticisms of developmental education are presented and responded to, including: (1) the community college is the wrong place to provide developmental education; (2) developmental education costs too much; (3) developmental education should be taught in a  separate school; (4) there is insufficient articulation with secondary schools; (5) faculty members do not know how to teach literacy; (6) there is too much experimentation with too few results; (7) instructors ask too little of the students; (8) there are inconsistent standards used in the classroom; (9) placement and diagnostic tests are not valid; and (10) the support services are not worth what they cost. Responses to these criticisms highlight the fact that community colleges have little choice but to teach developmental education; discuss methods for holding down program costs; argue that all faculty should be involved in developmental education; point to areas in which articulation with secondary schools can be improved; suggest means of improving developmental instruction; and  outline ways in which developmental education can be integrated into the fabric of the institution.

After an executive summary of the study's objectives, background, and findings, the two phases of the project are described: (1) the collection and analysis of the available data to produce a population profile of the groups; and (2) the holding of dialogues between service providers and members of the immigrant groups. The dialogues, which were held in communities with high concentrations of the new wave populations, centered on the identification of specific problems and concrete solutions. Chapters 1 to 3, which discuss Southeast Asian refugees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and  Hispanic immigrants, include gross population profiles, selected demographic and socio-economic characteristics, labor force and economic characteristics, utilization of social support services, and specific problems encountered by the immigrant groups. These chapters provide selected essays on particular problems facing the immigrant groups and sub-populations. Chapter 4 discusses programs and policies related to helping new wave women enter the workforce. Chapter 5 presents major report recommendations in the areas of providing training programs; improving Job Training Partnership Act programs; providing child care and transportation; improving the collection of data; planning with diversity in mind; expanding mental health services; creating housing; improving the nature and delivery  of welfare benefits; clarifying the legal status of entrants; and reconsidering the plight of undocumented Hispanic women.

The project involved agreements between HJC and Mack Trucks, the largest employer in the college's service area. The first program developed, the HJC-Mack instructor exchange program, addressed the need to keep faculty updated on new technology and processes and to contribute to upgrading the skills of Mack employees. Within this exchange program, three Mack employees taught courses at HJC and college personnel presented 13 training activities for Mack employees ranging in length from 6 to 20 hours. The second program, the HJC-Mack personnel assignment program, involved HJC  personnel in reviewing the content of Mack's training program and the qualifications of the trainers providing the instruction. Under this arrangement, the Mack trainers submit the content of their programs and their credentials to the college for assessment. If a training activity has sufficient content for the awarding of credit and the trainer meets college teaching standards the workers taking the course can receive college credit. These programs benefit the college by checking enrollment decline, increasing college personnel's familiarity with industrial training and its applications, and by making faculty aware of the relevance of new technology in the classroom. The HJC-Mack agreements are appended. (HB)",

First, six distinct types of merit pay are identified, and the problems associated with all of these types are reviewed. Next, the four sources of funding are examined (i.e., federal, state, local, and private) and associated with different types of merit pay proposals and different kinds of developmental writing programs. Next, arguing that the most difficult issue to deal with in any merit  pay program is the evaluation process, the paper suggests nine elements for evaluating a developmental writing class. The immediate positive and negative effects of the application of merit pay to developmental writing are then identified, and an illustration of a plan for the implementation of merit pay in a developmental writing course for a typical English Department is provided. The illustration highlights that a simple merit pay system can be set up with modest funding, but that high intangible costs may be incurred to the department and school. (AYC)",

The database used for the study was the Basic Skills Validity Studies file, which contains records on all first-time-in-college students tested during the fall 1980-81 term, including information on the developmental and core courses taken by the students and the total credits carried during the term. Study findings indicated that taking extra coursework beyond developmental and core courses during the first term improved student retention. For students with low basic skills levels, optimal retention occurred when a mix of core, developmental, and extra coursework was taken. Students who chose to take only developmental courses had  quite low retention rates, as did students who chose to take only non-developmental/non-core courses. While the retention rate for part-time students was generally much lower than that for full-time students, in every case the selection of an extra course during the first term improved retention.

        "description":"The educational reform movement of the 1980's has sought to deal with the current problems in the educational system of declining standards, unprepared students, and low levels of morale among teachers by seeking to impose higher and more rigorous standards to restore academic quality. The experience, however, of excellent business companies in the United States suggests that the road to excellence in education lies in shifting the focus of attention back to the individual and to ways of enhancing her/his creativity; emphasizing efforts to turn average students into \"winners\" rather than stressing the exceptional students and excluding the rest; and trusting the practitioners--teachers and principals--and encouraging their creativity. The solution to the current malaise in  education lies in creating the conditions that make it possible for individuals to get the power to experiment, create, develop, test, and innovate; and in stimulating the ordinary people who inhabit our schools to unusual effort that will result in excellence. If the schools are to meet the foreseeable demands of a society that requires lifelong learning, the requirements will be threefold: (1) to demonstrate to all students that they are capable of learning and that learning is a useful and satisfying skill that will serve them well throughout their lives; (2) to provide the cognitive skills that serve as the basic tools for lifelong learning; and (3) to gradually put students in charge of their own learning so that they can make choices from among the multiple learning options that  will face them as adults.

        "description":"A review of the literature is presented on developmental mathematics courses in two- and four-year colleges and universities. The paper is organized within the categories of status studies, placement, program evaluation, class management, student characteristics, and thought processes. Highlights of the report include: (1) an average of 2.0 remedial mathematics courses were offered in a carefully constructed sample of all colleges and universities in the United States; (2) the format in which courses were most often presented was the lecture-discussion method; (3) 20% to 40% of the colleges with students in developmental mathematics placed them with an examination, while 71% felt they ought to do so; (4) research indicated that older students benefited more from developmental  courses than younger students; and (5) one study indicated that 68% of students in developmental education courses had taken similar courses before. Finally, a critique of the research is presented, indicating that many studies were superficial or methodologically weak; the number of students was small; there was little external funding for reseach; few studies examined the experience of minority groups in developmental mathematics programs; and a tenuous relationship existed between the studies with little cross referencing or building upon earlier studies. A five-page list of references is included. (HB)",

        "description":"In fall 1983, work began on the development of a new transfer program at the Community College of Philadelphia. The process began with the replacement of the typical set of introductory courses with a 12-hour curricular unit in which the lectures, readings and other activities were coherently integrated. An &quot;Introduction to Social Science&quot; course would serve as the first offering of the new Transfer Education program. The program combined curriculum and staff development activities designed to ground students in the concepts, vocabulary, and methods of the social sciences, and to prepare long-time faculty members to rethink their pedagogical goals and procedures. The staff development component centered on writing across the curriculum, faculty mentoring, and seminar work, while  a main program element involved the integration of writing into the intellectual agenda of the program. In January 1984, the program began with two sections of students taking the initial &quot;Introduction to Social Science&quot; semester. Later, in spring 1984, a faculty group from the Humanities Division began a planning process to construct the curriculum for the second &quot;Introduction to Humanities&quot; semester. The program not only received enthusiastic response from faculty, but it resulted in high rates of student satisfaction accompanied by lower rates of attrition for students of the program. Problems that remain to be solved include a continuing need to reorient faculty in terms of their goals and the pedagogical process; the need to develop a more integrated college curriculum; ways to  include part-time students in the program; ways of improving counseling support; ways to improve articulation with four-year institutions; and ways of institutionalizing the program.

The first study sought to assess the proportion of associate of arts (AA) graduates passing at least three of four of the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST) subtests who had taken prior developmental course work. The study found that among students who passed three of four CLAST subtests there was virtually no difference in the percentage pass rate between students who took no developmental courses and those who took only one, though the pass rate for those who took more than one developmental class dropped dramatically. Using the criterion of passing four of four CLAST subtests, there was a  difference between students who took one developmental class (57.8% passed) and those who took no developmental classes (73.6% passed). The second study sought to determine the number of students who were initially not eligible to enter the state university system on the basis of their test scores who succeeded in passing all four of the CLAST subtests. Study findings revealed that of 195 students not eligible to enter the state university, 97 passed all four CLAST examinations and 151 passed at least three of four subtests and were hence eligible to transfer to the state university system.

Community college administrators must take on the role of leaders (i.e., those who infuse an organization with values) rather than managers (i.e., those who seek to efficiently operate the organization within the framework of values and directions already determined). One of the first tasks of these community college leaders will be to establish an academic strategy, which looks beyond the most efficient way to accomplish current activities to see whether those activities are relevant to the rapidly changing external environment. As leaders, community college  administrators must give greater priority to the development of long-range academic plans for curricula and programs. Program assessment goes hand-in-hand with program planning. If approached seriously, program assessment results in substantive instructional and administrative changes. The main criteria to be considered in program evaluation are the demand for, quality of, and cost of the programs. Based on these criteria, a number of instructional decisions are made, with respect to learning objectives, instructional methods, and devoted resources. The quality of these decisions depends upon the quality of the information upon which they are based. Statewide programs, such as the Program Data Monitoring System in Maryland, help provide colleges with such information for their use in  program assessment efforts. (AYC)",

        "description":"A total of 96 students identified as academically at risk were selected to participate in an extended-day kindergarten program featuring small class size and a whole-language approach to the curriculum and learning. High-risk students attended regular morning kindergarten classes as well as the extended-day sessions; comparison students attended morning classes only. Additional instruction time for the high-risk students ranged from 119 to 242 hours, depending upon which of five participating schools the students attended. A pretest posttest design was used to compare gains on the Listening subtest of the California Achievement Test, Part C, made by 33 students participating in five extended-day classrooms with gains made by 191 students in the same or similar schools who  attended half-day kindergarten classes. A similar analysis was performed on gains on the &quot;Prueba Boehm de Conceptos Basicos&quot; made by 14 participants and 27 nonparticipants with limited English-speaking ability. The extended-day kindergarten was found to have a positive effect on the achievement of students regardless of students' language background. Program participants made statistically and educationally significant gains on standardized tests and on teacher ratings of classroom performance. In one school, where all 29 students participated in two extended-kindergarten classrooms, pretest posttest gains on the Metropolitan Readiness Test were higher than in previous years. (Author/RH)",

It also examines some of the policies presently being discussed by school districts. Three types of homework are briefly delineated: practice assignments, preparation assignments, and extension assignments. Conflicting research findings regarding the relationship of homework to academic achievement are discussed and a recommendation is made that school districts should determine whether homework, as they define and construct it, meets the district's educational objectives. Several questions are presented to help determine what issues should be considered when developing homework policies. The digest  concludes that individualized homework assigned to appropriate grade levels seems to help students develop the disciplined study skills that result in increased scholastic achievement.

The following changing family patterns affecting the choice of full-day kindergarten programs are discussed briefly: (1) an increase in the number of working parents; (2) an increase in the number of children who have had preschool or day care experience; (3) an increase in the influence of television and family mobility on children; and (4) renewed interest in academic preparation for later school success. Some of the reasons affecting alternative scheduling for kindergarten are stated as state school funding formulas, busing  and transportation costs, and availability of classroom space and teachers. It is concluded that while both full-day and half-day programs have advantages and disadvantages, the length of the school day is only one dimension of the kindergarten experience. As long as the curriculum is developmentally appropriate and intellectually stimulating, either type of scheduling can provide an adequate introduction to school. (RH)",

Legal information regarding the separation and divorce, which also serves as a measure of acrimony, was collected from public court records. Several variables assessing interparent acrimony, including legal variables, were found to be significantly related to children's adjustment problems. Both the length of time since the physical separation and the amount of father contact during the post-separation period moderated the relationship between interparent acrimony and children's adjustment.

Fifty-one families responded to an assessment battery that measured affective relations between parents and their adolescent children. Measures included the Transition into Adolescence Survey; the Interactive Behavior Questionnaire; the Parental Control Questionnaire; the Decision-Making Questionnaire; and the Issues Checklist. Families were classified into prepubertal, transpubertal, or postpubertal groups according to their modal response on Tanner's (1962) physical status criteria. A stepwise discriminant analysis was performed to identify measures that maximize between groups differences. Based on that analysis, a correct classification rate of 70 percent was  achieved. A multiple discriminant analysis was then performed to determine if these groups could be classified based upon their resposes to the entire assessment battery. Based on this analysis, a correct classification rate of 86 percent was achieved. The two significant discriminant functions that emerged indicate that changes in family relationships are related to the transformation of mother-adolescent and father-adolescent relations. These results are discussed with respect to the dimensionalization of change in the affective nature of family relations during adolescence. (Author/RH)",

Forty-nine children between 36 and 73 months of age participated in a two-part interview which assessed gender constancy, knowledge and notions of flexibility in sex stereotypes, perceptions of similarities between themselves and pictured children, preferences for sex-typed toys, and schematic-based processing of toy preferences. Overall analyses indicated that children's knowledge of sex-role stereotypes for their own and the opposite sex and their preferences for sex-appropriate, neutral, and inappropriate toys  were best predicted by their level of gender schematization. Gender constancy stage was unrelated to any of the dependent measures. Finally, children's perceptions of similarities between themselves and other children appeared to focus largely on gender and toy-stereotype characteristics regardless of the age, stage of gender constancy, or degree of gender schematization. Findings support the use of a gender schematic approach to sex-role socialization and challenge the use of the construct of gender constancy. (Author/RH)",

A total of 293 boys and girls drawn from fourth through eleventh grades responded to a theoretically derived questionnaire developed for the study. Findings supported a cognitive-developmental progression in the acquisition of grading concepts. Older and higher-achieving students understood grading constructs better than younger and lower-achieving students. Student attitudes about grades also followed a developmental course. Dissatisfaction and cynicism related to grading practices increased with  age, as did ratings of the self-importance of grades. Attributional scores partially supported predictions from social-learning theory and research. Younger students and low achievers were more likely to attribute grades to external and uncontrollable factors, while high achievers and older students attributed grades to internal and controllable factors. Contrary to prediction, males made more external attributions and females made more internal attributions. Although effort attributions increased with age, ability attributions remained unchanged across grade levels. Findings are discussed in terms of cognitive-developmental and social-learning theory, implications for school practice, and future research. (Author/RH)",

Subjects, whose cognitive and language development had been followed experimentally since the age of 6 months, were nonretarded 30-month-olds from middle class families. Videotapes were made of the children's spontaneous behavior with dolls and a stuffed toy, miniature toys, and junk materials. Pretend actions and utterances were grouped into the categories of decentration, decontextualization, and integration. Findings indicated that a majority of children reached the levels of active other-directed, substitutive, and multischeme expressions in both actions and  utterances. However, it was suggested that the combination of modeling and feeding utensils would significantly increase the proportion of children showing inventive expressions. Developing skills such as active other-directed actions toward lifelike objects, substitutive actions for physical dissimilarity between the signifier and the signified, substitutive utterances other than naming, and inventive actions of object use were also interpreted to be facilitated by modeling. Since the roles of actions and utterances were not always the same in pretend play, it was suggested that further studies on multimodal aspects of pretend play are needed. (RH)",

Preconventional stage children 9 years of age were paired in same-sex dyads with 9- and 11-year-old children intermediate between preconventional and conventional stage reasoning. Six legal contravention vignettes were given to all subjects in individual interviews as a pretest. For each vignette, six questions were asked: four were designed to tap children's levels of legalistic awareness on Piagetian moral judgment dimensions and two tested supplementary dimensions of social rule perception. Subjects then played a board game that reintroduced the pretest items. In the interpersonal conflict condition, questions were asked  of players that encouraged conflict, discussion, and agreement. In the intrapersonal condition, conventional statements were presented to individual players that conflicted with their earlier preconventional judgments; subjects were asked to accept or reject the conflicting statement and explain their decision. Immediate and delayed posttest interviews introducing novel test items were administered to assess stage advancement. The pattern of change from pre- to posttests supports Piaget's view of cognitive conflict. Intrapersonal conflict subjects advanced more than control subjects, indicating that the social coordination of perspectives is not a prerequisite for advancement. Children can advance by means of an internal perception of conflict and a subsequent restructuring of their  knowledge. (RH)",

Integration of these two approaches in a course of instruction is discussed, and themes around which such instruction can be organized are delineated. Teachers are urged to recognize that (1) they are training developmental psychologists to make choices different from those of the traditional graduate student; (2) the role of the traditional mentor is often not appropriate in the context of  training students to effectively influence policy decisions; (3) they should not pretend to know everything about social policy; (4) they should instill realistic expectations about the role of scientists in the policy arena without promoting cynicism; and (4) they should make sure students appreciate the special value of their &quot;traditional&quot; training as psychologists.

Mother EVR's were coded according to syntactic form, type of cue for child response, and complexity of the child's expected response. Developmental trends were apparent across all three dimensions. Diversity of mother EVR's and complexity of expected child response were correlated with increases in the mean length of children's utterances (MLU). Generally, EVR's requiring more complex child responses and providing fewer cues increased with child age and MLU. The mother's feedback for child responses to various cues was correlated with her  use of EVR's including those cues, and with complexity of child's expected response. Individual analyses of three hierarchical levels of cues (modeling, direct requests for label, and open-ended information/opinion seeking questions) revealed different developmental trends for each cue level.

Among kibbutz mothers 23 lived on familial kibbutzim where children slept at home, and 22 lived on communal kibbutzim where children slept apart from their parents. Questionnaires assessed the mothers' perceptions of mother and caregiver influence and their use of disciplinary and nurturant techniques. Whereas the amount of time did not contribute to variations in role  perceptions, childrearing ideology (sole versus shared socialization responsibility) showed strong effects. In accord with nuclear family ideology, daycare mothers perceived mothers as more influential and as using more of all socializing techinques than caregivers. In accord with their ideology of shared responsibilities, kibbutz mothers perceived caregivers to be as influential as mothers. Further, as specified by kibbutz ideology, kibbutz mothers reported that they used nurturance more and disciplinary techniques less than caregivers. The importance of cultural ideology on parents' role perceptions is discussed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The present study involved a meta-analysis of 157 studies in which only children were compared with individuals raised with siblings. Findings failed to confirm the persistent negative stereotype of only children as maladjusted and disadvantaged. In fact, results suggested that only children are advantaged with respect to intelligence, educational and occupational attainment, achievement motivation, self-esteem, leadership, and relations with their parents. Many of these advantages are sustained even when social class and ethnicity are controlled. Only children and children with siblings were also found to be comparable in terms of academic performance, peer popularity, extraversion, autonomy, maturity, anxiety, mental illness, and behavior problems. In none of the 14 areas  examined was there evidence that only children are handicapped by the absence of siblings. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"With or without the support of research, clinicians must make judgments concerning relations between different areas of psychological functioning. Recently, studies have been made of possible relations between different areas of mental activity, including logical and emotional conception and social, emotional, and perceptual functioning. Nannis suggests that an understanding of children's concepts of emotions has important implications for the therapeutic process and points out that insight-oriented therapy must take into account developmental limitations in children's ability to conceptualize emotions. Gordon posits the structure of adolescents' logical thinking as a determinant of their social judgments and behavior. Slotnick argues that autistic children's social resistance,  deficits in information processing, and deficient self-regulatory abilities are responsible in part for the retardation observed in their logical structural development. However, in order to determine the existence of relationships, it is important to have a good understanding of phenomena thought to be related. In general, the effort to apply structuralist theory to clinical issues comes up against problems of distinguishing and determining relations between structure and content, between structure and function, and between one structural domain and another.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the social support network of mothers with high risk infants and the relation between support and mother-infant interactive behavior. Two issues were investigated: who gave what kind of support to the mother as a function of her infant's birth status; and the relation between type of support and mother-infant interaction in risk and nonrisk dyads. Subjects were 90 infants and their mothers who participated in a longitudinal study on the consequences of high risk birth. Infants were classified by maturity and health into four diagnostic groups: healthy and sick preterm and healthy and sick term. Families participating were all poor, inner city residents of New York City. Sixty-five percent were Hispanic and 28 percent were Black. The  remaining seven percent were Caucasian. Results indicate that the number of persons giving support and the type of support given is related to the health status of the child at birth. This differential support may mediate the mother's interactive behavior with her infant during the early months of life. Support to the mother of a sick infant, whether that support involves goods or services, seems to positively reinforce the mother's behavior toward her infant, facilitating more proximal and less distal interaction during the early months of infancy.

        "description":"Parent ability to diagnose the cause of non-contingent crying in an infant was investigated through use of a new methodological instrument. Problems programmed on a microcomputer presented 25 information units leading to only one correct causal hypothesis about infant crying and 25 information units similarly structured about an adult woman's insomnia. Subjects were 30 college-educated, upper-middle class women divided into four groups: inexperienced in infant caregiving, primiparae, multiparae, and (nulliparous) pediatric nurses. All subjects were instructed to select the fewest and only the most important information units in order to determine which of nine causal hypotheses was correct. Results suggest that women with some infant caregiving experience are, on average, more  efficient and accurate in diagnosing the cause of crying in babies than women who have not had that experience. The three experienced groups (primiparous, multiparous, and nurses) only differed reliably from the nulliparous group, suggesting a novice-expert dichotomy. Nevertheless, the nulliparae performed surprisingly well, suggesting a cultural effect involving the provision of experiences to women to aid them in their future task of mothering. It is concluded that the use of computer-presented problems offers a promising new approach for addressing cognitive and cognitive-behavioral questions. (RH)",

The children had been observed for several months prior to the interviews to identify reciprocal patterns of interaction. A total of 8 girls and 9 boys with a mean age of 35 months and their mothers participated in study 1. In study 2, children had a mean age of 28.5 months and six of the total of 16 were girls. Mothers' reports indicated that nearly all of the children in both studies talked regularly about their preschool peers. When, in study 1, sample verbalizations were rated and compared, children in reciprocal  relationships were found to differ from those without reciprocal partners in the mode used to describe peers. This difference did not emerge in study 2. Mothers of children in the first study were able to correctly identify their children's preschool friends. Mothers in study 2 were not. Findings indicate that the study of toddler friendships can involve dimensions beyond the identification of interaction patterns, if approached in a way that takes into account the capabilities of children of that age.

Eight families from a sample of 30 families who had been filmed on four occasions during evening meals are discussed as case studies. Two families chosen from each cell of a 2 x 2 factorial design consisting of family structure (one versus two parents) by grandmother's domicile (living with versus living away from the family) were coded to indicate the frequency family members spoke to one another. These frequencies were used to compute conditional probabilities representing the likelihood of a particular family member's interaction. The most significant findings were (1) a homogeneous interaction pattern in which the child(ren) and the adult(s) had an equal opportunity to  converse with one another; (2) a dyadic asymmetric interaction pattern in which adults talked more frequently to one another than to the child(ren); and (3) a focal asymmetric interaction pattern in which a single adult or an only child spoke first and second more often than did other family members. It was suggested that, overall, the functional relationships of adult-child interaction patterns in black families have several implications for the socialization of black children. While the generality of these results are limited due to the nature of the case study approach, they do suggest important hypotheses for further research. (Author/RH)",

The study thus focused on (1) the effects on the individual's planning skills of having worked with an adult or with a peer and (2) the differences between individual and collaborative planning. Findings indicated that adult-child dyads planned their routes with significantly more explicit references to the strategies to be used in planning and to the definition and characteristics of the problem. Children who had collaborated with adults produced much more efficient plans than those who had worked with peers. Extent to which the dyad had determined sequences of moves  predicted subsequent individual performance.

Project staff and local Community Health Representatives (CHRs) completed 82 developmental assessments, made more than 400 home visits, and provided ongoing educational services to 27 handicapped infants and toddlers and their families. Project evaluation assessed the effect of paraprofessional training for CHRs, the impact of home intervention, and the handicapped children's developmental progress. In each case beginning and end-of-year results were compared using correlated t-tests. CHRs self-reports of knowledge and competency reflected significant growth in the four key areas addressed by inservice training, particularly  interacting with parents. To measure the impact of home intervention, PIPE staff members completed the &quot;Parent Behavior Progression&quot; checklist with 21 families. Ratings indicated significant improvement in parenting skills over the year. Developmental assessments with 20 of the children served showed significant raw score gains; differences between predicted and observed gains were not significant. Correlations between project related variables and child progress suggest that parenting skills are related to rate of child progress, i.e., the project's aim of training parents also benefits the children.

According to NCES' data, more than 21 million adults ages 17 and older participated in some form of adult education; nearly 6 million, or 28%, lived in rural areas. Although there were some differences, data were remarkably similar for rural and urban respondents. Nearly three-fourths of all respondents were ages 23-50. Women were the majority of participants. The predominant intent for participation was occupational advancement or  personal development. The notion that rural adults were interested in education only for remedial or recreational purposes, if at all, was refuted. The augmentation study selected five representational postsecondary institutions in the midwest because of the high incidence of adult learners in their programs, their rural settings, and the ease of acquiring survey data from the students. A questionnaire, which was designed to be compatible with the NCES survey instrument, elicited responses very similar to the NCES sample, suggesting that adults want access to quality education wherever they live. The report has numberous tables; the augmentation survey form is included. (BRR)",

        "description":"Begun in June 1984, the national study utilized questionnaires from 461 rural education researchers and practitioners to provide the first empirical data for prioritization of rural education research needs. Since conducting and supporting rural education research are clearly federal functions, the study was prepared for dissemination to federal agencies and elected officials and designed to focus on activating the research agenda and acting on its implications. Respondents rated 46 research questions and prioritized 13 themes. Nine research clusters were thus identified and rank ordered: rural school effectiveness, governance and finance, staff training needs (technology as a resource), teaching styles and incentives, field-based personnel preparation, preservice preparation,  personnel recruitment and retention, school-community interaction, and rural versus non-rural factors. Rural practitioners and researchers were in agreement in prioritizing the importance of the clusters. Twelve recommendations/ implications are given that should be addressed by the federal government in support of efforts related to the prioritized clusters. Nineteen tables provide information on: ranking of questions within clusters by &quot;importance to the field&quot; and &quot;personal interest&quot;; respondents' positions, institutions, and general/special education orientation; number of respondents by federal region and general/special education orientation; detailed information about rankings; and regional differences by clusters. The rural education research questionnaire is appended. Numerous  tables and the survey instrument are included. (BRR)",

Of this number 15,038 students were enrolled in regular school programs, 520 in the Secondary Credit Exchange (SCE), and 2,584 in the Early Childhood program. Fifty-seven districts reported that 8,182 students in K-12 received basic skills instruction. Better than half of those students were served by reading and oral development projects in English. In the Secondary Credit Exchange, over 2,000 students earned an average of 5.24 credits in 17 subject areas. The most commonly used service model was the Pullout Model where children were given additional exposure to basic skills. Of the 290  full-time equivalent staff members hired in 1983, 250 were funded through migrant education funds. The Migrant Education Center provided recruitment services and inservice, and tutoring projects, and established a new center in Sunnyside. Although academic assessment indicated a general improvement over the past five years, migrant children still deserved additional academic assistance as all scores fell below the 50th percentile. Mini-Corps provided 763 children summer instruction and 171 children recreational services. Two contracted agencies provided health services to over 5,800 students. (PM)",

The address by Barbara Zang discusses specific skills and techniques for influencing state and federal policy and emphasizes the need for service providers to understand and be involved in the legislative process. The address by Everett D. Edington considers the process of change in rural schools and communities and cites characteristics of rural schools which affect willingness to change, e.g., their multiple functions, their limited and precarious economic base, and rural fears of federal colonialism. Synopses of 13 workshop  topics, amounting to nearly half the report, cover transition from early childhood handicapped programs to public schools, interagency coordination, lobbying, service delivery strategies, inservice training, fund raising, staff recruitment and retention, parent involvement, transportation, and the development of rural networks for early intervention programs. The conference evaluation report includes ratings of each event for quality and usefulness and sample responses to 10 open-ended questions concerning strengths and weaknesses of the conference.

Papers by Susan Hastings and Stewart Gabel summarize physician attitudes toward early intervention and suggest ways to obtain physician involvement. Suggestions for improving physicians' cooperation include informing them of intervention program services and convincing them of program validity. Papers by Charlene Rydell and Ruth Jones, Stephanie Parks, Sharon Kiefer, and Mary Morse and Barbara Kruger describe four model early intervention programs which successfully collaborate with  local medical professionals and/or community hospitals. Topics include initial planning, program design, coordination with existing services, linkage with hospitals, staff recruitment, funding sources and program effectiveness (increased physician referrals, lower age of new referrals). Papers by Esther Tesh and Sarah Strauss and Kenneth Axtell provide an overview of the administration, organization, and priorities of community hospitals and are intended to help non-medical professionals work within that structure. Information includes functions of 19 hospital staff positions and basic steps to follow when communicating with medical staff concerning a particular child admitted to the hospital. (JHZ)",

        "description":"To examine effects of ethnicity, SES, and residence on students' participation in formal clubs, activities, and sports, a survey was administered to 1,450 students at a county-wide consolidated high school in southern Appalachia. The purpose was to investigate the significance of Appalachian ethnicity as an explanation for behavior and to understand factors influencing internal social structure in high schools. The survey included three general sections. The first elicited background information to establish students' family ties to Appalachia, SES, and residence; the second elicited information concerning past and present participation in high school clubs, etc.; the third asked questions about employment, after-school work at home, and transportation. Participation in various  activities was then compared separately with SES, residence, and ethnicity. All of the variables of SES, residence, and Appalachian ethnicity showed significant relationships to the level of participation and the type of participation. Students who were Appalachian, rural, and from the lower socioeconomic class participated in clubs, activities, and sports significantly less than did non-Appalachian students who resided in town and were from the middle or upper socioeconomic class. Residence and SES strongly mediated the influence of ethnicity; higher SES and town residence appeared to overcome the liabilities of being Appalachian. (CHG)",

Further, a new Department policy declared that &quot;rural education shall receive an equitable share of the information, services, assistance, and funds available from and through the Department of Education and its programs.&quot; This policy then listed 10 initiatives such as monitoring, expanding data bases, including rural institutions in pilot projects, and others. An annual  rural forum is also sponsored; last year's forum included Iowa's model program in its 21 exemplary projects. These projects included partnerships involving corporations and communities, schools and townships, etc. All of the successful programs have clearly defined needs and goals. To propogate this success, the Intra-Agency Committee has created four subcommittees on the annual forum, research, data and staff seminars, and the Secretary's awards program. As rural economies become more diversified, and as urban-rural migration continues, new partnerships will help assure that rural communities have quality education. (PM)",

Respondents indicated that migrant &quot;wellness&quot; and disease prevention should be a coordinated effort, led by migrant health projects and migrant education programs. The major barrier to adequate health care was high cost, compounded by the migrant environment and life style and lack of information. Teachers, outreach workers, and nurses  were seen as the most influential in promoting good health practices and also were the major health providers. Dental health, nutrition, fitness, and substance abuse were the most important instructional areas. Parents' health values and beliefs, their present health knowledge, and an awareness of the barriers to good health habits were essential to the teaching process. Materials should be designed to be integrated with existing curriculum. Dental health materials were needed most.

Respondents indicated a high incidence for both minor and major illnesses; they showed a strong desire for information, with one-third of the families wanting more information on each of the illnesses.  Data on perceptions and treatments of illnesses showed areas of sophisticated knowledge and areas where information is badly needed. Health education should emphasize key disease processes, migrant control over their own health status, and knowing when to seek professional help for illness. Because of the socio-cultural diversity of migrants in the United States, this survey should be conducted with other special populations.

The survey was distributed to MERLIN's consortium members (16 state departments of education and 3 national clearinghouses with migrant interests) and others knowledgeable about migrant health and/or education. Twenty-five respondents completed the survey (11 consortium members; 14 others). Respondents were asked to rate each of the 12 chosen scopes and each of the topics within each scope on a 5-point scale ranging from definitely change to definitely not change. Based on the  responses, the following scopes were identified as needing major revision: Administration, Cultural Studies, Dropout Prevention, Educational Programs, Parent and Community Involvement, and Special Education. Career Education, English as a Second Language, Bilingual Education, Health and Human Services, Identification and Recruitment, and Vocational Education were the scopes identified as needing minor revision. The Migrant Student Record Transfer System scope did not need any changes. It was suggested that the ERIC thesaurus be used as the basis for the categorization and retrieval system, replacing the current scopes and topics. (PM)",

This study is an attempt to partially replicate and extend the findings of research by Paul Ankeny and Lyle Joyce who found significant positive correlations between a paper and pencil Piagetian test and manipulation Piagetian tasks. It was hypothesized that the scores obtained by 50 fourth-grade students on Ankeny and Joyce's Piagetian Reasoning Test would be positively correlated with the number of manipulative tasks mastered by the students. The Reasoning Test is group administered; it consists of 30 objective questions and assesses operations such as: conservation (of weight, length, area  and volume), one-to-one correspondence, class inclusion, transitivity, Euclidean space, spatiality, and velocity. Students were given the Reasoning Test (and classified as concrete operational if they demonstrated mastery on eight or more operations) and were interviewed using Piagetian tasks which paralleled the 10 operations on the Reasoning Test. Results show that a significantly larger portion of students demonstrated concrete operational thought process on task interviews as compared to printed (and oral) questions reflecting the same operations. Implications for decisions concerning the selection of instructional materials and methods are also addressed. (JN)",

Level of subjects' performance in formal tasks (subjects included 319 students from urban schools and 92 students from kibbutzim and small villages) was measured using a video-taped group test (VTGT) demonstration. The VTGT measured conservation and volume displacement, proportional reasoning, control of variables, combinatorial analysis, probabilistic reasoning, and correlational reasoning.  Among the findings are those showing: that boys surpassed girls in VTGT performance in grades 7 through 11; that although the percentage of formal reasoners increased with age, half of the students in the total sample were in the concrete operational reasoning stage (this finding strengthens the universality of Piaget's cognitive development model); and a higher rate of cognitive development was found for kibbutzim students compared to urban students.

        "description":"A sociometric survey examined the informal faculty development network existing within the School of Nursing at East Tennessee State University. During the fall 1983 semester, all 25 nursing faculty members at the school were asked to complete a self-report instrument dealing with patterns of seeking and providing advice regarding their role as a teacher. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis techniques were used to uncover the latent or emergent structure of a faculty development network at the school. It was concluded that little informal sharing of information existed between members of the associate and baccalaureate degree programs. New faculty members appeared to linger at the fringes of the faculty development networks and therefore did not have access to  suggestions from colleagues. Part-time faculty members were more likely to act as isolates in the teaching development network. The principle of homophily seemed to be operating, as faculty members selected others with whom to interact concerning professional development. Those members who were alike in terms of years since graduate school tended to cluster together. The results of this study were seen as demonstrating the utility of the techniques of multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis in a research study of this nature. (MN)",

According to the literature, many practitioners view career indecision as a normal task of development whereas others see indecision as related to serious psychological problems such as anxiety, self-perceptual difficulties, and externalized attributions. Several of those theories that postulate career indecision as a normal part of the development were reviewed. One of those theories, which views the decision-making process as extending over the individual's lifetime and as being composed of a period of anticipation and a period of implementation and adjustment, was used  as the basis for the development of the following three goals for those individuals assisting students in the career decision-making process: (1) help students gain self-knowledge, (2) assist students in acquiring information about careers and alternatives open to them, and (3) aid students in their career preparation. Specific strategies for use in attaining these goals, as well as a list of works dealing with career indecision and career choice, are included. (MN)",

        "description":"A study examined the effects of participation in Adult Basic Education (ABE) on quality of life. To gather data for the study, researchers mailed packages of questionnaires to the supervisors of 89 ABE programs that served 2,225 students throughout Tennessee. Packages of completed survey instruments were returned from 72 of these programs, thus providing data concerning 1,623 ABE students from the potential sample. Based on an analysis of the completed survey instruments, it was concluded that ABE is having a positive impact on the quality of life of the individuals participating in it. ABE program participation was perceived as having a positive effect on the individual in terms of self-expression, self-concept, family life, leisure, relationships with others, life in general,  and the individual's function as a member of society. Males, older males, and those who have been in the program longest tended to be more positive than did other groups regarding the impact of ABE in improving quality of life. Since data indicated that older adults are more positive in their perceptions concerning the variables measured, it was recommended that ABE teachers and administrators review their curricula to see if the needs of young adults are being met.

Research was limited to adult basic education programs funded by Federal and state monies and operated through the public school systems of Ohio. The literature review indicated that the Adult Education Act was enacted to eradicate poverty by providing the undereducated, underemployed, and poor adult with the basic reading and writing skills needed to retain or obtain employment. The literature revealed that the Federal Government authorizes and establishes funding levels and regulations and the 50 states serve as a bridge between the Federal level and their respective  education agencies. The literature further indicated that, at best, the legislation is minimally serving the stated goals. Those benefitting the most were the secondary level students who are achieving General Educational Development certificates and gaining skills necessary to upgrade, retain, or obtain employment. Findings led to such recommendations as a philosophical and financial commitment beyond current legislation, institution of specialized programs for the target population, design of evaluations to measure stated outcomes, and support of the thrust to eradicate illiteracy.

From the estimated 4,000 certified operators in water utilities, waste water treatment plants, and plant superintendents surveyed, 723 (18 percent) completed questionnaires were processed for this report. Conclusions about the respondents, water utilities, and wastewater systems in general include the following: (1) nearly half of the respondents worked in wastewater systems only, while about one-fourth each worked in water utility systems only and in both water utility and wastewater systems; (2) more than 90 percent of respondents had taken at least one course relevant to their job, with more  than half having taken it within the last two years; (4) the 12 hours of continuing education required every two years for recertification were endorsed as &quot;about right&quot; by about 80 percent of the respondents; (5) technical subjects were the most frequently desired to improve operations, while general subjects were the most commonly desired for personal development; (6) the most highly desired areas for training in water utility subjects were preventive maintenance, leak detection and repair, emergency and cold weather operations, water meter testing, safety, and electricity; (7) the most highly desired training areas in wastewater subjects were preventive maintenance, cold weather operations, flow measurement, equipment, inflow identification, shock loads, and toxicity problems; (8)  certification ranked relatively low as a reason for desiring training; and (9) respondents wanted hands-on training by experienced personnel close to home. Recommendations were made to fill the training needs identified. (Findings are also given by district.) (KC)",

        "description":"The institution of school has developed to the extent that it is no longer only important to the lives of those in society and to the society as a whole, it is vital. In the last decade, the &quot;deschoolers&quot; have argued that school is no longer appropriate and in serving the society it does not adequately serve the individual. School, as it currently operates, serves neither the individual nor the society. School systems are vulnerable to major changes because they are not cost effective, they are serving an increasingly smaller percentage of the population, and what they are doing is not seen as relevant to current society. A school system to serve the individual and society might be the &quot;core-plus&quot; model. The more stable &quot;core&quot; would address the processes of the community. The  programmatic &quot;plus&quot; would consist of all formal classes. Core-plus schools overcome the earlier mentioned deficiencies by being more cost effective because they are used more often, serve those out of school, and involve the community. Core-plus education, based on principles of community education, enhances K-12 education by using community resources, reconceptualizes facility usage, and changes the perception of what public schooling should be.

        "description":"This paper suggests that the occupational hierarchy is based on functionally important differences among workers and their jobs and proposes a modified functional theory of occupational stratification. Section I examines the role of education in social stratification. Sections II, III, and IV review (1) functions of schooling, (2) evidence about the relation of intelligence to performance at work and in school, and (3) evidence for the multidimensional nature of job demands. Section V presents new evidence showing that cognitive and non-cognitive demands of work are related to the activities occupations actually require workers to perform and the more difficult jobs tend to be the most critical and prestigious. Section VI provides new evidence that educational requirements for  jobs can be explained largely by intelligence demands. Section VII presents a theory of naturally occurring occupational hierarchies. A review of the contributions of previous sections to a modified functional theory is followed by speculations about how occupational hierarchies arise in response to differences in intelligence in a population. The issue of how education relates to these structural processes is explored. Section VIII discusses implications of the theory for educational policy and stratification research. Additional detail about data, tables and figures are appended. (YLB)",

        "description":"Although the role of humor in relaxation and interpersonal relationships is well documented, its role in increasing performance in the classroom has not been systematically studied. To investigate the effect of appropriately timed humor on performance of a stressful task, 40 college students performed a mathematics test under one of four experimental conditions (high or moderate stress; presence or absence of humor). The procedure entailed a pretest administration of the stressor (the Quiz Electrocardiogram) combined with the dependent measure, a 7-minute break during which the humor/no humor condition was implemented, and a post-break readministration of the stressor with the dependent measure. An analysis of the results showed that humor did not significantly reduce ratings of  complexity, time constraint, or ego involvement in high or low stress conditions. However, both the main effect for humor and the humor by stress interactions were statistically significant, indicating that humor improved the level of subsequent task performance. These findings confirm the effectiveness of humor on task performance; however, the underlying mechanisms of that interaction need further clarification. (BL)",

To examine the nature of sex differences and their relationship to achievement domains, 439 college students (197 females, 242 males) were asked to write an account of an achievement or failure. They then responded to statements on locus of standards (internal, external), the process or impact focus of their conceptual orientations, and their initial expectations for success (or failure). An analysis of the results revealed significant main effects for domain on both success and failure outcomes. Further, a strong sex difference in initial expectations preceeding failure events was found, with men holding consistently high expectations  regardless of achievement domain. Interaction effects of sex and achievement domain observed on locus of standards for success, and initial expectations preceeding failure indicated that women were more responsive to domain differences than were men. Cognitive responses were more readily classified by the nature of the achievement domain than by sex. These findings suggest that elaboration and incorporation of the concept of domain should be included in cognitive models of achievement. (Author/BL)",

        "description":"Although the effects of occupational or work stress have received considerable attention in recent years, few studies have attempted to systematically measure the construct. Prior to this study, Scale 1 of the Work Stress Inventory was developed to measure three indices: (1) appraised stress; (2) frequency of stressful situations; and (3) composite overall stress, as they relate to organizational stress and communication. Scale 1 was found to reflect organizational exclusion or alienation. To investigate job task situations associated with stress, 227 working adults (84 males, 143 females), from 34 occupations, completed Scale 2 of the Work Stress Inventory. The 58-item Scale 2 was designed to measure individual stress perceptions in relation to threats to safety and job  security, and adverse environmental and mental working conditions. Based on item-total correlations the Scale was reduced to 20 items. The reduced Scale 2 and Scale 1 were then administered to 385 working adults (150 males, 235 females). Scores for the three indices (stress appraisal, frequency, and composite stress) were calculated. An analysis of the results supported the validity of the inventory as an overall measure of work stress and of the Scales as different facets of the construct. Two facets to the construct of work stress were identified: organizational alienation and job risk. These findings suggest that the Work Stress Inventory may be a useful instrument in assessing occupational stress. (BL)",

        "description":"Many researchers have begun to investigate juvenile justice as a series of interdependent treatment and punishment decisions made by different professionals. To test the effects of resource availability and agency type on judgments of amenability to treatment, court personnel (N=49), social service workers (N=66), and community mental health workers (N=53) from six locations in the same state responded to prose vignettes and videotaped interviews with adolescents portraying juvenile offenders. The vignettes represented a range of background characteristics found to be related to high, medium, or low amenability to treatment. Multivariate analysis showed a relationship between the three variables, but the hypothesized linear relationship did not emerge consistently. There was a  consistent trend across agency types to view punishment as beneficial when few resources were available; however, court personnel across all resource availability conditions saw punishment as beneficial. All personnel in all resource conditions saw non-residential therapy as the most effective service for problem adolescents. Social service and mental health personnel in medium resource availability conditions saw youths as more treatable than did comparable personnel in high or low resource availability conditions. Court and social service personnel in medium resource availability conditions tended to see a variety of services as less effective than comparable personnel in low or high resource availability conditions. Individual background characteristics of agency personnel were  generally unrelated to amenability judgments or preferred treatment choices. The findings suggest that amenability judgments may be sensitive to local conditions, and medium resource availability may make personnel more optimistic about treatment potential but more pessimistic about the effectiveness of certain services.

To compare Japanese and American work ethics and attitudes toward women's employment, Japanese and English versions of the Work/Family Ethic questionnaire were completed by 205 middle-aged Japanese and American adults. An analysis of the results indicated that Japanese respondents, when compared with Americans, preferred large to small organizations, were more group oriented, more patriotic, more loyal to employer and family, and more desirous of leisure time. Compared with Americans, Japanese respondents were more likely to believe that women's place should be in the home, that wives' or mothers' employment might be harmful to marriage or children, and that mothers should  not work outside the home when there are children in the family. By contrast, American respondents were more likely to believe that women could handle both home and career, that women should be free to choose whether they work outside the home or not, and that women should feel free to work despite husbands' feelings or the presence of children in the family. Future research should focus on the work ethics and attitudes of different age cohorts. (Author/BL)",

        "description":"Research has proposed that personality traits may be derived from emotions and that individuals tend to judge another's personality traits on the basis of observed emotional reactions. To examine the relationship between personality and emotional traits within ecologically valid settings, 22 college students (19 females, 3 males) rated their emotions in a wide variety of work, recreation, social, and alone situations, sampled over a 30-day period. They were also administered the Personality Research Form and the Eysenck Personality Inventory. An analysis of the results showed that, although theoretically predictable relationships between certain personality traits and specific emotions averaged across situations, the most meaningful results were obtained in distinguishing chosen  from imposed situations. The need for affiliation correlated positively with feeling friendly in chosen-social situations, and negatively with feeling friendly in imposed-alone situations. Extraverts reported more joy in social situations of their own choosing compared to imposed-alone situations. Neuroticism correlated with reported feelings of unhappiness in imposed social situations; but neurotics were less unhappy when they choose to be alone. Need for achievement correlated significantly with productive feelings in chosen work situations, and negatively with productive feelings in imposed recreation situations. These findings support an interactional approach to the study of personality and emotions. (BL)",

        "description":"Although psychologists have recently expressed interest in working for and with labor unions and their members, the relationship in the past has ranged from mutual indifference to open hostility. This traditional lack of interaction has created an information vacuum. Unions need to know that psychologists are not all alike, although they do all share a common goal of understanding, predicting, and assisting change in human behaviors. Four groups of psychologists offer services potentially useful to unions and their members. Clinical and/or health psychologists work with clients to understand and possibly change normal as well as abnormal behaviors. They use their understanding of human behavior to listen to and advise clients, and should be considered as potential providers of  services to troubled employees and their families in such matters as substance abuse, job stress, family problems, absenteeism, or disturbances accompanying mental illness. Industrial/organization psychologist consultants can serve as consultants for quality of work life efforts, and can assist unions on internal organizational matters. Two other groups of psychologists, educators and researchers, are prepared to deliver high quality training and education programs for union staff as well as the rank and file members. Dialogue between unions and psychologists will take time, but with initiative on both sides, an exchange of mutually interesting and beneficial ideas is possible. (JAC)",

        "description":"To explicate the conditions under which black men and women have achieved success, using blacks as a legitimate population rather than as deviants from a majority group, factors related to academic and professional achievement by black men and women were explored. Sixty-four black professionals with doctoral degrees, including college professors, dentists, lawyers, psychologists, physicians, secondary school teachers, and scientists, were asked about personal, family background, career development, and personality factors. Results indicated that parental education was an important factor in the black professionals' family background. Black women came from middle class, well-educated families more often than did black men. They were also more likely to be unmarried, to be  childless, and to express no religious affiliation. Family members were most often the influential persons who assisted in the black professional's career decisions. Most of these professionals were satisfied with their career selection and their progress in their field; those who were dissatisfied believed themselves responsible for any lack of progress. These professionals were found to be highly motivated and self-oriented. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Males' and females' interaction styles were observed while they worked in four-person, mixed-sex groups on a discussion task. In some groups, members were only given information about each others' names and gender. Under these conditions, males were perceived higher in competence than females. Further, males were found to engage in a greater amount of active task behavior than females (e.g., giving information, giving opinions), and females exhibited a greater amount of positive social behavior than males (e.g., agreeing, acting friendly). In other groups, members' competency-based status was manipulated by providing false feedback that they were high or low in overall intellectual and moral aptitude. High status members were then perceived to be more competent than low status  ones, and further, high status individuals engaged in more active task and less positive social behavior than low status people. In these conditions, no effects for gender were obtained on perceived competence or on active task or positive social behavior. Correlational analyses supported the idea that the gender differences obtained in interaction when status was not specified were partially a function of inferred sex differences in competence. When direct information concerning members' competence was provided, however, this data apparently blocked the gender-to-competence inference and status alone affected perceived competence and interaction style.

        "description":"The construct of empathy may be located conceptually at several different points in a network of social cognition and vicarious emotion. This paper discusses one specific form of emotional empathy, empathy in response to perceiving another person in need. First, evidence is reviewed suggesting that there are at least two distinct types of congruent vicarious emotional responses to perceiving another in need: feelings of personal distress (e.g., alarmed, upset, worried, disturbed, distressed, troubled, etc.), and feelings of empathy (e.g., sympathetic, moved, compassionate, tender, warm, softhearted, etc.). Next, evidence is reviewed suggesting that these two vicarious emotions have distinct motivational consequences. Whereas personal distress seems to evoke egoistic motivation to  reduce one's own aversive arousal, as a traditional Hullian tension-reduction model would propose, empathy does not. Motivation evoked by empathy appears to be altruistic. The ultimate goal seems to be reduction of the other's need, not reduction of one's own aversive arousal. The emotional and motivational differentiation suggested by the empirical evidence seems more congruent with the analysis of the nature of emotion and motivation proposed long ago by McDougall than that proposed by Hull.

An analysis of the results showed that students whose current major was the same as their desired major scored significantly higher on total self-concept than did students who reported a discrepancy between their current and preferred major. A significant interaction between risk and self-concept revealed that low risk students scored lower than high risk students on social and personal self-concept. High risk students reported higher values in the social realm, while low  risk students reported higher theoretical values. Sex by self-concept interaction revealed that females scored high on the moral-ethical self, family self, and social self, while males scored higher in the areas of physical and personal self. Males scored highest on economic, political, and theoretical values, while females were highest on aesthetic, religious, and social values. Finally, males in this study had changed their majors more frequently than had females, but tended to exhibit a greater consistency between their personal values and choice of an academic major.

To examine the association between life satisfaction and social support among this population, 65 women (30 widowed, 35 never-married) were interviewed and completed the Life Satisfaction Scale. An analysis of the results showed that the never-married sample had significantly greater life satisfaction than their widowed counterparts. The never-married women were more able to give and receive assistance in concrete crisis situations than the widowed women. The never-married group also was oriented more to the present than the widowed group. The remainder of this paper focuses first on a discussion of the relationship of the research findings to a role theory perspective and its effects on  clients' thinking and behavior. Second, a short overview of some of the reasons that groups are thought to be an effective means of intervention is presented. Third, these factors are tied into a model format of group intervention, a way of most effectively reaching this client group. The major issues to be addressed in a group and some of the situational factors such as time, place, and composition, are discussed. (BL)",

In order to evaluate study strategy effectiveness, and students' ability to self-monitor their level of comprehension of course material, 26 undergraduates were asked to complete a questionnaire prior to each of the four exams given during one course. The questionnaire elicited information about time spent studying, study strategies used, use of the study guide, perceived readiness, days absent, year in school (freshman, sophomore, etc.) and predicted grade. Results indicated that type of study strategies used was most  consistently related to actual grade on the exams. Scores on the test, however, were unrelated to students' perceptions of their readiness for exams, suggesting inaccuracy in comprehension monitoring. Implications for future research include verifying the relationship between type of strategies used and actual test performance. (The questionnaire and exam scores are appended.) (LLL)",

        "description":"As the belief that social support and coping can moderate the impact of stress becomes part of the common wisdom in the mental health field, the demand for support-oriented interventions has increased. However, a review of the stress-buffering research indicates that the effect of support is more modest and more complex than most researchers suggest. Interesting stress-support relationships at the significant level have led many to pay less attention to the implications of the large numbers of nonsignificant and problematic findings. Some inconsistencies may be due to methodological issues both in hypothesis development and statistical design. A more enriched understanding of the role of social support requires a paradigm shift that will expand the questions being asked. Research  should focus on an ecological perspective examining the determinants of stress, coping, and support patterns; the costs and consequences associated with helping behavior; systematic consequences of support patterns; and the social and personal context of support. Such an approach goes beyond the stress-buffering hypothesis, toward providing a richer understanding of the role of support in the process of adaptation. (BL)",

To examine the association between painful chronic illnesses and depression from a cognitive-behavioral perspective, 100 patients of the Pain Management Program at the West Haven, Connecticut Veterans Administration Hospital (78% males) completed a battery of tests. The tests assessed depression, pain severity, life interference attributed to pain, perceived self-control, and social support. An analysis of the results showed that pain was a significant predictor of perceived interference, support, and self-control. In turn, perceived self-control and interference were significant predictors of depression. Pain was not a significant direct predictor of depression. The coefficient of  determination indicated that 68% of the variance in depression was accounted for by the cognitive-behavioral model. The results suggest that all of the structural relations predicted by the cognitive-behavioral model of pain and depression were confirmed, with the exception of the relationship between support and self-control, which was found to be nonsignificant.

Following an introduction, the first portion of the paper explores why some frequently used teaching practices may fail to prepare students adequately to read their textbooks. The major part of the paper describes the three phases of the PReP activity, suitable for students in grades three through twelve in all subject areas, and requisite preparation for the activity. The final part of the paper discusses assessing student knowledge during the activity and provides examples of the PReP being used  with several different types of reading material at different grade levels.

        "description":"College students can read, but they often lack the prereading and postreading skills needed to help them think about and respond to what they read. A three-step plan can help students read and understand the text more fully. The first step entails using measures of fitness to determine: (1) the grade level of the text being considered and how it compares with the level the college has determined is necessary for material to be used in various college curricula, (2) how ready students are to use the text, and (3) the type of responses the teacher can expect from students in discussions about selections in the text. The second step consists of testing one's own (the instructor's) assumptions about how to teach this material against the information gained in the first step to see if  they are realistic, and then revising one's goals accordingly. The third step involves accommodating the information found in the first two steps to prepare the student via guided reading. Students learn to scan the preface and table of contents to get the gist of the text and find its organizational framework, then analyze the arrangement of a typical chapter to learn what to expect in their reading assignments. Next, techniques are introduced to help students develop into active readers. These may include vocabulary previews; thought provoking questions that evoke interest in the selection and engage the students in examining their own experiences and beliefs; and various prereading procedures designed to help the student grasp the main points of the story, its setting, character, and  tone.

In addition, 58 \"regular\" students were asked to assess their reading abilities and reading and study skills needs. Results indicated that most basic reading students were satisfied with their courses. In general, they found the courses to be helpful in the classes they later took, and found the courses to be more useful than labs. In terms of skills taught, students indicated that vocabulary, summarizing, reading for main idea, and dictionary work were the most valuable. Many students expressed the desire to take additional reading courses (advanced reading and speed reading) and workshops. Regular students expressed  similar desires for opportunities to improve their reading skills and get help with their assignments--in spite of the fact that the majority of these students rated themselves as good or excellent in most reading and study skills. Skills in which more than 15% of the regular students rated themselves as fair or unsatisfactory were (1) taking lecture notes, (2) using Latin and Greek affixes, and (3) library research.

        "description":"Evidence from a nine-month longitudinal study of deaf children's early attempts at learning to read provides the construct for an instructional model that stresses that even though the children may have, at the least, a meager expressive sign language vocabulary, they can be lead successfully through the holophrastic or one-word stage of reading development by matching signs and meaning to print. In addition, the evidence identifies three levels of change in this word-reading development. At the first level, the child knows about printed word symbols, can handle a book properly, and begins to attend to stories and label pictures with manual signs. At the next level, the child can: recognize words on food labels, cereal boxes, and road signs in picture contexts; recognize the  alphabet using finger spelling; read and print a first name; and attempt to sequence and recall stories. During the third level, the child rapidly increases a sight-word vocabulary, spelling and printing knowledge, and story reciting and sequencing abilities. Two classroom experiments and parent interviews provide additional evidence to support this instructional model. The findings of these efforts suggest that children's communicative interactions about reading related activities using finger spelling and manual signs with parents, teachers, or peers act as precursors to and possibly shape the reading acquisition process that follows.

Knowledge of Palestinian/Israeli affairs was measured by six true-false questions regarding Palestinian figures and events, and six questions regarding Israeli figures and events. Media use was measured through self-reports of newspaper reading and viewing of television news and public affairs programs. Education was measured through self-reports of years of schooling completed, and interest in world affairs was determined by a yes or  no response to a question about discussing world affairs with family and friends. Results revealed differences between respondents in education and media use, with Blacks less likely than Jews or other nonblacks to use newspapers or newsmagazines on a regular basis. Blacks also had a lower level of education than other participants in the survey. Regression analyses revealed that race and ethnicity made no independent contribution to foreign affairs knowledge once exposure to related stories, dependence upon print sources, and education had been removed as sources of variance. Similar analysis revealed that when education and interest in world affairs were controlled, race and ethnicity made no independent contribution to variance in print media use. (Author/HOD)",

Next, the digest covers the pedagogical issues to consider during the first viewing. It then offers criteria for a second viewing, in which the evaluator intentionally makes errors that a student might make to examine how the program responds to confused or slow learners.

        "description":"New approaches to the teaching of the classics are explored in this collection of articles written by high school, junior college, college, and university literature instructors. The seven articles in the first section of the book discuss linking the classics. Specific topics covered in the articles include using the works of William Golding as a key to the works of Joseph Conrad, the role of the misfit in literature, and the relationships between a classic novel and a related painting. The four articles in the second section inquire into the connection between literature and writing. Topics covered in this section include writing allegories as a way to approach the classics; using writing to facilitate the teaching of &quot;Beowulf&quot;; and reading, writing, and the Victorian novel. The  third, fourth, and fifth sections offer teaching units for specific titles at three levels: kindergarten through grade eight, high school, and university. Titles discussed include &quot;The Scarlet Letter,&quot;&quot;The Odyssey,&quot;&quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot;&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot;&quot;Ozymandias,&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream.&quot; (RBW)",

        "description":"Intended for use by teachers at both the college and the secondary school level, this booklet describes a method of getting students to write using the motivation theories developed by the psychologist Abraham Maslow. The first chapter of the booklet reviews Maslow's basic principles as they apply to the teaching of writing, but includes a cautionary note to the effect that interested persons would do better to read Maslow in the original. The second chapter discusses the tools and methods available to teachers for assessing students' writing needs, while the third outlines a number of general motivational strategies for use in the classroom. The fourth chapter deals with designing writing assignments that meet students' needs and goals, and the fifth explains how to implement  this type of writing program. A short list of resource references concludes the booklet. (RBW)",

        "description":"Acknowledging that the process approach to writing instruction is particularly valuable for lower ability students (because carrying a project through from prewriting to publication enhances their self-esteem), this book presents procedures for teaching writing to build student confidence and subsequently to improve student writing. Following an introduction, the first chapter discusses ways to set the stage for a conducive writing atmosphere. The next three chapters present activities for the stages of the writing process--prewriting, drafting, and revising. The fifth chapter discusses peer review of students' work before publication, while the sixth chapter suggests the proofreading stage as a final opportunity for students to discuss their papers with the teacher before  publication. The last chapter explores various forms in which student writing can be &quot;published,&quot; such as classroom books, letter exchanges, book reports, and screen plays. The appendix includes a curriculum guide, a guide to planning effective writing assignments, excerpts from student-authored books, and student poems and letters. (HTH)",

While refinement of composition skills frames the entire narrative, the day-by-day record of the tutor's first quarter also emphasizes such skills as goal setting, effective questioning, and motivating students to become self-confident learners. The appendix includes information sheets given to students and tutors at the Writing Center, Student Learning Center at the University of California, Berkeley; the sheets deal with how to get the most out of tutoring, goal setting for writing tutors, the goal-setting process, and how to avoid doing a student's homework. A measure of student tutoring style, a  personal checklist of tutoring skills, and an instructor's guide to marking symbols and grammatical terms are also included in the appendix. (HOD)",

        "description":"The political trials of the past two decades have shown the misuse and abuse of judicial summary contempt power in limiting individual liberty. The primary justification offered for use of the contempt power has been the need to deter obstruction of the administration of justice. The trials of the Chicago 7 and the Black Panthers were intricately linked with American political currents, and this type of trial has spotlighted the conflict between freedom of speech and the need for order in the courtroom. Responses such as the binding and gagging of defendants that occurred in these trials not only punish any obstruction of the judicial process, but also serve as a prior restraint on the defendant's freedom to communicate. Such action is both harmful and unnecessary. Actions that  impede or preclude oral communication in a conflict situation such as a trial only beg for more violent responses. It has been contended that wise use of the power can reduce its deleterious effects, but such wisdom is nearly impossible to achieve. Judges will embody the values of the politicians who appointed them and can hardly function effectively while they are objects of vilification. That a judge could dispassionately use the contempt power following bitter confrontation is unlikely. Finally, the use of the summary contempt power places the judge in a dual and untenable position of both bringing and trying charges against a defendant, antithetical to American judicial law. Disruptive conduct can and should be disciplined without restraining a defendant's future right to speak.  (HTH)",
