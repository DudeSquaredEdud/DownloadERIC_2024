ACTION RESEARCH WAS DIRECTED TOWARD (1) THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS, COMMUNITY LEADERS, AND COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STAFF MEMBERS, (2) THE IDENTIFICATION OF OTHER COMMUNITY RESOURCES CAPABLE OF ASSISTING WITH COMMUNITY PROBLEMS, (3) THE ASSIGNMENT OF PRIORITIES TO THE PROBLEMS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS, AND (4) THE SUGGESTION OF SOME TYPES OF COLLEGE LEVEL PROGRAMS TO ASSIST IN THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMS. A CATEGORIZATION SCHEME DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE OUTLINED IN TITLE I LEGISLATION WAS DEVELOPED. IT INCLUDES--INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL PROBLEMS, FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION, ISOLATIONISM, CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR WOMEN, GENERAL EDUCATION PROBLEMS,  LABOR-MANAGEMENT UNDERSTANDING, CONSUMER EDUCATION, NEED FOR INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION, AND PROBLEMS RELATED TO AGING. DATA CONTAINED IN THE REPORT ARE BASED ON SUBJECTIVE OPINIONS OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, COMMUNITY LEADERS, SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, AND LAYMEN. ALSO INCLUDED ARE SOME &quot;HARD&quot; DATA FROM PUBLICATIONS AND REPORTS. SEVERAL FACTORS LIMITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS STUDY--(1) MANY COMMUNITY LEADERS TENDED TO VIEW CHRONIC PROBLEMS AS SITUATIONS TO BE TOLERATED, (2) RELATED LITERATURE WAS OFTEN SUPERFICIAL, (3) AREA REPORTS WERE WRITTEN BY NATIVES, AND THUS, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA MAY HAVE BEEN PREJUDICED, AND (4) BECAUSE MOST DATA WERE COLLECTED DURING A PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTION, MANY GOVERNMENT OFFICALS HESITATED TO PARTICIPATE OR RESTRICTED THEIR VIEWS TO  UNCONTROVERSIAL AREAS. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION ARE MADE. (AF)",

        "description":"THE DRAW-A-PERSON AND THE BENDER-GESTALT TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO A GROUP OF SIBLINGS PARTICIPATING IN A STUDY OF LEARNING DISABILITY. THE SIBLINGS WERE DIVIDED INTO FOUR GROUPS OF SUBJECTS--EDUCATIONALLY HANDICAPPED (EH), SUCCESSFUL ACADEMIC (SA) CONTROLS, EDUCATIONALLY HANDICAPPED SIBLINGS (EHS), AND SUCCESSFUL ACADEMIC SIBLINGS (SAS) CONTROLS. ALTHOUGH THE TESTS ARE FELT TO BE SIMILAR IN THAT THEY REQUIRE MOTOR ACTIVITY AND SOME DRAWING SKILL, THE BENDER IS MORE STIMULUS-BOUND, IS GEOMETRIC RATHER THAN HUMAN, AND INVOLVES IMMEDIATE PERCEPTION RATHER THAN MEMORY FUNCTIONING. NEVERTHELESS, BOTH SCALES SHOWED AN APPRECIABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EH AND SA CHILDREN. THE EHS AND SAS GROUPS SCORED IN PATTERNS CLOSE TO THAT OF THEIR RELATED SIBLINGS. THE TESTS WERE SCORED BY FOUR  DIFFERENT METHODS AND THE RESULTS REMAINED CONSISTENT. ANALYSES OF THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE TESTS SUGGEST THAT THE PROBLEM OF THE EH GROUPS DOES NOT LIE IN AN INABILITY TO SEE CORRECTLY. HOWEVER SOME OF THEIR PROBLEMS COULD BE SOLVED BY DISCRIMINATION TRAINING. THIS PAPER WAS PREPARED FOR PRESENTATION AT THE SRCD MEETINGS IN NEW YORK, MARCH 31, 1967. (DK)",

        "description":"EXISTING SOCIAL AND OCCUPATIONAL STRUCTURES SHOULD BE REMADE SO THAT CREDENTIALISM DOES NOT ARBITARILY BAR NEGROES AND THE POOR FROM ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND SOCIAL MOBILITY. GRADUATION FROM A SCHOOL SIMPLY IMPLIES THAT ONE HAS FIT INTO THE PROPER EDUCATIONAL STRAITS AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY SIGNAL QUALITY PERFORMANCE. CREDENTIALISM AND ITS CONCOMITANT RATIONALE OF EXCLUSION PREVAIL BECAUSE EMPLOYERS ARE FREQUENTLY RELUCTANT TO MAKE SUBJECTIVE CHOICES WHEN HIRING. MOREOVER, EMPLOYERS IN THE PUBLIC AND HUMAN SERVICES TEND TO BE UNCERTAIN OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND THUS USE THE EMPLOYEE'S CREDENTIALS TO DETERMINE HIS \"PRODUCTION OUTPUT.\" MANY ORGANIZATIONS EMPHASIZE CREDENTIALS BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH SOCIAL APPEARANCES AND BECAUSE THEY WISH TO HIRE A SURPLUS OF\"TOP-NOTCHERS\" WHO WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR HIGH LEVEL PROMOTION. RATHER THAN RELYING ON AN EMPLOYEE'S CREDENTIALS, EMPLOYERS MIGHT INSTEAD BE GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF \"JOB FIRST, TRAINING LATER.\" PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD SEEK OUT AND CULTIVATE THE TALENTS OF DISADVANTAGED PERSONS, ESPECIALLY FOR NONPROFESSIONAL CAREERS. ALSO, NEW MEANS OF CREDENTIALING MIGHT BE ESTABLISHED, AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED FOR THE EXPANSION OF CREDENTIALS.

        "description":"AN ATTEMPT TO SEPARATE THE PROBLEMS OF CULTURAL DIFFERENCE FROM THE MORE GENERAL PROBLEMS OF UNDERACHIEVMENT IS MADE IN THIS OVERVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH. THE CULTURALLY DIFFERENT STUDENT COMES PRIMARILY FROM THE LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC LEVELS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY. HE IS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE MENTALLY RETARDED, PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED, EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED, OR SIMPLY BORED BY SCHOOL. THE CULTURALLY DIFFERENT ARE THE UNASSIMILATED AMERICANS WHO FOR HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL REASONS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE AN INTEGRAL PART OF AMERICAN SOCIETY. THIS CAUSES PROBLEMS THAT CAN BE BROADLY CLASSIFIED AS SOCIAL-CULTURAL, SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND EDUCATIONAL. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF PROGRAMS FOR THE CULTURALLY DIFFERENT SHOULD BE SOCIALIZATION RATHER THAN INTELLECTUALIZATION. A PROGRAM  SHOULD STRESS--(1) ACADEMIC SUCCESS IN VERBAL AND READING SKILLS, (2) POLITICAL MATURITY, PARTICULARLY THE MEANING AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF CITIZENSHIP, (3) SOCIAL MATURITY AND THE NEED FOR A STABLE FAMILY, AND (4) THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF HOLDING A JOB AS A USEFUL EMPLOYEE. IN IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM FOR THE CULTURALLY DIFFERENT, IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE SCHOOL IS ONLY ONE ELEMENT IN THE COMMUNITY. THE SCHOOL MUST INTEGRATE WITH THE COMMUNITY AND REACH OUT TO PARENTS AND BUSINESSES IF IT IS TO BECOME THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENT IN THE SOCIALIZATION OF THE CULTURALLY DIFFERENT STUDENT.

THE SAMPLE POPULATION FOR THE STUDY WAS MADE UP OF 1,963 NEGRO MOTHERS OF 4-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN FROM ONE MIDDLE-CLASS AND FROM THREE LOWER-CLASS GROUPS--UPPER-LOWER, LOWER-LOWER, AND LOWER-LOWER RECEIVING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. DATA ON THE MOTHERS AND THE HOME ENVIRONMENTS WERE GATHERED FROM INTERVIEWS, INTELLIGENCE TESTS, AND &quot;INTERACTION SESSIONS&quot; DURING WHICH THE MOTHER WAS REQUIRED TO TEACH THE CHILD THREE SIMPLE TASKS WHICH SHE HAD SPECIFICALLY BEEN TAUGHT. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT MOTHERS IN THE THREE LOWER-CLASS GROUPS INFLUENCE THE CHILD'S ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCHOOL BY STRESSING THAT HE BEHAVE  AND LISTEN TO THE TEACHER. THUS THE LOWER CLASS CHILD COMES TO REGARD SCHOOL AS AN AUTHORITARIAN INSTITUTION RATHER THAN AS A PLACE FOR LEARNING. MOTHERS IN THE TWO LOWEST-CLASS GROUPS EXPRESSED FEELINGS OF POWERLESSNESS IN RELATION TO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THEIR CHILD'S BEHAVIOR, WHICH TENDED TO INHIBIT THE CHILD'S INITIATORY BEHAVIOR IN A TESTING SITUATION, HIS QUICKNESS OF RESPONSE, AND HIS SOCIAL CONFIDENCE WITH AN ADULT EXAMINER. IN GENERAL, MIDDLE CLASS MOTHERS HAD MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THEIR CHILD AND THE SCHOOL AND WERE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE EMOTIONAL ASPECTS OF THEIR CHILD'S EARLY SCHOOL EXPERIENCES.

MOTHERS' RESPONSES TO TWO TASKS WERE USED TO ASSESS THEIR ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR. THE FIRST TASK WAS TO ANSWER A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THE MOTHERS WOULD DO IF THEY HAD THE POWER TO CHANGE EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOLS, AND THE SECOND TASK REQUIRED AN INTERPRETATION OF A PICTURE OF A MOTHER AND A TEACHER SEATED IN A CLASSROOM. THE SUBJECTS WERE 163 NEGRO NONWORKING MOTHERS OF 4-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN, FROM FOUR SOCIAL STATUS GROUPS--MIDDLE CLASS, UPPER-LOWER, LOWER-LOWER, AND LOWER-LOWER RECEIVING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. IN CONTRAST TO THE MIDDLE CLASS MOTHERS, THE MOTHERS IN THE LOWER CLASS GROUPS SHOWED AN INABILITY TO COPE WITH AND LITTLE CONCERN FOR  PROBLEM-ORIENTED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCHOOLS. THEY DEFINED THEIR ROLE WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AS PASSIVE, INEFFECTIVE, OR DEFENSIVE. THESE ATTITUDES REFLECT THE MOTHERS' OWN SCHOOL EXPERIENCES, AND IN TURN INFLUENCE THE LOWER CLASS URBAN CHILD TOWARDS A SIMILARLY PASSIVE OR DEFENSIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS SCHOOL. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST A NEED FOR THE RESOCIALIZATION OF THE ENTIRE LOWER CLASS FAMILY.

IT WOULD INVOLVE POTENTIAL LEADERS WHO COULD EVENTUALLY ASSUME CONTROL AND PROVIDE THEIR OWN MOMENTUM. BASIC TO THE NEW CAREERS THEORY IS THE REORGANIZATION OF SERVICE POSITIONS SO THAT PEOPLE WITH LITTLE OR NO TRAINING CAN LEARN ON THE JOB AND RISE IN THE OCCUPATIONAL HIERARCHY, WITH THE ULTIMATE OPTION OF BECOMING  PROFESSIONALS.

A SUMMARY POINTS OUT THAT THE TREND HAS BEEN TOWARD INCREASING IN-MIGRATION, FOR THE MOST PART FROM WITHIN CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES. PUERTO RICAN IN-MIGRATION HAS DROPPED FROM ITS PEAK IN 1956-57. MIGRATION OUT OF THE CITY HAS BEEN MORE STABLE, BUT THOSE WHO DO LEAVE ARE MADE UP PRIMARILY OF PUPILS MOVING TO AREAS ADJACENT TO THE CITY AND TO PUERTO RICO. THE NET CHANGE SHOWS AN ANNUAL LOSS OF ABOUT 3,000 PUPILS. IT IS NOTED THAT THERE IS ALSO CONSIDERABLE TRANSFER WITHIN THE CITY. THE  SCHOOLS ARE FACED WITH INCREASINGLY SEVERE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THE LANGUAGE AND SOCIOECONOMIC HANDICAPS OF THE IN-MIGRANTS, MOST OF WHOM ARE NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS.

IN THE PAST THE CITY HAD INITIATED VARIOUS TEMPORARY SCHOOL DESEGREGATION ACTIONS, BUT BY 1964 THE NECESSITY OF A PERMANENT SOLUTION HAD BECOME APPARENT. SINCE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL THE CITY'S STUDENTS WERE ALREADY INTEGRATED IN A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL, AND ONLY MINOR EFFORTS WERE REQUIRED TO INTEGRATE THE CITY'S THREE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS, ADMINISTRATORS FOCUSED ON DESEGREGATING THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. AT THIS TIME ONE 67 PERCENT NEGRO CENTER-CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WAS CLOSED, AND ATTENDANCE AREAS WERE RE-ESTABLISHED SO THAT THE OTHER 10 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS COULD RECEIVE THE TRANSFERRED PUPILS.  DEVELOPED BY THE BOARD OF EDUCATION, THIS PLAN WAS STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY THE SCHOOL SYSTEM'S PRINCIPALS AND SUPERVISORS, THE CITYWIDE PTA COUNCIL, AND THE WHITE PLAINS TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. PRELIMINARY EVALUATIONS INDICATE THAT THE INTEGRATED WHITE AND NEGRO PUPILS ARE MAKING SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS AND THAT THE NEGRO PUPILS ARE MAKING THE NECESSARY PEER GROUP ADJUSTMENTS. MOREOVER THE MAJORITY OF PARENTS AND TEACHERS CONTINUE TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT. NEVERTHELESS THE TEACHERS HAVE EMPHASIZED A NEED FOR ADEQUATE CLASS SIZE AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, AND PARENTS HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT ANXIOUS ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN'S ADJUSTMENT. THE PTA HAS BEEN WORRIED ABOUT INVOLVING CENTER-CITY NEGRO PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN ATTEND OUTLYING SCHOOLS.

IT DISCUSSES \"BLACK POVERTY\" AND GHETTOS, THE NEW ROLE OF BUSINESS IN SLUM ERADICATION, NEGRO-INITIATED SELF-HELP PROJECTS, AND THE EDUCATION OF NEGROES. ONE PART OF THE REPORT OUTLINES A 12-POINT PROGRAM FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION WHICH IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT AMERICAN PRIORITIES SHOULD BE SHIFTED TO GIVE THE WAR ON POVERTY AND DISCRIMINATION THE SAME URGENCY AS THE WAR IN  VIETNAM. NEEDED ARE ACTIVE PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP, INFLATION CONTROL AND REALLOCATION OF FEDERAL FUNDS, STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES, AND GREATER INVOLVEMENT BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. OTHER STEPS INCLUDE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN JOB TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS, REFORM OF WELFARE SYSTEMS, THE CREATION OF UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR BENEFITS, HOUSING, AND EDUCATION, BETTER RIOT CONTROL, AND PROPER POLICE TRAINING. ALSO, EXISTING CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS MUST BE VIGOROUSLY ENFORCED AND AGENCIES GIVEN ADEQUATE FUNDS. LONGER RANGE GOALS ARE FULL EMPLOYMENT, WELFARE POLICIES WHICH GUARANTEE MINIMUM NECESSITIES, DISPERSAL OF NEGRO GHETTOS, QUALITY INTEGRATED EDUCATION, SOUTHERN DEVELOPMENT, AND IMPROVED HEALTH.

THE GOALS INCLUDED INCREASING STUDENTS' VERBAL AND NONVERBAL CREATIVITY, DEVELOPING STUDENT COOPERATION AND TOLERANCE, DEVELOPING MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD SCHOOL AND TOWARD AUTHORITY, AND BETTERING THE WORK HABITS OF THE STUDENTS. TEACHERS FOR THE 445 PARTICIPATING STUDENTS WERE DRAWN MOSTLY FROM THE INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS IN THE BOSTON AREA WHICH CONDUCTED THE PROGRAM. THE TEACHERS WERE GIVEN A SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, TEACHING METHODS, DISCIPLINE, AND DAILY ROUTINE. THE CURRICULUM TRIED TO IMPROVE THE STUDENTS'  READING ABILITY AND COMPREHENSION, WRITTEN AND ORAL EXPRESSION, AND UNDERSTANDING AND APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION AND DISCOVERY. ALL STUDENTS WERE PERFORMING AT GRADE LEVEL WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS INITIATED. THE PROGRAM WAS SUCCESSFUL IN INCREASING INTEREST IN INTELLECTUAL MATTERS, IN EMPHASIZING ETHICAL REWARDS OVER MATERIAL REWARDS, AND IN TEACHING THE MIDDLE CLASS VALUES OF NEATNESS, PUNCTUALITY, AND HONESTY. THE STUDENTS ALSO SHOWED MORE TOLERANCE FOR OTHERS, A GREATER WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE, AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREATIVE THINKING.

BECAUSE THE STUDENT'S ATTITUDES AND PERSONALITY WERE FELT TO BE RELATED TO HIS UNDERACHIEVEMENT, THE PROJECT SET UP A STUDY PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED READING AND WRITING EXERCISES TO ENCOURAGE THE STUDENT TO THINK ABOUT HIS INTERESTS AND ABILITIES, VOCATION, AND PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE, AND TO ADVANCE HIS GENERAL KNOWLEDGE. IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WOULD IMPROVE THEIR PERSONALITY  CHARACTERISTICS, SELF-ESTIMATE, AND SELF-INSIGHT, AND HAVE A HIGHER GRADE POINT AVERAGE. CHANGE WAS MEASURED BY INVENTORIES ADMINISTERED BEFORE AND AFTER AN 8-MONTH EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD. RESULTS SHOWED THAT WHILE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN TWO OF 18 TEST VARIABLES, THE CONTROL GROUP IMPROVED IN TWO OTHERS.

MORE NEGROES THAN WHITES ARE FUNCTIONAL ILLITERATES, WHO DO NOT COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE AND WHO LAG BEHIND AGE PEERS IN SCHOOL. HOUSING RANGES FROM POOR TO GOOD, AND RENTALS ARE COMPARABLE TO CITYWIDE COSTS. IN EMPLOYMENT, NEGROES ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN SKILLED AND SEMISKILLED OCCUPATIONS.

THESE OBJECTIVES WERE IMPLEMENTED BY INTENSIVE REQUIRED CORE PROGRAMS IN READING, LANGUAGE ARTS, AND MATHEMATICS AND BY SOME ELECTIVE CLASSES. FIELD TRIPS, FREE NUTRITIONAL SNACKS, GUIDANCE PERSONNEL, A READING CONSULTANT, AND A NURSE WERE ALSO PROVIDED. THE APPRAISAL OF THE PROGRAM IS BASED ON PRE- AND POST-ACHIEVEMENT TEST RESULTS, STUDENT, TEACHER, AND PARENT OPINIONS AS MEASURED BY QUESTIONNAIRES, ATTENDANCE RATES, AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SPECIAL SERVICES. DROPOUT AND ABSENCE RATES WERE  HIGH. MOST OF THE 22 TEACHERS FELT THAT STUDENTS HAD MADE &quot;SOME&quot; IMPROVEMENT OF A &quot;SATISFACTORY NATURE,&quot; ESPECIALLY IN MOTIVATION AND ATTITUDE CHANGES. TEACHERS ALSO FELT THAT CLASS SESSIONS WERE TOO LONG AND THAT THE PROCEDURES FOR SCREENING AND SELECTING STUDENTS NEEDED IMPROVEMENT. MOST OF THE STUDENTS AND PARENTS SEEMED SATISFIED.

DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM THE GATES READING SURVEY, TWO STAFF QUESTIONNAIRES, TWO RATING SCALES, AND SOME CASE STUDIES. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SAMPLE STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED REGULARLY MADE SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN READING ABILITY. HOWEVER, HIGH STUDENT  TURNOVER RATES AND IRREGULAR ATTENDANCE WERE TYPICAL AMONG ALL THE PARTICIPANTS. THE GREATEST BENEFITS WERE IMPROVEMENT IN READING AND STUDENT ATTITUDES. THE FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM WHICH NEED IMPROVEMENT ARE THE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES, THE AVAILABLE TIME FOR TEACHING, STUDENT RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION PROCEDURES, MOTIVATION TECHNIQUES, AND POSSIBLE PROJECT EXPANSION.

DISCRIMINATION, HOWEVER, IS NOT CONSIDERED THE MAJOR CAUSE OF LOW NEGRO ENROLLMENT IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS.

INTERVIEWERS CONTACTED 545 OF THE 638 FIRMS IN THE SAMPLE OF WHICH 87 PERCENT WERE PAYROLL FIRMS. THERE WERE 5,443 AGRICULTURAL BUSINESSES, INDUSTRIES, AND SERVICES OF 18 DIFFERENT TYPES OPERATING IN THE STATE. IN THE FIRMS CONTACTED, 16,983 PERSONS WERE EMPLOYED, WITH 4,204 ENGAGED IN OFF-FARM AGRICULTURAL OCCUPATIONS. THE MAIN CATEGORIES OF FIRMS EMPLOYING MOST PERSONNEL IN OFF-FARM AGRICULTURAL OCCUPATIONS WERE (1) FARM MACHINERY SALES AND SERVICE, (2) COTTON PROCESSING, SALES, AND  WAREHOUSING, AND (3) FARM SUPPLY RETAIL STORES. THE CATEGORIES EMPLOYING THE FEWEST WERE FOOD PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION, DAIRY PRODUCTS MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, MEAT PROCESSING AND WHOLESALE, AGRICULTURAL CHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS AND WHOLESALE, AND LUMBER AND WOOD PRODUCTS. THERE WERE 184 DIFFERENT OFF-FARM AGRICULTURAL OCCUPATIONS. AN 8 PERCENT INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY WAS PROJECTED FOR 5 YEARS HENCE. PROJECTION OF FIGURES FROM THE SAMPLE TO THE STATE POPULATION WOULD PLACE THE NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED IN OFF-FARM AGRICULTURAL OCCUPATIONS AT 49,447. THE STUDY INDICATED A NEED FOR (1) BROADENING THE VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE PROGRAM, (2) IMPROVING COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE ANDEMPLOYERS, (3) INSTRUCTION TO ACQUAINT STUDENTS WITH EXISTING EMPLOYMENT  OPPORTUNITIES, (4) CONTINUING STUDY OF OPPORTUNITIES, AND (5) MORE TEACHER RESPONSIBILITY FOR PLACEMENT.

INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED FROM HIGH SCHOOL RECORDS AND JOB EVALUATION FORMS COMPLETED BY STUDENTS, GRADUATES, COLLEGE SUPERVISORS, AND EMPLOYERS. THE EMPLOYERS AND COLLEGE SUPERVISORS IN GENERAL RATED ALL STUDENT EMPLOYEES HIGH IN INTEGRITY, DEPENDABILITY, COOPERATION, COURTESTY, PERSONAL APPEARANCE, ATTITUDE, AND EMOTIONAL STABILITY AND AVERAGE IN INITIATIVE, JUDGMENT, AND LEADERSHIP. BOTH COLLEGE SUPERVISORS AND EMPLOYERS RATED THEM LOWER ON SKILLS THAN ON GENERAL TRAITS. EMPLOYERS  INDICATED THAT 95 PERCENT OF THE ON-THE-JOB TRAINING STUDENTS WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE AS PERMANENT EMPLOYEES. THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS INDICATED A PREFERENCE FOR A 2-YEAR PROGRAM ALTHOUGH ONE-THIRD WERE INTERESTED IN A COURSE OF MORE THAN 2 YEARS. OF THE GRADUATES, ONLY 11.5 PERCENT WERE EMPLOYED OUTSIDE OF AGRICULTURE. OVER ONE-HALF REMAINED AS PERMANENT EMPLOYEES AT THEIR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING STATION. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL SALARY OF THE 13 REPORTING IT WAS $5,746. THEY RATED ON-THE-JOB TRAINING AND COURSE WORK IN AGRICULTURE AS THE MOST VALUABLE PART OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM.

IN THE ADOPTION PROCESS, AN INDIVIDUAL PASSES THROUGH THE STAGES OF AWARENESS, INTEREST, EVALUATION, TRIAL, AND ADOPTION. TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS IN FARMING TEND TO FLOW FROM THE IMPERSONAL SOURCES TO THE EARLIER ADOPTERS AND FROM THEM AS PERSONAL COMMUNICATION TO THE LATER ADOPTERS. EARLY ADOPTERS REPRESENT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THE AGRICULTURAL MARKETING PICTURE. THE 3,778 MEMBERS OF THE DOANE COUNTRYWIDE FARM  PANEL UNDER 45 YEARS OF AGE WERE SURVEYED TO DETERMINE WHETHER A RELATIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN A FARMER'S HAVING STUDIED VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE AND HIS PRESENT ADOPTION STATUS. EACH FARMER ON THE PANEL WAS CATEGORIZED AS AN EARLY ADOPTER, A MIDDLE ADOPTER, OR A LATE ADOPTER. THE PRIMARY COMPARISONS WERE MADE BETWEEN THOSE FARMERS WHO HAD VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE TRAINING AND THOSE WHO HAD NONE.

        "description":"SEVERAL PROPOSALS FOR ALLEVIATING THE DROPOUT PROBLEM ARE PRESENTED. STUDENTS LEAVE SCHOOL BECAUSE OF FAILURE AND RETARDATION IN SCHOOL, DISLIKE OF SCHOOL, HOME CIRCUMSTANCES, MARRIAGE, CONFLICTS WITH TEACHERS, FEELINGS OF REJECTION, NEED TO WORK, MILITARY SERVICE, AND HEALTH. WHILE IN SCHOOL, THE POTENTIAL DROPOUT IS USUALLY SHUNTED INTO A CURRICULUM AREA WHERE HE CAUSES THE FEWEST ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS, AND UNLESS HE SUCEEDS THERE, HE PROBABLY GIVES UP AND LEAVES SCHOOL. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AS A SOLUTION TO THE DROPOUT PROBLEM IS NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE THE SMALL SCHOOLS OF WEST VIRGINIA CANNOT SUPPORT BROAD VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS. A REVIEW OF RECENT STUDIES LED TO NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF THE VALUE OF ANY NONACADEMIC SUBJECT OVER OTHER SUBJECTS IN HOLDING POWER. PUBLISHED  STATEMENTS AND PERSONAL CONTACTS WITH A REPRESENTATIVE NUMBER OF EDUCATORS INDICATED THE POSSIBILITY THAT INDUSTRIAL ARTS COULD HAVE HOLDING POWER. AN INDUSTRIAL ARTS PROGRAM CAN BE STRUCTURED TO SERVE ALL STUDENTS. PROPOSALS ARE--(1) A BROAD GENERAL SHOP PROGRAM SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS, (2) GENERAL SHOPS IN HIGH SCHOOLS SHOULD BE ADEQUATE SO THAT ALL WHO DESIRE CAN ENROLL, (3) UNIT SHOPS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED WHERE STUDENTS' NEEDS JUSTIFY THEM, (4) ADEQUATE FUNDS SHOULD BE PROVIDED, AND (5) A STATE SUPERVISOR OF INDUSTRIAL ARTS SHOULD BE APPOINTED TO SEE THAT THESE PROVISIONS ARE CARRIED OUT IN EACH DISTRICT.

        "description":"A STUDY WAS MADE TO IDENTIFY THE CURRENT THINKING AND PRACTICES OF BUSINESS EDUCATION LEADERS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN REGARD TO ANCILLARY SERVICES. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE SENT TO 293 COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND RETURNS WERE RECEIVED FROM 175 REPRESENTING 46 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND PUERTO RICO. A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF THE SCHOOLS CARRIED ON RESEARCH PROJECTS AND CONSULTING FUNCTIONS AND PROVIDED OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES. TEACHING AIDS, AUDIOVISUAL AIDS, AND SIMULATION PROJECTS WERE DEVELOPED RATHER CONSISTENTLY BY A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF THE SCHOOLS. A MAJORITY OF ANCILLARY SERVICES WERE DISTRIBUTED FREE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FILMS AND FILMSTRIPS. WORKSHOPS AND CONFERENCES WERE SPONSORED BY THE BUSINESS EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS IN THE FOLLOWING  ORDER OF FREQUENCY--PROGRAMS FOR EXPERIENCED TEACHERS, CONFERENCES FOR SUPERVISORS OF STUDENT TEACHERS, AND CONFERENCES AND WORKSHOPS FOR FIRST-YEAR TEACHERS. OVER HALF OF THE SCHOOLS ACTIVE IN ANCILLARY SERVICES WERE IN THE SMALL CATEGORY (7,500 STUDENTS OR BELOW) AND OFFERED DEGREES BEYOND THE BACHELOR'S. THE MEDIUM-SIZED AND VERY LARGE INSTITUTIONS HAD SHOWN A VERY FAVORABLE ATTRACTION FOR BUSINESS EDUCATION MAJORS WHILE THE SMALL AND MEDIUM-LARGE WERE DEFINITELY LAGGING. THE GROWTH PATTERNS FOR INSTITUTIONS AS A WHOLE WERE AHEAD OF BUSINESS EDUCATION DEPARTMENT GROWTH PATTERNS IN ALL SCHOOL-SIZE CATEGORIES IDENTIFIED. A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF THE SCHOOLS INDICATED THAT BUSINESS EDUCATION CURRICULUM REVISION SHOULD BE BASED PRIMARILY ON FOLLOWUP INFORMATION ON BUSINESS TEACHER  PROBLEMS, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS, AND EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH.

IN 1965 THE MDTA PROGRAM ENROLLED 186,000 TRAINEES, OF WHOM 110,000 COMPLETED TRAINING. OF THOSE WHO COMPLETED TRAINING, 74 PERCENT WERE EMPLOYED. INSTITUTIONAL TRAINING PROJECTS PROVIDED IN-SCHOOL OCCUPATIONAL INSTRUCTION TO 145,000 PERSONS. TRAINING WAS PROVIDED  AT THE JOB SITE FOR 35,000 PERSONS. EXPERIMENTAL AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR THE DISADVANTAGED SERVED 40,000 PERSONS. THE PROGRAM HELPED TO MEET LABOR DEMAND FOR 112,000 JOBS IN SERVICE AND SERVICE-RELATED OCCUPATIONS THROUGH JOB DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. THE MDTA TRAINING PROGRAMS WILL BE REDIRECTED TO FOCUS ON TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE ECONOMY--THE EMERGENCE OF SOME SELECTED SKILL SHORTAGES AND THE EXPOSURE OF RESIDUAL BUT LARGE POCKETS OF HARD-CORE UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG FAIRLY WELL DEFINED GROUPS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL-STATE MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT PLANNING SYSTEM TO RECONCILE STATE OPERATIONS WITH OVERALL NATIONAL MANPOWER NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES TO PROMOTE A RATIONALIZED UTILIZATION OF TRAINING RESOURCES IS IN PROCESS.

THE THREE MAJOR FACTORS  WHICH DETERRED ENROLLMENT WERE (1) THE TRAINING ALLOWANCE OF $25 PER WEEK WAS TOO LOW, (2) THE TRAINING PERIOD WAS TOO LONG, AND (3) COMMUNICATIONS CONCERNING THE COURSES AND ENROLLMENT IMPEDED RECRUITMENT.

TWO EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED IN INTRODUCTORY COLLEGE BACTERIOLOGY WITH A TOTAL OF 235 STUDENTS DURING 2 TERMS. IN EACH TERM, STUDENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO THREE TREATMENT GROUPS ACCORDING TO METHOD OF INSTRUCTION--(1) CONVENTIONAL, (2) PROGRAM ONLY (FIRST TERM), AND PROGRAM-PROBLEMS (SECOND TERM), AND (3) PROGRAM-DISCUSSION. FINDINGS WERE BASED ON RESULTS OF THREE TESTS GIVEN TO EACH GROUP. ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PERFORMANCE AMONG  TREATMENT GROUPS. THERE WAS GREATER VARIABILITY OF SCORES WITHIN PROGRAM GROUPS THAN WITHIN CONVENTIONAL GROUPS. HIGH ACHIEVEMENT STUDENTS LEARNED BY PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS STUDENTS OF LOW ACHIEVEMENT. IN THE SECOND TERM, STUDENTS WHO EXPRESSED NO CONFIDENCE IN THE PROGRAM METHOD DID SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER ON TESTS THAN THOSE WHO HAD CONFIDENCE. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES EXISTED DURING THE FIRST TERM BETWEEN THE CONFIDENCE AND NO CONFIDENCE GROUPS.

THE COUNTRY NO LONGER SUPPORTS THE OLD UTILITY-OF-POVERTY DOCTRINE, WHICH HELD THAT  POVERTY IS A USEFUL, NECESSARY, AND GOOD THING IN SOCIETY. HOWEVER, PROVISION FOR TODAY'S STRONG DEMAND FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY IS LIMITED BY OBSOLETE MANPOWER THINKING. IT IS ALSO LIMITED BY EDUCATIONAL MALINVESTMENT WHICH RESULTS IN LOW EARNING CAPABILITIES. SUCH MALINVESTMENT IS CAUSED BY (1) INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS SCHOOLS, THE STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY, AND THE FUNCTIONING OF THE CAPITAL MARKET WHICH DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PARTICULAR CLASSES OF PEOPLE, (2) DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, AND (3) ECONOMIC GROWTH BEYOND THE EDUCATION RATE. THE ECONOMIC GROWTH INCREASES THE DEMAND FOR HIGH SKILLS. WHAT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD ARE INPUTS OF PHYSICAL SORT WHICH ARE COMPLEMENTS OF HIGH SKILLS, THEIR RELATIONSHIP, AND THEIR SUBSTITUTION FOR UNSKILLED LABOR AND OLD FORMS OF CAPITAL.

IT BUILDS ON THE BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS OF STIMULUS, RESPONSE, AND REINFORCEMENT, AND PROVIDES A RESEARCH PARADIGM FOR GENERATING TESTABLE HYPOTHESES. IT WAS DERIVED FROM EARLY RESEARCH EFFORTS OF THE REGIONAL REHABILITATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. WORK ADJUSTMENT IS THE OUTCOME OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN AN INDIVIDUAL AND HIS WORK ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS OF SATISFACTION AND SATISFACTORINESS. THE THEORY IS FORMULATED IN TERMS OF (1) THE DEFINITIONS OF SATISFACTION, SATISFACTORINESS, ABILITIES, NEEDS, ABILITY REQUIREMENTS, REINFORCER SYSTEM, CORRESPONDENCE, AND TENURE, AND (2) NINE PROPOSITIONS. THE FIRST PROPOSITION  IS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL'S WORK ADJUSTMENT AT ANY POINT IN TIME IS DEFINED BY HIS CONCURRENT LEVELS OF SATISFACTORINESS AND SATISFACTION, THE EIGHTH IS THAT TENURE IS A FUNCTION OF SATISFACTORINESS AND SATISFACTION, AND THE NINTH IS THAT THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL (ABILITIES AND NEEDS) AND THE ENVIRONMENT (ABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND REINFORCER SYSTEM) INCREASES AS A FUNCTION OF TENURE. RESEARCH HYPOTHESES DERIVED FROM THE THEORY MAY BE OF THE CROSS-SECTIONAL, LONGITUDINAL, OR INDIVIDUAL LONGITUDINAL TYPES. THE THEORY IS COMPREHENSIVE IN THAT IT EMBRACES OR INTERPRETS FINDINGS OR CONCEPTS REPORTED IN RELEVANT LITERATURE SUCH AS ADAPTATION, ATTITUDES, EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FORCES, OCCUPATIONAL PERSONALITY, SELF-ACTUALIZATION, AND VOCATIONAL CHOICE, INTEREST, AND MATURITY. THE  THEORY CAN BE USEFUL IN (1) VOCATIONAL COUNSELING PRACTICE, (2) EDUCATION, AND (3) THE SPECIAL PROBLEM AREAS OF DISABILITY, AUTOMATION, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND RETIREMENT. THREE DIAGRAMS ILLUSTRATING THE THEORY ARE INCLUDED.

ON THE BASIS OF THIS STUDY, IT WAS RECOMMENDED (1) THAT THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE MAKE PERIODIC REVIEWS AND ANALYSES OF ATTENDANCE AND, IN THE EVENT OF CONTINUED ABSENCES AS NOTED IN PENNSYLVANIA, HE PROVIDE, WITH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF STATE AGENCIES IN DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF ABSENCES, EXCUSED AND UNEXCUSED, PERMISSIBLE FOR SATISFACTORY ATTENDANCE, AND (2) THAT THE SECRETARY OF LABOR ESTABLISH GUIDELINE CRITERIA AS TO THE NUMBER OF EXCUSED ABSENCES FOR WHICH TRAINING ALLOWANCES MAY BE PAID.

IT SHOULD ALSO GIVE RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION EMPHASIS TO THE AREAS OF STATECRAFT AND VOCATIONAL OR TECHNICAL EDUCATION BY COMPREHENDING, INVENTING, SUGGESTING, AND EVALUATING PROMISING AVENUES OF TECHNICAL WORK. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MODERN UNIVERSITY TO INFLUENCE A  DYNAMIC MANPOWER POLICY BY IMPROVING ITS ARTICULATION AND INTERDEPENDENCE WITH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. IT MUST ALSO RECONCILE ITS TRADITIONAL SENTIMENT OF DISENGAGEMENT WITH A CONTEMPORARY NEED TO CONSIDER THAT CONTINUOUS EDUCATION ON A LIFETIME BASIS IS REQUIRED. THE UNIVERSITY, AS A CENTRAL FORCE IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM, IS NOT ALTOGETHER PREPARED TO GIVE MEANING TO THE VAST TECHNOLOGICAL MACHINERY OF AN URBAN INDUSTRIAL CIVILIZATION, BUT AS IT FINDS NEW WAYS TO INFLUENCE UNDERSTANDING AND REGARD FOR THE WORLD OF HUMAN WORK, IT MAY HELP IN ACHIEVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WHICH TECHNOLOGY IS DESIGNED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

TEACHER PACING OF THE STROKING ALLOWS THE LEARNER TO GET SET FOR AND TO ORGANIZE HIS MOTIONS. THIS IS HELPFUL WHEN USED SPARINGLY AND ONLY DURING THE EARLIEST STAGES OF LEARNING. THE BASIC STRATEGY FOR LEARNING THE KEYBOARD IS TO SELECT FOR FIRST PRESENTATION A GROUP OF LETTERS THAT PERMITS THE IMMEDIATE USE OF REGULAR WORD AND SENTENCE COPY. EARLY EMPHASIS ON SPEED IS  SUPERIOR, BOTH IN THE SHORT AND IN THE LONG RUN, TO EARLY EMPHASIS ON ACCURACY OF TYPESCRIPT. THE MATERIALS FOR SPEED PRACTICE SHOULD ALWAYS CONSIST OF REGULAR LANGUAGE COPY AND NOT OF SPECIALLY CONTRIVED DRILL MATERIALS. SPEED PRACTICE MATERIALS SHOULD BE MARKED SO THAT EACH PERSON IS AIMING AT A GOAL ONLY SLIGHTLY (TWO TO FIVE WORDS) ABOVE HIS ORDINARY RATE.

SUCH DUPLICATION WASTES TAXPAYERS' MONEY.

THE PERCEPTIONS OF OFFICE WORK HELD BY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS IN URBAN AREAS, URBAN AREA STUDENTS NOT CLASSIFIED AS DISADVANTAGED, AND OFFICE WORKERS WHO GRADUATED FROM URBAN HIGH SCHOOLS AND WHO HAD LESS THAN 3 YEARS' EXPERIENCE WERE IDENTIFIED BY USE OF A PERCEPTION SCALE DEVELOPED FOR THE PROJECT. THE GAPS BETWEEN THE PERCEPTIONS AMONG THESE GROUPS WERE ANALYZED. A 5-WEEK SUMMER WORKSHOP WAS HELD AT HUNTER COLLEGE TO DEVELOP METHODS AND  MATERIALS FOR MODIFYING PERCEPTIONS OF THE DISADVANTAGED YOUTH. IT INCLUDED LECTURES AND FILMS, READINGS, GROUP DISCUSSIONS, AND LABORATORY EXPERIENCES WITH DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. THE 27 PARTICIPANTS DEVELOPED THE UNITS &quot;UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF,&quot;&quot;KNOWING ABOUT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY,&quot; AND &quot;ENTERING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY&quot; TO SUPPLEMENT EXISTING PROGRAMS. FOURTEEN RESOURCE PERSONS PRESENTED SPEECHES RELATED TO BUSINESS EDUCATION AND THE DISADVANTAGED. THE MATERIALS AND METHODS DEVELOPED WILL BE FIELD TESTED ON THREE STUDENT GROUPS.

THE IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT OCCUR IN ACQUIRING THE SKILLS BEING STUDIED HAVE TO DO WITH THE PROBLEM OF TACTILE-KINESTHETIC PERCEPTION. THE SEVEN CURRICULUM AREAS WITH WHICH THE PROJECT IS CONCERNED ARE BEING ANALYZED BY A PSYCHOLOGIST, AN INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION SPECIALIST, AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS SO THAT THE COGNITIVE AND PSYCHOMOTOR BEHAVIORS THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE TAUGHT CAN BE SPECIFIED IN BEHAVIORAL TERMS.

PHASE I CONSISTS OF 1 WEEK OF ON-CAMPUS ORIENTATION SEMINARS COVERING (1) INDUSTRIAL PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIOLOGY, AND ECONOMICS, (2) HISTORY OF INDUSTRY AND LABOR, AND (3) INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION. PHASE II CONSISTS OF 6 WEEKS OF CONCENTRATED STUDY AND OBSERVATION OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ENGINEERING, PRODUCTION, LABOR, FINANCIAL CONTROL, AND MARKETING. PHASE III IS DEVOTED TO 2 WEEKS OF ON-CAMPUS CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOP WHERE MAJOR CONCEPTS  AND INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE INDUSTRY PHASE ARE DEVELOPED INTO RESOURCE UNITS. A STUDENT WORKBOOK, 206 LESSON TOPICS, 42 SEMINAR RESOURCE UNITS, A GUIDE FOR COOPERATING INDUSTRIAL PERSONNEL, AN INDUSTRIAL CONCEPTS TEST, AND A PROCEDURE FOR CONCEPT IDENTIFICATION AND TABULATION WERE DEVELOPED.

        "description":"THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT CENTER WAS CREATED TO INITIATE AND EXPERIMENT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHING MATERIALS THAT WOULD MAKE USE OF UNTRIED, BUT SIGNIFICANT, LANGUAGE TEACHING CONCEPTS. THESE CONCEPTS WERE APPLIED IN A PROJECT FOR PRODUCING AND TRYING OUT INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS DESIGNED FOR THE FIRST 3 YEEARS OF SCHOOL AND INTENDED AS A COMMON CORE OF MATERIALS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF LANGUAGE BACKGROUNDS. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION USED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE MATERIALS WAS THAT NONPREDICTABLE, PURPOSEFUL COMMUNICATION CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS FOR THE EARLY STAGES OF SECOND OR FOREIGN LANGUAGE LEARNING, WHICH IS A DEPARTURE FROM THE USUAL PATTERN-PRACTICE FORM OF INSTRUCTION. THE NONPREDICTABLE, PURPOSEFUL  COMMUNICATION WAS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY HAVING HE STUDENT PARTICIPATE IN A SITUATION THAT HAS A MORE DEMANDING PURPOSE THAN LANGUAGE PRACTICE AND THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED ONLY BY THE APPLICATION OF NEWLY LEARNED LANGUAGE FORMS IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT PREDICTABLE BY HIS HEARERS. THE HEARERS ARE REQUIRED TO RESPOND OVERTLY TO THE SPEAKER'S LINGUISTIC SIGNALS BY SELECTING ONE OF A RANGE OF POTENTIAL RESPONSES. THE FOUR APPENDIXES TO THE REPORT CONTAIN 150 COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES, PLAYLETS AND IMPROVISATIONS, SONGS, AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT OF INTERNAL APPRAISAL OF THE DEVELOPED MATERIALS AND TRYOUTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NONPREDICTABLE, PURPOSEFUL COMMUNICATION CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AT PRIMARY GRADE  LEVELS AND THAT TAKING CHILDREN INTO EARLY FUNCTIONAL USE OF THE LANGUAGE CAN BE PEDAGOGICALLY USEFUL.

FOUR INSTITUTES SERVE THE FOUR ROLES. IN ADDITION THREE CENTERS CUT ACROSS THE FOUR INSTITUTES TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND RESEARCH TO ALL OF THEM--CENTERS FOR COUNSELING AND COMMUNITY REFERRAL, FOR RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND FOR METROPOLITAN STUDIES AND PROBLEM SOLVING. ADMINISTRATIVE AND ORGANIZATIONAL ARRANGEMENT INVOLVES A READILY ACCESSIBLE CAMPUS FOR ADULTS WITH A LEARNING CENTER, A SMALL RESIDENTIAL UNIT, AND A MUSEUM FOR POPULAR SCIENCE. FACULTY IS  OBTAINED BY A LEND-LEASE ARRANGEMENT WITH INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT IN METROPOLIS AND USE OF FACULTY AIDES. FINANCING IS DIVERSIFIED. COMMUNITY COOPERATION IS STRONG. NEW EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IS EXPLOITED. THE MYTHICAL QUALITY OF THE UNIVERSITY IS BELIED BY ITS ROOTS IN REALITIES OF THE 1960'S LISTED IN THE APPENDIX. (RT)",

        "description":"THE RELATIONSHIP OF EGO-STAGE DEVELOPMENT (BASED UPON THE THEORIES OF ERIK ERICKSON) TO THE EXPERIENCES ADULTS IDENTIFIED AS LEADING TO RE-CREATION WAS EXPLORED, USING DATA OBTAINED FROM 73 WOMEN SELECTED AT RANDOM FOR A POPULATION OF 582 AMERICAN AND CANADIAN WOMEN GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN IN FALL, 1964. INFORMATION REGARDING RE-CREATIVE EXPERIENCES WAS OBTAINED FROM A SELF-REPORT DIARY SHEET WHICH REPRESENTED REFLECTION OF EGO STAGE CONCERNS--ENJOYMENT WITHIN THE EXPERIENCE AND INTENSITY OF RE-CREATION. PARTICIPANTS OBSERVED THEIR RE-CREATIVE BEHAVIOR ON TEN RANDOMLY SELECTED DAYS IN THE INTERVENING PERIOD. IT WAS FOUND THAT, FOR THE MOST PART, EGO STAGE DEVELOPMENT WAS NOT REFLECTED IN RE-CREATIVE EXPERIENCES. HOWEVER, A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT  ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EGO STAGE DEVELOPMENT AND RE-CREATIVE EXPERIENCE WAS FOUND AMONG PSYCHOLOGICALLY MATURE SUBJECTS WHEN THEY WERE IN A POSITIVE, ENTHUSIASTIC, CREATIVE MOOD BEFORE THE EXPERIENCE. UNDER THESE SAME CONDITIONS, INTENSITY OF RE-CREATION WAS MOST FREQUENTLY HIGH. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE TENDENCY IS TO REGRESS TO A LOWER STAGE OF EGO DEVELOPMENT IN OBTAINING RE-CREATION. MATURITY AND POSITIVE DYNAMIC PRECONDITION ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN GAINING RE-CREATION IN EXPERIENCES OF PROGRESSIVE ADAPTATION. THIS PAPER WAS PRESENTED AT THE NATIONAL SEMINAR ON ADULT EDUCATION RESEARCH, CHICAGO, FEBRUARY 11-13, 1968. IT WILL BE PUBLISHED IN ADULT EDUCATION. (AJ)",

THE FIRST APPROACH TAKES OFF FROM THE TELEVISION BROADCAST, THE EFFECT OF WHICH CAN BE HEIGHTENED BY DIAL ACCESS LIBRARIES OF MAGNETIC TAPE RECORDINGS, OPEN LINE PROGRAMS, DISCUSSION GROUPS, SIMULATION OR GAMES, AND THE PUBLICIZING OF OTHER RESOURCES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY, AND BY INTERACTION WITH THE BRAODCAST VIA SELECTION OF SUBPROGRAMS, WHICH IS TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN USED. THE LEARNING SYSTEM APPROACH USES TELEVISION IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS OR EXPERIENCES TO ADD VARIETY, DEPTH, OR APPEAL TO THE WORLD AFFAIRS EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THE METROPLEX ASSEMBLY CAN CLOSE TO ILLUSTRATING THIS APPROACH IN COMMUNITY EDUCATION.

THERE ARE TWO GROUPS OF PLAYERS--HOUSEHOLD DECISION MAKERS AND FINANCIAL AGENTS. IN TEN TWO-YEAR PERIODS REPRESENTING THE AGE SPAN 45-65, PLAYERS ALLOCATE DISPOSABLE INCOME TO MAXIMIZE ASSETS BY AGE 65. THE FINANCIAL AGENTS (SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION MANAGER, STOCKBROKER, AND THREE LIFE INSURANCE AGENTS SELLING TERM, ENDOWMENT, OR STRIGHT LIFE) COMPETE FOR THE HOUSEHOLDER'S INCOME. A  COORDINATOR DETERMINES EACH PLAYER'S BIANNUAL SCORE, OVERSEES THE SELECTION OF CHANGE CARDS, AND UPDATES THE ECONOMIC INDEX. FIELD TESTS, BASED ON THE CONSUMER GAME, INDICATED THAT THE SIMULATION TECHNIQUE IS EFFECTIVE AMONG OLDER WORKERS. RESEARCH WILL CONTINUE UNDER THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INDUSTRIAL GERONTOLOGY, BEING ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON THE AGING, TO PRODUCE A WELL-DESIGNED SEQUENCE OF GAMES TO GIVE PRACTICE IN RELATING PROBLEMS SO THAT PLAYERS CAN ARRIVE AT A COMBINATION OF DECISIONS TO FIT THEIR NEEDS AND RESOURCES.

IT APPEARS THAT THE TEACHERS IN BOTH GRADES ARE USING NORMAL ADULT SPEECH PATTERNS THAT ARE NOT RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO ANY DIFFERENCES THAT MIGHT SEPARATE THEM FROM THEIR STUDENTS. THE INVESTIGATOR RECOMMENDS BOTH EXTENSION AND  REPLICATION OF THIS STUDY (USING TEACHERS AT DIFFERENT GRADE LEVELS AND CONTROLLING FOR THE CONTENT OF THE CLASSROOM DISCUSSION) AND TEACHER-CHILD INTERACTION STUDIES WITH CRITERION MEASURES UNDER CAREFUL SCRUTINY.

THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT \"FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES, AN AMERICAN ENGLISH SPEAKER WHO HAS A REASONABLE (UNDEFINED) COMMAND OF SPANISH WILL REACT TO PORTUGUESE IN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME WAY THAT A NATIVE SPANISH SPEAKER WILL.\" THIS HYPOTHESIS IS BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS OF THREE GROUPS OF PORTUGUESE LEARNERS--NATIVE SPEAKERS OF ENGLISH WITH SOME MASTERY OF SPANISH, LATIN AMERICAN NATIVE SPEAKERS OF SPANISH, AND URUGUAYANS LIVING ON THE BORDER NEAR BRAZIL WHO LEARN PORTUGUESE ALONG WITH SPANISH FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD. IN ALL THREE GROUPS THE INFLUENCE OF SPANISH ON THE  LEARNING OF PORTUGUESE WAS \"STRIKINGLY SIMILAR\" AND DIFFERENCES AMONG THE GROUPS APPEARED MOSTLY OF DEGREE RATHER THAN TYPE. AT THE PRESENT AND IN THE NEAR FUTURE, HOWEVER, AMERICAN STUDENTS WITH COMPETENCE IN SPANISH WILL HAVE TO USE AVAILABLE TEXTS WRITTEN FOR THE MONOLINGUAL ENGLISH SPEAKER. THE INDIVIDUAL TEACHER OF PORTUGUESE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR--(1) BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH THE STRUCTURE OF SPANISH THROUGH LINGUISTIC DESCRIPTIONS OF ITS PHONOLOGY AND GRAMMAR, AND (2) DEFINING THE NATURE OF THE LINGUISTIC PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN CONTRASTING THE TWO LANGUAGES, AT LEAST IN TERMS OF WHETHER THE SOUND SYSTEM, THE GRAMMAR, OR THE VOCABULARY ARE INVOLVED. SEVERAL SHORT EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF A BACKGROUND IN SPANISH ON THE LEARNER'S PERFORMANCE IN BEGINNING  AND INTERMEDIATE PORTUGUESE. (JD)",

SUCH A STUDENT SHOULD BE OFFERED COURSES IN PORTUGUESE DESIGNED FOR SPEAKERS OF ANOTHER ROMANCE LANGUAGE (ESPECIALLY SPANISH). WHEN FEASIBLE, BOTH A REGULAR ELEMENTARY AND AN ACCELERATED COURSE SHOULD BE OFFERED. IF THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, A SCHOOL WITH A LANGUAGE LABORATORY OR AUDIOLINGUAL EQUIPMENT COULD OFFER A PROGRAMED COURSE IN SPOKEN PORTUGUESE FOR SPEAKERS OF SPANISH WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THE CONTINUING PRESENCE OF AN  INSTRUCTOR (SEE ED 010 319). IN ENCOURAGING ABLE STUDENTS TO STUDY PORTUGUESE, CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO MAKE USE OF THE BEST AVAILABLE TEACHING MATERIALS AND TO PLAN FOR COURSES BEYOND THE TWO-YEAR HIGH SCHOOL SEQUENCE OR INITIAL ONE-YEAR COLLEGE COURSE. ADVANCED COURSES IN LITERATURE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO PRESENT THE FULL RANGE OF PORTUGUESE CULTURE. COURSES IN LUSO BRAZILIAN CULTURE AND AREA STUDIES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AND TAUGHT IN PORTUGUESE. THESE COURSES NEED NOT BE SUBORDINATED TO A LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES CURRICULUM, HOWEVER. AGAIN, INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS COULD BE DEVELOPED USING PROGRAMED MATERIALS, CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION OR VIDEOTAPED CLASSES, OR COORDINATED HIGH SCHOOL/COLLEGE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION. BASIC TO THESE SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING THE CURRICULUM IS THE NEED FOR MORE AND  BETTER TRAINED TEACHERS.

FURTHER EXPERIMENTATION WAS CARRIED OUT ON THE FIRST LEVEL OF PRIMARY SCHOOL, PREPARING AND TESTING A SERIES OF TAPES DESIGNED TO HELP CHILDREN FROM IMPOVERISHED BACKGROUNDS DEVELOP VERBAL FACILITY. IT WAS FELT THAT THE SOONER THE CHILD LEARNS TO DISTINGUISH THE SOUNDS OF THE HOME AND NEIGHBORHOOD FROM THOSE OF THE SCHOOL AND BUSINESS WORLD, AND HAS PRACTICE IN USING THE NEW SOUNDS THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN SONGS AND GAMES DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN STANDARD USAGES, THE BETTER START HE WILL HAVE IN ALL COMMUNICATION  SKILLS. THE TAPE SCRIPTS WERE DISCUSSED AND REVISED BY A MULTI-RACIAL TEAM OF TEACHERS AND SUPERVISORS AS WELL AS CONSULTING LINGUISTS AND EDUCATORS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES. AFTER PRELIMINARY RECORDINGS WERE TESTED IN CLASSROOM SITUATIONS, THREE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN DETROIT USED THE TAPES (THREE LESSONS A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS).

THE LEARNING PROCESS MIGHT BE CASUAL EXPOSURE OR SYSTEMATIC PEDAGOGY. THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT FOR CHILDREN UNDER ELEVEN LANGUAGE IS SOUND AND FOR ADULTS, SENSE. CHILDREN ATTEND MORE TO THE SURFACE, JUST AS THEY ALSO CONNECT SPEECH MORE TO THE IMMEDIATE SITUATION IN WHICH IT OCCURS. FOR ADULTS, LANGUAGE IS TRANSPARENT, SINCE ADULTS RAPIDLY PENETRATE THE SURFACE OF AN UTTERANCE TO ITS MEANINGS, TO A NETWORK OF CONNECTED THOUGHTS. THE BASIS FOR THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHILDREN AND ADULTS IS UNKNOWN. IF THE DIFFERENCE IS NEUROLOGICAL, OR LIES IN THE LOSS OF AN ABILITY, CHILDREN MUST BE EXPOSED TO DIFFERENT TEACHING METHODS THAN ADULTS,  SINCE THEIR ABILITIES DIFFER. IF THE DIFFERENCE IN BEHAVIOR IS A CONSEQUENCE OF SHIFT OF SET OR ATTENTION OR THE RESULT OF THE ADULT'S GREATER RICHNESS AND SKILL IN SEMANTIC ASSOCIATION, THE PEDAGOGICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND OTHERS CONCERNING AGE OF LEARNING AND THE SOCIAL MILIEU ARE BROUGHT TO BEAR IN THIS PAPER, TO SUGGEST NEW DIRECTIONS THAT RESEARCH MIGHT TAKE IN THE STUDY OF BILINGUALISM.

(2) IF THE ENGLISH MAJOR SENTENCE TYPE CAN BE SAID TO CONSIST OF SUBJECT AND PREDICATE, THE JAPANESE MAJOR SENTENCE TYPE CAN BE SAID TO CONSIST OF PREDICATE ONLY. (3) BLOCH'S CONCEPT OF THE JAPANESE SENTENCE AS A PAUSE GROUP CONSISTING OF A PREDICATE ONLY IS APPROPRIATE, BUT HIS IDEA OF DIVIDING THE PREDICATES INTO TWO TYPES--FINAL PREDICATE AND NON-FINAL PREDICATE--BASED ON INTONATION IS NOT APPROPRIATE. THE CONCLUSION WAS REACHED THAT SINCE THE MAJOR SENTENCE TYPE OF JAPANESE IS NOT ONLY SUBJECTLESS BUT ALSO FRAGMENTARY OR ELLIPTICAL, IT  IS NOT APPROPRIATE FIRST TO POSTULATE A KERNEL SENTENCE CONSISTING OF A SUBJECT AND A PREDICATE AND THEN TO DELETE THE SUBJECT. IN THIS PAPER, WHICH CONTINUES THE DISCUSSION, THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS JAPANESE AS BELONGING TO NEITHER THE LATIN-ENGLISH NOR THE CHINESE GROUP, BUT BEING A \"BORDERLINE\" CASE. ALTHOUGH SOME JAPANESE VERB FORMS (NEUTRAL, HONORIFIC, AND HUMBLE) LOOK LIKE LATIN SENTENCE-WORDS IN WHICH SUBJECT AND PREDICATE ARE FUSSED, THEY DO NOT REGULARLY INCLUDE SUBJECTS. IN DISCUSSING JAPANESE SYNTAX, IT IS USUALLY AGREED THAT A PREDICATE NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE PROVIDED WITH A TOPIC. THE IMPRESSION THAT IN JAPANESE THE SUBJECT IS OPTIONAL IS NOT ACCURATE. THE FACT THAT SOME SUBJECTS ARE OPTIONAL, SOME OTHERS ARE OBLIGATORY, AND STILL OTHERS MUST NOT BE OVERTLY STATED CAN BE  COMPARED WITH THE USAGE OF ENGLISH ARTICLES. JAPANESE SYNTAX WOULD BE SENSELESS UNLESS IT IS ANALYZED AND DESCRIBED IN DETAIL FROM THE VIEWPOINT THAT SENTENCES ARE LINGUISTIC UNITS OF A LARGER CONSTRUCTION.

THE STUDY OF THE OLD UZBEK LITERARY LANGUAGE (SOMETIMES REFERRED TO INCORRECTLY AS &quot;CHAGATAY&quot;) IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE FOR DETERMINING THE PERIOD OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE UZBEK LITERARY LANGUAGE. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR ESTABLISHING ITS RELATIONSHIP TO (1) UZBEK DIALECTS, (2) RELATED TURKIC LANGUAGES, PARTICULARLY UIGHUR, AND (3) NON-RELATED LANGUAGES, SUCH AS TAJIK (CENTRAL ASIATIC PERSIAN) AND ARABIC. THE FORMATION OF THE OLD UZBEK LITERARY LANGUAGE DATES BACK TO THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES. A LARGE PART OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY LITERATURE REMAINS UNSTUDIED TO THIS DAY. WHILE THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE OF THIS PERIOD WAS &quot;HIGH STYLE&quot; AND NOT INTELLIGIBLE TO THE BROAD MASSES  OF THE PEOPLE, AT ITS BASE LAY A FOLK LANGUAGE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY LEXICAL BORROWINGS FROM ARABIC AND TAJIK. THE GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE WAS AND STILL IS MORE STABLE, REVEALING A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CASE FORMS OF OLD UZBEK AND MODERN UZBEK. THE UNUSUAL NATURE OF THE DIALECT MAP OF UZBEK IS BEST EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ETHNO-GENETIC PROCESS UNDER WHICH THE UZBEK NATION WAS FORMED. CERTAIN LOCAL DIALECTS HAVE RETAINED CLEAR TRACES OF LINGUISTIC INTERACTION BETWEEN MEMBERS OF VARIOUS TURKIC TRIBAL GROUPS DURING DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THEIR JOINT EXISTENCE. ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS THE VERY PROLONGED LINGUISTIC CONTACT WITH NON-TURKIC ETHNIC ELEMENTS. RESULTS OF THE INFLUENCE OF THIS SUBSTRATUM ARE CLEARLY APPARENT NOT ONLY IN THE LEXICAL SPHERE BUT ALSO  IN PHONETICS, AND TO SOME EXTENT, IN THE GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE OF UZBEK.

BEFORE THIS, THE BASHKIR LANGUAGE DID NOT HAVE A STANDARD LITERARY FORM. PROGRESSIVE BASHKIR EDUCATORS OF THE LATE NINETEENTH AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURIES FOUGHT FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE LITERARY LANGUAGE FROM ELEMENTS OF CENTRAL ASIATIC TURKI. AS A RESULT, A SIGNIFICANT LITERATURE WAS CREATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BASED PRIMARILY ON COLLOQUIAL (SPOKEN) BASHKIR. THE INFLUENCE OF TURKI ON THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE WAS SO DEEP, HOWEVER, THAT THE FEATURES OF THE ORAL LANGUAGE COULD NOT BECOME PREDOMINANT IN THE WRITTEN LANGUAGE. THE SPOKEN (&quot;FOLK-COLLOQUIAL&quot;) BASHKIR IS DESCRIBED AS HAVING SPLIT INTO THREE  TERRITORIAL DIALECT GROUPS, WHICH DEVELOPED UNDER DIFFERENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DURING THE SIXTEENTH TO EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES--(1) THE NORTHWESTERN DIALECTS, STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY TATAR, (2) THE SOUTHWESTERN DIALECTS, COMPARATIVELY UNIFIED IN THE JURMATI DIALECT, AND (3) THE NORTHEASTERN GROUPS, REPRESENTED BY THE KUVAKAN DIALECT. WHILE THE JURMATI AND KUVAKAN DIALECTS DEVELOPED SEPARATELY IN THE LAST TWO CENTURIES, THEY STILL MOST FULLY PRESENT THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE BASHKIR LANGUAGE WHICH WERE LOST BY MANY NORTHWESTERN DIALECTS AS THE RESULT OF FOREIGN INFLUENCE.

        "description":"A NEW METHOD FOR LEARNING TO READ TECHNICAL LITERATURE IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE IS BEING DEVELOPED AND TESTED AT THE LANGUAGE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX, COLCHESTER, ENGLAND. THE METHOD IS CALLED \"THREE QUESTION EXPERIMENTAL METHOD (3QX),\" AND IT HAS BEEN USED IN THREE COURSES FOR TEACHING SCIENTIFIC RUSSIAN TO PHYSICISTS. THE THREE QUESTIONS--WHAT, HOW, AND WHEN TO LEARN--ARE CONSIDERED FOR EVERY DETAIL WHICH STUDENTS WILL ENCOUNTER AND PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS ARE GIVEN TO ATTAIN OPTIMUM PERFORMANCE. THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS ARE DECIDED ON THE BASIS OF COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF THE TARGET LITERATURE AND ON LEARNING PROCEDURES DERIVED FROM EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. IN THE 3QX METHOD, VOCABULARY LEARNING IS TAKEN AS THE MAJOR SUBJECT SINCE IN ANY SPECIALIZED LITERATURE THE 1,000  MOST COMMON WORDS COVER ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF THE TEXT. THE PHYSICS COURSE BEGINS WITH A FIVE-HOUR INTRODUCTION TO THE RUSSIAN ALPHABET, PRONUNCIATION, WORD FORMATION, AND TECHNIQUES OF MEMORIZATION. STUDENTS THEN LEARN THE FIRST 500 DIFFERENT WORDS WHICH ARE USED EXCLUSIVELY IN AN ELEMENTARY RUSSIAN TEXTBOOK ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM. LEARNERS CAN START READING THE TEXT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WORDS ARE MEMORIZED (15 HOURS OF STUDY IN THREE WEEKS, ONE HOUR A DAY) AND ARE ABLE TO DEDUCE CONTEXT FROM THE VOCABULARY AND FROM THEIR SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER. THE RUSSIAN IS READ THROUGH A GRILL WHICH CAN BE MOVED TO SHOW THE ENGLISH EQUIVALENT, THE GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION, AND THE DICTIONARY FORM OF EVERY WORD USED. IN ADDITION, THE 1,026 MOST FREQUENTLY USED WORDS IN RUSSIAN  THEORETICAL PHYSICS HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR MEMORIZATION ON CARDS. A SECOND TEXT, ON RADIOACTIVITY, IS BEING PREPARED FOR FURTHER PRACTICE IN DEDUCTION. IT IS PLANNED TO EXTEND WORK TO RUSSIAN CHEMISTRY AND MATHEMATICS. AT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE THE CARD SYSTEM OF LEARNING IS LIKELY TO BE SUPPLEMENTED OR SUPPLANTED BY A COMPUTER WHICH WILL MEASURE THE SPEED AT WHICH THE LEARNER REMEMBERS THE MEANING OF EACH ITEM.

OLDER CHILDREN (THREE-YEAR-OLDS) UNDERSTAND SOME SENTENCES LESS WELL THAN YOUNGER CHILDREN (TWO-YEAR-OLDS). THIS BRIEF DECREASE IN COMPREHENSION ABILITY IS DUE TO THE TEMPORARY OVER-GENERALIZATION OF PERCEPTUAL STRATEGIES WHICH ARE DRAWN FROM THE CHILD'S EXPERIENCE. IN THE AUTHOR'S VIEW, THE YOUNG CHILD PASSES THROUGH THREE PHASES WITH RESPECT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY CONCEPTUAL CAPACITY--(1) DEPENDENCE ON BASIC PERCEPTUAL AND CONCEPTUAL MECHANISMS, (2) EXTENSION OF THOSE BASIC MECHANISMS BY GENERALIZATIONS DRAWN FROM EXPERIENCE, AND (3) THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BROAD CONCEPTUAL BASE WHICH MEDIATES BETWEEN THE  BASIC MECHANISMS AND THE GENERALIZATIONS. THE PRESENT RESEARCH ON 263 CHILDREN SHOWS THAT THE YOUNG CHILD'S CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND AND ACT OUT SIMPLE SENTENCES GOES THROUGH THIS KIND OF DEVELOPMENTAL SEQUENCE. (AUTHOR/AMM)",

        "description":"AT THE ECONOMICS INSTITUTE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, A SUMMER ORIENTATION PROGRAM FOR FOREIGN GRADUATE STUDENTS IN ECONOMICS, AN APPROACH TO THE TEACHING OF COMPOSITION HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WHICH INVOLVES THE USE OF WRITING LABORATORIES BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE AURAL-ORAL LANGUAGE LABORATORY. THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THE LATTER IS THAT BY MEANS OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT THE STUDENT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXTENDED SELF-CORRECTING PRACTICE OF MATERIALS INTRODUCED IN CLASS. THE IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION OF HIS RESPONSE IS BUILT INTO THE PROGRAM. THE WRITING LABORATORY AS USED BY THE AUTHOR CONSISTS OF A SMALL GROUP OF ABOUT SEVEN TO TEN STUDENTS WHO PRACTICE COMPOSITION UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF AN INSTRUCTOR. A TYPICAL SESSION LASTS FOR ABOUT ONE AND A HALF HOURS. THE INSTRUCTOR  CIRCULATES AMONG THE STUDENTS, CORRECTING THEIR LEXICAL AND STRUCTURAL MISTAKES, SUGGESTING ADDITIONAL VOCABULARY, AND POINTING OUT STYLISTIC DEVICES WHICH WILL MAKE THE WRITING MORE EFFECTIVE. THE STUDENT KEEPS HIS CORRECTED ASSIGNMENT IN A FOLDER WHICH HE BRINGS EACH TIME, PERMITTING A CUMULATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE TYPES OF MISTAKES WHICH HE TENDS TO MAKE. SEVERAL BASIC LINGUISTIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES MUST BE KEPT IN MIND IN PREPARING MATERIALS FOR THIS TYPE OF WRITING EXERCISE--(1) THE STUDENT MUST NOT BE ASKED TO PERFORM ON A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVEL OF PROFICIENCY THAN HE IS PREPARED FOR. (2) WHILE THE STUDENT IS STILL ON LEVELS TWO AND THREE, EMPHASIS ON FORM (THE MANIPULATION OF THE STRUCTURES) SHOULD PRECEDE EMPHASIS ON THE CONTENT OF THE COMPOSITION.

A TRANSITIONAL CULTURE RELIEVING THE INDIVIDUAL OF CARES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND ALLOWING FOR EXPERIMENTATION AND PLAY IS REQUIRED. THE INDIVIDUAL IN SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION EXHIBITS A COMMITMENT TO THE NEW STATUS, AN ARTICULATION OF WHAT THE NEW STATUS IS LIKE, AND A RESERVED JUDGMENT OF HIS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE IT.

THE SEVENTH GRADE EVALUATIONS WERE COMPREHENSIVE, INCLUDING A VARIETY OF SCHOOL RECORD AND ACHIEVEMENT MEASURES, PERSONALITY AND BEHAVIOR MEASURES, AND TEACHER AND PEER EVALUATIONS. THIS EVALUATION PARALLELED IN FORM AND CONTENT THE ONE USED AT THE THIRD GRADE LEVEL. CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE PRIMARY GRADES AS HAVING MANIFEST OR INCIPIENT PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS CONTINUED, AT THE SEVENTH GRADE LEVEL, TO GIVE EVIDENCE OF INEFFECTUAL FUNCTIONING IN MANY BASIC AREAS OF PERFORMANCE. THE EARLY DETECTED DIFFICULTIES, LEFT  UNTREATED, HAD THUS REMAINED ESSENTIALLY STABLE. FOLLOW UP COMPARISONS BETWEEN CHILDREN EXPOSED TO A PREVENTIVE PROGRAM AND THOSE NOT SO EXPOSED INDICATED THAT THE ORIGINAL BENEFICIAL RESULTS OF THE PROGRAM WERE NOT CLEARLY DEMONSTRABLE AT THE FOLLOW UP POINT. THE LATTER ANALYSIS, HOWEVER, WAS CLOUDED BY DIFFERENTIAL ATTRITION RATES IN THE TWO SAMPLES. LONGITUDINAL CORRELATIONAL DATA INDICATED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF STABILITY OF EVALUATION INDICES OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD, SUGGESTING THAT EARLY PERFORMANCE (DURING THE PRIMARY YEARS) MAY PREDICT WELL TO LATER SCHOOL FUNCTIONING.

THIS THEORY WAS THE BASIS OF THE TEACHERS TRAINING PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY THE CHICAGO INSTITUTE FOR PSYCHOANALYSIS. THE PROGRAM INVOLVED FIVE SEMINARS AT WHICH TEACHERS PRESENTED CASE SUMMARIES BASED ON CURRENT CLASSROOM PROBLEMS. THE CASES WERE USED AS POINTS OF DEPARTURE FOR TEACHING APPROPRIATE THEORY APPLICABLE TO OTHER CHILDREN. CONSULTATION WAS ALSO PROVIDED ON THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD. THE TRAINING PROGRAM UTILIZED TEACHER OBSERVATION AND TEACHER INTROSPECTION AS INSTRUCTIONAL TOOLS. SINCE MANY OF THE CONCEPTS TAUGHT RAN COUNTER TO TRADITIONAL EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICE, THEY ACTIVATED ANXIETY AND PERSONAL CONFLICT  IN TEACHERS. THE LEADER, HOWEVER, BY ACCEPTING AND RESPECTING THE TEACHERS' FEELINGS, MINIMIZED THE ANXIETY. PSYCHODYNAMIC THEORY WAS ALSO USED TO HELP TEACHERS BECOME MORE SENSITIVE AND TOLERANT OF THEIR PUPILS. FINALLY, EDUCATIONAL TECHNIQUES FOR MEETING THE CHILD'S NEEDS WERE DEVELOPED BY THE TEACHERS IN COLLARBORATION WITH THE LEADER.

TABULATIONS WERE MADE OF 92 QUESTIONNAIRES RETURNED FROM 21 COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO INDICATE HOW RESPONDENTS PERCEIVED THE ROLE OF THE COUNSELOR IN THEIR COLLEGES IN 1966 AND BY 1970. TABULATIONS WERE MADE ACCORDING TO FUNCTION AND PERCEPTION OF ROLE. AMONG THE 21 BASIC STUDENT PERSONNEL FUNCTIONS, MORE THAN 95 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS SAW THE COUNSELOR AS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR STUDENT COUNSELING. OVER 90 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS SAW THE COUNSELOR AS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR--(1) APPLICANT CONSULTING, (2) EDUCATIONAL TESTING, (3) GROUP ORIENTING, (4)  CAREER INFORMATION, AND (5) STUDENT ADVISEMENT. THE MOST FREQUENT AND CONSISTENT PERCEPTION OF THE COUNSELOR'S TASKS FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL STUDENT INTERVIEWING. INTERPRETING TEST RESULTS IN COUNSELING INTERVIEWS WAS SEEN AS A COUNSELOR'S TASK BY MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS. INCREASED INVOLVEMENT WAS SEEN IN INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH AND GROUP WORK WITH STUDENTS. INTERVIEW REPORTS SUPPORT THE MAJOR FINDINGS IN THE QUESTIONNAIRES.

MALE ENGINEERING STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA WERE ADMINISTERED A BATTERY OF SIX BRIEF, INDEPENDENT TESTS ON EACH OF TWENTY DAYS. MOST OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF INTRA-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY WERE RELIABLE. VARIABILITY OVER TIME ON SOME TASKS IS RELATED TO VARIABILITY ON OTHER TASKS, BUT THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE ONLY MODERATE AND THE HIGHEST CORRELATIONS BETWEEN ANY TWO OF THE VARIANCE INDICES WAS ONLY ABOUT .50. INTRA-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY IS NOT SPECIFIC TO EACH  TASK BUT NEITHER IS THERE A BROADLY GENERALIZED CHARACTERISTIC OF SUCH VARIABILITY. A RELATIONSHIP WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE VARIABILITY OVER TIME OF A PERSON'S BEHAVIOR ON SIMPLE TASKS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS WITH WHICH HIS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE CAN BE PREDICTED. SOME OF THE ANALYSES REVEALED ERRORS OF PREDICTION SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER FOR THE LESS VARIABLE GROUP. CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF RESULTS OF OTHER RESEARCH, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A COMPLEX BUT PRESUMEDLY USEFUL RELATIONSHIP EXITS BETWEEN THE CONSISTENCY OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S BEHAVIOR AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH HIS ACADEMIC BEHAVIOR IS PREDICTABLE.

THE 769-PAGE APPRAISAL, IN PROCESS OF PUBLICATION, EXAMINES THE OPERATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF EACH DIVISION OF THE FOUR OPERATING BUREAUS--HIGHER EDUCATION, RESEARCH, ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION, AND ADULT AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. ASPECTS OF THE OFFICE WHICH WERE CONSIDERED INCLUDE BACKGROUND AND PRESENT ORGANIZATION, PERSONNEL AND PERSONNEL PRACTICES, DECENTRALIZATION, REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES, AND PLANNING AND EVALUATION OF PROGRAMS. ONE OF THE OFFICE'S GREAT STRENGTHS IS ITS CAPABLE AND SERVICE-MINDED STAFF, RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONGRESS AND TO THE  VARIED NEEDS OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, INSTITUTIONS, AND POPULATIONS SERVED. THE OFFICE'S GREATEST WEAKNESS IS ITS OVERLOAD OF RESPONSIBILITIES COMPARED WITH ITS PRESENT CAPABILITY OF DEALING WITH THEM. PROBLEMS OF FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS THAT DEMAND IMMEDIATE ATTENTION INCLUDE LATE FUNDING, BURDENSOME ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS, INADEQUATE EVALUATION, FEDERAL CONTROL WHEN SUCH CONTROL IS PROHIBITED, AND LACK OF UNIFORM STATE ADMINISTRATION. OTHER PROBLEMS INCLUDE UNSATISFACTORY DEVELOPMENT OF CATEGORICAL AID PROGRAMS, INADEQUATE VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL TRAINING PROGRAMS, AND THE NEED FOR RAISING EDUCATION TO CABINET STATUS IN THE FEDERAL STRUCTURE.

OF 321 QUESTIONNAIRES MAILED TO A SELECTED SAMPLE OF HEALTH PROGRAM PERSONNEL, 217 (67.7 PERCENT) WERE RETURNED USABLE FOR ANALYSIS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 35 FROM EACH COMMUNITY. IN THE SIX COMMUNITIES, 155 INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH SELECTED SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY PERSONNEL. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS GENERALLY CONFIRMED THAT (1) QUALITY OF THE SCHOOL HEALTH PROGRAM IS RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION AND RELATIONSHIPS, (2) QUALITY OF THE SCHOOL HEALTH PROGRAM IS RELATED TO SOURCE AND  EXTENT OF FISCAL SUPPORT, (3) MAINTENANCE OF AND/OR IMPROVEMENT IN STUDENT HEALTH IS RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION AND RELATIONSHIPS, AND (4) EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF THE THREE PHASES OF THE SCHOOL HEALTH PROGRAM (INSTRUCTION, SERVICES, AND ENVIRONMENT) IS RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION AND RELATIONSHIPS.

BOARD MEMBERS AND ADMINISTRATORS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO BOARD TEAMS, AND TEACHERS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TEACHER TEAMS. AFTER BARGAINING THROUGH A SIMULATION OF COLLECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS, THE RESULTS OF THE SIMULATION AND THE OPTIMUM SOLUTIONS OF GAME THEORY WERE SCORED USING THE GUIDELINES FOR SCORING AS SUGGESTED BY THE UCEA NEGOTIATIONS GAME. A STRONG MAJORITY (87 PERCENT) OF THE PARTICIPANTS INDICATED IN A  POST-SESSION QUESTIONNAIRE THAT THE EXERCISE WAS FROM MODERATELY TO HIGHLY SIMULATED.

THE STUDY IS LIMITED TO FORMAL PROCEDURES USED FOR PROCESSING THE GRIEVANCES OF PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS. INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT WAS OBTAINED FROM QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSES RECEIVED FROM 374 SCHOOL SYSTEMS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE ASKED FOR STATUS INFORMATION NOT UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE IN WRITTEN GRIEVANCE POLICIES. THIS INFORMATION INCLUDED TYPE OF PROCEDURE, NUMBER OF PROCESSINGS, PERSONNEL COVERED, AND DISSEMINATION OF THE POLICY. THE REPORT PROVIDES A FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR SCHOOL PERSONNEL, EDUCATION ASSOCIATIONS, AND INTERESTED LAYMEN FOR BOTH ESTABLISHING AND IMPROVING FORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES.

        "description":"THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VOCATIONAL OUTLOOK OF HIGH SCHOOL EDUCABLE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED (EMH) STUDENTS AND THE TYPE OF HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM IN WHICH THEY WERE ENROLLED. POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EMH STUDENTS' VOCATIONAL OUTLOOK AND AGE, SEX, RACE, INTELLECTUAL LEVEL, READING ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL, WORK EXPERIENCE HISTORY, AND HOME BACKGROUND WERE ALSO CONSIDERED. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 13 HIGH SCHOOLS IN ILLINOIS WHICH OPERATED TWO OR MORE SPECIAL CLASSES DURING THE 1965-66 SCHOOL YEAR. THE SAMPLE INCLUDED 202 MALES AND 171 FEMALES WHO RANGED IN AGE FROM 13 TO 21 YEARS. VOCATIONAL OUTLOOK OF EMH STUDENTS WAS MEASURED BY A COULD YOU EVER SCALE, A GROUP TEST CONSTRUCTED FOR THE STUDY. EACH PROGRAM WAS RATED ON A PROGRAM CRITERIA  INDEX, ALSO CONSTRUCTED BY THE INVESTIGATOR. THE STUDY FOUND (1) A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN IQ GROUPINGS BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES WITH MORE MALES IN THE HIGHER IQ GROUPINGS, (2) NO SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STUDENTS' VOCATIONAL OUTLOOK AND THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM IN WHICH THEY WERE ENROLLED, (3) FEMALES LESS APPROPRIATE IN THEIR VOCATIONAL OUTLOOK THAN MALES, (4) A DECREASE WITH AGE IN INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSES ON VOCATIONAL OUTLOOK, (5) AS A GROUP NON-WHITE SUBJECTS WERE MORE INAPPROPRIATE IN VOCATIONAL OUTLOOK THAN WHITE, (6) A LESS APPROPRIATE OUTLOOK IN THE LOWER IQ GROUP OF SUBJECTS, (7) MORE APPROPRIATE ATTITUDES IN VOCATIONAL OUTLOOK OF MALES FOLLOWING COMMUNITY WORK PLACEMENT, AND (8) MORE APPROPRIATE VOCATIONAL ATTITUDES IN STUDENTS FROM THE FATHERS' HIGHER LEVEL OF  OCCUPATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL GROUPS THAN IN THOSE FROM THE FATHERS' LOWER LEVEL GROUPS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAM PLANNING ARE MADE, AND FURTHER STUDIES ARE SUGGESTED. A BIBLIOGRAPHY CONTAINS 32 REFERENCES, AND APPENDIXES PRESENT THE PROGRAM CRITERIA INDEX AND THE COULD YOU EVER SCALE.

IN 1964, A QUESTIONNAIRE ELICITING BIOGRAPHICAL DATA, MEDICAL HISTORY, ATTITUDES OF PARENTS AND SIBLINGS TOWARD THE BRAIN INJURED CHILD, AND THERAPEUTIC NEEDS WAS SENT TO ALL PARENTS WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THE NEW JERSEY ASSOCIATION FOR BRAIN-INJURED CHILDREN. THE 190 RETURNED QUESTIONNAIRES (55 PERCENT) PROVIDED INFORMATION ABOUT 137 BOYS AND 53 GIRLS, AGED 4 TO 21 YEARS. PARENTS WHO RETURNED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ABOVE NEW JERSEY 'S AVERAGE IN EDUCATION, OCCUPATION, AND ECONOMIC  STATUS. ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE BRAIN INJURED CHILDREN IN THE SAMPLE TENDED TO BE BORN TO OLDER WOMEN (OVER 30). SPEECH WAS THE MOST VISIBLE DISABILITY OF THESE CHILDREN, FOLLOWED BY FAULTY BABY PATTERNS, POOR COORDINATION, AND SLOW DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL. MOST LEARNING DISABILITIES (85 PERCENT) WERE FIRST NOTED AT SCHOOL AGE AND OVER HALF OF THE CHILDREN WERE MULTIPLY HANDICAPPED. PARENTS MOST FREQUENTLY COMPLAINED ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS OF INABILITY TO RELATE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. NEARLY HALF OF THE PARENTS WERE DISSATISFIED WITH THE WAY THEIR DOCTORS PRESENTED THEIR DIAGNOSIS. THE INSTITUTE FOR HUMAN POTENTIAL AND OTHER CHILD GUIDANCE AND EVALUATION CENTERS HAD THE HIGHEST REPUTATIONS AMONG PARENTS. MOST OF THE PARENTS REPORTED TAKING AN ENCOURAGING ATTITUDE TOWARD  THEIR CHILDREN AND HOPING THAT THE CHILDREN WOULD ADAPT TO THEIR DIFFICULTIES. IN ALL, 89 PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN WERE CONSIDERED BY THEIR PARENTS TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH, AND MOST OF THE SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN ATTENDED PUBLIC SCHOOLS. PARENTS FELT THE MOST IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE NEED OF THEIR CHILDREN WAS FOR SPECIAL CLASSES WITH TRAINED TEACHERS. ELEVEN REFERENCES ARE LISTED.

INDIVIDUALLY FITTED WITH MOLDED EARPLUGS, THE DEVICE WAS SIMILAR TO A HEARING AID BUT PRODUCED A CONSTANT TONE OF SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO INTERRUPT AUDITORY FEEDBACK DURING SPEECH AND THEREBY TO REDUCE THE CIRCULARITY OF NONFLUENCY. TO TEST THE DEVICE, SUBJECTS WERE SELECTED FROM GRADE SCHOOL, HIGH SCHOOL, AND COLLEGE. HALF OF THE SUBJECTS RECEIVED BIWEEKLY 1-HOUR SPEECH THERAPY FOR 6 MONTHS WITH THE USE OF THE AID. THE REMAINING SERVED AS CONTROLS AND RECEIVED NO THERAPY. EACH OF THE 24 SUBJECTS WAS PRE- AND POSTTESTED WITH (1) FOUR SUBSCALES OF THE WECHSLER ADULT INTELLIGENCE SCALE OR THE SAME SUBSCALES OF THE WECHSLER  INTELLIGENCE SCALE FOR CHILDREN, WHICHEVER WERE AGE APPROPRIATE, (2) THE IOWA SCALE OF SEVERITY, AND (3) THE GRAY ORAL READING TEST (EVALUATED IN TERMS OF TIME IN SECONDS TAKEN TO READ THE ASSIGNED PARAGRAPHS). PRETESTS INDICATED NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS ON AGE, INTELLIGENCE, OR THE GRAY TEST AND IOWA SCALE. ALSO, POSTTESTS INDICATED THAT THE GRAY TEST WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IN PRE- AND POSTTRAINING ASSESSMENT. THE RATINGS ON THE IOWA SCALE, HOWEVER, INDICATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (BEYOND THE .05 LEVEL) AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP.

WITH THE INTERMITTENT SYSTEM THE CORRECTIONIST IS ASSIGNED TO A NUMBER OF SCHOOLS AND GENERALLY SEES CHILDREN TWICE A WEEK FOR 15 TO 20 MINUTES. UNDER THE BLOCK SYSTEM CHILDREN RECEIVE DAILY THERAPY FOR 3 TO 6 WEEKS, AND 1 DAY A WEEK THE CORRECTIONIST RETURNS TO ALTERNATE SCHOOLS FOR CARRYOVER OR SEVERE SPEECH CASES. THE STUDY HYPOTHESIZED THAT ARTICULATION PROBLEMS WOULD SHOW GREATER IMPROVEMENT WITH THE BLOCK SYSTEM, AND THAT WHEN ARTICULATION PROBLEMS WERE VIEWED IN TERMS OF FOUR SEVERITY GROUPINGS THE BLOCK SYSTEM WOULD MAKE GREATER GAINS. TWO  CORRECTIONISTS USED THE BLOCK SYSTEM IN FIVE CHAMPAIGN (ILLINOIS) PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WITH 153 CHILDREN, WHILE FOUR CORRECTIONISTS USED THE INTERMITTENT SYSTEM IN 13 SCHOOLS WITH 243 CHILDREN. NONE OF THE CHILDREN WERE IN ORTHOPEDIC OR MENTALLY RETARDED CLASSES. THE TEMPLIN-DARLEY ARTICULATION TEST WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE OPENING AND CLOSE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, AND THE ILLINOIS TYPOLOGICAL RATING SCALE WITH SEVERITY RATINGS FROM ONE TO FOUR WAS APPLIED. WHEN THE TWO TOTAL GROUPS WERE COMPARED, SPEECH GAINS OF BLOCK SYSTEM CHILDREN WERE CONSISTENTLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THOSE OF THE CHILDREN ON THE INTERMITTENT SYSTEM (.01 LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE). OF THE FOUR SEVERITY GROUPINGS, ONE BLOCK SYSTEM GROUP, THE SECOND MOST SEVERE, MADE SPEECH GAINS OF STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE (.01  LEVEL).

THE FIRST, POLICY AND GOAL SETTING, RELATES TO THE DETERMINATION OF GOALS, POLICIES, AND OBJECTIVES WHICH GUIDE HIGHER EDUCATION SERVICES. QUALITY AND PATTERN OF SERVICES, RELATIONSHIP OF EDUCATION TO SOCIETY, DETERMINATION OF THOSE TO BE SERVED, AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF POST HIGH SCHOOL SERVICES TO THE LARGER SOCIETY ARE FACTORS CONSIDERED. ALTHOUGH POLICY SETTING AUTHORITY RESIDES IN THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE, IN ACTUAL PRACTICE THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION (CCHE) PERFORMS THIS FUNCTION. THE SECOND PART OF THE PLANNING PROCESS IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STATE-WIDE EDUCATIONAL SERVICE PLAN. THIS IS A TRANSLATION OF EDUCATIONAL GOALS, POLICIES, AND OBJECTIVES INTO AN ADMINISTRATIVE PATTERN. THE CCHE  HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PHASE OF THE PLAN. THE THIRD PART OF THE PLAN DEALS WITH THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. EACH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION PREPARES ACADEMIC PLANS WHICH OUTLINE THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE TOTAL PLAN. THE CCHE REVIEWS THESE PLANS. THE FINAL PHASE IS THE INSTITUTION PHYSICAL FACILITIES PLAN. EACH INSTITUTION PREPARES A PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICAL FACILITIES IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY, RELATIONSHIPS, AND EXPANSION. GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION ESTABLISH THE PARAMETERS FOR THE PLANS. A TWO-STAGE PLANNING PROCESS, CONCEPT PLAN AND WORKING PLAN, ENABLES CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES AND RESOLUTION OF DISAGREEMENTS. THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS THE CCHE MAINTAINS REVIEW PRIVILEGES. THE BUILDING COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF  ADMINISTRATION REVIEW PLANS ALSO, AND SUGGEST ALTERNATIVES. THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT MAY BE USED AS AN INFORMATION SOURCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN. (RH)",

PREDICTION OF LIGHTING PERFORMANCE IN A BUILDING CAN BE MADE EARLY IN PLANNING. THIS METHOD PROVIDES FOR THE TESTING OF A VARIETY OF TRIAL SCHEMES ECONOMICALLY AND RAPIDLY. MODEL TESTING IS THE ONLY METHOD WHICH ALLOWS COMPARISON OF ARCHITECTURAL FORMS BY VARYING SKY AND LANDSCAPING CONDITIONS. THIS METHOD ASSURES GOOD SEEING ENVIRONMENT IN NEW FACILITIES AVOIDING COSTLY MISTAKES. ACCURATE RESULTS ARE A PRODUCT OF HIGHLY DETAILED MODELS. LANDSCAPING MUST BE CONSIDERED AND IS AN INSEPARABLE PART OF THE DESIGN PROCESS IF ACCURATE NATURAL LIGHTING PREDICTIONS ARE TO BE MADE. USING THIS TECHNIQUE THE EFFECTS OF  DESIGN ALTERNATIVES IN THE LANDSCAPE CAN BE EVALUATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THOSE IN THE BUILDING ITSELF. THE TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION MAKES ITS MODEL TESTING FACILITIES AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC IN THE FORM OF A TESTING SERVICE SERVICE. THROUGH SUBMISSION OF PRELIMINARY PLANS, TESTS CAN BE MADE AT REASONABLE COST.

IT REVIEWS THE BASIC INDEPENDENT RESEARCH WHICH HAS BEEN DONE, DOCUMENTING THE ACOUSTICAL AND MAINTENANCE PROPERTIES AS A SCHOOL FLOOR COVERING, AND TRACES THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF A NUMBER OF CARPETED SCHOOLS. CARPETING MEETS THE PERFORMANCE QUALITIES OF MODERN DESIGN TRENDS IN SCHOOL PLANTS. CARPET HAS BEEN, AND IS, WIDELY USED FOR BOTH AESTHETIC AND NOISE CONTROL PURPOSES AND, WITH ALL FACTORS CONSIDERED, AT NO GREATER \"TOTAL USE\" COST. CARPETING HAS A NOISE REDUCTION COEFFICIENT (NRC) OF .55 WHICH IS AS EFFECTIVE AS MOST MATERIALS ON THE MARKET TODAY MANUFACTURED FOR THE EXCLUSIVE PURPOSE OF NOISE REDUCTION. BY TREATING THE FLOOR ACOUSTICALLY,  CEILINGS CAN BE LEFT HARD AND REFLECTIVE FOR BETTER VOICE PROJECTION TO ALL PARTS OF THE ROOM. CARPETING VIRTUALLY ELIMINATES IMPACT NOISE AND ALSO CREATES A POSITIVE HABIT DEVELOPMENT BY STUDENTS USING THESE AREAS. WITH REGARD TO MAINTENANCE, ALL TESTS CONDUCTED FROM THE FIRST IN 1955 POINT TO VERY SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS WITH CARPETED FLOORS. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT CARPET MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT LESS, UNDER HEAVIEST USE CONDITIONS. THE ELIMINATION OF OTHER WALL OR CEILING ACOUSTICAL TREATMENTS IN CARPETED AREAS CAN OFFSET OR EQUALIZE INITIAL MATERIAL COST. CARPETED FLOORS WILL LESSEN FUEL CONSUMPTION. THE USE OF CARPETING IN AUDITORIUMS, ENTRANCE WAYS, AND AS A REPLACEMENT FLOOR COVERING IS DEALT WITH BRIEFLY. (RK)",

SMITH, PRINCIPAL OF SHAKER HIGH SCHOOL, LATHAM, NEW YORK, REGARDING THE USE OF CARPETING CONCLUDES THE BEHAVIOR PATTERNS OF THE STUDENTS ARE ALTERED BY THE USE OF CARPETING. CARPETS PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE OTHER AREAS OF THE SCHOOL AS CLASSROOMS. HALLS, CORRIDORS, STAIRS, LOBBIES, AND FLOOR ARE ALL CLASSROOMS. IN ADDITION, CARPET PREVENTS NOISE. CARPETING PRODUCES THE ACOUSTICAL ATMOSPHERE WHICH ALLOWS PARTITIONS TO BE MOVED AND ALTERED AT WILL. ACOUSTICAL CONTROL THROUGH CARPETING ALLOWS TEACHERS TO TEACH BETTER, KEEPS NOISE LEVELS DOWN, AND PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY OF UTILIZATION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A MODERN SCHOOL PROGRAM. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT TEACHERS PREFER TO TEACH IN A CARPETED ENVIRONMENT. A PROBLEM IS WHEN CLEANING A  SPOT THE CARPET IS CLEANER IN THAT AREA, HOWEVER, IN A FEW DAYS OF USE THE CARPET IS EVENED UP AGAIN. SPOT CLEANING IS DONE BY THE REGULAR CUSTODIAL STAFF. CARPET DOES COST LESS TO MAINTAIN AND THE SAVINGS CAN ADD UP TO THE COST OF REPLACING THE CARPET. VERY LITTLE TIME IS SPENT IN CLEANING CARPETS. ALSO THE EASE OF MAINTENANCE MEANS THAT CARPETED ROOMS CAN BE USED FOR AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITIES MORE THAN OTHER ROOMS BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS READY. AN INVITATION IS EXTENDED BY MR. MILLARD TO VISIT SHAKER HIGH SCHOOL AND VIEW THEIR CARPET EXPERIMENT. IT IS REQUESTED THAT A LETTER BE SENT SPECIFYING THE PLANNED ARRIVAL DATE. (RK)",

IT IS PREDICTED THAT WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES A MULTITUDE OF NEW SCHOOL BUILDINGS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED IN ADDITION TO THE REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING SCHOOL PLANTS AS THEY BECOME OUTDATED AND INADEQUATE FOR NEW INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS. THE NEW INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS WILL BE DESIGNED TO FOSTER INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION AS TEACHER TECHNIQUES AND INSTRUCTIONAL EXPERIENCES ARE REDUCED TO COMPUTER LANGUAGE FOR EASY RETRIEVAL IN TEACHING MACHINES. THE EMPHASIS IN BUILDING DESIGN IN THE FUTURE WILL BE ON LEARNING ENVIORNMENT, AND WILL REFLECT CONCERN FOR WHAT THE BUILDING DOES RATHER THAN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. SECONDARILY, THE WRITER PREDICTS THE ABANDONMENT OF THE \"CLASS A\" HOT LUNCH PROGRAM IN THE  NEAR FUTURE AS SCHOOL PARKS ARE DEVELOPED AND AS INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION BECOMES THE MODE OF PUPIL LEARNING. THE LUNCH HOUR WILL CEASE TO DOMINATE THE DAILY SCHEDULE AND WILL BE DISPLACED BY THE AUTOMAT APPROACH TO PUPIL FEEDING PROGRAMS. PUPIL NUTRITION WILL BE ASSURED AS BETTER INSTRUCTION IN NUTRITIONAL NEEDS IS THE PRODUCT OF TEACHING. LUNCHES WILL NOT BE RESTRICTED TO ONE MENU, THEY WILL BE SENSITIVE TO THE DIFFERENT CULTURES OF OUR SOCIETY, AND WILL PROVIDE THE PUPIL THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXERCISE CHOICE IN HIS EATING HABITS. (JZ)",

IT WAS DECIDED THAT EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE PROGRAMED INDEPENDENTLY, THAT A LIGHT, INFORMAL APPROACH BE USED, AND THAT, WHILE LEARNING, THE STUDENTS BE BROUGHT IN CONTACT WITH RELATED INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. THE PROCEDURE, ADMINISTERED BY THE STUDENTS, WAS THE SAME FOR ALL TYPES OF EQUIPMENT, AND CONSISTED OF A PROGRAMED BOOKLET PLUS RELATED TRAINING MATERIAL. THE PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION WAS POSITIVELY RECEIVED BY STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. SINCE THE PROJECT WAS BEGUN A GREAT INCREASE IN STUDENT USE OF EQUIPMENT COVERED WAS OBSERVED, THE NEED FOR THE INSTRUCTOR TO BE PRESENT WAS  ELIMINATED, AND THE PROGRAM BECAME STANDARD FOR NEW FACULTY. THE CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT AUDIO-VISUAL EQUIPMENT TRAINING CAN BE EFFECTIVELY PROGRAMED, AN INFORMAL APPROACH APPEARS TO HEIGHTEN INTEREST AND REDUCE PREVIOUS BIAS, SHORT, SELF CONTAINED PROGRAMS INCREASE UTILIZATION AND FLEXIBILITY, AND CLASS ROOM APPLICATION CAN BE DEMONSTRATED BY USE OF SAMPLE MATERIALS.

TEACHING CONDITIONS RANGED ON A CONTINUUM FROM RIGID CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION AND TEACHER-CONTROLLED STUDENT PACE TO FLEXIBLE ORGANIZATION AND STUDENT-DETERMINED PACE. AT THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG CONDITIONS IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT, IN STUDENT ATTITUDE TOWARD MATHEMATICS OR PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION, OR IN TEACHER ATTITUDE TOWARD PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION, INDIVIDUALIZATION OF INSTRUCTION, AND EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH. TEACHER ATTITUDE AFFECTED STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. TEACHERS TENDED TO MAKE MORE UNFAVORABLE COMMENTS ABOUT THOSE TEACHING CONDITIONS WHICH DEPARTED  FROM THE TRADITIONAL MODES. READING SCORES WERE THE BEST PREDICTOR OF MATH ACHIEVEMENT. IT WAS FOUND THAT PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION CAN BE USED IN AT LEAST FIVE DIFFERENT WAYS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT OR ATTITUDE, AND THAT BOTH STUDENTS AND TEACHERS CAN DEPART FROM CONVENTIONAL MODES OF INSTRUCTION. THE SIGNIFICANT FINDING WAS THAT NO ONE CONDITION WAS OUTSTANDING, THAT EACH CONDITION HAD A HIGH PAY-OFF FOR SOME TEACHERS AND STUDENTS--FOR OTHERS, THE SAME CONDITION WAS AN ABOMINATION. (BB)",

THESE EXTREME POSITIONS MUST BE AVOIDED AS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DEVELOPS A CONSISTENT FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR GUIDING POLICY DECISIONS. THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THE COLLEGE SUFFERS WHEN THE INSTITUTION BECOMES MERELY A COMMUNITY STATUS SYMBOL OF HIGHER EDUCATION OR WHEN THE INSTITUTION IS EVALUATED AGAINST THE NORM OF CURRENT PRACTICE. CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL AND LIBERAL FORCES AFFECT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITH RESPECT TO ITS STUDENT SERVICES, ITS CURRICULUM, ITS RELATIONSHIP TO ITS FACULTY, AND ITS ADMISSION POLICIES. CAUTION IS NEEDED SO THAT INSTRUMENTALLY DERIVED VALUES ARE NEITHER ACCEPTED AS ABSOLUTES NOR CONSIDERED AS ENDS IN  THEMSELVES.

A STUDY WAS MADE OF LIBRARY STANDARDS AND LIBRARY LITERATURE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH GENERALLY ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES WHICH RESULT IN BUILDING GOOD LIBRARY COLLECTIONS. TWO GROUPS OF TEN LIBRARIANS EACH WERE STUDIED, ONE COMPOSED OF LIBRARY SCHOOL GRADUATES AND THE OTHER UNTRAINED LIBRARIANS. ALL WERE EMPLOYED IN SMALL PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND SELECTED ALL THE BOOKS ADDED TO THE ADULT COLLECTIONS. THE LIBRARIES WERE VISITED, THE LIBRARIANS INTERVIEWED, AND A 5 PER CENT SAMPLE OF 1965 ADULT BOOK PURCHASES WAS DRAWN. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT LIBRARY SCHOOL GRADUATES--(1) USED A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER NUMBER OF BOOK SELECTION AIDS, (2)  SELECTED BOOKS OF HIGHER QUALITY, (3) ACQUIRED FEWER GENERAL BOOKS FROM SALESMEN, BOOK CLUBS, OR COMMERCIAL LENDING AGENCIES, AND (4) DID SOMEWHAT BETTER IN MAKING WELL-ROUNDED SELECTIONS IN VARIOUS SUBJECT AREAS. LITTLE DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IN THE AREA OF CONTROVERSIAL BOOKS. OTHER TESTS SHOWED THAT YEARS OF LIBRARY EXPERIENCE WERE RELATED LESS STRONGLY TO SUCCESS THAN LIBRARY SCHOOL EDUCATION AND THAT GRADUATES OF TYPE I LIBRARY SCHOOLS USUALLY PERFORMED CONSIDERABLY BETTER THAN OTHER GRADUATES. THE FACT THAT LIBRARY SCHOOL GRADUATES DID SOMEWHAT BETTER THAN THE UNTRAINED LIBRARIANS ON MOST OF THE MEASUREMENTS USED SUPPORTS THE THEORY THAT THERE ARE REAL, BUT NOT LARGE, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LIBRARY SCHOOL GRADUATES AND UNTRAINED LIBRARIANS IN BOOK SELECTION  COMPETENCE.

IN A CROSS-SECTIONAL APPROACH, 184 NEGRO CHILDREN, OF 12, 18, AND 24 MONTHS OF AGE REPRESENTING 3 SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS GROUPS, WERE COMPARED ON THE PIAGET OBJECT SCALE AND THE CATTELL INFANT INTELLIGENCE SCALE. RESULTS SHOWED NO DIFFERENCES AMONG THE 3 GROUPS ON EITHER SCALE. HOWEVER, INFANTS WERE RATED ON  SUCCESS OR FAILURE ON A GIVEN ITEM WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NUMBER OF TRIALS OR TIME REQUIRED, SO SOCIAL CLASS DIFFERENCES MAY HAVE BEEN HIDDEN. PREVIOUS RESEARCH FINDINGS WHICH INDICATED THAT SOCIAL CLASS DIFFERENCES IN INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DO NOT APPEAR DURING THE FIRST 2 YEARS WERE CONFIRMED. AFTER 2 YEARS LANGUAGE BECOMES IMPORTANT FOR LEARNING, AND DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED. DIFFERENCES IN PATTERNS OF MOTIVATION AND COGNITIVE STYLE OCCUR EARLY BUT SHOW UP IN LATER LEARNING. THEREFORE, COMPENSATORY EDUCATION PROGRAMS SHOULD FOSTER THE KINDS OF MOTIVATIONS AND COGNITIVE SKILLS WHICH WILL BE NEEDED FOR ABSTRACT THINKING AND ACADEMIC SUCCESS.

FORTY-FIVE CHILDREN RECEIVED PROBLEMS WHICH INVOLVED AN EXISTENTIAL QUANTIFIER, AND 45 HAD PROBLEMS WHICH DID NOT. TEN OF THE PROBLEMS GIVEN TO EACH CHILD HAD DIFFERENT NAMES WITHIN THE PROBLEM SETS, AND 10 PROBLEMS  HAD THE SAME SET NAMES. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE OF THE DATA SHOWED THAT THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE OCCURRED BETWEEN THE PROBLEMS INVOLVING SET NAMES.

THE ANALYSIS IS RESTRICTED IN APPLICATION TO RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INTERVAL-MEASURABLE VARIABLES THAT ARE LINEAR, ADDITIVE, AND ASYMMETRIC. TO MAKE A PATH ANALYSIS, THE VARIABLES IN THE SYSTEM ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER EXOGENOUS, THAT IS, HAVING THEIR VALUES DETERMINED BY FACTORS OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM, OR ENDOGENOUS, THAT IS, HAVING THEIR VALUES DETERMINED BY FACTORS REPRESENTED BY VARIABLES WITHIN THE SYSTEM. BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS, A SET OF REGRESSION EQUATIONS  REPRESENTING THESE RELATIONS IS FORMED. THIS SET IS TERMED THE PATH MODEL, AND GRAPHIC CONVENTIONS ARE GIVEN FOR DIAGRAMING IT. THE COEFFICIENTS IN THE EQUATIONS ARE SIMILAR TO THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS OCCURRING IN ORDINARY LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION EQUATIONS. THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PATH ANALYSIS APPROACH IS THAT IT ENABLES THE EXPERIMENTER TO UTILIZE ALL THE INFORMATION AT HIS DISPOSAL, PARTICULARLY THAT CONCERNING CAUSAL RELATIONS BETWEEN VARIABLES.

ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CHILDREN (30 EACH IN GRADES 1 THROUGH 6) WERE RATED ON A 30-ITEM, 5-POINT, INFERRED SELF-CONCEPT SCALE DEVELOPED FOR THE STUDY. RATINGS MADE BY THE CHILD'S TEACHER AND THE SCHOOL COUNSELOR WERE USED TO TEST SCALE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY, BUT ONLY THE TEACHERS' RATINGS WERE USED IN THE ANALYSES OF HYPOTHESES. CORRELATION OF SELF-CONCEPT RATINGS WITH THE ABOVE VARIABLES SHOWED THAT THE CHILDREN VIEWED THEMSELVES POSITIVELY. AFTER 6 MONTHS  OF SCHOOL, THE CHILDREN WERE AGAIN RATED BY TEACHERS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DATA SHOWED (1) THAT SELF-CONCEPTS OF ALL THE EXPERIMENTAL CHILDREN HAD DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY, (2) THAT INADEQUATE VERBAL SKILLS (FOUND IN THE MEXICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN) WERE RELATED TO LOW SELF-CONCEPTS, AND (3) THAT IT CANNOT BE ASSUMED THAT ALL MEMBERS OF ONE SPECIFIC RACE OR ECONOMIC CLASS HAVE LOW SELF-CONCEPTS. SINCE THIS EXPERIMENT WAS BASED ON THE THEORY THAT SOCIAL PRESSURE FORMS SELF-CONCEPT, ONE CONCLUSION IS THAT CHILDREN MUST FEEL THAT THERE IS PERSONAL VALUE IN ACHIEVING MIDDLE CLASS GOALS IF THEY ARE TO ACHIEVE IN SCHOOL. THEREFORE, ACHIEVEMENT MUST BE POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE VALUE SYSTEM OF A SPECIFIC POPULATION. (MS)",

        "description":"RECOGNITION OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS OF CULTURALLY AND SOCIALLY DEPRIVED CHILDREN TOGETHER WITH THE GROWING EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT ON LATER EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT HAS LED TO THE PROPOSING OF LARGE-SCALE PROGRAMS TO ATTACK THESE PROBLEMS. IT SEEMS THAT SPECIAL NURSERY SCHOOL AND KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS OFFER THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL PAYOFF. SUCH PROGRAMS ARE BEING DEVELOPED FIRST FOR DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN BUT WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXTENDED TO ALL. AN IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH IS RAISED IS WHAT THE GOALS OF SUCH PROGRAMS SHOULD BE. SOME ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION POSED ARE AVAILABLE FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF RESEARCH INCLUDING LONGITUDINAL STUDIES, OTHER THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF DEVELOPMENT, RESEARCH IN THE HOME ENVIRONMENT, AND RESEARCH ON  PROCESSES IN INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT. A GENERAL CONCLUSION FROM THIS RESEARCH IS THAT VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT IS QUITE CRITICAL. THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE PARENTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF CULTURALLY DEPRIVED CHILDREN, ARE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY SUPPLY THIS DEVELOPMENT SEEMS SLIGHT. THUS, THERE IS AN IMPORTANT TASK FOR THE SCHOOLS BOTH IN HELPING THE PARENTS AND IN SUPPLEMENTING THEIR EFFORTS. SOME MAJOR PROGRAM OBJECTIVES SUGGESTED BY THE RESEARCH ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT ARE (1) INCREASING THE RANGE OF THE CHILD'S PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCES, (2) DEVELOPING AN EXTENDED AND ACCURATE USE OF LANGUAGE, (3) CREATING AN ENTHUSIASM FOR LEARNING THROUGH THE CHILD'S ABILITY TO MASTER LEARNING TASKS, (4) DEVELOPING THE CHILD'S THINKING AND REASONING SKILLS, AND (5) DEVELOPING PURPOSIVE LEARNING ACTIVITY IN  THE CHILD.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE USE OF EMOTIONAL WORDS, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, AND THE TOTAL VERBAL OUTPUT OF NORMAL AND DISORDERED CHILDREN TO DETERMINE IF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN VERBAL EXPRESSION OCCUR. TWO GROUPS OF CHILDREN, 7 TO 12 YEARS OF AGE, WERE RECRUITED. FORTY OF THEM WERE DIAGNOSED AS NORMAL CHILDREN, AND 38 AS HAVING BEHAVIOR DISORDERS. EACH CHILD WAS SHOWN 5 STIMULUS CARDS PORTRAYING A NEUTRAL SCENE CONTAINING 1 OR 2 PEOPLE AND WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE INTERACTION AND EMOTION. THESE IMPRESSIONS WERE RECORDED AND THEN ANALYZED TO SEE IF THEY CONTAINED ANY OF 5 POSITIVE OR 5 NEGATIVE WORDS SELECTED TO INDICATE WHETHER THE CHILD'S REACTION TO THE  STIMULUS CARD WAS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. ALL OF THE DATA ANALYSIS WAS DONE BY COMPUTER. THE COMPUTER WAS PROGRAMMED TO ANALYZE THE RECORDINGS FOR THE USE OF THE 10 EMOTION-DETERMINATION WORDS AND WAS ALSO PROGRAMMED TO DETERMINE TOTAL WORDS USED. THE SCORE FOR EACH CHILD WAS DERIVED BY THE COMPUTER ON THE BASIS OF A PREPROGRAMMED FORMULA. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE NORMAL CHILDREN USED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POSITIVE WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE PICTURES AND ALSO USED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TOTAL WORDS THAN THE CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIOR DISORDERS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THIS COMPUTER PROCEDURE FOR ANALYSIS OF THE EXISTENCE OF EMOTIONAL DISORDERS MEANINGFULLY DIFFERENTIATES BETWEEN EMOTIONALLY NORMAL AND EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED CHILDREN. THEREFORE, IT SHOULD HAVE GENERAL VALUE IN ANALYZING GROUPS OF CHILDREN  THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF EMOTIONAL DISORDERS. (WD)",

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF 2 METHODS OF INTRODUCING S- (FADING AND CONSTANT) AND 2 RESPONSE CONTINGENCIES (DELAY AND NO DELAY) ON THE OCCURRENCE OF S- RESPONSES. THE SUBJECTS WERE 27 KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN WHO WERE DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS WHICH RECEIVED 1 OF 3 TRAINING PROCEDURES--(1) FADING-NO DELAY, (2) CONSTANT-NO DELAY, AND (3) CONSTANT-DELAY. THE STIMULI WERE A HORIZONTAL AND A VERTICAL LINE PROJECTED ONTO A PLEXIGLASS SCREEN. THE RESPONSE CONSISTED OF PUSHING ON THE SCREEN, AND THE S+ STIMULUS WAS REINFORCED WITH CANDY. IN THE INITIAL SESSION THE S+ STIMULUS WAS PROJECTED 5 TIMES TO ESTABLISH  THE RESPONSE, AND THEN THE S- STIMULUS WAS INTRODUCED IN A RANDOM FASHION. IN THE FADING PROCEDURE, ITS INTENSITY AND DURATION WERE GRADUALLY INCREASED UNTIL IT MATCHED THAT OF THE S+ STIMULUS. IN THE CONSTANT PROCEDURE IT WAS KEPT AT THE SAME INTENSITY AS S+. IF THERE WAS NO RESPONSE TO S-, IT TERMINATED IN 5 SECONDS. IN THE DELAY CONTINGENCY, 5 SECONDS HAD TO ELAPSE WITHOUT A RESPONSE BEFORE IT WOULD TERMINATE. IN THE NO-DELAY CONTINGENCY A RESPONSE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED IT, AND IT WAS THEN REPROJECTED. THE SUBJECTS WERE TRAINED UNTIL THEY WENT THROUGH ONE SESSION OF 20 PRESENTATIONS OF EACH STIMULUS WITH NO S- RESPONSES. SUBJECTS TRAINED WITH THE FADING PROCEDURE MADE SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER RESPONSES IN THE COURSE OF TRAINING THAN SUBJECTS TRAINED WITH THE CONSTANT PROCEDURE. SUBJECTS  TRAINED WITH THE CONSTANT-DELAY PROCEDURE MADE SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER RESPONSES THAN THE SUBJECTS TRAINED WITH THE CONSTANT-NO DELAY PROCEDURE. IN THE LATTER, IT WAS FELT THAT THE OFFSET OF THE S- STIMULUS WITH A RESPONSE WAS ACTING AS A REINFORCEMENT. (DR)",

THE ABILITY OF ADULTS TO GIVE AN INTERPRETATION TO NONSENSE LIKE \"JABBERWOCKY\" DEPENDS ON THE SYNTACTIC CUES GIVEN BY RELATIONAL WORDS AND WORD ORDER. IN ORDER TO FIND OUT IF CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THESE CUES, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVISE TESTS OF SYNTACTIC UNDERSTANDING. THE TESTS MUST BE POSED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE SITUATIONAL CUES ARE MINIMIZED. THEY MUST USE WORDS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE IN THE CHILD'S VOCABULARY AND MUST BE CONSTRUCTED SO THAT THE ABILITY TO GIVE A CORRECT ANSWER DEPENDS ON COMPREHENSION OF A PARTICULAR SYNTACTIC CONSTRUCTION. SEVERAL COMPREHENSION TESTS ARE INCLUDED. IN EACH TEST THE CHILD IS  ASKED TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN 2 SENTENCES WHOSE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IN SYNTACTIC CONSTRUCTION.

PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS FOR THE DISADVANTAGED HAVE CONCENTRATED ON LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT AS THE CHILDREN HAVE DEMONSTRATED LACKS IN THESE AREAS. SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL  PRINCIPLES THAT APPLY TO LANGUAGE TRAINING ALSO APPLY TO INTELLECTIVE PROCESSES. THEREFORE, APPLICATION OF THESE TRAINING PRINCIPLES SHOULD RESULT IN A HIGHER LEVEL OF INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING. A FIRST PRINCIPLE OF LANGUAGE TRAINING IS THAT A CHILD SHOULD HEAR GOOD SAMPLES OF LANGUAGE USAGE SO THAT HE CAN LEARN TO DECODE MEANING AND TO CONSTRUCT HIS OWN RESPONSES. A MOTHER OR TEACHER WHO EXPANDS OR EXTENDS THE CHILD'S SENTENCES IMPROVES HIS LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN THE TEACHER IS AWARE OF SENTENCE STRUCTURE SHE CAN RECOGNIZE LANGUAGE AREAS IN WHICH A CHILD IS WEAK. THESE AREAS CAN THEN BE STRENGTHENED BY OFFERING PRESCHOOL ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO ELICIT DESCRIPTIVE AND COMPARATIVE RESPONSES, THUS STIMULATING VERBAL EXPRESSION. POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT BY THE TEACHER HELPS TO IMPROVE THE  CHILD'S MEANINGFUL COMMUNICATION. THIS PAPER WAS PREPARED FOR THE HEAD START CONFERENCE (BERKELEY, APRIL 3, 1968). (MS)",

THREE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED. IT WAS PREDICTED (1) THAT CEREBRAL PALSIED CHILDREN WOULD IDENTIFY FEWER ACTION CONCEPTS THAN NONHANDICAPPED CHILDREN, (2) THAT PREVIOUS SENSORIMOTOR EXPERIENCE WOULD DETERMINE WHETHER CHILDREN WOULD UTILIZE A MOTORIC OR NONMOTORIC MODE OF PROBLEM SOLVING, AND (3) THAT CEREBRAL PALSIED CHILDREN WOULD HAVE POORER WEIGHT DISCRIMINATION THAN NORMAL CHILDREN. THE EXPERIMENT WAS A SIMPLE EX POST FACTO COMPARISON OF 2 GROUPS AND HAD THE DISADVANTAGE THAT THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE--  SENSORIMOTOR EXPERIENCE--WAS NOT CONTROLLED. TWO GROUPS OF 40 CHILDREN RANGING IN AGE FROM 42 TO 66 MONTHS MADE UP THE SAMPLE. THE MAJOR CRITERION FOR INCLUSION WAS THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE EXAMPLE PLATES OF THE PEABODY PICTURE VOCABULARY TEST (PPVT). THE CHILDREN WERE GIVEN 4 TESTS--(1) THE PPVT, FORM A, (2) A MODIFIED PPVT DESIGNED TO ALLOW AN ACTION OR CONCEPT PICTORIAL IDENTIFICATION IN RESPONSE TO A WORD, (3) A TEST OF WEIGHT DISCRIMINATION, AND (4) A TEST OF ADAPTIVE MODE. CHI-SQUARE ANALYSIS OF THE TEST SCORES OF THE 2 GROUPS STRONGLY SUPPORTED THE ACCEPTANCE OF ALL 3 HYPOTHESES. THE MAJOR CONCLUSION THAT CAN BE DRAWN IS THAT CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT IS GIVEN TO CURRENT THEORIES THAT SENSORIMOTOR EXPERIENCE IN INFANCY IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CONCEPT FORMATION. ONE EDUCATIONAL  IMPLICATION IS THAT SEVERELY CEREBRAL PALSIED CHILDREN MIGHT PROFIT FROM SPECIALLY DESIGNED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. (DR)",

THE POPULARLY-HELD CONTENTION THAT RURALITY IS EDUCATIONALLY UNDESIRABLE WAS NOT BORNE OUT IN A RECENT SURVEY OF 1,500 RURAL TEACHERS WHICH INDICATED THAT MANY TEACHERS WERE IN AGREEMENT ON THE ADVANTAGES OF RURALITY, BUT WERE IN FAR LESS AGREEMENT ABOUT THE DISADVANTAGES, IF ANY.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF DESIRABLE ATTITUDES SHOULD BE FOSTERED IN A LITERATURE PROGRAM MADE POSSIBLE BY THE WISE SELECTION OF BOOKS TO BE READ INCOMMON AND THE USE OF INCOMMON READING TO TEACH STUDENTS HOW TO READ TO ENJOY VARIOUS TYPES OF LITERATURE.

        "description":"TEACHERS AND READING SPECIALISTS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY ACCEPT PHONICS CONTENT IN READING PROGRAMS. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT PHONICS WHICH INVOLVE QUESTIONS SUCH AS HOW PHONICS SHOULD BE PRESENTED, WHAT CONTENT SHOULD BE INCLUDED, AND WHEN IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED. THIS STUDY RAISES SOME BASIC ISSUES AND PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR ACTION. THE ANALYTIC AND SYNTHETIC APPROACHES HAVE BEEN USED DURING RECENT DECADES. HOWEVER, TEACHER JUDGMENT AND KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS BEST MUST STILL BE RELIED ON. THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT PHONICS HAS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE TEACHING OF READING. PHONIC ANALYSIS IS BEST USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER WORD IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES TO UNLOCK WORDS WHICH ARE KNOWN IN THEIR SPOKEN FORM BUT UNKNOWN IN THEIR WRITTEN FORM. TEACHERS  RATHER THAN METHODS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLE IN THE TEACHING PROCESS. TEACHERS SHOULD BE AWARE OF RESEARCH RELATING TO METHODS AND MATERIALS AND SHOULD UTILIZE THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN ADJUSTING PROCEDURES TO INDIVIDUAL NEEDS IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. REFERENCES ARE INCLUDED.

PART 1 DEALS WITH THE ADAPTATION OF THE BSCS MATERIALS WHICH WAS DONE BY 25 BIOLOGY TEACHERS FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF ISRAELIAN SECONDARY SCHOOLS (ACADEMIC, AGRICULTURE KIBBUTZIM). A TEXTBOOK, LABORATORY MANUAL FOR THE STUDENT, AND A BOOK FOR THE TEACHER WERE PREPARED SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE PRIMARY TEXTBOOK AND LABORATORY CHANGES FOR EACH YELLOW VERSION CHAPTER ARE GIVEN IN THE REPORT. PART 2 DISCUSSES THE TESTING PHASE WHICH IS DIRECTED AT TWO MAJOR OBJECTIVES. THESE ARE (1) TO PRODUCE FEEDBACK INFORMATION OF  TEACHING EFFICIENCY, AS MEASURED BY STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT, ON KEY POINTS IN THE TEXT, AND (2) TO PROVIDE EVALUATION DATA IN COMPARING THE BSCS APPROACH TO CONVENTIONAL BIOLOGY INSTRUCTION. BSCS QUARTERLY ACHIEVEMENT TESTS WERE ADAPTED TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK INFORMATION. THE TESTS USED ON A PRE- AND POST-TEST BASIS FOR THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WERE (1) THE TEST ON UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE (TOUS), (2) INVESTIGATOR-CONSTRUCTED ATTITUDE AND BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION TESTS, AND (3) THE &quot;MILTA&quot; GROUP INTELLIGENCE TEST.

THE TRAINING INVOLVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SKILL IN ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION. THE EXPERIMENT INVOLVED 10 ANESTHESIOLOGY RESIDENTS. FIVE WERE GIVEN TRAINING ON THE PATIENT SIMULATOR WHILE THE OTHER FIVE WERE INTRODUCED TO THEIR RESIDENCY IN THE USUAL MANNER. COMPARISONS BETWEEN SIMULATOR-TRAINED RESIDENTS AND THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP WERE MADE ON THE BASIS OF ELAPSED TIME FROM DATE OF ARRIVAL IN THE PROGRAM TO DATE OF PERFORMANCE AT A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL OF PROFICIENCY. THE OFFICIAL ANESTHESIA CHARTS OF THE HOSPITAL WERE USED AS THE SOURCE OF DATA. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT  THERE IS A TIME ADVANTAGE TO THE USE OF SUCH A SIMULATOR IN TRAINING ANESTHESIOLOGY RESIDENTS IN THE SKILL OF ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION. THE TIME ADVANTAGE DEMONSTRATED IS TWO-FOLD IN THAT (1) RESIDENTS ACHIEVE PROFICIENCY LEVELS IN A SMALLER NUMBER OF ELAPSED DAYS OF TRAINING, AND (2) RESIDENTS ACHIEVE A PROFICIENCY LEVEL IN A SMALLER NUMBER OF TRIALS IN THE OPERATING ROOM.

THE SAMPLE POPULATION WAS COMPOSED OF 98 MEN AND 76 WOMEN WHO HAD RECEIVED THE A.B. DEGREE IN ENGLISH BETWEEN 1953 AND 1957 FROM FIVE MIDWEST COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM QUESTIONNAIRES, TRANSCRIPTS SUPPLIED BY THE COOPERATING INSTITUTIONS, AND TAPE-RECORDED INTERVIEWS WITH 25 ENGLISH MAJORS. THE OCCUPATIONS OF THE 31 CAREER WOMEN WERE TOO VARIOUS TO PERMIT DETAILED ANALYSIS OF TYPICAL CAREER PATTERNS, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOTED THAT MOST HAD RETURNED TO COLLEGE FOR POST-GRADUATE STUDY. OF THE 30 WOMEN NO LONGER EMPLOYED, MOST HAD  BEEN TEACHERS OR SECRETARIES, AND A FEW HAD BEEN JOURNALISTS OR WRITERS. FIFTEEN WOMEN HAD NEVER BEEN EMPLOYED FULL-TIME. AMONG THE MEN, 25 EACH WERE IN BUSINESS OR EDUCATION, 15 WERE IN JOURNALISM OR WRITING, 25 IN OTHER PROFESSIONS, SEVEN IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE, AND TWO HAD NO ESTABLISHED CAREER. BOTH THE MEN AND THE WOMEN WERE MOTIVATED BY INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT RATHER THAN BY CAREER CHOICE IN SELECTING ENGLISH AS THEIR MAJOR. THE WOMEN FOUND CAREER CHOICES MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE AND POSITIONS MORE DIFFICULT TO SECURE THAN DID THE MEN, ALTHOUGH THE MEN WERE NOT READY TO CHOOSE A CAREER UNTIL NEAR OR AFTER GRADUATION.

        "description":"BECAUSE AVERAGE AND BELOW-AVERAGE STUDENTS DO NOT FIND THE WRITTEN WORD ESSENTIALLY MEANINGFUL, AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO THAT OF THE TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE-AND-LITERATURE ENGLISH PROGRAM IS NEEDED. SUCH A PROGRAM BEGINS WITH AND FOCUSES ON THE STUDENTS' OWN PAST AND PRESENT EXPERIENCES. STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH VIVID AND SIGNIFICANT SENSE-EXPERIENCES WHICH STIMULATE AND FREE THE IMAGINATION AND FURNISH THE STARTING POINT FOR &quot;PERSONAL WRITING&quot;--THE ARTICULATION OF THE STUDENTS' OWN RESPONSES. STUDENTS ARE ALSO ENCOURAGED TO USE THEIR MEMORIES TO ANALYZE, EXAMINE, AND RECAPTURE IN WORDS LESS IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCES AND INTERESTS. LITERATURE IS INCORPORATED INTO THE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ANOTHER DIMENSION TO THE STUDENT'S EXPERIENCE, MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BECOME MANY MEN, YET  REMAIN HIMSELF, AND THUS BECOME A MORE HUMANE INDIVIDUAL. SUCH MATTERS AS PUNCTUATION, SPELLING, AND VOCABULARY STUDIES ARE NOT IGNORED, BUT ARE PART OF THE WRITING AND REWRITING PROCESS ITSELF. THIS APPROACH SHARPENS THE STUDENTS' PERCEPTION OF EXPERIENCE AND ENABLES THEM TO ENGAGE ACTIVELY IN THE PROCESS OF MEANINGFULLY ORDERING AND ARTICULATING THAT EXPERIENCE AND ITS RAMIFICATIONS.

        "description":"PREPARING CHILDREN TO WRITE BY TAKING THEM OUT OF THE CLASSROOM TO SHARE EXPERIENCES IS A RESPECTED PRACTICE IN SOME ENGLISH PRIMARY SCHOOLS. SINCE A TEACHER CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHEN A CHILD WILL BE READY FOR WRITTEN EXPRESSION, HE MUST REPEATEDLY ENCOURAGE THE CHILD TO SHARE, TO TALK OVER, AND LATER--WHEN THE MOMENT OF EXPRESSION ARRIVES--TO DRAW, PAINT, WORK WITH MATERIALS, OR WRITE. SUCH PRELIMINARIES ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE (1) WRITING IS ONLY ONE SEGMENT OF NUMEROUS INTEGRATED ACTIVITIES IN THE SCHOOLS, (2) SPOKEN, NOT WRITTEN, LANGUAGE GIVES CHILDREN THEIR FIRST OPPORTUNITIES TO COMPARE LANGUAGE WITH EXPERIENCE, AND (3) THE LONELY ACT OF WRITING CAN BE FACED ONLY WHEN CHILDREN HAVE BUILT UP THE EXPECTATION OF AN INTERESTED, SYMPATHETIC LISTENER. AT THE CHILD'S  INITIAL STAGE OF UTILIZING WRITTEN EXPRESSION, WRITING IS VERY MUCH A MATRIX OF INTERWOVEN FEELINGS, IMPRESSIONS, OBSERVATIONS, AND THOUGHTS. INSTEAD OF ENCOURAGING CHILDREN TO DISTINGUISH UTILITARIAN FROM IMAGINATIVE USES OF LANGUAGE, THEY SHOULD BE LED TO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF WRITING BOTH AS A MEDIUM AND AS A TOOL OF EXPRESSION, IN THAT (1) BEING PERMANENT, IT CAN HELP ONE COLLECT A STORE OF THINGS WORTH REMEMBERING, (2) BEING SLOWER THAN TALKING, IT ENCOURAGES ONE TO REFLECT, PONDER, AND MAKE DISCOVERIES ABOUT EXPERIENCE, AND (3) BEING PRIVATE, IT ENHANCES ONE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPERIMENT WITH LANGUAGE.

INFORMANTS WERE ASKED TO IDENTIFY PICTURES, AND THEIR RESPONSES WERE RECORDED ON TAPE AND TRANSCRIBED. A COMPUTER WAS UTILIZED TO PRODUCE LISTINGS OF PARTICULAR SPEECH ITEMS IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH (1) WHAT LEXICAL AND PHONOLOGICAL SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTIES SURVEYED HAVE COUNTERPARTS IN THE REGIONAL SYSTEMS REPORTED FOR THE ATLANTIC STATES, (2) WHAT DISTRIBUTIONAL RELATION OTHER ITEMS OF LEXICAL AND PHONOLOGICAL EVIDENCE HAVE TO THOSE IDENTIFIED ABOVE, (3) WHAT ELEMENTS OF A GRAMMATICAL-SYNTACTICAL SUBSYSTEM CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY COMPUTER TECHNIQUES, AND (4) WHAT THE RELATION OF  THE GRAMMATICAL-SYNTACTICAL ELEMENTS SO IDENTIFIED IS TO THE OCCURRENCE OF LEXICAL AND PHONOLOGICAL ITEMS. CONCLUSIONS SHOWED THAT THERE ARE UNIFORM ASPECTS OF LEXICON, PHONOLOGY, AND SYNTAX FOR THE REGION STUDIED, AND THAT SMALLER LEXICAL AND PHONOLOGICAL GROUPINGS OCCUR WITHIN AREAS OF THAT REGION. IT WAS ALSO DEDUCED THAT CHANGES IN LEXICON ARE READILY MADE. FURTHER RESEARCH COULD BE CONDUCTED BY BOTH LINGUISTIC AND EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHERS.

        "description":"SINCE MOST OF THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM IS DEVOTED TO SPECIALIZED DISCIPLINES, HUMANITIES COURSES PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CREATING IN STUDENTS AN AWARENESS OF THE UNITY WHICH EXISTS AMONG PHILOSOPHY, HISTORY, AND THE ARTS. INTENSIVE STUDY AND CLASS DISCUSSION OF INDIVIDUAL WORKS BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE, HOWEVER, WHEN TOO MANY BOOKS ARE CROWDED INTO A HUMANITIES COURSE. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE WORKS REMAIN REMOTE ARTIFACTS TO BE \"APPRECIATED,\" BUT BEAR NO RELEVANCE TO THE LIVES OF STUDENTS WHO PREFER CURRENT LITERATURE AND OTHER MEDIA. HUMANITIES COURSES CAN BEST BE DEVOTED TO EXAMINING THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND LITERARY ISSUES OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF WORKS, FOR IT IS IN THESE AREAS THAT THE WORKS OF THE PAST ARE RELEVANT TO TODAY'S STUDENTS. THE INTENSIVE STUDY OF STRUCTURE AND STYLE CAN BE  LEFT TO SPECIALIZED DEPARTMENTAL COURSES. THROUGH THE ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF THE STUDENT IN STUDYING, DISCUSSING, AND ARGUING THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND LITERARY ISSUES, THE WORKS OF THE PAST CAN BECOME ACCESSIBLE TO HIM AND A PART OF THE SHAPING FORCES OF HIS LIFE, RATHER THAN DEAD MONUMENTS TO BE HONORED BUT NEVER TOUCHED.

        "description":"AT A TIME WHEN HUMANITIES COURSES ARE UNDERGOING REEVALUATION AND DEVELOPMENT, THEY MUST NOT BE SUFFOCATED BY INCORPORATING INTO THEM TOO MANY LITERARY WORKS AND TOO MANY APPROACHES. SELECTION OF WORKS IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE, AND PERHAPS THE BEST PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH TO BASE SELECTION IS ONE WHICH ENCOURAGES \"ENLIGHTENED CHERISHING\"--THE COMMITMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO CERTAIN VALUES AND TO THE STANDARDS BY WHICH HE JUSTIFIES HIS COMMITMENT. THE HUMANITIES COURSE CAN OFFER TO THE STUDENT, FOR STUDY AND POSSIBLE EMULATION, THE BEST EXEMPLARS OF THE HUMAN IDEAL. IN CHOOSING MATERIALS AND AN APPROACH, SCHOOLS MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT HABITS OF ENLIGHTENED CHERISHING TAKE TIME TO ESTABLISH, AND THAT IT IS MORE EFFECTIVE TO CONCENTRATE ON A FEW WORKS WHICH HAVE THE GREATEST  POTENTIAL FOR INTERESTING THE STUDENT AND DEMONSTRATING THE MEANING OF THE HUMAN QUEST FOR HUMANITY. BY CONCENTRATING ON THOSE WORKS WITH GREAT ARTISITC MERIT, THE APPROACH USED IN TEACHING CAN BE THAT OF AESTHETIC ANALYSIS, WHICH TEACHES STUDENTS TO READ KNOWINGLY AND INTELLIGENTLY AND TO RESPOND RATIONALLY AND IMAGINATIVELY.

IDEALLY, THESE TWO SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN COMBINATION THROUGH A RHETORICAL APPROACH TO \"COMPOSED TEXTS.\" RHETORIC IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMPOSITION COURSE CAN BEST BE DEFINED AS \"THE ART THAT GUIDES JUDICIOUS CHOICES OF AVAILABLE MEANS OF COMMUNICATING WITH AN AUDIENCE.\" THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS DEFINITION IMPLY THAT TEACHERS MUST HELP STUDENTS BECOME AWARE OF AVAILABLE MEANS--OF DISCOVERING SOMETHING TO SAY AND WAYS IN WHICH THEY CAN ORGANIZE THEIR KNOWLEDGE. FURTHERMORE, STUDENTS MUST HAVE  A SET OF CRITERIA WITH WHICH TO MAKE INTELLIGENT AND WISE CHOICES FROM AMONG THE AVAILABLE SUBJECT MATTERS AND FORMS. THESE CRITERIA INVOLVE A CONCERN WITH THE TYPE OF DISCOURSE ONE IS COMPOSING, ITS SUBJECT MATTER, THE AUDIENCE, AND THE WRITER HIMSELF. LASTLY, TEACHERS OF RHETORIC MUST HELP STUDENTS BECOME AS AWARE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD AS THEY ARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR DISCOURSE. WHEN THIS OCCURS, TEACHERS ARE NOT ONLY TRAINING STUDENTS IN RHETORIC, BUT ALSO GIVING THEM A LIBERAL EDUCATION. (THIS ARTICLE APPEARED IN THE \"KENTUCKY ENGLISH BULLETIN,\" VOL. 17 (1967-68), 3-12.)

EVALUATIONS FROM SCHOOL SUPERVISORS WERE USED TO DETERMINE SUCCESSFUL TEACHING.

ANCILLARY TO THE MAIN STUDY, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT RANK IN CLASS AND GENERAL MENTAL ABILITY CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH TEACHING EFFECTIVENESS AS EVALUATED BY SUPERVISORS, WHILE OVERALL AND ENGLISH GRADE-POINT AVERAGES WERE CLOSE TO ZERO OR WERE NEGATIVE IN CORRELATION.

THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IN THE RESEARCH WAS TO TEST AND TO EVALUATE A CLINICAL TYPE OF INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM BASED ON INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT DIAGNOSES COULD BE MADE AND INDIVIDUAL'S MUSIC AILMENTS COULD BE TREATED IN LEARNING THREE BASIC MUSIC ELEMENTS. PHASE I WAS AN ITEM ANALYSIS OF STUDENT WORKSHEETS AND TEST PAPERS ACCUMULATED FROM USING AUTO-INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS IN PAST RESEARCH. PHASE II WAS A DISCRIMINATIVE ANALYSIS SO THAT PREDICTIONS COULD BE MADE FOR THE SELECTIVE AUTO-INSTRUCTIONAL TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS. PHASE III WAS AN EXPERIMENT USING THOSE  FRESHMEN MUSIC STUDENTS WHO WERE ENROLLED IN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MUSIC COURSE AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE ACADEMIC YEAR 1966-67. FROM THE RESEARCH IT WAS POSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS AS A PARTICULAR TYPE OF LEARNING PROBLEM, WHICH COULD BE DEALT WITH ON AN INDIVIDUAL-GROUP BASIS, WITH THE PREDICTED GAIN SCORES ESTABLISHED.

FOR MANY STUDENTS BEGINNING COLLEGE, LITERATURE HAS NOT BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR LIVES. THEY SHOULD BE TOLD WHAT IT IS AND BE INTRODUCED TO MANY BOOKS, ESPECIALLY CONTEMPORARY ONES, WHICH PEOPLE USED TO READ FOR THEMSELVES. ALTHOUGH ENGLISH DEPARTMENTS NOW EXIST, PROFESSIONAL CONCERN WITH LITERATURE IS NO GUARANTEE OF MORAL IMAGINATION OR UNUSUAL INTELLIGENCE. THE MAJOR QUESTION IS HOW A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY CAN FIND SELF-EVIDENT A TRADITION FOUNDED ON THE INSIGHTS OF A SELECT FEW. NOR CAN THE GREAT TRADITION BE SELF-EVIDENT TO STUDENTS WHOSE EDUCATION OFTEN HAS BEEN UTILITARIAN AND WHOSE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE DIMINISH THE INTELLECTUAL AUTHORITY OF RELIGION.  EFFORTS TO RE-ESTABLISH THE LITERARY TRADITION HAVE BEEN MADE BY T.S. ELIOT AND OTHERS, AND TODAY, DESPITE THE EMPHASIS ON THE CONCEPTUAL, ABSTRACT, AND MANIPULATIVE, MUCH CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE EXPRESSES THE SPIRIT AND PARADOX OF MAN'S CONDITION.

SECOND, HIS INSISTENCE THAT ENGLISH DEPARTMENTS SHOULD TEACH ONLY LITERATURE AND ELIMINATE ALL COMPOSITION COURSES DENIES BOTH THE STUDENTS' NEEDS AND THE INTEGRAL RELATION BETWEEN COMPOSITION AND LITERATURE. DESPITE SUCH PROBLEMS AS STAFFING, COST, ADMINISTRATIVE ATTITUDES, AND POORLY TRAINED TEACHERS, THE ENGLISH PROFESSION SHOULD NOT ABDICATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FRESHMAN ENGLISH COURSES.

IN GENERAL, THE PROJECT IS BEING RECEIVED ENTHUSIASTICALLY AND IS CONSIDERED A SUCCESS. ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF HARTFORD  PARENTS USUALLY ATTEND THE SUBURBAN PTA MEETINGS.

THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER, IN MOVING, THE TARGET CHILD CHARACTERISTICALLY REMAINED IN THE SAME AREA OF THE COMMUNITY, WHETHER THERE WAS A PARTICULAR PATTERN OF MOVEMENT, AND WHETHER THE TARGET CHILD MOVED INTO A WEALTHIER NEIGHBORHOOD OR SIMPLY INTO ANOTHER POOR AREA. THE POSSIBILITY OF THE COMPARISON CHILD'S EVER ATTENDING SCHOOLS IN THE LOW-INCOME AREAS WAS ALSO EXAMINED.

THE PROJECT OPERATED IN SIX CENTRAL CITY JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS FROM SEPTEMBER 1966 TO JUNE 1967.

HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW MOBILITY STUDENTS WERE LESS MARKED IN THE COMPARISON SAMPLE, SUGGESTING THAT EXTENSIVE MOBILITY HAS LESS  EFFECT ON CHILDREN OF FAMILIES WITH ABOVE AVERAGE INCOME THAN IT DOES ON THE POOR.

IN THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT IF AN EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION PROGRAM WAS LIMITED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ABSTRACT LANGUAGE, THEN NOT ONLY LANGUAGE, BUT MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF THINKING WOULD BE FACILITATED. THE DESIGN OF THIS PROGRAM WAS BASED ON SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT REQUIRED (1) THAT THE INSTRUCTION BE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL TUTORING, (2) THAT EACH CHILD BE SEEN FOR SHORT DAILY SESSIONS, (3) THAT EVERY TASK SET FORTH BY A TEACHER BE COMPLETED, EVEN IF IT HAD TO BE SIMPLIFIED, AND (4) THAT THE PROGRAM BE MODIFIED TO FIT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF EACH CHILD. SUBJECTS WERE 12 PRESCHOOL DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN SELECTED FROM A NURSERY  SCHOOL. THE CHILDREN WERE MATCHED FOR STANFORD-BINET AND LEITER IQ SCORES, AGE, AND SEX. ONE CONTROL GROUP OF SIX REMAINED IN THE TRADITIONAL NURSERY SCHOOL PROGRAM. ANOTHER CONTROL GROUP OF TWO RECEIVED INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION BUT NO TUTORING, WHILE AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP OF FOUR RECEIVED DAILY PROGRAM TUTORING.

TWO SECTIONS OF FRESHMAN ENGLISH WERE TAUGHT BY SPECIALLY TRAINED INSTRUCTORS WHILE A CONTROL GROUP WAS TAUGHT BY REGULAR TEACHERS. EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE MATCHED ON THE BASIS OF ENTERING READING AND ENGLISH TEST SCORES. EXPERIMENTAL STUDENTS WERE INSTRUCTED WITH READING MATERIALS WHICH PERTAINED TO THEIR EXPERIENCES TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO EXPRESS THEIR REACTIONS IN STANDARD ENGLISH. THE STUDENTS'  TEST SCORES AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM GENERALLY CONFIRMED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT STANDARDIZED TESTS DO NOT REVEAL ACCURATELY THE INTELLECTUAL POTENTIAL OF THESE STUDENTS AND THAT THE RELATION OF READING IMPROVEMENT TO HIGHER ACHIEVEMENT IN OTHER ACADEMIC AREAS REQUIRES FURTHER STUDY.

THE INVOLVEMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS, STATE BODIES, THE U.S. JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT, AND THE STATE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS ARE DESCRIBED. ALSO DISCUSSED ARE THE MAJOR ISSUES AT THE CORE OF THE EVENTS--THE EDUCATIONAL QUALITY OF STATE-SUPPORTED NEGRO COLLEGES, THE PAST AND PRESENT STATUS OF RACE RELATIONS IN THE TOWN, AND THE EXTENT AND MEANING OF THE INFLUENCE OF BLACK POWER. THE BROADER NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF POLICE ACTION, LAW ENFORCEMENT, BLACK POWER, AND STUDENT REVOLT ARE OUTLINED IN RELATION TO THE PROTOTYPAL SITUATION IN ORANGEBURG. THIS DOCUMENT IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR 30 CENTS FROM THE SOUTHERN REGIONAL COUNCIL, 5 FORSYTH STREET, N.W., ATLANTA 3, GEORGIA. (NH)",

FOR  GENERAL DIRECTORS, SALESMEN, AND SUPERVISORS, HORTICULTURE 3, AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS 2, FLORICULTURE 1, AND SOILS 2 WERE RECOMMENDED. FOR GENERAL DIRECTORS AND SALESMEN, HORTICULTURE 4, FLORICULTURE 2, AND SOILS 3 WOULD BE ADDED. COURSES IN HORTICULTURE, SOILS, AND FLORICULTURE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SPECIALIZATION WERE RECOMMENDED FOR WORKERS ACCORDING TO POSITION AND FIELD.

IN FEDERAL PROGRAMS FOR ASSISTING ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED REGIONS, MORE EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON FINANCES FOR CONSTRUCTING AND EQUIPPING EDUCATIONAL AND REHABILITATION FACILITIES. MORE USE SHOULD BE MADE OF THE CAPACITIES OF BUSINESS FOR TRAINING WORKERS AND DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE EDUCATIONAL METHODS.

Specific objectives were to determine the value of group feedback to the teacher, the difference in learning retention between students with and without feedback, and the difference in efficient use of teaching time between the feedback and traditional methods. Experimental and control groups of 140 students in four California schools were taught teacher-developed lessons in animal physiology and plant cells. Each for 1 week one subject was taught by by traditional methods and the other by the use of the EDEX Communicator which consisted of individual pupil response units and a console which showed individuals and group student  response to each question. The experiment applications in different schools were staggered to utilize equipment. A pretest, posttest and a test for retention after 3 months were given. Data were subjected to an analysis of covariance. Results showed that immediate feedback did not improve student learning more than the traditional method, retention was greater by the control group, and teachers and students judged the feedback meter to be efficient in terms of time.

THE MANPOWER PROGRAM OPERATES IN ALL 50 STATES AND IN FOUR TERRITORIES. INSTITUTIONAL TRAINING IS THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM. BY THE END OF 1965, APPROVAL HAD BEEN GIVEN TO 7,625 INSTITUTIONAL PROJECTS TO TRAIN 435,700 PERSONS, AND MORE THAN 345,000 HAD BEEN ENROLLED. IN ADDITION, ALMOST 3,000 ON-THE-JOB TRAINING PROJECTS HAD BEEN APPROVED FOR 104,000 MEN AND WOMEN, AND 164 EXPERIMENTAL AND DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR 88,000  TRAINEES. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONS APPROVED FOR TRAINING EXCEEDS THE ORIGINAL GOALS SET BY THE CONGRESS FOR THE FIRST 3 YEARS OF THE ACT. MANPOWER TRAINING CENTERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN AN ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF TRAINING MANY PEOPLE WITH DIVERSE CHARACTERISTICS IN A VARIETY OF JOBS IN AN ECONOMICAL MANNER.

        "description":"THE ENACTMENT OF THE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ACT OF 1963 PROVIDED A NEW PHILOSOPHY IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION WHICH IS RESULTING IN A MAJOR EXPANSION AND REDIRECTION OF THE PROGRAM ACROSS THE NATION. THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM HAS EVOLVED INTO A SYSTEMATIZED APPROACH AND PROCEDURE WITH SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK INTO THE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE CONSTANT CHANGE AND IMPROVEMENT. ALL STATES AND TERRITORIES HAVE DEVELOPED PLANS FOR INCORPORATING ALL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ACTS. THE ANNUAL REPORTING SYSTEM HAS BEEN REVISED, EVALUATION AT FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LEVELS HAS BEEN PLANNED, AND THE RESEARCH PROGRAM IS OPERATING AT BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY PROVIDES FUNDS FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY'S PUBLIC SECONDARY  SCHOOLS WHICH ENROLL 5.4 MILLION STUDENTS INCLUDING ADULTS. LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL EXPENDITURES FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN FISCAL 1965 WAS NEARLY 563 MILLION DOLLARS. PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN ACHIEVING THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH FUNDS MAY BE EXPENDED--(1) VOCATIONAL EDUCATION FOR PERSONS ATTENDING HIGH SCHOOL, FOR THOSE WHO HAVE COMPLETED OR LEFT HIGH SCHOOL, FOR TRAINING OR RETRAINING FOR THOSE ALREADY IN THE LABOR MARKET, AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE HANDICAPS PREVENTING THEIR SUCCESS IN REGULAR VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS, (2) CONSTRUCTION OF AREA VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS, AND (3) PROVISION OF ANCILLARY SERVICES. OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE BEEN IN DEVELOPING CURRICULUMS, TRAINING GUIDANCE PERSONNEL, AND RELATING PROGRAMS TO MANPOWER NEEDS. THERE IS STILL A NEED FOR STATE LEADERSHIP PERSONNEL. AS A RESULT OF  REVISED SMITH-HUGHES AND GEORGE-BARDEN ACTS, DEVELOPMENT IS CONTINUING IN THE VOCATIONAL AREAS. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT WILL BE MADE FOLLOWING A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE PROGRAM. (WB)",

NINE SELECTED TOPICS WERE TAUGHT IN SOME GRADE LEVEL BY AT LEAST 70 PERCENT OF THE TEACHERS, AND SOME TOPICS, SUCH AS LANDSCAPING, WERE TAUGHT AT  ALL GRADE LEVELS. EXPERIENCE PROGRAMS WERE CONDUCTED AT HOME FOR 51 PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS, IN COOPERATING BUSINESSES FOR 27 PERCENT, AND AT SCHOOL FOR 14 PERCENT. NO EXPERIENCE PROGRAM WAS REPORTED FOR 8 PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS. TEACHERS RECOMMENDED 500 SQUARE FEET FOR HOME FLOWER OR GARDEN PROJECTS AND 10,000 SQUARE FEET FOR NURSERIES, AND 200 HOURS OF EXPERIENCE PER YEAR FOR HOME AND SCHOOL PROJECTS AND 300 HOURS FOR COMMERCIAL PLACEMENT.

APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN NEW YORK, PHILADELPHIA, CLEVELAND, PITTSBURGH, CINCINNATI, DETROIT, SAN FRANCISCO-OAKLAND, HOUSTON, ATLANTA, AND WASHINGTON WERE STUDIED THROUGH NUMEROUS INTERVIEWS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF LABOR, MANAGEMENT, CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS, GOVERNMENT, EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND NEGRO YOUTH. THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF NEGROES WHO PRESENTLY WANT TO OR CAN QUALIFY FOR APPRENTICESHIP IS, MORE THAN DISCRIMINATION, THE CHIEF OBSTACLE TO WIDER PARTICIPATION OF NEGROES IN THE 350 APPRENTICEABLE TRADES. OF 21,500 APPRENTICES EMPLOYED ON  FEDERALLY SUPPORTED CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN 1964, 483 (2.2 PERCENT) WERE NEGRO. DESPITE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF NEGRO APPRENTICES.

THE PERCEPTIONS ARE BASED ON THE RESPONSES OF 185 TEACHERS IN 14 GROUP INTERVIEWS, THE RESPONSES OF THESE SAME TEACHERS ON A SELF-PERCEPTION QUESTIONNAIRE, AND THE RESPONSES OF ANOTHER SAMPLE OF 408 TEACHERS ON TWO FORMS OF A PRESCRIPTION-DESCRIPTION QUESTIONNAIRE.

THE FINAL POPULATION OF THE STUDY WAS 6,107 GRADUATES COMPOSED OF THOSE WHO HAD ENROLLED IN SIX OR MORE SEMESTERS OF VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURE AND THOSE WHOSE FATHERS WERE FARMING ON THE DAY THEIR SONS GRADUATED OR WERE FARMING DURING MOST OF THE TIME THEIR SONS WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL. SOME FINDINGS WERE--(1) 29.63 PERCENT OF THE GRADUATES WERE ENGAGED IN FARMING OR WERE EMPLOYED AS FARM MANAGERS, (2) GRADUATES ENGAGED IN FARMING OR OFF-FARM AGRICULTURAL OCCUPATIONS TENDED TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOME COMMUNITIES MORE THAN THE NONAGRICULTURALLY EMPLOYED  GRADUATES, (3) GRADUATES CLASSED AS PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL, MANAGERS AND PROPRIETORS, CLERICAL, SALES, AND CRAFTSMEN MIGRATED MORE EXTENSIVELY THAN WAS EXPECTED, AND (4) A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THOSE FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF LIVING INDEX AND FROM LARGER HOME FARMS WAS CLASSIFIED AS FARMERS AND FARM MANAGERS.

SOME EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS FACING NEW JERSEY WERE--(1) THE SCHOOLS HAD TO PROVIDE NOT ONLY FOR NORMAL POPULATION GROWTH BUT ALSO FOR IMMIGRATION, AND A BACKLOG OF UNFILLED NEEDS, (2) THE STATE RANKED LOWEST IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION ENROLLMENT PER 1,000 POPULATION AMONG THE 50 STATES, (3) ONE OF EVERY SIX PUBLIC SCHOOL PUPILS ATTENDED SCHOOL IN THE SIX OLDER CITIES, (4) HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS  ENCOUNTERED SEVERE HANDICAPS IN SECURING EMPLOYMENT, (5) ONE QUARTER OF A MILLION ADULTS WERE FUNCTIONAL ILLITERATES, AND (6) THE NEED EXISTED FOR 2-YEAR COLLEGES. THE EFFECTS OF AN OBSOLETE AND INADEQUATE PATTERN OF PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE INDICATED THAT THE RISING EDUCATIONAL COSTS FALL MORE ON REAL PROPERTY.

        "description":"THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER COMMON BEHAVIORS COULD BE IDENTIFIED ACROSS OCCUPATIONS TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR CURRICULUM BUILDING. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH INCUMBENTS IN 47 AGRICULTURAL OCCUPATIONS AND 36 OCCUPATIONS IN THE METAL FABRICATING INDUSTRY FOR A TOTAL OF 466 INTERVIEWS IN COLORADO AND NEBRASKA. THE INTERVIEW SCHEDULE CONTAINED A NUMBER OF GENERAL WORK ENVIRONMENT ITEMS, FOUR CHECKLISTS, AND FIVE MAJOR BEHAVIORAL DIMENSIONS. THE 329 SCORES FOR EACH INTERVIEW WERE SUBJECTED TO FACTOR ANALYSES TO DETERMINE INTERCORRELATIONS AMONG THE OCCUPATIONS. THE ANALYSIS OF THE CORRELATION MATRIX OF THE 47 AGRICULTURE OCCUPATIONS YIELDED THREE OCCUPATIONAL CLUSTERS, PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE, AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY, AND AGRI-BUSINESS. PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE WAS  CHARACTERIZED BY AN AVERAGE OR HIGH LEVEL ON NEARLY ALL OF THE BEHAVIORS, AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY SCORED AT A LOW AVERAGE OR LOW LEVEL, AND AGRI-BUSINESS SCORED AT A GENERALLY HIGH LEVEL EXCEPT FOR LOWS ON THE PHYSICAL AND DISCRIMINATIVE BEHAVIORS. THE ANALYSIS OF THE 36 METAL WORKING OCCUPATIONS ALSO YIELDED THREE CLUSTERS, SKILLED WORKER, SEMISKILLED WORKER, AND BUSINESS. THE BUSINESS CLUSTER IN METAL WORKING EXHIBITED A PATTERN OF SCORES SIMILAR TO THAT OF AGRI-BUSINESS. THE PATTERN OF SCORES ON PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE WAS SUCH THAT A COMPREHENSIVE CURRICULUM IN PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE WOULD COVER THE BEHAVIORS IN THE OTHER CLUSTERS ALSO. THE STUDY RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT A TEAM TEACHING APPROACH WOULD SERVE WELL IN TRAINING FOR PLACEMENT IN AG-INDUSTRY AND AGRI-BUSINESS OCCUPATIONS.  (MM)",

A 3-DAY PRESCHOOL WORKSHOP AND SEVERAL CONFERENCES FOR VOCATIONAL TEACHERS, COUNSELORS, AND ADMINISTRATORS FROM THREE PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS WERE HELD TO STUDY PROBLEMS IN IMPLEMENTING COURSES HAVING CONTENT COMMON TO SEVERAL OCCUPATIONS AND IN RESTRUCTURING THE CURRICULUM. SCHOOLS WERE GIVEN FREEDOM IN ADJUSTING SCHEDULES AND COURSES TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INSTRUCTION. ALL NINTH GRADE STUDENTS WERE ENCOURAGED TO ENROLL IN AN OCCUPATIONAL SURVEY COURSE TO ASSIST THEM IN CAREER AND EDUCATIONAL PLANNING BY INTERPRETING THEIR INTERESTS, APTITUDES, AND VOCATIONAL ABILITIES AND BY INTRODUCING THEM TO CAREERS IN MAJOR  OCCUPATIONAL FIELDS. COMMON COMPETENCIES OF SEVERAL OCCUPATIONS WERE TAUGHT, AND SIMULATED WORK EXPERIENCE WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR SUPERVISED JOB EXPERIENCE WHERE WORK STATIONS WERE NOT AVAILABLE. DATA CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS, GRADE ACHIEVEMENTS, AND INTERESTS AND APTITUDES MEASURED BY STANDARDIZED TESTS HAD NOT BEEN ANALYZED AT THIS REPORTING TIME. TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONS INDICATED ONLY TENDENCIES. FOR INSTANCE, IT APPEARED THAT MANY STUDENTS HAD BEEN EMPLOYED FOR PAY IN DOING VERY SIMPLE JOBS, AND VOCATIONAL CHOICES OR INTERESTS HAD NOT CONCENTRATED IN CLOSELY RELATED FIELDS. DURING THE SECOND YEAR, CLINICAL SCHOOLS WERE TO BE ENCOURAGED TO OFFER VOCATIONAL COURSES AND IN THE THIRD YEAR, THEY WERE TO TRY OUT A VARIETY OF WAYS TO SIMULATE OCCUPATIONAL WORK. (EM)",

THE FINDINGS WERE--(1) THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN TEACHER EFFECTIVENESS AS OBSERVED BY STUDENTS BETWEEN THOSE GROUPS RECEIVING FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS, EITHER ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH FEEDBACK FROM SUPERVISORS, AND THOSE WHO RECEIVED NO FEEDBACK, AND (2) STUDENT FEEDBACK IMPROVED TEACHER EFFECTIVENESS WHILE SUPERVISOR FEEDBACKS DID NOT, AND THE EFFECT OF COMBINED FEEDBACK DID NOT EXCEED THAT OF STUDENT FEEDBACK ALONE. STUDENT FEEDBACK DURING THE FIRST 10 YEARS OF TEACHING CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF IMPROVING TEACHER EFFECTIVENESS AS SEEN BY STUDENTS.

THREE SEPARATE EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED IN THREE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS USING 80, 72, AND 60 SEVENTH GRADE BOYS AS SUBJECTS. EACH EXPERIMENT INVOLVED FOUR GROUPS, EQUATED ON THE BASIS OF INITIAL PERFORMANCE SCORES IN THE PARTICULAR LEARNING TASK. EACH GROUP WAS ASSIGNED TO A DIFFERENT PRACTICE SCHEDULE FOR 7 SUCCESSIVE SCHOOL DAYS. THREE OF THE GROUPS FOLLOWED SCHEDULES WHICH INVOLVED BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PRACTICE IN DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS (75 PERCENT MENTAL-25 PERCENT PHYSICAL, 50 PERCENT MENTAL-50 PERCENT PHYSICAL, AND 25 PERCENT MENTAL-75 PERCENT  PHYSICAL), AND ONE GROUP ENGAGED IN PHYSICAL PRACTICE ONLY. PERFORMANCE TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO ALL GROUPS AT THE END OF 7 DAYS AND AT THE END OF 3 WEEKS OF NO PRACTICE. THE CONCLUSIONS WERE--(1) A SCHEDULE COMBINING BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL TRIALS CAN PROVE AS VALUABLE IN LEARNING A MOTOR TASK AS A SCHEDULE IN WHICH ALL TRIALS ARE PHYSICAL, (2) WITHIN THE INTELLIGENCE RANGES OF SUBJECTS USED IN THESE STUDIES, IQ SCORES WERE NOT INDICATIVE OF ONE'S ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM MENTAL PRACTICE, (3) UP TO 50 PERCENT OF THE PRACTICE TIME (OR TRIALS) SPENT IN MENTAL PRACTICE CAN BE AS EFFECTIVE AS 100 PERCENT OF THE TIME SPENT IN PHYSICAL PRACTICE, AND (4) ALTHOUGH SUBJECTS RESPONDED FAVORABLY AND CONSCIENTIOUSLY TO THE SUGGESTION OF MENTAL REHEARSAL, SOME BECAME IMPATIENT WHEN THE TECHNIQUE  WAS USED TO EXCESS, UP TO THREE-FOURTHS OF THE PRACTICE TIME.

A MAJOR CONCERN WAS TO STUDY THE STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE LOCAL-STATE-FEDERAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATION, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE, POPULATION MOBILITY, DISCRIMINATION, URBANIZATION, AND PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION. MAJOR DIVISIONS OF THE REPORT ARE (1) REVIEW, (2) EVALUATION, (3) IMPROVEMENT AND REDIRECTION, AND (4) ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE PANEL'S GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS WERE THAT VOCATIONAL EDUCATION MUST--(1) OFFER TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO THE 21 MILLION NONCOLLEGE GRADUATES  WHO WILL ENTER THE LABOR MARKET IN THE 1960'S, (2) PROVIDE TRAINING OR RETRAINING FOR WORKERS WHOSE SKILLS AND TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE MUST BE UPDATED AND WORKERS WHOSE JOBS WILL DISAPPEAR, (3) MEET THE CRITICAL NEED FOR HIGHLY SKILLED CRAFTSMEN AND TECHNICIANS, (4) EXPAND VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL TRAINING PROGRAMS CONSISTENT WITH EMPLOYMENT POSSIBILITIES AND NATIONAL ECONOMIC NEEDS, AND (5) MAKE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES EQUALLY AVAILABLE TO ALL.

        "description":"THIS REPORT DEALS WITH TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND THE PART IT PLAYS IN PROVIDING TRAINED TECHNICIANS AND OTHER TECHNICAL WORKERS FOR AMERICAN INDUSTRY. RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF BOTH MALE AND FEMALE SEMIPROFESSIONAL TECHNICAL WORKERS IN INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE, BUSINESS, MEDICINE, AND HEALTH. THE GEOGRAPHIC MOBILITY OF INDUSTRY HAS WIDENED THE DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH WORKERS AND THEREBY INCREASED THE DEMANDS ON TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN VARIOUS REGIONS. ALTHOUGH SOME PROJECTIONS INDICATED AN ANNUAL NEED FOR 67,800 TECHNICIANS BY 1970, ANOTHER BASED ON A 2 TO 1 RATIO BETWEEN TECHNICIANS AND ENGINEERS, INDICATED AN ANNUAL NEED FOR 200,000. THE PROJECTED POTENTIAL POST-SECONDARY TECHNICAL EDUCATION ENROLLMENT FOR 1970 IS 590,000 FULL-TIME STUDENTS. THE 140,000  NEW WORKERS NEEDED TO BE TRAINED ANNUALLY IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WILL REQUIRE AN ENROLLMENT OF SOME 390,000 FULL-TIME STUDENTS, WITH AN ENTERING GROUP EACH YEAR OF 240,000. PRESENT FULL-TIME TRAINING PROGRAM ENROLLMENTS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE 60,000 STUDENTS--FAR SHORT OF THE NEEDS. THE OVERALL COST OF A PROGRAM THAT WILL MEET THE NEEDS AS OUTLINED IN THIS REPORT WOULD AMOUNT TO ABOUT $1.5 BILLION DOLLARS FOR PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR FULL-TIME STUDENTS IN POST-SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS AND ABOUT $300 MILLION FOR ANNUAL OPERATING COSTS. EXTENSIVE CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS AND ISSUES ARE INCLUDED. THE COMPLETE REPORT IS AVAILABLE AS VT 005 454, A SUMMARY AS VT 001 796, AND OTHER APPENDIXES AS VT 005 455 AND VT 001 306.

LISTS OF TASKS PERFORMED BY NURSE AIDES, PRACTICAL NURSES, AND SURGICAL TECHNICIANS WERE DEVELOPED THROUGH (1) INTERVIEWS WITH WORKERS AND JOB SPECIALISTS, (2) A STUDY OF HIRING REQUIREMENTS, JOB SPECIFICATIONS, AND DAILY ACTIVITY CHARTS, AND (3) OBSERVATIONS BY THE RESEARCH STAFF. THESE LISTS WERE RATED BY 954 WORKERS AND SUPERVISORS IN 43 AREA HEALTH SERVICE INSTITUTIONS. WORKERS RATED THE FREQUENCY OF PERFORMANCE AND SUPERVISORS THE CRITICALITY OF EACH TASK. TASKS REPORTED AS PERFORMED BY NO FEWER THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE WORKERS AND AS A FUNCTION OF THE WORKER BY NO FEWER THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE SUPERVISORS WERE ANALYZED. FROM THESE, 61 TASKS COMMON TO THE THREE OCCUPATIONS WERE USED  AS THE BASIS OF THE CORE CURRICULUM. THE CURRICULUM WAS DEMONSTRATED IN A 6-WEEK NURSE AIDE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR 22 STUDENTS IN TWO GROUPS AS OPPOSED TO THE CONVENTIONAL 8 WEEKS. A HANDBOOK OF STEP-BY-STEP BASIC NURSING PROCEDURES, DEVELOPED DURING THE PREPARATORY STAGE, WAS UTILIZED AND FURTHER DEVELOPED DURING AND FOLLOWING THE COURSE. ON PERFORMANCE TESTS GROUPS IN THE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MEAN THAN THE 14 STUDENTS IN TWO CONTROL GROUPS IN THE 8-WEEK CONVENTIONAL PROGRAM, AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS' SCORES WERE CONSISTENTLY HIGH ON THE WRITTEN TESTS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE PROGRAM WAS SUCCESSFUL AND THAT THE MODEL IS SUITABLE AS A BASIC DESIGN FOR OTHER PARAMEDICAL TRAINING PROGRAMS.

A MEAN OF FIFTY 5-MINUTE PRACTICE TRIALS (3 OR 4 A DAY) UNDER EITHER CONDITION WERE CONDUCTED OVER A 4-WEEK PERIOD ON A BODY OF ORDINARY PROSE PARAGRAPHS PROVIDING FOR 5 MINUTES OF PRACTICE AT EVERY EVEN-NUMBERED SPEED FROM 16-76 WORDS PER MINUTE. FOR EXTERNALLY-PACED PRACTICE, COPY WAS MARKED INTERNALLY IN QUARTER-MINUTE INTERVALS, WHICH WERE LOUDLY ANNOUNCED BY THE TEACHER. SUBJECTS WERE TO ADJUST STROKING RATES UPWARD OR  DOWNWARD IN ACCORD WITH TIME ANNOUNCEMENTS. SELF-PACED PRACTICE COPY WAS NOT MARKED INTERNALLY, AND THERE WERE NO TIME ANNOUNCEMENTS. SUBJECTS WERE ASSIGNED TO SPEED OR TO ACCURACY TRIALS AT INDIVIDUALLY APPROPRIATE SPEEDS AND PROGRESSED TO HIGHER SPEEDS AND A CHANGED OBJECTIVE (SPEED OR ACCURACY) ACCORDING TO THEIR PRACTICE PERFORMANCE. COVARIANCE ANALYSIS OF POST-TEST SPEED AND ERROR SCORES SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT DIFFERENCES.

Six studies, completed under interstate contract, explored the areas of off-farm agricultural, multi-occupational, and business and technology programs, teacher competency examinations, predictive testing for student success in the trade programs and home economics occupational program evaluation. The completed studies approved by the U. S. Office of Education were distributed. Some of the findings relevant to developing a framework for a regional approach to research  were--(1) there was considerable articulation among research groups as a result of the six projects; (2) there is an increased awareness on the part of researchers and institutions that the state education department can act significantly in coordinating priority research projects within a wide geographic area; (3) all studies were conducted by consultants employed as chief investigators and retained through the full period of the research and development program; (4) the successful completion of the studies has proved the feasibility of the projects being funded and operated across state lines; (5) costs were kept at a low level because the programs were fitted into an existing administrative structure; and, (6) the inclusion of population samples from two or more states made the  findings more generalizable and applicable.

LIMITED DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM SCHOOLS BY MEANS OF QUESTIONNAIRES AND INTERVIEWS AND FROM EARLIER STUDIES. AN ORGANIZED BODY OF PERFORMANCE DATA WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT ANY OF THE SCHOOLS, AND AVAILABLE COST DATA DID NOT READILY LEND THEMSELVES TO MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS. FINDINGS, IF ACCEPTED AT FACE VALUE, SUGGESTED--(1) ACCORDING TO DATA REPORTED BY FIVE VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS AND FOUR COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS, THE GENERAL COST OF EDUCATION IN COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS WAS LOWER THAN  IN VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS FOR 1961-62, BUT ROSE MUCH MORE RAPIDLY TO APPROXIMATE THE COST IN VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS BY 1965-66, AND (2) DATA FROM FOUR COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS SHOWED THAT THE COSTS OF ACADEMIC-GENERAL (NONVOCATIONAL) EDUCATION WERE HIGHER THAN FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOLS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS, 1961-62, 1963-64, AND 1965-66.

        "description":"The job counseling center initiated an experimental and demonstration program to test the thesis that an urban school could provide a manpower training program to out-of-school, unemployed, and disadvantaged youth. Licensed school personnel were used in four centers in areas having high unemployment rates and a concentration of Negro and Puerto Rican families to provide counseling, remedial education, short-term vocational training, and job placement services. The highest source of recruitment was referral by other clients. The counseling program concentrated on quick job placement for clients and used both licensed school counselors and social workers. Remedial reading instruction was offered on a voluntary basis, and most clients who stayed with the program 6 months or more  showed gains. Skills training, offered in &quot;try-out shops&quot; in typing and office machines, proved motivational but did not provide salable skills except in a few cases. Industrial shops were discontinued, and clients were referred to other institutions for such training. The program cooperated with other agencies and other special educational programs with some success in obtaining services, training and job placement for some clients. There were 5,986 employment referrals and 3,493 client placements during the program. The program demonstrated that a school system can provide professional personnel who are qualified to run a program for out-of-school and disadvantaged youth. Extensive discussion of each facet of the program, general evaluative statements, and a summary and recommendations  are included. (EM)",

Staff members were selected in part from nonprofessional personnel to indicate a new direction in such recruitment, and VISTA volunteers offered tutorial and personal or small group contacts. Seven vocational courses were offered-automotive services, food services, painting, welding, barbering, clerical and sales, and building maintenance. A total of 158 trainees graduated, and 64 of 69 released during the project's contract period were employed at least once  after release. Eighteen of the 69 were considered unsuccessful releases on the basis of further law violation. The employment rate of released trainees ranged from 92 percent in February 1967 to 75 percent in July 1967. The average first job salary was $70.65 per week and the last measured salary range was $63.20 to $104.24. Procedure, findings, and recommendations are given for different aspects of the project. The appendix includes sample record forms, instructional material, a staff training bibliography, newspaper and periodical articles, and the Federal Youth Corrections Act.

MCKEACHIE BROUGHT OUT THREE MAJOR PRINCIPLES--(1) LEARNING IS ALWAYS GOING ON, SO THE PROBLEM IS TO PLAN WHAT KINDS OF LEARNING WILL OCCUR, (2) DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEARNING DO NOT ALWAYS GO TOGETHER, SO CHOICES MUST BE WEIGHED AGAINST WHAT IS FORECLOSED, AND (3) FEEDBACK FACILITATES LEARNING. AT THE MAIN CONFERENCE, FRANK WOERDEHOFF DISCUSSED PRINCIPLES TO OBSERVE IN DEVISING A TRAINING PROGRAM AND SUGGESTED HOW TO BUILD A CURRICULUM FOR TRAINING NEW C AND I PERSONNEL. THE PRINCIPLES WERE (1) TO MAKE  TRAINING OBJECTIVES MEET THE CRITERIA OF SOCIAL ADEQUACY, NEEDS, ADULT EDUCATIONAL IDEAS, AND BEHAVIORISTIC INTERPRETATION, (2) SELECT CONTENT SIGNIFICANT TO THE FIELD OF THE CONFERENCE AND INTERESTING AND CONTRIBUTORY TO GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND (3) LOGICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY ORDER CONTENT IN TERMS OF SCOPE AND SEQUENCE.

THE PROCEEDINGS COVERED THE DIMENSIONS OF OBSOLESCENCE, THE NEED FOR A TECHNOLOGICAL STRATEGY, SKILL NEED AT VARIOUS LEVELS, REMEDIAL OR CONTINUING EDUCATION, TRAINEE SELECTION AND MOTIVATION, COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, AND PROPOSED FACILITIES. THREE PAPERS WERE PREPARED ON THE  RECRUITMENT AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT OF ENTRY LEVEL (GS-5 - GS-11) SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS, MIDCAREER AND SENIOR FEDERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EMPLOYEES (GS-3 - GS-18), AND FEDERAL LABORATORY, SCIENTIFIC, AND TECHNICAL DIRECTORS.

MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DESCRIPTION MAY BE NEEDED TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF INADEQUATE PERFORMANCE TO A SYSTEM AND THE PROBABILITY OF ADEQUATE PERFORMANCE WITHOUT TRAINING--THE PROBLEM OF IDENTIFYING DIFFICULT COMPONENTS OF A JOB. IN THE ABSENCE OF DIRECT EMPIRICAL MEASURES OF THESE FACTORS, WORKING ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE BY APPEALING TO EXISTING METHODS AND CONCEPTS. SINCE SOME DIVISION OF TASKS INTO PERFORMANCE UNITS WILL BE NEEDED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES, TRAINING TAXONOMIES ARE REQUIRED. ALTHOUGH TAXONOMIES SHOULD INCLUDE A HIERARCHY OF EXHAUSTIVE, MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE CATEGORIES, EACH WITH A SPECIFIC TRAINING REQUIREMENT, THE RELATIVE POSITION OF SUCH  CATEGORIES CAN BE EXPECTED TO VARY. IN RESPECT TO ACTUAL EVALUATION OF TRAINING TECHNIQUES, EVIDENCE ON SPECIFIC TRAINING CONDITIONS AND THEIR APPLICABILITY IS STILL FAR FROM COMPLETE.

THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT RETENTION CURVES OVER A WEEK WERE COMPARABLE FOR THE YOUNGER AND OLDER AGE GROUPS, ALTHOUGH THE OLDER GROUP TOOK SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER TO LEARN THE TASKS. THIS IMPLIES THAT MEMORY IN THE ADULT IS NOT SO MUCH A FUNCTION OF AGE AS IT IS OF THE DEGREE OF LEARNING, AND ALSO THAT LEARNING IS A FUNCTION OF AGE. THE FINDINGS EXTEND THE  GENERALITY OF THE INTERFERENCE THEORY OF FORGETTING TO THE OLDER ADULT POPULATION. A FURTHER IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS IS THAT THE FACILITATING MECHANISMS WHICH ARE FOUND TO FACILITATE LEARNING AND RETENTION BY INCREASING RESISTANCE TO INTERFERENCE IN YOUNGER SUBJECTS SHOULD ASLO APPLY TO THE OLDER ADULTS. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE ABSENCE OF THESE FACILITATING MECHANISMS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A LARGE PART OF THE MEMORY LOSS IN ADULTS. (AUTHOR)",

A STEERING COMMITTEE AND LOCAL PROGRAM COMMITTEES WERE SET UP, TOGETHER WITH LOCAL PROGRAM COORDINATORS. BY MEANS OF A SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE, TEN IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL NEEDS WERE UNCOVERED. ALTHOUGH NO PROFESSIONAL ADULT TEACHER WAS AVAILABLE, IN EACH COMMUNITY AN ABLE INSTRUCTIONAL STAFF WAS RECRUITED FROM LOCAL PEOPLE AND REGULAR VISITORS, SUCH AS, PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS, MINISTERS, AND BANKERS. REGISTRATIONS WERE 36 AT MAYSVILLE, 16 AT ELIZABETHTOWN, 60 AT SOMERSET, AND 52 AT CUMBERLAND. PROGRAMS DIFFERED IN FORM AND IN RESOURCE USE, BUT ALL MADE EXTENSIVE USE OF MATERIALS FROM THE UNIVERSITY  OF KENTUCKY COUNCIL ON AGING. PROGRAM STRUCTURES AND CONTENT WERE EVALUATED IN STUDENT ESSAYS AND IN STAFF MEETINGS. HIGH STUDENT SATISFACTION AND MOTIVATION TOWARD FURTHER LEARNING WERE PREVALENT. STAFF EVALUATIONS WERE UNIVERSALLY FAVORABLE, AND EXTENSION OF THE PROGRAM TO OTHER COMMUNITIES UNDER FUNDS FROM TITLE 1, HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1965 WAS RECOMMENDED. (LY)",

        "description":"THE AUTHOR, WHO IS A HISTORIAN, POINTS OUT THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF TEACHERS IN SMALL COLLEGES WHO ARE FACED WITH TEACHING ASIAN LANGUAGES IN ADDITION TO SURVEY COURSES IN FAR EASTERN CULTURAL HISTORY. HE HAS FOUND THAT A COURSE IN THE CULTURAL HISTORY OF JAPAN OR CHINA WILL LEAD TO A DESIRE ON THE PART OF SOME STUDENTS TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THE JAPANESE OR CHINESE LANGUAGE. BECAUSE OF THESE INTERRELATED INTERESTS, A COLLEGE PLACING THE JAPANESE OR CHINESE LANGUAGE IN ITS CURRICULUM SHOULD ALSO OFFER A COURSE IN JAPANESE OR CHINESE HISTORY. WHILE IT IS IMPRACTICAL TO OFFER TOO MANY MAJOR FIELDS IN A SMALL COLLEGE, A STUDENT IN SUCH A SCHOOL COULD MAJOR IN ANY OF A NUMBER OF EXISTING DEPARTMENTS AND USE ASIAN STUDIES COURSES FOR CREDIT TOWARD HIS MAJOR. THOSE INTERESTED IN  CONTINUING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF A SMALL SCHOOL CURRICULUM SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE COOPERATIVE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS FOR CRITICAL LANGUAGES AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, OR AVAILABLE SUMMER INSTITUTES OFFERING ADVANCED STUDIES IN THESE LANGUAGES. AN OVERRIDING PROBLEM IN THE AREA OF METHODS AND TECHNIQUES IN THE SMALL COLLEGES IS FINDING ADEQUATE TIME FOR LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS FINDING TEXTBOOKS WHICH ARE SATISFACTORY FOR THE NEEDS OF A SMALL SCHOOL. THE AUTHOR STRESSES THE NEED FOR LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION TEXTS IN MODERN JAPANESE WHICH WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AMONG OTHER THINGS THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL AND SOCIAL CONTENT AS WELL AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WRITTEN AND SPOKEN JAPANESE, AND TEXTBOOKS WRITTEN IN A STYLE WHICH IS EASILY COMPREHENSIBLE TO USERS WHO ARE NOT SCIENTIFIC  LINGUISTS.

        "description":"IN THIS PAPER, PREPARED FOR THE APRIL 1967 TEXAS SYMPOSIUM ON LINGUISTIC UNIVERSALS, IT IS PROPOSED THAT THE GRAMMATICAL NOTION &quot;CASE&quot; DESERVES A PLACE IN THE BASE COMPONENT OF THE GRAMMAR OF EVERY LANGUAGE. IT IS ARGUED THAT PAST RESEARCH HAS NOT LED TO VALID INSIGHTS ON CASE RELATIONSHIPS AND THAT WHAT IS NEEDED IS A CONCEPTION OF BASE STRUCTURE IN WHICH CASE RELATIONSHIPS ARE PRIMITIVE TERMS OF THE THEORY AND IN WHICH SUCH CONCEPTS AS &quot;SUBJECT&quot; AND &quot;DIRECT OBJECT&quot; ARE MISSING. THE LATTER ARE REGARDED AS PROPER ONLY TO THE SURFACE STRUCTURE OF SOME (BUT POSSIBLY NOT ALL) LANGUAGES. BASIC TO THESE ARGUMENTS ARE TWO ASSUMPTIONS NOW TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY GENERATIVE GRAMMARIANS--(1) THE CENTRALITY OF SYNTAX, AND (2) THE IMPORTANCE OF COVERT CATEGORIES. THE AUTHOR PROPOSES &quot;THAT  THERE ARE MANY SEMANTICALLY RELEVANT SYNTACTIC REALTIONSHIPS INVOLVING NOUNS AND THE STRUCTURES THAT CONTAIN THEM, THAT THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE IN LARGE PART COVERT BUT ARE NEVERTHELESS EMPIRICALLY DISCOVERABLE, THAT THEY FORM A SPECIFIC FINITE SET, AND THAT OBSERVATIONS MADE ABOUT THEM WILL TURN OUT TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE CROSS-LINGUISTIC VALIDITY.&quot; HE REFERS TO THESE AS &quot;CASE&quot; RELATIONSHIPS AND THE GRAMMAR PROPOSED AND OUTLINED HERE IS &quot;CASE GRAMMAR.&quot; THE SUBSTANTIVE MODIFICATION TO THE THEORY OF TRANSFORMATIONAL GRAMMAR WHICH HE PROPOSES AMOUNTS TO A REINTRODUCTION OF THE &quot;CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK&quot; INTERPRETATION OF CASE SYSTEMS BUT WITH A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEEP AND SURFACE STRUCTURE. THE SENTENCE IN ITS BASIC STRUCTURE CONSISTS OF A VERB AND ONE OR MORE NOUN  PHRASES, EACH ASSOCIATED WITH THE VERB IN A PARTICULAR CASE RELATIONSHIP. THE &quot;EXPLANATORY&quot; USE OF THIS FRAMEWORK RESIDES IN THE NECESSARY CLAIM THAT, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE COMPOUND INSTANCES OF A SINGLE CASE (THROUGH NOUN PHRASE CONJUNCTION), EACH CASE RELATIONSHIP OCCURS ONLY ONCE IN A SIMPLE SENTENCE.

THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MATERNAL LANGUAGE STYLES AND PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN'S COGNITIVE STYLES AND INTELLECTUAL COMPETENCE LEVELS, SPECIFICALLY TO (1) DEVELOP LANGUAGE SCALES FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THE LANGUAGE STYLES OF NEGRO MOTHERS OF FOUR SOCIAL CLASS GROUPS, (2) ASSESS SOCIAL CLASS DIFFERENCES IN LANGUAGE STYLES, AND (3) APPRAISE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOTHERS' LANGUAGE STYLES AND THEIR PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN'S COGNITIVE STYLES AND INTELLECTUAL COMPETENCE LEVELS. SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS WERE--(1) SOCIAL CLASS LEVEL WAS A MAJOR  PREDICTOR OF THE CHILDREN'S CONCEPTUAL SORTING BEHAVIOR IN ONLY ONE INSTANCE (DESCRIPTIVE PART-WHOLE CONCEPTUALIZATION). (2) THE MOTHER'S VERBAL IQ WAS A MAJOR PREDICTOR OF ONLY THE CRITERION VARIABLE, THE CHILD'S IQ. (3) WHERE THE CHILD'S OWN IQ WAS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN HIS CONCEPTUALIZING BEHAVIOR, THE MOTHER'S LANGUAGE WAS AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT, ALSO. (4) CHILDREN WHO WERE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN VERBALLY THE REASON FOR THEIR CONCEPTUAL SORTS TENDED TO BE LOW IN IQ AND TO HAVE LOW VERBAL IQ MOTHERS. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR THIS IS INDIRECT SUPPORT FOR THE VIEW THAT LANGUAGE MEDIATES THOUGHT. (5) CHILDREN WHO DID NOT PERFORM THE TASK TENDED TO BE LOW IN IQ AND TO HAVE MOTHERS WHO WERE LOW IN VERBAL IQ AS WELL AS IN VIRTUALLY ALL THE LANGUAGE MEASURES. THE AUTHOR FEELS THAT ONE OF THE MOST  POSITIVE RESULTS OF THE STUDY MAY BE THAT A BEGINNING HAS BEEN MADE AT DISCOVERING THE PRECISE LANGUAGE MECHANISMS WHICH MEDIATE BETWEEN CULTURAL EXPERIENCE AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOPMENT. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PERHAPS ONE EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR ENHANCING THE COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CULTURALLY DISADVANTAGED CHILD IS TO TAKE STEPS IN THE PRE-SCHOOL YEARS TO EXPAND HIS LINGUISTIC ENVIRONMENT AND TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO SEE THE VALUE, INTRINSIC AS WELL AS EXTRINSIC, OF USING LANGUAGE AS A COGNITIVE TOOL.

IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THIS DISCREPANCY, THE AUTHOR ADVANCED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE DESCRIPTIONS OF LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT ARE BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE CHILD'S COMPETENCE AS IT IS REFLECTED IN OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS, WHILE THE UNFAVORABLE DESCRIPTIONS OF HIS COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT ARISE FROM EXPERIMENTS THAT PLACE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF THE ACTUALIZATION OF HIS COMPETENCE. IN GENERAL, IT WAS POSTULATED THAT IMMEDIATE STIMULI COMPETE FORCEFULLY WITH IDEATIONAL PROCESSES IN GUIDING THE CHILD'S BEHAVIOR. TWO EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING THE SINGULARITY-PLURALITY DICHOTOMY WERE CONDUCTED TO  EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF DEALING EXPERIMENTALLY WITH THIS PROBLEM. IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN HAD TO SORT OBJECTS ACCORDING TO THIS DICHOTOMY. THE CHILDREN PERFORMED BETTER ON A TASK WHERE SINGULARITY-PLURALITY WAS EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF SINGLE OR MULTIPLE OBJECTS THAN IN A TASK WHERE IT WAS EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF DUPLICATE FEATURES EMBEDDED IN AN OBJECT. THIS FINDING SUGGESTED THAT THE IMPOSING PRESENCE OF THE OBJECT AS A WHOLE INTERFERES WITH RESPONSES BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS PARTS. THE SECOND EXPERIMENT TESTED THE PLURALIZATION RULES OF KINDERGARTEN CHILDREN USING NONSENSE SYLLABLES AS NAMES FOR CARTOON ANIMALS. (SEE RELATED DOCUMENTS ED 011 653 AND AL 000 829.) THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT RECOGNITION PROCEDURES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS MERELY MORE  SENSITIVE TESTS OF THE SAME UNDERLYING COMPETENCE AS IS MEASURED BY PRODUCTION PROCEDURES, BUT MUST BE RECOGNIZED AS TAPPING DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF COMPETENCE.

AT ALL LEVELS, CONTEXT MODIFIES THE ORDER OF ELIMINATION BY LIMITING POSSIBILITIES OF OCCURRENCE OF UNITS, AND EVEN NATIVE SPEAKERS MAKE ERRORS IN DISCRIMINATION WHEN DEPRIVED OF CONTEXT. FOR THE FOREIGN LISTENER, THE DECODING PROCESS USED  IS THAT OF HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE. THE CONDITIONS OF TEACHING ARE SUCH THAT HE HAS NEITHER THE SAME LINEARITY NOR THE SAME LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS THE NATIVE SPEAKER.

ALL TELUGU MATERIAL IS WRITTEN IN DEVANAGARI SCRIPT. A BRIEF INTRODUCTION AND SHORT PARAGRAPHS CONCERNING EACH AUTHOR ARE WRITTEN IN ENGLISH. THE AUTHORS HAVE TRIED TO EXPOSE THE STUDENT EARLY AND REPEATEDLY TO THOSE FEATURES OF THE LANGUAGE WHICH OCCUR MOST FREQUENTLY. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE MOST FREQUENT FEATURES OF THESE SELECTIONS, THE ENTIRE TEXT WAS FED INTO A HIGH-SPEED ELECTRONIC COMPUTER AND ANALYZED FOR FREQUENCY. THE ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE FREQUENCIES WERE DETERMINED FOR EACH LEXICAL WORD IN THE TEXT, AS WELL AS FOR SOME 90 INFLECTIONAL AFFIXES. A SPECIALLY  DEVELOPED FORMULA WAS APPLIED TO ASSIGN TO EACH SELECTION A &quot;SCORE&quot; BASED ON THE LENGTH OF THE SELECTION, THE RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF THE WORDS AND AFFIXES IT CONTAINED, AND THE PROPORTION OF HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS AND AFFIXES IT CONTAINED. ON THE BASIS OF THESE SCORES, THE SELECTIONS WERE ARRANGED IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY APPEAR IN THIS READER. IN THE EARLIER READINGS LOW-FREQUENCY WORDS WERE REPLACED WITH HIGH-FREQUENCY EQUIVALENTS AND THE INTRODUCTION OF CERTAIN DIFFICULT AND LESS FREQUENT GRAMMATICAL MATERIAL WAS POSTPONED UNTIL LATER IN THE TEXT. BY THE END OF THE EIGHTH STORY, MOST OF THE GRAMMAR USED IN THE TEXT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED, LEAVING THE SECOND HALF OF THE TEXT FOR REINFORCEMENT, ADDITIONAL VOCABULARY, AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE STUDENT'S READING EFFICIENCY.

RULES OF WORD-DERIVATION--SUFFIXATION, PREFIXATION, COMPOUNDING--FREQUENTLY YIELD RESULTS WHOSE MEANING IS NOT PREDICTABLE FROM THEIR COMPONENT PARTS. IT IS ARGUED THAT SOME OF THESE MUST BE IN THE TRANSFORMATIONAL COMPONENT OF THE GRAMMAR OF ENGLISH. SOME DERIVATIONAL PATTERNS OF ENGLISH ARE ANALYZED IN DETAIL. ARGUMENTS ARE GIVEN THAT THE DERIVATION OF ADJECTIVES IN \"-ABLE\" MUST BE TRANSFORMATIONAL. NOMINALIZATIONS IN \"-ITY\" ARE SHOWN TO BE SEMANTICALLY ERRATIC. IT IS THEN ARGUED THAT THE FORMATION OF THESE  MUST BE SUBSEQUENT IN THE GRAMMAR TO THE FORMATION OF \"-ABLE\" DERIVATIVES. ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE COMPONENTS OF THE GRAMMAR ARE HOMOGENEOUS, IT FOLLOWS THAT \"-ITY\" FORMATION MUST BE IN THE TRANSFORMATIONAL COMPONENT. IF RULES OF DERIVATION ARE IN THE TRANSFORMATIONAL COMPONENT, THEY MUST PARTICIPATE IN ITS ORDERING. SOME FACTS OF DERIVATION ARE EXAMINED IN THE LIGHT OF THIS CONSEQUENCE. ORDERING OF DERIVATIONAL RULES IS SHOWN TO OFFER A SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF SOME OTHERWISE PUZZLING PHENOMENA. IT IS THEN DEMONSTRATED THAT DERIVATIONAL RULES CANNOT BE LINEARLY ORDERED.

LANGUAGE HAS SOME MEANS OF SPECIFYING SETS OF OBJECTS, ACTIONS, OR ABSTRACT UNITS IN VARIOUS WAYS, IN ORDER TO HAVE SUCCESSFUL COMMUNICATION. LANGUAGE DOES NOT BEAR THE ENTIRE BURDEN OF SPECIFYING A CERTAIN SET UNAMBIGUOUSLY, HOWEVER. NONLINGUISTIC CONTEXTS ALSO PLAY SOME PART IN DECIDING THE REFERENCE INTENDED BY LINGUISTIC EXPRESSION, AND WITHOUT THESE CONTEXTS, AMBIGUITIES MAY BE UNSOLVABLE. THE DEGREE OF RELIANCE ON NONLINGUISTIC CONTEXTS SEEMS TO VARY FROM ONE LANGUAGE TO ANOTHER, AND CHINESE SHOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS ONE OF THOSE WHICH HAVE A LOW DEGREE OF RELIANCE UPON LIFE CONTEXTS FOR UNIQUENESS OF REFERENCE. CHINESE TEXTS ARE NOT  MORE AMBIGUOUS THAN THE TEXTS OF OTHER LANGUAGES. IF THEY ARE LONG, THEY ARE USUALLY AS CLEAR AS THOSE OF ANY OTHER LANGUAGE. RELIANCE ON NONLINGUISTIC CONTEXTS IS HEAVY ONLY WHEN A TEXT IS SHORT AND SENTENCES ARE AMBIGUOUS ONLY WHEN THEY ARE TAKEN FROM LONGER TEXTS.

ONE OF THE AUTHOR'S MAJOR INTERESTS IS A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO SCIENTIFIC CREATIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE WORK OF SOCIAL-BEHAVIORAL SCIENTISTS. A PRECONDITION FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IS EXACTNESS OF DESCRIPTION OF LONG LANGUAGE STRINGS, SO THAT THEY MAY BE DISCRIMINATED ONE FROM ANOTHER WITH HIGH RELIABILITY AND SO THAT EVEN SLIGHT SHIFTS IN DISTRIBUTIONS OF CHARACTERISTICS MAY BE READILY DISCERNED. TO CHECK THE EMPIRICAL ADEQUACY OF HUMAN PERCEPTIONS AS TO CHARACTERISTICS OF LONG STRINGS OF SOCIAL ANALYSIS PROSE OVER AGAINST THE  COMPUTATION RIGOR OF THE PROGRAMED MACHINE, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT SET OF HUMAN DECISIONS FOR A MAN-MACHINE SYSTEM TO APPROXIMATE, THE AUTHOR IS ANALYZING SOME SUBSTANTIAL SEGMENTS OF \"HUME'S HISTORY OF ENGLAND,\" A MAJOR WORK OF SOCIAL ANALYSIS.

THE \"A\" INDEX (A QUANTITATIVE MEASURE OF MOTHER TONGUE DIVERSITY PROPOSED BY GREENBERG IN 1956) GIVES THE PROBABILITY OF RANDOMLY PAIRED INHABITANTS OF A GIVEN COUNTRY HAVING DIFFERENT MOTHER TONGUES. THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS MEASURE IS THAT IT PERMITS QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE DEGREE OF MOTHER TONGUE DIVERSITY EXISTING IN A GIVEN AREA AS WELL AS ALLOWING FOR COMPARISON BETWEEN AREAS. THE AUTHOR FEELS IT CRUCIAL TO RECOGNIZE  THAT ANY CONCENTRATION OF A MINORITY LANGUAGE IN A REGION WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO LOWER MOTHER TONGUE DIVERSITY IN THE REGION IF THE NATION HAS A RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL OF DIVERSITY TO BEGIN WITH.

THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN A GRADUATE SEMINAR GIVEN IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY. STUDENTS AND THE AUTHORS SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECTED DATA FROM SEVERAL INFORMANTS IN EACH OF SEVENTEEN LANGUAGES FROM A NUMBER OF UNRELATED LANGUAGE FAMILIES.

THESE MATERIALS FROM TWENTY LANGUAGES WERE SUPPLEMENTED BY COMPARATIVE DATA FROM THE LITERATURE, BRINGING  THE SAMPLE OF LANGUAGES TO 80 REPRESENTING A WIDE VARIETY OF MAJOR LINGUISTIC STOCKS.

IT WAS FELT THAT SUCH CHINESE LANGUAGE CLASSES WOULD BECOME A COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL HIGH SCHOOL LANGUAGE OFFERINGS ONLY IF THESE PIONEERING CLASSES PROVED VERY SUCCESSFUL. IN ANALYZING THE BACKGROUND OF THE 42 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE TWO SCHOOLS, IT WAS FOUND THAT (1) ALL OF THE STUDENTS ARE ON THE HONOR ROLE OR HAVE ABOVE AVERAGE GRADE RECORDS, (2) THE MAJORITY (29) ARE JUNIORS AND SENIORS, AND (3) 14 STUDENTS ARE OF CHINESE ANCESTRY AND HAVE VARYING RANGES OF READING AND WRITING SKILLS. SINCE THE CHINESE LANGUAGE IS CONSIDERED DIFFICULT TO LEARN, A COURSE IN THIS SUBJECT SHOULD NOT APPEAR TO BE AIMED SOLELY AT THE ABOVE-AVERAGE STUDENT OR THOSE WHO POSSESS  CULTURAL ADVANTAGES. IN ORDER THAT THE EXTREMELY BRIGHT STUDENTS IN THE \"CORE GROUP\" SHOULD BE CHALLENGED AND THE AVERAGE STUDENT FEEL HE IS MAKING PROGRESS AS WELL, A SUPPLEMENTARY PROGRAM OF INDEPENDENT STUDY IN WRITTEN CHINESE WAS SET UP. REGULAR CLASSWORK IN THE FIRST YEAR IS PRIMARILY AUDIOLINGUAL AND IS ABOUT AS DIFFICULT AS OTHER FIRST-YEAR LANGUAGE COURSES. WRITTEN CHINESE IS PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED TO INDEPENDENT STUDY SINCE IT INVOLVES MAINLY THE ACQUISTION THROUGH MEMORIZATION OF IDEOGRAPHS. TWENTY-THREE STUDENTS VOLUNTEERED FOR THE INDEPENDENT WORK PROGRAM AND SET GOALS FOR THEMSELVES OF LEARNING FROM 160 TO 650 CHARACTERS. AFTER AN INTRODUCTION TO THE CHINESE WRITING SYSTEM, THE STUDENTS WORKED INDEPENDENTLY, TAKING TESTS WHEN THEY FELT PREPARED AND RE-TAKING TESTS WHEN THEY  WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS. STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN THE INDEPENDENT STUDY PROJECT DO NOT SEEM TO FEEL PENALIZED. IT IS HOPED THAT CHINESE LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION WILL EXPAND IN THE FUTURE BY SERVING BOTH THE AVERAGE AND THE ABOVE-AVERAGE STUDENT.

THE BASIC AREAS ENCOMPASS THE VARIOUS PROCESSES OF THE PHYSIOLOGY OF SPEECH PRODUCTION, THE ACOUSTICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SPEECH, INCLUDING THE SPEECH WAVE TYPES AND THE INFORMATION-BEARING ACOUSTIC PARAMETERS, AND THE PROCESSES OF SPEECH PERCEPTION. PHONETICS IS CONCERNED WITH THE MORE BASIC CONCEPTS IN SPEECH PHYSIOLOGY AND SPEECH ACOUSTICS. THE NOTATIONAL ASPECT OF DESCRIPTIVE PHONETICS IS BASED PRIMARILY ON SPEECH PHYSIOLOGY, AND THE CHIEF PROBLEM IN EXPERIMENTAL PHONETICS IS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF SPEECH. THE MAJOR PROCESSES OF SPEECH PRODUCTION ARE IDENTIFIED AS INITIATION, COORDINATION, INNERVATION,  ARTICULATORY, AND SHAPING. THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE MAJOR AREAS OF APPLIED SPEECH SCIENCE--THE PHONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF LANGUAGES, SPEECH PATHOLOGY, AND SPEECH COMMUNICATION. THE PHONOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF LANGUAGES IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH NORMAL SPEECH AND IS BASED ON PHONETIC CONCEPTS. SUCH DESCRIPTIONS EXTEND BEYOND PHONETICS, HOWEVER, AND REQUIRE HIGHER LEVEL CONCEPTS IN PHONOLOGY, SUCH AS THE PHONEME AND THE PROSODEME. THE MANY BRANCHES OF SPEECH PATHOLOGY MAKE IT A LARGE AREA OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. IT IS NOTED THAT DESCRIPTIVE PHONETICS IS INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR NORMAL SPEECH AND SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO ENCOMPASS THE DEVIATIONS COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED IN ABNORMAL SPEECH. THERE ARE MANY AREAS OF SPEECH COMMUNICATION, INCLUDING THE VOCODER TRANSMISSION OF NATURAL SPEECH AND THE  DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE AIDS TO SPOKEN LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION. A MAJOR DIVISION OF SPEECH COMMUNICATION IS SPEECH AUTOMATION, WHICH INCLUDES AUTOMATIC SPEECH SYNTHESIS AND AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION. AMONG OTHER POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS, SPEECH AUTOMATION WOULD PROVIDE DIRECT SPEECH COMMUNICATION WITH COMPUTERS.

THE AUTHOR DEFINES &quot;WRITTEN-LITERARY&quot; LANGUAGE, CORRESPONDING TO &quot;WEN-YEN&quot; IN CHINESE AND &quot;BUNGO&quot; IN JAPANESE, AS BEING ANALOGOUS TO THE LATIN &quot;LITTERAE&quot; WHICH MEANS BOTH &quot;LITERATURE&quot; AND &quot;LETTERS.&quot; THIS IS IN OPPOSITION TO &quot;SPOKEN&quot; OR &quot;COLLOQUIAL&quot; LANGUAGE (CORRESPONDING TO &quot;PAI-HUA&quot; IN CHINESE AND &quot;KOGO&quot; IN JAPANESE), WHICH IS DEFINED AS THAT LANGUAGE UNDERSTOOD BY THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN A COUNTRY. IN JAPAN, THIS IS THE TOKYO REGION DIALECT, AND IN CHINA, THE PEKING REGION DIALECT. THAT THESE &quot;COMMON&quot; OR &quot;PLAIN&quot; DIALECTS SHOULD HAVE THUS CRYSTALLIZED RESULTS FROM  REPRESENTATIVES OF LOCAL DIALECTS COMING TOGETHER IN COMMON ACTIVITIES--TOKYO AND PEKING BEING THE LARGEST POLITICAL, ECONOMICAL, AND CULTURAL CENTERS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. A MOVEMENT FOR THE FORMATION OF A NEW LITERARY LANGUAGE BASED UPON COLLOQUIAL SPEECH BEGAN IN JAPAN IN THE 1870'S AND 1880'S AND IS KNOWN AS THE &quot;GEMBUN-ITCHI&quot; OR &quot;UNITY OF WORD AND WRITING&quot; MOVEMENT. A SIMILAR MOVEMENT IN CHINA, &quot;WEN-HSUEH KO-MING&quot; OR &quot;LITERARY REVOLUTION,&quot; MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEGUN IN EARNEST IN 1919. THESE LITERARY MOVEMENTS WERE CLOSELY AFFECTED BY SOCIO-POLITICAL CHANGES AND THE USE OF REALISM, IN THE COLLOQUIAL LANGUAGE, BY CONTEMPORARY WRITERS. THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES THE HISTORIES OF THE TWO LITERARY LANGUAGES AND POINTS OUT THAT THE PATHS TO THE ADOPTION OF NATIONAL LITERARY LANGUAGES IN  CHINA AND JAPAN ARE DIFFERENT BUT &quot;THE STUDENT OF THE WRITTEN-LITERARY LANGUAGES OF BOTH COUNTRIES HAS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED THE WRITTEN-LITERARY LANGUAGES WITH EVERYTHING OLD AND EVERYTHING HINDERING SOCIAL AND CULTURAL PROGRESS.&quot; THE DISCUSSION PRESENTED PLACES EMPHASIS ON SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS RATHER THAN ON THE LINGUISTIC CHANGES.

IT WAS FOUND THAT--(1) THE CHILDREN WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO RECOGNIZE A WORD CORRECTLY THAN TO MAKE AN ERROR, (2) IT  TOOK SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER TO MAKE AN ERROR THAN TO RESPOND CORRECTLY, AND (3) THIRD-GRADERS MADE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ERRORS TO RHYME WORDS THAN TO SEMANTICALLY RELATED WORDS WHILE THE SIXTH-GRADE CHILDREN MADE MORE ERRORS TO THE SEMANTIC THAN TO THE RHYME WORDS.

THIS SURVEY OF WORD ASSOCIATIONS REVEALED, CONTRARY TO EXPECTATION, THAT SLUM CHILDREN ARE APPARENTLY MORE ADVANCED LINGUISTICALLY THAN SUBURBAN CHILDREN AT FIRST GRADE IN TERMS OF PARADIGMATIC RESPONSES. BY THIRD GRADE, HOWEVER, THE FAVORABLE POSITION OF THE SLUM CHILD HAS ALTERED AND SUBURBAN CHILDREN LEAD ON ALL PARADIGMATIC MEASURES. THE FIRST-TO-THIRD GRADE DECLINE IN THE RELATIVE POSITION OF DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY PARALLELS THE FAILURE OF THESE CHILDREN TO BECOME LITERATE EARLY IN  THEIR SCHOOL CAREER. DIFFERENCES IN WORD ASSOCIATIONS PRESUMABLY REFLECT DIFFERENCES IN SEMANTIC STRUCTURE BETWEEN WHITE AND NEGRO CHILDREN AND COULD DEVELOP APART FROM, OR IN ADDITION TO, DIALECT DIFFERENCES, ESPECIALLY IN SEGREGATED ENVIRONMENTS. TO PROFIT FROM INSTRUCTION THE LEARNER MUST BRING MANY SKILLS TO THE CLASSROOM, ONE OF WHICH MAY BE A SEMANTIC SYSTEM CONGRUENT WITH THAT OF THE TEACHER OR TEXTBOOK AUTHORS. IN KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE IT APPEARS THAT WORD MEANINGS, AND THEREFORE THE COGNITIVE ROLE OF WORDS, IS VASTLY DIFFERENT FOR THE NEGRO AND WHITE CHILD. IT ALSO APPEARS THAT WHEREAS SUBURBAN CHILDREN ARE MAKING ORDERLY PROGRESS TOWARD EXPANDING THEIR SEMANTIC SYSTEMS TO EMBED LESS FREQUENT WORDS OVER THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YEARS, SLUM CHILDREN ARE MAKING LITTLE OR NO  PROGRESS TOWARD USE OF LANGUAGE THAT IS CONCEPTUALLY MORE ELABORATE THAN WHAT THEY STARTED SCHOOL WITH. POSSIBLE REMEDIES INCLUDE SOME ADJUNCT USE OF TELEVISION IN THE EARLY GRADES AND SPECIFIC TRAINING ON WORD ASSOCIATES IN THE FORM OF ORAL GROUP GAMES LIKE THOSE FEATURED IN BEREITER'S PRE-SCHOOL CURRICULUM.

THESE SUBJECTS WERE THEN CONFRONTED WITH TWO OTHER JOB APPLICANTS, HALF WITH &quot;MR. CLEAN&quot; (WELL-DRESSED, WELL-GROOMED, SELF-CONFIDENT), HALF WITH &quot;MR. DIRTY&quot; (JUST THE OPPOSITE). THE SUBJECTS WERE THEN GIVEN THE OTHER HALF OF THE SELF-ESTEEM INVENTORY AND A FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE ASKING FOR THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF O AND OF THE SITUATION. ANALYSIS OF THE DATA LED TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS--(1) IN ANY SITUATION  (COMPETITIVE OR NONCOMPETITIVE), AN O WITH SOCIALLY DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS CAUSES A LOWERING OF P'S SELF-ESTEEM, AND AN O WITH NEGATIVE CHARACTERISTICS CAUSES AN INCREASE, AND (2) IN ANY SITUATION, SUBJECTS WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF INCONSISTENCY CHANGE THEIR SELF-ESTEEM MORE THAN THOSE WITH A LOW LEVEL.

QUESTIONNAIRES DESIGNED TO MEASURE THE SUBJECT'S CONCEPT OF HIS ACTUAL SELF AND HIS CONCEPT OF AN IDEAL SELF FOR THREE SITUATIONS WERE OBTAINED FROM EXPERIMENTAL (EX-PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS) AND CONTROL (MEDICAL OUT-PATIENT) GROUPS. HIGH WORK-INVOLVED PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM, HAVE THE ABILITY AND ACTUALLY DO WHAT IS EXPECTED, AND ARE MORE ACTIVE AND INVOLVED WITH PEOPLE THAN LOW WORK-INVOLVED PEOPLE. A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ACTUAL-IDEAL DISCREPANCY IN THE WORK SITUATION EXISTED FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS, INDICATING A LOWER LEVEL OF WORK ADJUSTMENT FOR THE EX-PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS THAN FOR THE GENERAL MEDICAL PATIENTS. THE CONCLUSIONS INDICATE--(1)  THE LEVEL OF WORK INVOLVEMENT IS CLOSELY LINKED TO SELF-PERCEPTIONS, (2) SELF-PERCEPTIONS REFLECT ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS, (3) MANY ADJUSTMENT PROBLEMS LEADING TO WORK AVOIDANCE MAY BE DUE TO SOCIAL DEFICIENCIES, (4) EX-PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS IN THE LOWER SOCIO-ECONOMIC GROUPS SHOW CONSIDERABLE NEED FOR EXTERNAL GUIDANCE BECAUSE THEY LACK INNER-DIRECTEDNESS, AND (5) THERE IS DEFINITE NEED FOR FOLLOW-THROUGH COUNSELING EFFORTS WITH THE LOW WORK-INVOLVED PERSON.

CAREFULLY SELECTED PATIENTS FROM THE HOSPITAL WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AS VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT LEADERS IN \"Y\" COMMUNITY CENTER PROGRAMS. ASSIGNMENTS WERE DETERMINED BY THE PATIENT'S PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS AND INTERESTS, THE HOSPITAL'S TREATMENT PLAN, AND THE NEEDS OF THE CENTER. PHASE ONE PREPARED PATIENTS FOR DISCHARGE THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN A CORE GROUP. AFTER DISCHARGE, THE PATIENTS REMAINED IN THE CORE GROUP WHILE PARTICIPATING IN NON-PATIENT ACTIVITY GROUPS WITHIN THE CENTER. THE FINAL PHASE  INVOLVED LEAVING THE CORE GROUP TO PARTICIPATE AUTONOMOUSLY IN COMMUNITY CENTER ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE THE PATIENT'S FAMILY IS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE ADJUSTMENT STRUGGLE, THE NEED TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM INVOLVING THE FAMILY IS DISCUSSED BY THE AUTHORS. THESE TWO PROGRAMS PROVIDED PATIENTS WITH--(1) AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN SOCIAL SKILLS, AND (2) A CHALLENGING STIMULUS WHICH COUNTERACTED THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION.

THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT WHEN NEUROTICISM SCORES WERE LOW, THE LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE MADE NO APPRECIABLE DIFFERENCE TO ACHIEVEMENT. THE COMBINATION OF HIGH INTELLIGENCE AND A HIGH LEVEL OF NEUROTICISM PRODUCED HIGH ACHIEVEMENT. THE POOREST ACHIEVERS WERE CHILDREN WITH LOW I.Q. AND A HIGH LEVEL OF EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCES.

THE INVESTIGATORS DETERMINED WHETHER THE PROVISION OF INCIDENTAL STIMULI, WHEN USED TO FACILITATE LEARNING, RESULTED IN IMPROVED TEST PERFORMANCE. BRIEF, HIGH INTENSITY STIMULI, SEX DIFFERENCE, COLOR OF FOCAL MATERIAL AND CUE WORDS, AND CONTROL OF THE PRESENTATION OF FOCAL MATERIAL AND INCIDENTAL STIMULI BY A GROUP TEACHING DEVICE WERE THE CRITERION VARIABLES. THE LEARNING SITUATIONS INVOLVED THE VISUAL PRESENTATION (USING TWO PROJECTORS) OF 32 SLIDES SHOWING 32 UNRELATED \"BITS\" OF FACTUAL INFORMATION, AND 32 PAIRED CUE SLIDES TO HIGHLY MOTIVATE THE SUBJECTS. THE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF MOTIVATION IN CONNECTION WITH INCIDENTAL LEARNING.  THE FINDING THAT MOTIVATED COLLEGE STUDENTS CAN IMPROVE TEST PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE USE OF INCIDENTAL STIMULI IMPLIES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE LEARNING OF FACTUAL MATERIAL IN THE CLASSROOM BY CAUSING BOTH INCIDENTAL AND INTENTIONAL LEARNING TO OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY.

THE RESPONSES BY THE LIBRARIANS SHOWED THAT--(1) SENIOR BOYS MADE THE GREATEST USE OF OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION AND NINTH- AND 10TH-GRADE BOYS THE LEAST, (2) THE OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK, PAMPHLETS FROM PRIVATE PUBLISHERS, AND GENERAL BOOKS WERE THE MOST COMMON SOURCES, AND (3) ACCURACY AND READABILITY WERE THE REASONS GIVEN FOR STUDENTS' USE OF  THESE SOURCES. THE VOCATIONAL INSTRUCTORS MENTIONED TEXTBOOKS, PERIODICALS, AND THE DICTIONARY OF OCCUPATIONAL TITLES AS OTHER FREQUENTLY USED SOURCES. THE COUNSELORS' RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE SUGGESTED THAT COUNSELORS ARE GENERALLY SATISFIED WITH THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION IF THEY FEEL COLLEGE-BOUND STUDENTS HAVE THE GREATEST INFORMATION NEED, WHILE COUNSELORS WHO FEEL TERMINAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE THE GREATEST NEED ARE GENERALLY DISSATISFIED. THE OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK WAS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF INFORMATION. THE MAJOR CRITICISM OF BOTH DESCRIPTIVE AND OUTLOOK SOURCES WAS THAT NOT ENOUGH ASPECTS OF THE JOB WERE COVERED, AND THOSE ASPECTS WHICH WERE COVERED LACKED DETAIL. (CG)",

A SERIES OF 19 CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS AND FACTOR-ANALYTIC STUDIES WAS CARRIED OUT TO CLARIFY THE NATURE OF CONCEPT LEARNING STRATEGIES AND THEIR COMPONENT COGNITIVE PROCESSES. A TOTAL OF 2,062 ELEMENTARY, HIGH SCHOOL, AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SERVED AS SUBJECTS. INSTRUCTIONS FORMULATED TO ENABLE SUBJECTS TO COGNIZE THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE CONCEPT POPULATION AND THE RULE JOINING THE ATTRIBUTES, AND TO DRAW CORRECT INFERENCES FROM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CONCEPT INSTANCES  FACILITATED CONCEPT LEARNING. SUBJECTS OFFERED HYPOTHESES IN A SYSTEMATIC PREDICTABLE PATTERN RELATED TO THE INFORMATION FEEDBACK WHICH THEY HAD RECEIVED. SUCCESSIVE PRESENTATION OF CONCEPT INSTANCES, RANDOM ORDER OF INSTANCE RECALL, AND SHORTER STIMULUS EXPOSURE TIME (VARIABLES ASSUMED TO INCREASE MEMORY LOAD) RESULTED IN POORER RETENTION SCORES. HIGH-ANALYTICAL SUBJECTS WERE SUPERIOR TO LOW-ANALYTICAL SUBJECTS IN ABILITY TO PROCESS INFORMATION AND ATTAIN CONCEPTS. FACTOR-ANALYTIC STUDIES RELATED AN INDUCTION FACTOR TO CONCEPT-ATTAINMENT TASKS, AND SUGGESTED THAT MORE COMPLEX CONCEPT LEARNING TASKS REQUIRE HIGHER-LEVEL ABILITIES THAN SIMPLER TASKS. (AUTHOR)",

THE FOUR VARIABLES WERE (1) AMOUNT OF INSTRUCTION PROVIDED IN HOW TO PROCESS INFORMATION, (2) NUMBER OF WRITTEN DOCUMENTS PRESENTED, (3) DEGREE OF MASKING OF INFORMATION, AND (4) INTERVIEW INFORMATION. THE EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED IN A SIMULATED SITUATION USING 144 PRINCIPALS FROM THREE COUNTIES IN WASHINGTON AS SUBJECTS.

THIS PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CLOSE OBSERVATION OF SCHOOL OPERATIONS, FOR PARTICIPATION IN SCHOOL DECISIONMAKING, AND FOR INVOLVEMENT IN COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES, SUPERVISION, AND THE PLANNING OF IMPROVED INSTRUCTION. EACH INTERN WAS ASSIGNED TO AN EXPERIENCED AND SUCCESSFUL HOST PRINCIPAL OF A SCHOOL SERVING DISADVANTAGED PUPILS. INTERNS SPENT THREE DAYS OF EACH WEEK IN THEIR HOST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL AND TWO DAYS IN SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS. TRAINING TECHNIQUES INCLUDED OPEN-ENDED CASE STUDIES,  SIMULATED PROBLEM INCIDENTS PRESENTED OVER CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION, AND FOLLOW-UP SUPPORT AFTER APPOINTMENT OF INTERNS TO PRINCIPALSHIPS. PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODS INCLUDED EXAMINATION OF THE INTERNS' LOGS, ANALYSIS OF QUESTIONNAIRE REPLIES FROM INTERNS AND HOST PRINCIPALS, AND APPRAISAL OF OBSERVATIONS MADE AT WORKSHOPS, SEMINARS, AND SCHOOLS.

THREE GENERAL QUESTIONS GUIDED THE STUDY--(1) THE AFFECT OF ATTITUDES TOWARD EDUCATION ON PERCEPTIONS OF DESIRABLE TRAITS AND BEHAVIORS OF TEACHERS, (2) THE FACTOR STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF EDUCATIONAL ATTITUDES, AND (3) THE FACTOR STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF PERCEPTIONS OF DESIRABLE TRAITS OF TEACHERS. SECOND-ORDER FACTOR ANALYSIS REDUCED A NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL ATTITUDE FACTORS TO TWO LARGE FACTORS, PROGRESSIVISM AND TRADITIONALISM.  SIMILARLY, TWO SECOND-ORDER FACTORS WERE FOUND TO UNDERLIE TEACHER-TRAIT PERCEPTIONS, PERSON-ORIENTATION AND TASK-ORIENTATION. IT WAS FOUND THAT PROGRESSIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD EDUCATION WERE POSITIVELY AND CONSISTENTLY CORRELATED WITH PERSON-ORIENTED TEACHER TRAIT PERCEPTIONS. TRADITIONAL ATTITUDES TOWARD EDUCATION WERE SIMILARLY CORRELATED WITH TASK-ORIENTED TEACHER TRAIT PERCEPTIONS. (AUTHOR/JK)",

THE DISCUSSION OF PLANNING IS LIMITED TO SHORT-RUN EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS. THE NATURE OF PERT IS DISCUSSED AND ITS APPLICABILITY TO PLANNING IS ESTABLISHED. SEVERAL BENEFITS WHICH RESULT WHEN PERT PRINCIPLES ARE APPLIED TO THE PLANNING FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH ARE NOTED--(1) PERT OFTEN RESULTS IN CLEARER STATEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND GOALS, (2) PERT REQUIRES THAT THOSE INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT MAKE EXPLICIT THE MEANS BY WHICH THEY PLAN TO REACH THE OBJECTIVE, (3) THE USE OF PERT RESULTS IN CLEARER DEFINITION OF EACH ACTUAL TASK TO BE DONE, (4) THE USE OF PERT ENABLES THE PROJECT  MANAGER TO IDENTIFY AT AN EARLY STAGE THE POTENTIAL TROUBLE SPOTS IN THE PROJECT PLAN, (5) THE USE OF PERT ASSISTS A PROJECT MANAGER TO KNOW WHERE TO RE-PLAN IN THE EVENT THAT THE ORIGINAL PLAN IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR SOME REASON, AND (6) THE USE OF NETWORK TECHNIQUES FACILITATES THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS SINCE PLANS ARE PORTRAYED IN A GRAPHIC MANNER.

TWO TECHNIQUES WERE UTILIZED--CLASS LOADING AND STUDENT SELECTION (CLASS), AND GENERAL ACADEMIC SIMULATION PROGRAM (GASP). TWO PILOT SCHOOLS FROM NEW YORK, EACH USING BOTH TECHNIQUES, WERE SCHEDULED WITH BOTH PROCESSES. THE PROJECT YIELDED TWO SETS OF DATA TO PROVIDE PARTIAL ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS--(1) THE COSTS INVOLVED IN SCHEDULING BY GASP AND CLASS IN EACH SCHOOL, (2) THE PERSONNEL COMMITMENT REQUIRED FOR THE TWO TECHNIQUES IN EACH SCHOOL, (3) THE SPECIAL COMPETENCIES REQUIRED OF PERSONNEL TO COLLECT AND PREPARE DATA FOR USE IN  THE TWO TECHNIQUES, (4) THE ALTERATIONS IN THE SCHEDULING PROCEDURE NECESSARY WHEN CHANGING FROM CLASS TO GASP, AND (5) THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF THE GASP-GENERATED MASTER SCHEDULE WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONVENTIONAL HAND-DEVELOPED SCHEDULE. THE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA SHOWED THAT CLASS AND GASP COULD NOT BE COMPARED IN TERMS OF THEIR ULTIMATE OBJECTIVES BECAUSE CLASS IS A &quot;SECTIONING&quot; TECHNIQUE, WHILE GASP DEVELOPS A MASTER SCHEDULE.

IN ALL, 27 GROUPS OF RETARDATES (IQ'S 35 TO 75) WERE CREATED, NUMBERING FROM 10 TO 15 MEMBERS. ACTIVITIES WERE PREDOMINANTLY TASK ORIENTED FOR THE YOUNGEST GROUP (AGES 8 TO 12), UNFOCUSED AND EXPRESSIVE FOR THE ADOLESCENTS (AGES 13 TO 17), AND CONCERNED WITH GROUP GOALS AND NEEDS FOR THE YOUNG ADULTS (AGES 18 TO 30 AND OVER). SELF CARE SKILLS WERE STRESSED WITH THE PEER GROUPS SERVING AS MECHANISMS TO INCREASE SOCIAL  SKILLS. THE TURNOVER RATE, ABOUT 58 PERCENT OF THE PARTICIPANTS, WAS HIGHEST IN THE CHILDREN'S AND ADOLESCENTS' GROUP IN LOW INCOME AREAS. PARENT QUESTIONNAIRES, COMING PRIMARILY FROM THE FAMILIES OF CHILDREN REMAINING IN THE PROGRAM, INDICATED SATISFACTION WITH THE PROGRAM'S CONTENT AND CONTEXT AS WELL AS WITH THE CHANGES NOTICED IN THE RETARDED CHILD OR ADULT. HOWEVER, CONVENIENCE AND LOCATION OF THE AGENCY WAS A MAJOR COMPLAINT (MADE BY 38 PERCENT OF 56 RESPONDENTS), AND A NEED WAS DEMONSTRATED FOR A CONTINUATION OF PROGRAMS TO REDUCE SOCIAL ISOLATION (LESS THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE PARTICIPANTS ESTABLISHED FRIENDSHIPS WHICH CARRIED OVER OUTSIDE THE MEETINGS). AGENCY DIRECTORS, WHOSE ATTITUDES WERE CONDUCIVE TO THE PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT OF SUITABLE RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS, REVEALED IN  PERSONAL INTERVIEWS A FAVORABLE VIEW OF SERVING THE HANDICAPPED. THE MAINTENANCE OF FAVORABLE ATTITUDES BY AGENCY DIRECTORS AND STAFFS AND OF INTERAGENCY COOPERATION WAS FOUND ESSENTIAL TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE RECREATIONAL PROGRAM AS WAS THE PRESENCE OF THE FOLLOWING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS--OUTSIDE RATHER THAN LOCAL FUNDING, LACK OF SOCIAL DISORGANIZATION IN THE COMMUNITY, AND LESS NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMS. RESULTS INDICATED THAT EXPANSION WILL OCCUR IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS AND THAT THE PROGRAM WAS BOTH NEEDED AND FEASIBLE. FUTURE PLANS ARE OUTLINED. A SEMINAR PROGRAM, A WEEKLY GROUP PROGRESS RECORD FORM, AND A NARRATIVE MEETING RECORD ARE PROVIDED. (JD)",

SUBJECT GROUPS, AGED 3-9 TO 10-3, INCLUDED (1) 32 EDUCABLE MENTAL RETARDATES WITH A MEAN IQ OF 66, DIVIDED INTO CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS OF 16 EACH, (2) 16 AVERAGE CHILDREN WITH IQ'S OF 90 TO 110 OR IN THE 50TH TO 60TH PERCENTILE ON GROUP READINESS AND ABILITY TESTS, AND (3) 16 ABOVE AVERAGE CHILDREN WITH IQ'S OF 125 TO 145 OR ABOVE THE 90TH PERCENTILE ON THE SAME GROUP TESTS. BOTH THE RETARDED GROUPS WERE GIVEN 120 TRAINING INCIDENTS USING DOLL PLAY, LIVE MODELS, PUPPETS, AND FILM SLIDES. TRAINING FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL (E) GROUP WAS IN RESPONSES TO SIX COMMON TYPES OF SOCIAL SITUATIONS SUCH AS ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE  OR RESPONDING TO DISAPPROVAL. TRAINING FOR THE CONTROL (C) GROUP WAS IN VERBAL AND PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS. THE AVERAGE GROUP RECEIVED NO TRAINING. PRETESTS AND POSTTESTS MEASURED LOGIC AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. RESULTS INDICATED THAT (1) AFTER TRAINING THE E-GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE C-GROUP ON LOGICAL THINKING (P LESS THAN .05) AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR (P LESS THAN .0005), (2) ALTHOUGH THE C-GROUP SCORED LOWER THAN THE E-GROUP AFTER TRAINING, IT SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AFTER TRAINING THAN BEFORE ON LOGICAL THINKING (P LESS THAN .05) AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR (P LESS THAN .01), (3) BEFORE TRAINING THE RETARDED GROUPS SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE GROUP ON LOGIC (P=.001) AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR (P=.0005), AND (4) AFTER TRAINING THE E-GROUP SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE  AVERAGE GROUP ON LOGIC (P LESS THAN .005) BUT HIGHER ON SOCIAL BEHAVIOR (P LESS THAN .05). RESULTS THUS CONFIRMED THE HYPOTHESES THAT (1) RETARDED CHILDREN HAVE LESS SKILL IN LOGICAL THINKING AND KNOWLEDGE OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR THAN AVERAGE CHILDREN, AND (2) WITH TRAINING, RETARDED CHILDREN CAN IMPROVE IN LOGICAL THINKING AND MAY REACH OR SURPASS THE LEVEL OF AVERAGE CHILDREN IN KNOWLEDGE OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN SPECIFIC COMMONLY OCCURRING SITUATIONS.

SIXTY-THREE RATERS COMPLETED THE 125-ITEM R/R SCALE ON GROUPS OF THREE TO NINE EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED CHILDREN (TOTAL 109) WITH WHOM THEY HAD HAD DAILY CONTACT FOR AT LEAST 3 WEEKS. THE AVERAGE CORRELATION RATIO OF THE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS WAS .68, AND THE MEAN INTRACLASS CORRELATION WAS .30. HOWEVER, THIS INDEX OF RELIABILITY IS MORE STRINGENT, SINCE THE FORMULA CORRECTS FOR ERROR BETWEEN JUDGES AND THE RESIDUAL ERROR. IN ANALYZING THE PPI  FOR RELIABILITY, THE TEST, WHICH WAS CODED AND REFINED TO ASSESS PARENT METHODS AND VALUES THROUGH THREE DRAFTS, WAS GIVEN TO BOTH PARENTS OF ONE NORMAL AND SIX DISTURBED CHILDREN AND TO THE MOTHERS ONLY OF TWO DISTURBED CHILDREN. THE MEAN PERCENT OF ABSOLUTE AGREEMENT FROM TEST TO RETEST WAS 41 PERCENT. THE APPROXIMATE PERCENT OF AGREEMENT WAS WITHIN 2 POINTS FOR 11 POINT SCALES, WITHIN 1 POINT OR LESS FOR OTHER SCALES. THE MEAN APPROXIMATE PERCENT OF AGREEMENT WAS 74. THE PDC, A MEASURE OF TREATMENT VARIABLES, WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH SIX DRAFTS BY OBSERVING AND CONSULTING WORKERS WITH DISTURBED CHILDREN. THE INTRAJUDGE RELIABILITY ON THE THREE SECTIONS (ONE WITH TWO SUBSECTIONS) RANGED FROM 66 TO 85 PERCENT. THE AVERAGE PERCENT OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN TEACHERS AND OBSERVERS RANGED FROM 49 TO  68 FOR EACH SECTION OF THE TEST. TO MAXIMIZE RELIABILITY, THE PDC WILL BE GIVEN BY SPECIALLY TRAINED PROCTORS AND THE R/R SCALE WILL BE ADMINISTERED FIRST. THE LAST INSTRUMENT, THE CHC, WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS, ONE TO BE COMPLETED FROM THE FILES AND THE OTHER BY THE PARENTS. ADDITIONAL STATISTICAL ANALYSES WILL BE PUBLISHED. FINAL DATA COLLECTED ON 456 EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED CHILDREN, 36 ORGANICALLY IMPAIRED CHILDREN, AND 507 PARENTS WILL BE EVALUATED IN THE FUTURE. A 12-MONTH POST ASSESSMENT SCALE IS BEING DEVELOPED FOR FOLLOWUP STUDIES. COMPARISON DATA WILL BE GATHERED ON NORMAL CHILDREN.

SUBJECTS WERE 160 BOYS AND GIRLS FROM THIRD AND SIXTH GRADES. DURING A CONTROL PERIOD SUBJECTS REPEATED TRISYLLABLE NONSENSE WORDS PRODUCED BY A RECORDED VOICE. DURING THE DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT PERIOD, SUBJECTS AGAIN REPEATED THE NONSENSE WORDS. GROUP A RECEIVED POSITIVE VERBAL REINFORCEMENT, AND GROUP B RECEIVED NEGATIVE VERBAL REINFORCEMENT. DEPENDENT VARIABLES WERE LATENCY DURATION (TIME FROM THE END OF AN AUDITORY STIMULUS TO THE BEGINNING OF SUBJECT'S RESPONSE) AND RESPONSE DURATION (TIME FROM BEGINNING  TO END OF A SUBJECT'S RESPONSE). INDEPENDENT VARIABLES WERE PERIOD (CONTROL AND EFFORT), CONDITION (REWARD AND PUNISHMENT), GRADE (THIRD AND SIXTH), AND SEX (FEMALE AND MALE). ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND COVARIANCE WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE DATA AND REVEALED EVIDENCE OF HETEROGENEITY OF VARIANCE SO THAT FINDINGS MAY NOT BE ASSUMED TO BE RELATED ONLY TO TREATMENT LEVELS OR MEANS. CONCLUSIONS WERE (1) INTRINSIC CHARACTERISTICS EXISTING AMONG CHILDREN NEED TO BE ISOLATED FOR MAXIMUM UNDERSTANDING OF DISFLUENCY, (2) THE GENERAL TENDENCY IN THE LITERATURE TO INTERPRET ADULT FINDINGS AS APPLICABLE TO CHILDREN MAY BE UNWARRANTED, (3) LATENCY APPEARS UNRELATED TO REWARD AND PUNISHMENT FOR BOYS AND GIRLS IN THIRD AND SIXTH GRADES, (4) THIRD GRADE CHILDREN HAVE MORE DISFLUENCY (AS MEASURED BY RESPONSE  DURATION) THAN SIXTH GRADE CHILDREN IN THIS SITUATION, BUT NOT NECESSARILY AS A RESULT OF PUNISHMENT, (5) GENERALLY, VERBAL PUNISHMENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LONGER UTTERANCE THAN VERBAL REWARD, AND (6) GIRLS HAD SHORTER RESPONSES WHEN REWARDED AND LONGER RESPONSES WHEN PUNISHED AS COMPARED TO MALES WHO SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONDITIONS.

TWO ADDITIONAL FOLLOWUP SURVEYS OBTAINED SIMILAR INFORMATION FROM THIRD AND FOURTH GRADE TEACHERS IN 1963 AND FROM FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE TEACHERS IN 1965. OF 2,035 BOYS AND 1,838 GIRLS, 308 BOYS AND 147 GIRLS WERE SUSPECTED OF BEING EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED IN TWO OR ALL THREE SURVEYS (BY TWO OR THREE TEACHERS OVER SPANS OF 2 OR 4 YEARS). FOR THE 39 GIRLS AND FOR 87 OF THE 92 BOYS, THE OVERALL BEHAVIOR PATTERN WAS DISTURBING AND ANNOYING ACTIVITY, SUGGESTING A SINGLE SYNDROME, WHICH APPEARED IN THREE PROBLEM  AREAS (GROUP ASSOCIATION, INDIVIDUAL WORK PERFORMANCE, FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS). THE SYNDROME WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A MUTUAL ALIENATION OF THE CHILD AND THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. THREE BEHAVIOR PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYNDROME OF DISTURBING AND ANNOYING ACTIVITY DIFFERED FOR BOYS AND GIRLS, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED ACTIVITY AND LOWER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT EXPECTED AMONG BOYS. THE CHILDREN WITH THIS SYNDROME TYPICALLY HAD RECEIVED THE MAXIMUM HELP WHICH THE SCHOOL COULD OFFER--EXTRA ATTENTION, REMEDIAL PROGRAMS, COUNSELING SERVICES, TRANSFER TO OTHER CLASSROOMS.

INDIVIDUALIZED AND TRADITIONAL SPELLING INSTRUCTION AT THE FOURTH GRADE LEVEL WERE CONTRASTED IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT. FIFTY-SEVEN SUBJECTS WERE SEPARATED BY SEX AND RANKED BY SPELLING ABILITY. ONE-HALF OF EACH GROUP SERVED AS CONTROLS AND USED THE TRADITIONAL CURRICULUM. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP FOLLOWED A COMMERCIALLY DEVELOPED INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM. SPELLING LESSONS WERE GIVEN 15 MINUTES A DAY FOR 15 WEEKS. THE TEACHERS ALTERNATED CLASSES EVERY 3 WEEKS. EFFECTS OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER.

FROM AN ORIGINAL GROUP OF 4,500 PERSONS RANGING IN AGE FROM 10 TO 25 YEARS, FROM FIFTH GRADE THROUGH COLLEGE, A RANDOM SAMPLING OF 600 WAS DRAWN, BASED ON GRADE LEVEL PERCENTAGES WITHIN THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE FINAL POPULATION NUMBERED 478 WITH 12 SUBGROUPS. THREE MODIFIED VERSIONS OF THE STO AND THE ORIGINAL VERSION WERE SELECTED ALONG WITH ITEMS FROM KISELBACH'S TEST OF AESTHETIC DISCRIMINATION, THURSTON'S HIDDEN FIGURES AND MUTILATED WORDS TESTS, GUILFORD'S BRICK USES TEST, AND MODIFIED FORMS OF TAYLOR'S RELATIONSHIP  TEST AND OF A SELF CONCEPT RATING SCALE. BIOGRAPHICAL DATA WERE ALSO GATHERED. THE BATTERY WAS GIVEN TO THE 4,500 SAMPLE, AND ITS ANALYSIS YIELDED VARIABLES OF GENERAL CREATIVITY, VISUAL PERCEPTION, MATURATION, PROCESS STRATEGY, SELF CONCEPT, AND BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION. FOLLOWING DATA ANALYSIS WHICH INVOLVED COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION, PRINCIPAL COMPONENT FACTOR ANALYSIS, AND VARIMAX ROTATION OF FACTORS, FOUR SIGNIFICANT FACTORS WERE OBSERVED--GENERAL CREATIVITY, INTELLIGENCE, PROCESS STRATEGY, AND MATURATION. CONCLUSIONS MADE WERE (1) THAT GENERAL CREATIVITY COULD BE ISOLATED, ALTHOUGH IT IS A COMPOSITE OF VARYING PROPORTIONS OF SEVERAL PRIMARY CREATIVITY ABILITIES, AND (2) THAT THE CRITERIA SET FOR THE MEASURE WERE APPROPRIATELY MET.

IN THE 5TH, 6TH, OR 7TH WEEK, THE REWARDS WERE CHANGED FROM MONETARY TO SOCIAL ONES. THE REWARD SCHEDULE AND SPEED OF PRESENTATION WERE ALSO MANIPULATED. MATERIAL WAS KEPT (ESPECIALLY IN THE INITIAL STAGES) AT A LEVEL NEITHER TOO DIFFICULT NOR TOO EASY. IN THE MATHEMATICS PROGRAM, STUDENTS WERE GIVEN BOTH A DIFFICULT AND MIXED-DIFFICULTY SERIES. READING AND SPELLING TRAINING WERE WITH 2,021 WORDS FROM THORNDIKE WORD LIST. MATHEMATICS TRAINING, BECAUSE OF THE UNEXPECTEDLY FAST LEARNING RATE, WAS CHANGED FROM 2,000 TO 4,000 PROBLEMS.  OF THREE SOMATIC MEASURES TAKEN THROUGHOUT TRAINING, ONLY TEMPERATURE WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE AN EFFECT UPON PERFORMANCE. RESULTS INDICATED THAT EXPERIMENTAL STUDENTS GENERALLY IMPROVED MORE THAN DID THE CONTROLS. GRADE CHANGES WERE NOTED IN ALL AREAS (BEST IN SPELLING) FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS, AND TEACHER RATINGS WERE HIGHER FOR THEM (SIGNIFICANT AT THE .014 LEVEL ONLY IN SPELLING). LEARNING DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MARKEDLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TYPE OR SCHEDULE OF REINFORCEMENT. POSTTESTS AFTER 4 MONTHS REVEALED RETENTION BEST IN MATHEMATICS. APPENDIXES CONTAIN THE PRETRAINING MATHEMATICS SEQUENCE, A LIST OF WORDS WITH SEMANTIC ASSOCIATION INDEX, AND A SAMPLE OF PROGRAMED SPELLING WORDS. (JD)",

A TRANSLATOR SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE HONEYWELL PRINTER WHICH CONSIDERED BOTH ITS SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE COMPONENTS THAT COULD BE MADE OPERATIONAL IN 1 1/2 YEARS. COST ESTIMATES FOR A FULL SCALE TRANSLATOR WERE ALSO OBTAINED. A PROGRAM OF DIRECT INPUT OF GRADE TWO BRAILLE WAS COMPLETED, AND  THE POSSIBILITY OF USING REMOTE EQUIPMENT WAS EXPLORED. HOWEVER, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO TEST THE PROGRAM. A SURVEY OF THE NEEDS OF TEACHERS OF THE BLIND IN CALIFORNIA REVEALED THAT THE DEMAND FOR GENERALLY AVAILABLE TEXTS IS LESS THAN FOR MATERIALS THAT ARE NOT IN SUFFICIENT DEMAND TO JUSTIFY MASS PRODUCTION (SUPPLEMENTARY TEXTS, SPECIAL INFORMATION PAMPHLETS, RECREATIONAL READING MATERIALS, ETC.). SUCH MATERIALS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR USE WITH THE HONEYWELL PRINTER. SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE FOR THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRANSLATOR.

SOME PROVISIONS SHOULD BE MADE TO EQUIP THE LAB WITH A WEATHER STATION AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR THE STUDY OF ASTRONOMY. THE USUAL STORAGE PROVISIONS FOR SCIENCE ROOMS ARE ALSO REQUIRED FOR THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE ROOM.

AT THE OTHER EXTREME, FACILITIES RICH IN SOFTWARE (I.E., INTERNAL CAPACITIES TO ENHANCE ALGORITHMIC COMMUNICATIONS) ARE ALSO EXPENSIVE AND OF LIMITED AVAILABILITY TO SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS. TO OBTAIN  SOME QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ON THE EFFICIENCY OF COMPUTER FACILITIES, FIVE TYPICAL PROBLEMS WERE RUN ON SIX TYPES OF COMPUTER FACILITIES. THE TIME TO RUN THE SET OF FIVE PROBLEMS VARIED FROM ABOUT 90 MINUTES TO 3 MINUTES. THE 3-MINUTE SYSTEM WAS A LARGE-SCALE FACILITY LOCATED AT A UNIVERSITY. OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST WAS THE 20-MINUTE SYSTEM, WHICH CONSISTED OF TELETYPE ACCESS TO A LARGE-SCALE, TIME-SHARING SYSTEM. AT THE PRESENT TIME, SOME FORM OF INDIRECT ACCESS IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE AND MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO USE COMPUTERS AS INSTRUCTIONAL TOOLS IN TEACHING MATHEMATICS.

IT CAN FACILITATE COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE PROCESSES IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF INADEQUATE INTERNAL CODING ABILITY OF STUDENTS. SINCE VISUAL IMAGES ARE INDUCTIVE, THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF FILMIC COMMUNICATION DEPENDS ON THE INFERENTIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOUND  AND IMAGES, AND UPON THE AUDIENCE ABILITY FOR MAKING INFERENCES.

THIS WAS EXPLAINED AS AN ERRONEOUS STATISTICAL COMPARISON THAT RESULTED IN A SLEEPER EFFECT, AND ALSO BY EXTREME VARIATIONS IN FEEDBACK CONTENT.

TWO PAPERS SUBMITTED BY JOSHUA A. FISHMAN DISCUSS THE STATUS OF NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE RESOURCES IN THE UNITED STATES, THE PROSPECTS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THESE RESOURCES, AND THE POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BILINGUALISM, INTELLIGENCE, AND LANGUAGE LEARNING. THE NEED TO CORRECT CURRENT MISEDUCATION OF SPANISH-SPEAKING CHILDREN IN THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST, AND THE APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES LEARNED FROM LANGUAGE EDUCATION OF BILINGUALS TO LANGUAGE EDUCATION IN GENERAL IS STRESSED BY THEODORE ANDERSSON. ACCULTURATION OF THE BILINGUAL CHILD IS PROMOTED IN CHESTER C. CHRISTIAN  JR.'S REPORT. A. BRUCE GAARDER DISCUSSES THE RESEARCH EFFORTS DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN AND MAINTAIN A CHILD'S MOTHER TONGUE, WHICH IN TURN COULD HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THAT YOUNGSTER'S INTELLECT, PERSONALITY, AND ABILITY TO LEARN ENGLISH.

A PETITION FOR THE ELECTION WAS CIRCULATED AND ADDRESSED TO THE DUPAGE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. BUSINESS CONCERNS CONTRIBUTED FUNDS FOR THE CAMPAIGN. DISTRICT SCHOOL BOARDS SUBMITTED NAMES OF PEOPLE FOR A CITIZENS' COMMITTEE IN EACH AREA. THE CHAIRMAN OF EACH  COMMITTEE FOLLOWED CLEAR DIRECTIVES AND AN EXACT TIMETABLE FOR CLUB ADDRESSES, NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS, AND BLOCK-TO-BLOCK CANVASSING. A PUBLICITY COMMITTEE HANDLED SPEECHES, LITERATURE, AND ADVERTISING. THE ILLINOIS JUNIOR COLLEGE BOARD RECOMMENDED STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT.

ABOUT 9 PERCENT OF THE BLOCK GROUP AND 8 PERCENT OF THE CONTROL GROUP WERE CLASSED AS DROPOUTS IN THEIR FIRST TERM. THIS DOES NOT SUPPORT HYPOTHESIS (2), ALTHOUGH THE TIME PERIOD OF ONLY ONE TERM IS NOT CONCLUSIVE. WHEN SUBJECTIVE EVALUATIONS WERE COLLECTED, SEVERAL INSTRUCTORS COMMENTED THAT MORALE APPEARED HIGHER IN THE BLOCK CLASSES.

AFTER EXAMINING THE ENTIRE ENGLISH PROGRAM, THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED THE INTRODUCTION OF ENGLISH 2A (FUNCTIONAL READING AND WRITING), OF ENGLISH R (BASIC READING), AND OF A STUDY SKILLS CENTER TO TREAT DEFICIENCIES. THEY  ALSO ASKED FOR CHANGES IN ELIGIBILITY AND PLACEMENT TESTING. AFTER SUCH CHANGES WERE INITIATED, THEY FELT THAT THE ENGLISH REQUIREMENT FOR AN AA DEGREE WOULD BE FULFILLED BY COMPLETION OF ENGLISH 2A, ENGLISH 1A, OR BUSINESS ENGLISH AND THAT THE STUDENT WOULD HAVE A WIDER CHOICE OF COURSES IN COMPLETING THE 6-UNIT REQUIREMENT.

ONE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT IS TO BRIDGE THE SUMMER GAP BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE AND OVERCOME THE TRAUMA OF TRANSFER FROM A LOW SOCIOECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT TO A MIDDLE-CLASS ORIENTED INSTITUTION. OTHER AIMS ARE TO (1) ENCOURAGE THE ABLE, LOW-INCOME STUDENT TO ATTEND COLLEGE, (2) ASSIST WITH COUNSELING ON PROCEDURES AND PROGRAMING, (3) GIVE JOB ASSIGNMENTS THAT ENCOURAGE PERSISTENCE THROUGH PAYMENT OF A SALARY, AND (4) FAMILIARIZE HIM WITH THE FUTURE POSSIBILITIES OF COLLEGE WORK-STUDY PROGRAMS. THE STUDENTS WERE  SELECTED FROM THREE HIGH SCHOOLS. THEY HAD LOW INCOME (BY OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY STANDARDS), AND WERE CAPABLE OF DOING COLLEGE WORK AND OF BENEFITING FROM IT. OF THE ORIGINAL 40 STUDENTS, 35 COMPLETED THE FIRST SUMMER SESSION AND MOST REMAINED AT PASADENA CITY COLLEGE FOR THE FALL SEMESTER. STUDENTS FOUND THE JOB ASSIGNMENTS VALUABLE AND WELCOMED THE NEW EXPERIENCE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND ACHIEVEMENT.

THE EXAMINATION OF 500 NON-FICTION BOOKS PUBLISHED FROM 1800-1899 REVEALED THAT THE MAJOR CAUSE OF THE DETERIORATION OF BOOK PAPER AFTER MID-19TH CENTURY IS THE ACIDITY OF ALUM-ROSIN SIZE, WHICH WAS USED INCREASINGLY TO SIZE BOTH WOOD PULP AND RAG FIBER PAPERS. ALTHOUGH WOOD PULP WAS REPLACING RAG FIBER AT THIS TIME AND IS POPULARLY THOUGHT TO BE THE MAIN REASON FOR LOSS OF BOOK PAPER STRENGTH, THE STUDY SHOWED THAT ALL-RAG PAPERS  SUFFERED A SIMILAR DROP IN QUALITY. THE CHLOROPHENOL-RED SPOT TEST WAS FOUND TO BE RELIABLE FOR INDENTIFYING MOST OF THE BOOK PAPERS NEEDING STABILIZATION. THE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT PRINTER'S INK DID NO VISIBLE DAMAGE TO THE PAPERS TESTED, ALTHOUGH IT CAUSED A LOSS OF 30 PERCENT IN FOLDING STRENGTH. METHODS RECOMMENDED FOR DELAYING OR PREVENTING DETERIORATION OF 19TH CENTURY BOOK PAPERS INVOLVE DE-ACIDIFICATION AND STORAGE AT LOWERED TEMPERATURES.

THE TWENTY MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION INTENDED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF BETTER AND MORE RESPONSIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE DISCUSSED WITHIN SEVEN AREAS--(1) IMPROVING INFORMATION SYSTEMS WITHIN GOVERNMENTS, (2) IMPROVING THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AMONG GOVERNMENTS, (3)  STRENGTHENING INFORMATION SYSTEMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, (4) SHARING SYSTEMS KNOWLEDGE, (5) ACHIEVING COMPATIBILITY AMONG SYSTEMS, (6) IMPROVING INFORMATION ABOUT FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, AND (7) GUIDELINES FOR ACTION. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE INTENDED AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD IMPROVING THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL FLOW OF INFORMATION. A CONTINUING NATIONAL EFFORT WILL STILL BE NEEDED TO REVIEW AND IMPROVE THE COORDINATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS WITHIN AND AMONG ALL GOVERNMENTAL UNITS. (CM)",

THE CHILDREN WERE TESTED WITH THE PEABODY PICTURE VOCABULARY TEST AND THE STANFORD-BINET IN OCTOBER OF 1965 AND IN APRIL OF 1966. THE RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE IQ SCORES OF THE CHILDREN BETWEEN THE TWO TESTING PERIODS. SUMMER HEAD START PROGRAMS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE DRYDEN, NEWFIELD, AND ITHACA, N.Y. AREAS IN 1965. A FOLLOWUP STUDY ON 74 OF THE 77 HEAD START CHILDREN WAS DONE DURING THEIR KINDERGARTEN YEAR. DURING THE SECOND AND SEVENTH WEEK OF  EACH OF THE THREE SUMMER PROGRAMS, THE CHILDREN WERE TESTED FOR COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE FOR CHILDREN IN ANY OF THE GROUPS BUT SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IMPROVED SLIGHTLY. THE CHILDREN IN THE FOLLOWUP STUDY WERE TESTED TWICE DURING THEIR KINDERGARTEN YEAR. ALSO, A CONTROL GROUP OF 67 NON-HEAD START CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN WAS SO TESTED. BOTH GROUPS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN IQ, BUT THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE FOUND BETWEEN THE SCORES OF THE HEAD START AND NON-HEAD START CHILDREN. THE MOTHERS OF CHILDREN IN BOTH GROUPS WERE INTERVIEWED TO OBTAIN THEIR OPINIONS OF THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH THEIR CHILDREN PARTICIPATED. THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT HEAD START WERE GENERALLY ENTHUSIASTIC AND POSITIVE. IT WAS CONCLUDED  THAT THE SUCCESS OF THESE HEAD START PROGRAMS COULD BE MEASURED MORE IN TERMS OF PUPIL ENJOYMENT AND PARENTAL SATISFACTION THAN OF COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT. (WD)",

BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT EMPHASIS ON REVISION OF MATHEMATICS CURRICULUM AND OF THE APPARENT VALUE OF NUMBER TRAINING TO PRESCHOOL DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN, THIS STUDY WAS CREATED TO INVESTIGATE (1) WHETHER TRAINING PROGRAMS CAN EFFECTIVELY TEACH 3- TO 6-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN THE CONCEPT OF CONSERVATION OF SUBSTANCE, AND (2) IF SO, WHETHER SOME TRAINING PROCEDURES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE WITH CERTAIN POPULATIONS THAN OTHER PROCEDURES. ACCORDING TO PIAGET, TRAINING PROGRAMS ALONE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO TEACH CHILDREN THE CONSERVATION CONCEPT. ALL OF THE ACTIVITIES OF A CHILD, HIS GRADUAL  INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT, LEAD TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE CONCEPT. TO INVESTIGATE PIAGET'S IDEAS ON THE FORMATION OF THE CONCEPT OF CONSERVATION OF SUBSTANCE, 416 CHILDREN OF AGES THREE TO SIX AND OF VARIED SOCIOECONOMIC LEVELS WERE ADMINISTERED ONE OF FOUR TRAINING PROCEDURES AFTER A PRETEST. THE FOUR TRAINING PROCEDURES USED WERE (1) SMEDSLUND'S COGNITIVE CONFLICT METHOD, (2) SIGEL'S MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATION METHOD, (3) BEILIN'S VERBAL RULE INSTRUCTION METHOD, AND (4) BRUNER'S LANGUAGE ACTIVATION METHOD. AT THREE TIME INTERVALS AFTER THIS TRAINING PERIOD, POSTTESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO ASCERTAIN THE QUALITY AND EXTENT OF THE CHILD'S LEARNING OF THE CONCEPT. THE CONCLUSION REACHED FROM COMPARING THE TEST RESULTS FOR THE FOUR TRAINING GROUPS TO THE RESULTS FROM A CONTROL GROUP WAS THAT THE  TRAINING PROCEDURES, ALONE, WERE INEFFECTIVE, REGARDLESS OF THE POPULATION TYPE, IN TEACHING THE CHILDREN THE CONSERVATION-OF-SUBSTANCE CONCEPT.

AFTER EXTENSIVE OBSERVATIONS OF PRESCHOOLERS, DISCUSSIONS WITH PRESCHOOL PERSONNEL, AND REVIEWS OF AVAILABLE MATERIAL THE FIRST FORM OF THE SCALE WAS WRITTEN, BASED ON CERTAIN PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. THE SCALE ITEMS WERE INITIALLY JUDGED BY GROUPS OF PRESCHOOL TEACHERS AND TEACHER EDUCATORS WHO RANKED ITEMS IN TERMS OF THEIR IMPORTANCE IN REGARD TO CHILDREN'S SOCIAL COMPETENCE. AN INITIAL SAMPLE OF 1165 CALIFORNIA CHILDREN WERE RATED, AND 30 ITEMS WERE SELECTED FOR THE FINAL SCALE FORM. A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF CHILDREN IN NURSERY SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES PROVIDED THE NORMING  POPULATION. TEACHER RATINGS WERE OBTAINED FOR 800 CHILDREN, EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED BY AGE (2, 3, 4, AND 5), SEX, AND OCCUPATIONAL LEVEL (LOW AND HIGH). STATISTICAL TREATMENT OF THE DATA BY A THREE-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE INDICATED THAT THE SCALE RELIABLY DISCRIMINATED BETWEEN VARIOUS AGE GROUPS. F RATIOS FOR THE MAIN EFFECTS WERE SIGNIFICANT BEYOND THE .01 LEVEL. NONE OF THE INTERACTIONS WAS SIGNIFICANT. SEPARATE NORMS WERE MADE FOR EACH OF THE FOUR AGE GROUPS BY SEX AND OCCUPATIONAL LEVEL.

LANGUAGE SKILLS AND MOTIVATION CAN BE IMPROVED BY TEACHING STANDARD ENGLISH AS IF IT WERE A SECOND LANGUAGE.

CHILDREN ARE THEREFORE TRAINED TO FOCUS ON RELEVANT STIMULI AND TO RECOGNIZE, DISCRIMINATE AND CATEGORIZE THROUGH CONCRETE OBJECT MANIPULATION. TIME ORIENTATION IN ACTIVITIES GIVES A DISADVANTAGED CHILD, WHO MAY HAVE HAD LITTLE ORDER OR ROUTINE AT HOME, A SENSE OF SEQUENCE OF EVENTS, EACH OF WHICH HAS A BEGINNING, A MIDDLE, AND A CONCLUSION.

STANFORD-BINET TESTS, FORM LM, WERE ADMINISTERED TO 40 NURSERY SCHOOL CHILDREN AND 12 NONNURSERY SCHOOL CHILDREN. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NURSERY SCHOOL PROGRAM, THE NURSERY AND NONNURSERY CHILDREN RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE TESTS BY BOTH THE STANDARD AND OPTIMALLY-MOTIVATING PROCEDURES. THIS PROCESS WAS REPEATED ABOUT 7 MONTHS LATER, NEAR THE END OF THE NURSERY PROGRAM. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT (1) STANDARD TESTING PROCEDURES UNDERESTIMATE THE  CULTURALLY DEPRIVED CHILD'S INTELLIGENCE, SO THAT INITIAL OPTIMAL TEST SCORES SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN INITIAL STANDARD TEST SCORES, (2) INCREASES IN STANDARD IQ SCORES SHOULD BE GREATER FOR THE NURSERY THAN FOR THE NONNURSERY CHILDREN, AND (3) THE CHILD'S MOTIVATIONAL STRUCTURE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS TEST SCORES. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS REQUIRED THE ACCEPTANCE OF ALL THREE HYPOTHESES.

        "description":"MANY STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF A SLUMP OR INVERSION IN THE PROBLEM-SOLVING EFFICIENCY OF CHILDREN AT THE FOURTH GRADE LEVEL. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE INTERFERING EFFECT OF THE FORMATION OF COMPLEX HYPOTHESES BY THE CHILDREN. SINCE A TENDENCY TO RESPOND RAPIDLY WOULD PRESUMABLY INHIBIT THE FORMATION OF COMPLEX HYPOTHESES, IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT IF CHILDREN WERE DICHOTOMIZED INTO FAST AND SLOW RESPONDERS, THE FAST GROUP WOULD FAIL TO SHOW THE SLUMP. A TOTAL OF 168 STUDENTS, 42 IN EACH OF GRADES TWO THROUGH FIVE, WERE GIVEN A SET OF FOUR SEQUENCE-DETERMINATION PROBLEMS. THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE STUDENTS TOOK TO COMPLETE A SERIES OF 50 TRIALS ON EACH PROBLEM WAS USED TO DIVIDE EACH GRADE INTO FAST AND SLOW RESPONDERS. FOR THE COMPLETE SAMPLE, THE  PERCENTAGES OF CHILDREN SUCCESSFULLY DETERMINING EACH SEQUENCE SHOWED THE EXPECTED INVERSION FOR THREE OF THE FOUR PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, WHEN THE SAMPLE WAS DIVIDED, THE SLOW RESPONDERS SHOWED AN INVERSION FOR ALL PROBLEMS. BUT THE FAST RESPONDERS SHOWED AN INVERSION ON ONLY ONE PROBLEM. ALTHOUGH THE PREDICTION OF THE HYPOTHESIS WAS CONFIRMED, THE FACT THAT, AFTER THE SECOND GRADE, THE FAST RESPONDERS ALWAYS DID BETTER THAN THE SLOW RESPONDERS CLOUDS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS. IT IS FELT THAT THE COMPLEX HYPOTHESIS ASSUMPTION IS INSUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REACTION TIME VARIABLE. (DR)",

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPATIAL PERCEPTION IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS, AND ONE IMPORTANT PART OF SPATIAL PERCEPTION IS HAPTIC PERCEPTION--THE RECOGNITION OF OBJECTS BY TOUCH. THIS STUDY IS A LONGITUDINAL INVESTIGATION OF THE RETENTION OF HAPTIC ABILITIES DEVELOPED IN THE COURSE OF A 3-MONTH TRAINING EXPERIMENT, REPORTED IN ED 010 126. THE FINAL TEST OF THAT STUDY WAS USED AS THE PRETEST FOR THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY. TESTS WERE GIVEN TO THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE EARLIER STUDY 6 MONTHS AND 12 MONTHS AFTER ITS COMPLETION. OF THE 144 SUBJECTS OF THE EARLIER STUDY, 131 COMPLETED RETESTING. THE AGES OF THESE SUBJECTS RANGED, AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EARLIER STUDY, FROM 36 TO 71 MONTHS. THE SUBJECTS CAME  FROM MONTESSORI AND NON-MONTESSORI PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AND HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WHICH RECEIVED EITHER INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP INSTRUCTION. FIVE TESTS OF HAPTIC PERCEPTION WERE USED. IN EACH TEST THE SUBJECT HANDLED PLYWOOD FORMS THROUGH AN OPENING IN A SCREEN AND WAS THEN ASKED TO DO SUCH THINGS AS NAME THE OBJECT, DESCRIBE IT, OR DRAW IT. ANALYSES IN WHICH THE PRETEST SCORES WERE CONTROLLED INDICATED THAT RETENTION WAS NOT STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE TYPE OF PRESCHOOL, THE TYPE OF INSTRUCTION, CHRONOLOGICAL OR MENTAL AGE, OR SEX. EXAMINATION OF THE SCORES OVER THE 12-MONTH PERIOD SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH THE EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS SCORED CONSISTENTLY HIGHER, THE CONTROL SUBJECTS HAD HIGHER CHANGE SCORES. THIS SEEMS TO HAVE RESULTED FROM A LOSS OF PROFICIENCY IN HAPTIC  ABILITIES BY THE EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS, COUPLED WITH SOME DEVELOPMENT OF HAPTIC ABILITIES BY THE CONTROL GROUP AS A RESULT OF MATURATION.

THESE FACTORS WERE (1) FAMILY BACKGROUND VARIABLES, (2) PARENTAL CHILD-REARING PRACTICE AND ATTITUDE VARIABLES, (3) CHILD PERSONALITY AND SELF-CONCEPT VARIABLES, AND (4) CHILD-PEER RELATIONSHIP VARIABLES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE PRESENCE OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE FOUR CATEGORIES OF VARIABLES. STUDENTS OF THE CASTLEBERRY SCHOOL DISTRICT NEAR FORT WORTH, TEXAS HAD PARTICIPATED FOR FOUR YEARS IN THE DISTRICT'S PEER RELATIONS PROGRAM. SOCIOMETRIC RATING SCORES WERE THUS AVAILABLE FOR A LARGE GROUP OF STUDENTS. THESE SCORES REPRESENTED A CHILD'S RATING ACCORDING TO HIS PEERS AND TEACHERS. BOYS AND GIRLS IN GRADES SIX, SEVEN, AND  EIGHT WHO PLACED HIGH OR LOW ON THE SOCIOMETRIC RATING SCORE WERE THE SAMPLE POOL. THE PARENTS OF THESE CHILDREN WERE SOLICITED FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY AND WHEN 100 FAMILIES AGREED TO PARTICIPATE, THE SAMPLE WAS CLOSED. THE PARENTS AND CHILDREN WERE SUBSEQUENTLY ADMINISTERED A BATTERY OF INTERVIEWS, QUESTIONNAIRES, TESTS, AND RATING FORMS CONCERNING VARIABLE-CATEGORIES (1), (2), AND (3). THE RESULTS OF THESE DATA, PLUS THE SOCIOMETRIC RATING DATA USED IN SELECTING THE SAMPLE, WERE ANALYZED TO OBTAIN THE EXISTENCE OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS, IF ANY. SIGNIFICANT INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE FOUR GROUPS OF VARIABLES WERE FOUND TO EXIST. FAMILY BACKGROUND FACTORS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIABLES AT EACH OF THE OTHER THREE LEVELS. FAMILY TENSION, A VARIABLE UNDER CATEGORY (2), HAD A  DISRUPTING INFLUENCE ON CHILD-REARING PRACTICES, THE CHILD'S PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT, AND SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHILD BY PEERS. ANOTHER CATEGORY (2) VARIABLE, PARENTAL LOVE OR REJECTION, ALSO INFLUENCED THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE. (WD)",

DEPRIVED NEGRO PUPILS AND THEIR TEACHERS IN TWO NEW ORLEANS URBAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS TOOK PART IN AN EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT, INVOLVING A SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM. PRELIMINARY TESTING SUPPLIED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ON BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS, NONCOGNITIVE DATA ON TEACHER VARIABLES, AND COGNITIVE DATA ON PUPILS. AT THE PROJECT'S INCEPTION, PUPILS HAD SUCH LEARNER BEHAVIOR CHARACTERISTICS AS DEPRESSED LEARNING POTENTIAL, LOW READINESS LEVELS, INADEQUATE READING SKILLS AND  POOR IN-SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT. THE LONG FORM OF THE CALIFORNIA TEST OF MENTAL MATURITY WAS GIVEN TO ALL (APPROXIMATELY 2,200) PUPILS IN THE FALL OF 1966, PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION PROGRAM. INTERIM POSTTESTS WERE GIVEN IN THE SPRING OF 1967, AND POSTTESTS WILL BE GIVEN ANNUALLY IN GRADES ONE, THREE, AND FIVE. THERE WERE 305 GRADE ONE, 205 GRADE THREE, AND 250 GRADE FIVE PUPILS PARTICIPATING. ALL GAINS BETWEEN THE PRETESTS AND POSTTESTS IN GRADES ONE, THREE, AND FIVE WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AT OR BEYOND THE .001 LEVEL EXCEPT THE GRADE FIVE NONLANGUAGE GAIN, WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANT AT THE .05 LEVEL. LANGUAGE GAINS WERE HIGHER IN ALL CASES THAN NONLANGUAGE GAINS. THESE PRELIMINARY RESULTS APPEAR TO INDICATE THAT IQ SCORES, AS AN INDEX OF ACADEMIC POTENTIAL, CAN BE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY  WHEN GENERAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENT MODIFICATIONS ARE COUPLED WITH INSTRUCTIONAL INTERVENTION PROGRAMS.

THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 120 LOWER STATUS CHILDREN AND 120 UPPER STATUS CHILDREN, EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE KINDERGARTEN, FIRST GRADE AND THIRD GRADE, WHO WERE ADMINISTERED PAIRED-ASSOCIATE TASKS. FOUR METHODS OF PRESENTATION OF THE 20 PAIRED ASSOCIATES WERE USED--(1) PROVIDED-PHRASE (PP), (2) PROVIDED-SENTENCE (PS), (3) GENERATED-STILL (GS), AND (4) GENERATED-ACTION (GA). THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PP-PS METHODS AND THE GA-GS METHODS WAS THAT IN THE LATTER, THE CHILDREN HAD TO CONSTRUCT THEIR OWN SENTENCES,  USING THE PAIR NAMES. IN THE PP AND PS METHODS, THE CHILDREN JUST REPEATED A PHRASE (PP) OR SENTENCE (PS) GIVEN BY THE EXPERIMENTER. A PROJECTOR AND SCREEN APPARATUS WERE USED TO PRESENT THE PAIRED OBJECTS. THE PICTURES USED IN THE PP, PS, AND GS METHODS WERE STILL PICTURES. THE GA METHOD USED ACTION PICTURES IN WHICH THE DISPLAYED OBJECTS WERE PART OF AN ACTION CONTEXT. TWO TEST TRIALS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CONDUCTED. THE TEST TRIALS INVOLVED DISPLAYING ONE OF THE PAIR ON THE SCREEN AND REQUIRING THE PUPIL TO NAME THE OTHER ITEM OF THE PAIR. THE RESULTS OF THE TEST TRIALS INDICATED THAT THE LOWER LEVEL CHILDREN DID NOT HAVE THE LANGUAGE DEFICIENCY ANTICIPATED ALTHOUGH THEY LEARNED LESS EFFICIENTLY THAN THE UPPER STATUS CHILDREN AT THE KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE LEVEL. A POSSIBLE REASON FOR  THIS LOWER PERFORMANCE BY THE LOWER STATUS CHILDREN IS THAT UPPER STATUS CHILDREN BENEFITED MORE FROM LARGER NUMBERS OF PAIRING-TRIAL REPETITIONS. (WD)",

BEFORE A STATE CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OF SIZE, IT SHOULD PERHAPS FIRST ANSWER THE QUESTIONS--WHAT DO WE WANT THE STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM TO ACCOMPLISH, AND WHAT ARE THE STRUCTURAL ALTERNATIVES THAT WILL BE BEST FOR OUR STATE. WHEN THESE ARE ANSWERED, SIZE THEN BECOMES A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE STRUCTURE. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE REVEALS VARIOUS SIZE FIGURES ESTABLISHED THROUGH RESEARCH AND SURVEYS OF EXISTING SYSTEMS. WHILE THESE FIGURES ARE HELPFUL, IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SIZE FACTOR IS NOT IN THE NUMBERS THEMSELVES BUT IN WHAT THE NUMBERS CAN PRODUCE IN RELATION TO THE EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES. ANOTHER FACTOR WHICH MUST BE  CONSIDERED IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL PARTS OF A STATE SCHOOL SYSTEM STRUCTURE ARE INEXTRICABLY RELATED. A BALANCE IS GENERALLY MAINTAINED, AND TO CHANGE ANY PART WITHOUT GIVING CAREFUL CONSIDERATION TO THE OTHERS MAY CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. AS WITH SIZE, STRUCTURE IS NOT IMPORTANT IN AND OF ITSELF BUT ONLY WHEN IT IS RELATED TO THE TASKS THAT STRUCTURE CAN ACCOMPLISH TO MEET THE EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES OF THE STATE. TABLES PROVIDED IN THE APPENDIX INDICATE SIZES FOUND IN THE CURRENT LITERATURE AND CITE VARIOUS STATE SIZE RECOMMENDATIONS. (DK)",

IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS, HOWEVER, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO DISPEL SEVERAL MYTHS. THE FIRST MYTH (UNITARY CONCEPT MYTH) CONSISTS OF THE BELIEF THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS EXIST FOR SOME SINGLE UNDEFINED PURPOSE AND FURTHER DISCUSSION IS PRECLUDED UNTIL THIS PURPOSE HAS BEEN CLEARLY IDENTIFIED. RESEARCH, HOWEVER, INDICATES THAT DISTINCT ADVANTAGES EXIST IN EDUCATIONAL UNITS LARGER THAN MANY SMALL DISTRICTS. THE SECOND MYTH CONCERNS THE MAXIMUM SIZE (SIZE LIMITS MYTH) TO WHICH A DISTRICT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GROW. SINCE IT  IS RATHER EASY TO DEFINE A SYSTEM AS TOO SMALL, PROPONENTS OF THIS MYTH OFTEN DEMAND AN EQUALLY PRECISE DEFINITION OF AN OVERPOPULATED SYSTEM. FAILURE TO DEFINE A SPECIFIC UPPER LIMIT IS A WEAK ARGUMENT FOR NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SERVICES A LARGER DISTRICT COULD OFFER. THE THIRD MYTH (TRANSPORTATION MYTH) EXPRESSES ITSELF IN THE FEAR OF AN UNREASONABLE RISE IN TRANSPORTATION COSTS WITH INCREASED STUDENT INFLUX FROM OUTLYING COMMUNITIES. IN ACTUALITY, THOSE DISTRICTS WHICH HAVE REORGANIZED HAVE FOUND THAT TRANSPORTATION COSTS RISE NO MORE RAPIDLY THAN OTHER EXPENSES.

IN 1955, 7 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WERE ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL INDIAN INSTITUTE, WITH TEACHERS FROM THE LOCAL POPULATION AND INSTRUCTION IN MIXTECO, THE TRIBAL TONGUE. SPANISH WAS TAUGHT USING CONVERSATIONAL TECHNIQUES WHICH COULD BE PRACTICED. AGE AND SEX WERE FOUND TO BE CRUCIAL VARIABLES IN LEARNING STYLES. OLDER BOYS WERE ACCUSTOMED TO STRENUOUS WORK, AND EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY IN WRITING DUE TO POOR HAND MUSCLE CONTROL. GIRLS OF THE SAME AGE DISPLAYED A FACILITY FOR WRITING ATTRIBUTED TO MUSCULAR COORDINATION ATTAINED LEARNING TO SPIN, WEAVE, AND SEW. OLDER STUDENTS OF BOTH SEXES  WERE EXTREMELY TIMID. WITHIN 4 MONTHS, MIXTECAN CHILDREN KNEW THE RUDIMENTS OF READING AND WRITING, AND WITHIN 9 MONTHS MOST CHILDREN COULD READ AND WRITE THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AND SPANISH. THESE RESULTS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO TEACHERS WHO WERE FAMILIAR WITH LOCAL CULTURAL PATTERNS, AND TO PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED PRIMERS THAT RELATED LESSON MATERIAL TO THE CHILDREN'S DAILY LIVES. AFTER 2 YEARS IN AN INSTITUTE SCHOOL, A CHILD COULD ENTER A SPANISH-LANGUAGE FEDERAL SCHOOL AT THE SECOND OR THIRD GRADE LEVEL.

IT IS REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT--(1) THE EDUCATOR'S PERSONAL ATTITUDE RATHER THAN THE METHODS HE EMPLOYS HAS THE LARGER IMPACT ON THE STUDENT, (2) THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND MADE MORE PERSONAL, (3) EMOTIONAL REACTION MUST BE REPLACED BY  CRITICAL THINKING ON THE PART OF FUTURE STUDENTS, (4) CREATIVE TEACHING MUST BE ENCOURAGED IF STUDENTS ARE TO BE PREPARED FOR A WORLD IN WHICH KNOWLEDGE WILL HAVE ADVANCED TO LEVELS WE CANNOT NOW PREDICT, AND (5) THE TRAINING OF LEADERS MUST BECOME THE BASIC STRATEGY IN THE PREPARATION OF YOUTH FOR WHATEVER MAY COME.

DYSLEXIA IS USUALLY DEDUCED FROM (1) GENETIC FINDINGS (FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE WITHIN FAMILIES, GREATER INCIDENCE AMONG BOYS), (2) BY A PROCESS OF ELIMINATING OTHER POSSIBLE CAUSES, (3) BY THE IDENTIFICATION OF SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS, AND (4) BY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SPECIAL METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. THE THEORY OF DEVELOPMENTAL IMMATURITY IS BASED ON FOUR INTERRELATED ASPECTS OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES-- NORMALITY, VARIABILITY, COVARIABILITY, AND VELOCITY. IN THIS VIEW, READING  RETARDATION IS EXPLAINED AS AN ACCUMULATION OF SPECIFIC DIFICITS IN TRAIT PERFORMANCE.

THE STUDY ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOME RANGE OF DIFFICULTY MAXIMIZED THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION STUDENTS GAIN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF READING INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. IN ORDER TO FORM 129 PAIRS ACCORDING TO READING ABILITY, STUDENTS RANGING FROM GRADE 3 THROUGH GRADUATE LEVEL WERE GIVEN A CLOZE TEST. ONE MEMBER OF EACH PAIR WAS GIVEN A CLOZE READABILITY TEST OVER A PASSAGE TO DETERMINE THE DIFFICULTY OF THE PASSAGE FOR THAT PAIR. THE OTHER MEMBER OF THE PAIR DETERMINED HOW MUCH INFORMATION THAT PAIR GAINED BY READING THE PASSAGE. HE FIRST GUESSED THE ANSWERS TO A MULTIPLE CHOICE TEST AND THEN READ THE PASSAGE AND TOOK THE SAME TEST  AGAIN. INFORMATION GAIN WAS DETERMINED BY SUBTRACTING THE SCORE OF HIS FIRST TEST FROM THE SCORE OF THE SECOND. IT APPEARED FROM THE DATA OBTAINED THAT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH FAIRLY DEFINITE STANDARDS OF WHAT IS A SUITABLE PASSAGE FOR USE BY A CHILD.

THE FOUR APPROACHES USED WERE (1) A BASAL READER PROGRAM PUBLISHED BY SCOTT, FORESMAN AND CO. (1962), (2) A PHONIC PROGRAM UTILIZING CORRELATED FILMSTRIPS PUBLISHED BY J.B. LIPPINCOTT CO. (1963), (3) A COMBINATION USING SCOTT, FORESMAN'S MATERIALS SUPPLEMENTED WITH PHONIC BOOKLETS (PHONICS AND WORD POWER) PUBLISHED BY AMERICAN EDUCATION PUBLICATIONS, INC. (1964), AND (4) A LANGUAGE ARTS APPROACH USING THE INITIAL TEACHING ALPHABET (1963). AFTER THE PUPILS IN THIS GROUP MADE THE TRANSITION TO TRADITIONAL ORTHOGRAPHY, THE TREASURY OF LITERATURE SERIES PUBLISHED BY CHARLES E. MERRILL (1960) WAS USED. IN ADDITION, WIDE INDEPENDENT READING WAS  ENCOURAGED IN ALL FOUR GROUPS. THE STANFORD ACHIEVEMENT TEST AND THE GILMORE ORAL READING TEST WERE USED AS PRIMARY MEANS OF EVALUATION FOR THE STUDY. RESULTS ON THESE TESTS SHOWED THAT IN GENERAL THE LIPPINCOTT AND I/T/A-LIPPINCOTT PROGRAM MIGHT BE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND FUTURE STUDY.

THE UTILITY FUNCTION IS DEVELOPED IN TERMS OF THE OUTPUT OF AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM DEFINED AS THE LIFE-CYCLE PRODUCTIVE OUTPUT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EDUCATIONAL  EXPERIENCE FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THE SYSTEM. THE CRITERION OF PERFORMANCE ESTABLISHED WAS THAT THE SYSTEM SHOULD OPERATE SO AS TO MAXIMIZE THE WORTH OF THE EXPECTED LIFE-CYCLE PRODUCTIVE OUTPUT OF ALL THOSE EDUCATED IN THE SYSTEM.

PART 1 OF THE PAPER DEVELOPS SUPPORT FOR THE ASSERTION THAT THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN CLASSROOM PRACTICES ARE REINFORCING TO THE STUDENT AND TEACHER ALIKE, WHILE THEIR LONG-TERM WEAKNESSES ARE NOT SEEN, AND THE PRACTICES THEREFORE FLOURISH. MANY CURRENT INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES ARE ANALYZED AND SERIOUS QUESTIONS ARE RAISED AS TO THE LIMITED USE WHICH IS MADE IN TEACHER PREPARATION AND IN CLASSROOM PRACTICE OF THE KNOWLEDGE AVAILABLE ON THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IN LEARNING AND TEACHING. PART 2 DISCUSSES INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES WHICH THE AUTHOR BELIEVES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVE SCIENCE INSTRUCTION. THE  DESIRABILITY OF IDENTIFYING AND DEFINING TERMINAL BEHAVIORS AND THE UTILIZATION OF PROGRAMED INSTRUCTION IN ATTAINING THESE OUTCOMES ARE ELABORATED. CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT AND THE UTILIZATION OF VARIOUS FORMS OF REINFORCEMENT ARE RELATED TO THEIR EFFECT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF DESIRED STUDENT BEHAVIORS.

AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP OF 36 CHILDREN HEARD AND RECITED 8- TO 10-MINUTE TAPES OF POEMS, SONGS, AND SPEECH GAMES, WHILE 36 CHILDREN IN A CONTROL GROUP WERE INSTRUCTED IN STANDARD ENGLISH BY MORE TRADITIONAL METHODS. EACH CHILD WAS GIVEN A TAPED ORAL INTERVIEW AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE EXPERIMENTAL SCHOOL YEAR. DEVIATIONS FROM THE STANDARD DIALECT WERE COUNTED AND TABULATED BY IMPARTIAL SPEECH CORRECTIONISTS, AND THESE SCORES WERE SUBMITTED TO THE TEST OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE-COVARIANCE. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP'S IMPROVEMENT IN THE USE OF STANDARD ENGLISH SOUNDS AND PATTERNS OVER  THAT OF THE CONTROL GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANT AT THE .05 LEVEL, AND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE COULD NOT BE ASCRIBED TO SEX, THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THE PARENTS, THE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES OF THE THREE PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS, OR THE MENTAL ABILITIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN.

THE VERBALIZATION OF BOTH PERSONAL AND VICARIOUS EXPERIENCE MAKES US REEVALUATE AND RESTRUCTURE OUR REPRESENTATIONS OF REALITY. IF WE ARE TO EXPAND THE CHILD'S ABILITY TO DEVELOP COMPLEX AND EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATIONS OF REALITY, WE MUST, THEN, ENCOURAGE HIM MORE NOT ONLY TO WRITE EXPRESSIVELY, POETICALLY, AND LITERALLY, BUT ALSO TO TALK AND VERBALIZE IN THE CLASSROOM. THE VERY EXPERIENCE OF VERBALIZATION, COMBINED WITH ACTIVITY, IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR THE CHILD, AND A WAY OF GAINING CONTROL OVER A LARGER AND LARGER FRAME OF REFERENCE AND  OF DEVELOPING HIS POTENTIAL FOR AN EXPANSIVE, PERCEPTIVE, AND INTELLIGENT LIFE.

OBJECTIVES WERE TO WORK WITH UNIVERSITIES IN PREPARING IN-SERVICE COURSES FOR TEACHERS OF ALL SUBJECTS AND GRADE LEVELS, TO TRAIN PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS AS IN-SERVICE EDUCATION INSTRUCTORS, AND TO FIND METHODS OF EVALUATING THE COURSES. TEACHERS IN ADJACENT SCHOOL SYSTEMS WERE INVITED TO ATTEND THE COURSES, AND, LATER, THE PORTLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT ORGANIZATION WAS DECENTRALIZED, IMPROVING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TEACHERS AND DIRECTORS AND THUS INCREASING PROGRAM PARTICIPATION. UNCOVERED IN PLANNING THE COURSES WAS THE DIFFICULTY THAT TEACHERS EXHIBITED IN DEFINING COURSE OBJECTIVES. TO HELP ELIMINATE THIS PROBLEM, A FORM WAS DESIGNED FOR  RECORDING OBJECTIVES AND LEARNING EXPERIENCES. EVALUATION OF THE COURSES WAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE TESTING AND WRITTEN COMMENTS OF TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.

Data concerning 5,705 Catholic high school seniors in the Cleveland diocese were gathered. Through the demographic data, students were grouped as Northern, Central, and Southern Europeans. Students were also grouped as &quot;newcomers&quot; or &quot;oldtimers&quot; according to recency of family immigration. These Catholic seniors were compared to 7,129 public high school seniors on six standardized achievement tests. Catholic seniors achieved significantly higher on the tests dealing with process and understanding of the scientific enterprise, and with making inferences and  assumptions across lines of convergent and divergent thinking. Public high school seniors achieved significantly higher on the test of recall of science concepts. Among the Catholic groups compared, significantly higher levels of performance are associated with Northern European college-bound students whose families have resided in America for more than two generations.

An &quot;ESS hierarchy&quot; was developed from an analysis of the ESS units, and the resulting behavioral statements were organized into seven levels according to criteria used in Science -A Process Approach. This effort also resulted in the development of an experimental process measure for ESS. Twenty-one teachers administered the revised process measure and content test to their classes during the year 1966-67. The process measure was administered to five children in each of 11 classrooms before they studied the ESS units. This same process measure was again administered toward the end  of the year in 16 classrooms to different students also randomly selected. A content test was also administered at this time to these same students. An improvement in performance after studying the ESS units is indicated as measured in terms of transfer to another context and as transfer within the behavioral hierarchy or between learning sets. Gains on the content test were not significant. (BC)",

The material in this part of the course proceeds from simple understandings of circuits to the progressively more complex functional units. Early emphasis is placed on basic properties underlying digital circuits such as simple inverters and gates. The interconnection of these gates to perform simple logic functions is illustrated by detailed consideration of useful typical logic modules. The introduction of flip-flops then leads to sequential circuits such as registers, counters, and A-D and D-A converters. Interconnection of these sequential circuits leads to consideration of larger functional units. With  the student now understanding the operations and properties of the basic functional units, he is ready to proceed to Part II, Digital Subsystem Design. Part II of the course is subdivided into two sections: (1) Design Principles and Procedures, and (2) Examples of Digital Subsystem Design. Section One contains a detailed outline of the many considerations in digital subsystem design and concluded by outlining a general design procedure. Section Two contains a graded set of examples of digital subsystems. A reference section is provided for each part of the course. (BC)",

The test consists of 96 multiple-choice questions and requires an actual testing time of 73 minutes. Scoring of the instrument yields a total score and eight sub-scores, one for each process. The test was initially administered to 3,673 students in the state of New York representing all ranges of ability and socio-economic background. Norms are reported by grade, sex, urban versus suburban and for the total sample within each grade. There is  evidence of both content and curricular validity of the test.

Three salient variables were posited: the teacher's behavior, the subject matter before the class, and the composition of the student population in the class. Three situations were found where each of these influences could vary while the other two could be controlled. The  differences in number of discipline acts by teachers were tested by chi square. Although the number of classroom teachers and classroom situations observed was small, evidence was found that some teachers promote discipline problems through their own behaviors. It was also found that teachers tend to behave consistently: Teachers who employ a high number of acts of discipline with one class tend to do so with another, and teachers who tend to use no or few acts of discipline maintain that behavior when dealing with different classes and:or different subject matter. It is hoped that this pilot study will be replicated with larger numbers of teachers and that other relevant factors will also be researched. (Author/SG)",

A background appraisal, provided as a context in which to view the new organization, takes the form of a paralleled itemization of the functions of the elementary school today and in the decades ahead. The functions are divided into three categories: the instructional system; preservice and inservice education; and innovation, development, and research. The formal structure of the multiunit plan is described as an organizational hierarchy operating at three levels: (1) at the classroom level, Instructional and Research (I &amp; R) units consisting of a unit leader, two or more regular  staff teachers, one or more aides or secretaries, and in some cases an intern; (2) at the building level, the Instructional Improvement Committee (principal and unit leaders); (3) at the systemwide level, the Policy Committee (all staff personnel) chaired by the superintendent or his designee. Operational procedures for the three units are described, and job descriptions are detailed for the principal, unit leader, teacher, intern, and instructional secretary and teacher aides. Implications of the multiunit approach are discussed with reference to individually-guided education, teacher education, and research and development. (JS)",

Some objectives (the theoretical basis) should be drawn from the behavioral sciences and then tested practically and refined. The laboratory, through the teacher in charge, must provide numerous and varied learning experiences for the student teacher; a learning experience allows the student teacher to perceive his own behavior in relation to a teaching situation, to modify that behavior if necessary, and to perceive the consequences of his decisions. The responsibility of the teacher in charge is to help in the analysis of these experiences rather than to dictate the responses of the student teacher and to encourage self-confidence and  dignity through his own behavior. Through such laboratory training, the student teacher should grow in his ability and confidence to make decisions and in his understanding of his role as a teacher.

The basic strategy essential to such services is the development of differentiated staffing patterns which will allow any given school district to meet its needs in terms of available resources. Priority tasks required for differentiating the profession include (1) collecting, organizing, storing, and disseminating all necessary information (especially role definitions and staffing pattern models) and (2) utilizing this information to create a favorable climate for change. Other recommended actions include reform of pre- and inservice teacher education  and re-education of teacher educators; identification of a large manpower pool; cooperation among educational agencies; and provision of financial and consultative assistance to project developers. (The report includes three appendixes: (1) lists of anticipated benefits (for students, teachers, and the public) of differentiated staffing structure; (2) an example of a differentiated staffing pattern model with task analysis for the positions of professional specialist, learning engineer, staff teacher, academic assistant, and technical assistant; and (3) a list of problem areas needing priority attention.

Interns were randomly assigned to four training groups each of which received typescripts from the 1953 McCarthy investigations which were to be used the next day in developing pupil \"translation\" behaviors during class discussion of the typescripts. The four treatments were (1) unstructured discussion of the material, (2) oral instruction in the use of teacher translation tactics relative to the material, (3) videotaped demonstration of teacher translation tactics being used to develop pupil oral translations of the material, (4) combination of the oral instruction and the videotaped  demonstration. Audiotape recordings of the interns teaching the McCarthy lesson provided data for measuring pupil oral translation and seven teacher translation tactics; written tests given at the end of the period provided a measure of pupil translation ability. Two independent raters scored the tapes and tests. Analyses of variance and the Kruskal-Wallis test of results indicated that treatment 1 was significantly inferior to the others, and the Newman-Keuls test indicated significant differences (.05 level) between treatment 4 and treatments 2 and 3, favoring the combination treatment.

        "description":"A project was undertaken to develop and validate a method of assessing teacher competence through the use of pupil performance tests. Teachers were given a list of specific, operationally defined objectives for a particular topic and directed to teach the objectives. Teacher competence was judged in relationship to the way their students performed on pre- and posttests of behaviors stated in the objectives. An attempt to validate this method of measuring teacher effectiveness involved contrasting the results produced by experienced teachers and nonteachers (28 pairs teaching a 10-hour auto mechanics unit and 16 pairs teaching a 10-hour electronics unit to high school industrial arts classes). Calculations of mean and standard deviation, internal consistency coefficients,  intercorrelations between a number of variables, and analyses of covariance between pupil scores and interest revealed no significant differences between the teachers and nonteachers. Results (which confirmed those of an earlier study using social science classes) were interpreted as indicating that the experienced teacher is not more experienced than the nonteacher in modifying learner behavior in terms of previously established instructional objectives. Findings do not, however, refute the basic assumption that performance test measures are presently the most serviceable legitimate indices of teaching proficiency. (Related to ED 013 242, BR-5-0566.)

Problems of both the disadvantaged student and his teacher are explained generally in categories, such as culture shock, and more particularly in a few teacher experiences, with the goal of convincing educators that special teacher training is needed and that it is the responsibility of the school to reach out to understand the community and student, to be flexible in its programs, and to generate a better social order where the community has failed. Three areas  for teacher training improvement recurred through the speeches: understanding the student and his potential, as in teacher training in the disadvantaged environment and exposure to already successful programs; implementing this understanding through continued supervisory help in inservice teaching and knowledge of how to individualize instruction creatively; and teacher recognition of his own reactions and feelings through participation in such activities as T Groups.

The middle sections, describing the professors' perceptions of their pupils and, at greater length, episodes in teaching and learning, include insights by professors about their pupils in  positive terms, and about the need to activate the student through the use of spontaneous, flexible teaching and pertinent subject matter. The final sections are composed of implications for teacher education derived by the professors from their experiences, including the need for education about language usage and structure within the entire teaching profession, for practicum experience, for a thorough knowledge of the subject matter, and for closer contact between professors and teachers in public schools.

Thirty-four high and low scorers on the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale were selected from a group of teachers untrained in interaction analysis and were asked to record on tape six 20-minute segments of regular class sessions, which were then analyzed using the Flanders system of interaction analysis. Findings show that under actual teaching conditions closedminded teachers, as compared to openminded teachers, tend to monopolize classroom talk through a variety of verbal  behaviors and therefore seem excessively concerned with classroom control (their students talk less), an interpretation which may account for the lack of difference between open- and closedminded teachers in their use of indirect influence. This interpretation is based on the supposition that the Flanders system confuses verbal behaviors used for control with those used for indirect influence. Because of this apparent limitation of the Flanders system, and the study's other findings concerning the apparent influence of control, the conclusions of the previous study are questionable.

        "description":"From the point of view of the consumer, there is too much of a consumer-producer dichotomy in teacher education. Four distinct hopes and dreams, all interrelated, constitute selected aspects of this problem. First, teacher education should become a joint endeavor between inservice teachers and teacher educators possibly through the implementation of standards boards to encourage research, testing, and dissemination in the major problem areas of teaching. Second, teacher education should become an educational continuum in selection, initial preparation, induction into the profession, and graduate and continuing education by allowing inservice teachers to control their own continuing education, by encouraging local boards to contract with teacher education institutions for the  establishment of new career programs for the disadvantaged, and by a reorganization of the certification process. Third, teacher education should be individualized and should emphasize sensitivity. Fourth, systematic orientation and induction of prospective teachers into teaching should be developed through the study of the sociology of the teaching profession in terms of essential teaching tasks or abilities. The youth of today, better educated, more sensitive, and more concerned, should be involved in the solving of these problems. (SM)",

To combat these problems, a 2 -year curriculum was devised to include &quot;hooker courses&quot; (courses relevant to social and minority  group problems designed to stimulate interest in formal education) offered on military bases, and &quot;action courses&quot; (courses which immediately place students in field situations) given on the Webster campus in conjunction with special interest courses which are integrated into the undergraduate curriculums leading to certification.

On group supervised itself using videotape and Flanders' system of interaction analysis; another group was supervised in a more traditional manner (supervisor present). The two remaining groups experienced both self-supervision and teacher supervision. Upon program completion the MTAI was retaken (in one group retesting was at delayed intervals). Analysis of variance indicated the following: (1) No significant relationship exists between  attitudes and teaching behavior before supervisory treatment. (2) Supervisory treatment tends to promote a significant relationship between attitudes and teaching behavior. (3) Self-supervision tends to promote indirect teaching and higher MTAI scores. (4) Estimated by student teachers of the precentage of indirect teaching they exhibit in their lessons are very inaccurate under both traditional and self-supervision.

Phase II data was statistically analyzed and  compared with data from Phase III in which 100 Phase II subjects, then first-year teachers, and 100 experienced teachers were evaluated. Data analysis in Phase IV revealed: predictable interrelationships among teacher beliefs, teacher competence, observer descriptions, and observer-judge beliefs; belief gaps between colleges of education and public schools; and theory-practice discrepancies in teachers and observer-judges.

Sections on rationale present (1) inferences about elementary school teaching drawn from predictions for society and for education by 1976 and (2) a task analysis of teaching which isolates five essential teaching behaviors upon which the total program is based: formulating objectives, selecting and organizing content, instructional strategies, evaluation skills, and professional responsibilities. The major sections present curriculum specifications for (1) the underclass phase (general education and preprofessional studies); (2) the preservice phase (program  components for each of the five essential teaching behaviors); (3) the inservice phase (field work and on-campus programs); and (4) a specialization dimension allowing for emphases on different age groups, academic subjects, and differentiated teaching functions. Sections on the facilitating components present specifications for (1) an admissions and screening system reflective of teaching performance criteria, (2) a computerized management control system, and (3) a faculty development and utilization program to provide retraining for new roles.

Part 1 contains introductory chapters which present definitions of terms, a brief description of the program, and general considerations of innovation and change in teacher education. Part 2 includes chapters describing the creation of school-university centers of inquiry (the basic prerequisite of the program); the use of the democratic method and differentiation of instruction (within the concept of group inquiry) as models through which the program is developed; and the development of a contact laboratory for training experiences with children and schools. Part 3 (the  body of the report) consists of descriptions of the four basic components (derived from basic teaching processes) of the program: interactive teaching (using teaching strategies and decisionmaking skills); institution-building (developing an innovative organizational climate); innovating (developing teacher spontaneity and flexibility); and continuing teacher scholarship (studying the teaching-learning process and the learning ability of children). Descriptions of possible implementation and evaluation problems and procedures are presented in Part 4. Source papers for each component are included. ED 018 677 is a related document. (SM)",

        "description":"One hundred and forty secondary teacher candidates who were enrolled in a first course in teaching were the subjects of a seven-week study to determine the effects of microteaching in a Teaching Laboratory (TL) on verbal behaviors. All students taught a 10-minute pretest prior to the start of the study and then were divided into two groups. Group A students (85) taught five- to eight-minute TL lessons with feedback and subsequent reteach lessons in two cycles (emphasizing clarification of instructional objectives and interaction). Group B students (55) had no direct teaching experience. At the end of the seven-week period, all students taught a 10-minute posttest. When both sessions were measured using the Laboratory Observation Schedule and Record (LOScAR) and when data obtained  were subjected to analysis of covariance, results indicated that teaching candidates' verbal behaviors can be modified in a TL. Adjusted group means showed statistically significant differences in 17 of the 22 variables of the LOScAR favoring group A. (A 16-item bibliography is included.) (SM)",

        "description":"Four historical studies, carried out under the direction of Professor Raven I. McDavid and reported in this monograph, trace the various attitudes toward language study expressed in the journals (1911-63) of the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE). For the years between 1911 and 1929, Betty Gawthrop reports a cautious questioning of the usefulness of &quot;textbook rules&quot; and of British Received Standard pronunciation before the introduction and tentative acceptance of linguistics. C. Michael Lightner points out that the NCTE was hospitable to research and change, defended a descriptive approach to the study of grammar, and was responsible for the publication of four major investigations of grammar between 1930 and 1945. Doris C. Meyers indicates that from 1945 to 1954  contributors to NCTE publications deplored the disparity between advanced grammatical theory and actual language instruction, resisted pressures to de-emphasize English in the curriculum, debated language permissiveness, and urged language research. In the final study, Geraldine Russell reports that from 1955 to 1963 the importance of levels of usage was generally recognized and a de-emphasis of grammar gave way to a new interest in linguistics, in reformed traditional grammar, and in generative grammar.

Two factors contributing to the concept of a \"new\" discipline are a revival of interest in classical rhetoric and the development of new approaches to rhetoric based on information from related disciplines. Basic among the current problems is the tendency to confuse the rhetoric that is a theoretical study of discourse (including subjects like logic, semantics, linguistics, and psychology) with the rhetoric that is a summary of precepts about writing and speaking. A teaching rhetoric should differ from either of these in that it must attempt to describe the choices  available to a writer, explain the effects of the different choices, and, at the same time, be comprehensive enough to take account of all aspects of composition. More emphasis on rehtoric is needed in the training of teachers at all levels. (LH)",

However, the integration of film and literature, in which students can see how each medium functions, seems most viable. Films and literature are similar in that they both are part of the humanities, both are oriented toward content, and both offer entertainment; the two media differ in that films deal with action whereas literature emphasizes thought and abstraction, and also in that film conveys time by the manipulation of space while literature conveys it by the use of tense. The complementary aspects of literature and film can best be illustrated by a thematic  approach--e.g., a study of man's interaction with machines, in which works of film and literature consider man in the absence of machines and in positive or negative relationships with machines. Such a thematic approach (perhaps combined with experience in actually making filsm) helps students to better understand the problems and limitations of both film and literature. (LH)",

A developing country must have a national language, whether English or native, to achieve (1) national unity, (2) contacts with other nations, and (3) an effective educational system. Due to contacts with English-speaking countries and the information available in English-language books and journals, over a dozen African nations have adopted English as the major language or as a second language. The future educational and economic growth of many parts of Africa may lie in the ability of the citizens to master English  thoroughly. The imposition of a new language, however, must be handled carefully, for the language native to a particular group seems to symbolize the distinctiveness of the group; its history, traditions, rituals, and politics are preserved in the richness of the language. The full expression of the African personality may require that a delicate balance be maintained between the vernacular and English. (LH)",

Because subject matter is regarded as the fundamental means of affecting the students' self images, the course emphasizes humanistic content with special weight on man's development within a society and his use of language. Six units varying from eight to 12 periods in length are used: \"Man as a Creature with Potential,\"\"The Individual in Society,\"\"Man as Part of a Social  Group,\"\"The Individual in the Renaissance World,\"\"Man in a Scientific and Technological World,\" and a general unit intended to culminate the year's work (objectives, techniques, and materials are suggested for each unit). Although only slight change has been noted in students under the new curriculum, the quantity and quality of questions they ask indicate that the course is beginning to affect their aspirations and self-awareness.

        "description":"Although humanities courses in secondary schools can be used to introduce valuable curricular and pedagogical reforms, certain dangers are inherent in such courses: (1) the superficiality of the \"Great Works\" course organization which stresses broad coverage rather than depth of understanding, (2) the neglect or loss of distinctions between disciplines, (3) prescriptive teaching--e.g., telling students what to find in literature rather than allowing them to make their own discoveries, (4) the treatment of imaginative works as sociological documents, and (5) the tendency to read literature for its ideas, or to equate the value of a literary work with the value of the ideas found in it. There is no one model for a good humanities course, but the better courses arouse a student's  interest in the arts for their own sake, encourage his desire to master new sets of intellectual skills, and exploit the particular talents and resources of school and community.

        "description":"An evaluation team, funded by a Title III/ESEA grant, considered the success of the 1967-68 Dramatics Enrichment Program conducted in selected secondary school systems in Kentucky. Eight test instruments were used to evaluate 900 students who attended four plays as a class activity and who received copies of the plays, study guides, and special classroom instruction before and after viewing each play. The following conclusions were reached: (1) Dramatic experiences are important to American secondary students of all levels and abilities, who regularly assimilate and personalize dramatic content. (2) Adequate instruments for evaluating the effects of educational experiences on students' attitudes and values are not presently available. (3) Inservice programs for upgrading and  extending teachers' backgrounds in drama can be effectively implemented through a Dramatics Enrichment Program. (4) The difference between academic and theatrical interpretations of plays can prompt discussions and consequent involvement for both students and teachers; indicate important principles of theater, literature, and education; and guide students in making individual evaluations of art forms.

The conclusions reached were based on surveys of existing programs and the duties of present specialists. It was decided that the doctoral program should prepare recipients of the degree to become supervisors of English programs in elementary and secondary schools, to teach English methods courses in Colleges, to supervise student teachers, and to carry out and direct research. As background for admission, a candidate should have an understanding of the social and behavioral sciences, a fourth-year  college-level knowledge of one foreign language and its literature, and at least 2 years' teaching experience at the elementary or secondary level. Administered by a department of education, of English, or both, the program should require the equivalent of 96 semester hours distributed as follows: (1) English composition, language, literature (50% of the work), (2) courses in English Education, e.g., the history of the teaching of English (25%), and (3) practicum experiences in teaching methods courses and writing a dissertation (25%).

The major portion of the report is comprised of the unit for grade 7 which establishes a definition of language and introduces the concept that language is a coded system of learned, conventional oral symbols. Lectures, inductive questions, exercises, and such materials as Helen  Keller's autobiography and Lewis Carroll's &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; are used to help students perceive the basic characteristics of spoken language, its possible origins, its personal and social importance, how it is learned, and how it both resembles and differs from other coded systems and from communication among animals.

Among the specific objectives of the Center were (1) the identification and analysis of the concepts appropriate to grades 7-12, (2) the preparation of curricular materials and study guides for teachers, (3) the education of selected teachers to use the study guides, and (4) the establishment of field tests for evaluation of the materials. The materials were first tested by 166 teachers throughout the state; later, three schools were selected as demonstration centers. Results indicated that the Project English materials engender interest in many kinds of curriculum reform, that the language-centered curriculum has become  widely accepted, and that a curriculum should be considered a process rather than a finished product. A study is underway which provides a pilot test for the effect of the materials on student performance by determining the value and validity of a test of &quot;linguistic sensitivity&quot; developed by members of the Center staff.

Exercises and lectures on historical background are provided to help students realize that our spelling system is based on late Middle English spelling, that differences in Middle English dialects caused corresponding differences in spelling, that the invention of printing had an influence on stabilizing spelling, and that later changes in pronunciation as well as borrowings from other languages have caused irregularities. In addition, students are helped to understand that English has 46 phonemes but only 26 graphemes and that the system can be divided into regular, semi-regular, and  irregular spellings. Finally, through selected readings, spelling reform is presented as impractical because of the continuing changes in pronunciation, the cultural readjustment that would be required, and the prohibitive expense in reprinting.

In addition, drills are designed to give the student insights into computer programming and, possibly, into the human thought process. Concepts emphasized in the second unit are (1) that the extension of reference of nouns is affected by the  determiner as well as by the semantic content of the noun itself, (2) that the transformational rules applicable to subject-verb agreement are similar to those that operate in the formation of the passive, (3) that the transformational rules may differ from dialect to dialect, and (4) that the phonological rules governing number are related primarily to the subject of the sentence while those governing intonation pertain to the entire sentence.

The survey begins by examining excerpts from Aristotle and Dionysius Thrax to show the Greek grammarian's concern for logic and rhetorical analysis. Next, the 18th-century desire for the purification and preservation of language is revealed by excerpts from Dr. Johnson, Robert Lowth, and others. Nineteenth-century historical and  comparative studies are represented by excerpts from T. R. Lounsbury and Fitzedward Hall, while the concern of the Victorian middle classes for &quot;proper usage&quot; is illustrated by excerpts from &quot;McGuffey's Readers.&quot; Current interest in transformational theory is discussed with references to the work of Robert S.

        "description":"Thirty-seven secondary and four college English teachers in Maine participated in research on a two-fold problem: late adolescents' indifference to writing and their typically superficial themes. The secondary teachers planned 12th-grade writing sequences integrating the study of composition and literature and relating it to problems of immediate adolescent concern. They used these sequences in their college preparatory classes. The next year, two sections of Freshman Composition, composed equally of students from the senior high experimental classes and from control classes, used the same approach to literature on a more sophisticated level. At the end of the secondary school phase, the compositions of students in the classes using the writing sequences showed better  organization, spelling, and word sensitivity than the compositions of other seniors; at the conclusion of the college phase, the students having had exposure to the experimental curriculum in both high school and college again demonstrated superiority in written composition over students having had only half or none of the curriculum. The findings indicated that such a coordinated program integrating the secondary and the college English courses can accelerate students' abilities to understand, to analyze, and to communicate increasingly complex ideas.

The test consists of phrases of concert-type music paired with versions of these same phrases in which one element--rhythm, melody, or harmony--has been altered. For the study, 4,412 subjects--American students in grades 5-12, British students in forms 1-6, college students (music and non-music majors), and an adult women's chorus--were given the test and asked to fill out an inventory of their music experience and training. When possible, information concerning I.Q., achievement-test scores, and school achievement was secured from school  records. Analysis of the data suggested that piano experience, band/orchestra experience, and school achievement are related to music discrimination and that school music programs which are performan3e-oriented help to develop the musical tastes of youth. (Charts are included which present norms for the test and the correlation coefficients computed between music discrimination as measured by the Indiana-Oregon test and various factors of environment, music experience, and training.)

Studies show that parent involvement in the schools enhances children's development and academic achievement. The invidious sense of powerlessness felt by minority group parents and children in dealing with such middle class institutions as the schools would be lessened if they actively participated in the decisions affecting a significant part of their lives. Concomitantly, an improved self concept and greater sense of fate control, leading to changes in the child's aspirations, attitudes, and motivation, would increase  academic achievement. Moreover, strengthening the integrity of the neighborhood school and the community would also serve to enhance child development. The minority group child's heightened self worth and sense of control over his destiny (mentioned in the Coleman Report as such an important element in school success) would be encouraged by his awareness of the participation of parents and community groups in effecting changes in educational policy and programs.

Data were collected through interviews with 12- to 16-year-old lower class students in New York City and Baltimore. The 110 students on whom the findings are based were divided into four groups by social class and type of school attended. Interviews covered students' aspirations, attitudes, perception of parental expectations, and interpersonal competence. Data revealed that lower class students do not find the norms and attitudes of their homes and their schools in conflict. It was found, however, that the academically unsuccessful lower class group was less socially competent than the others. This variable did not  correlate with socioeconomic status; data suggested that it may be a psychological variable dialectically but not deterministically related to social class. (EF)",

Firms to be included in the study were selected on a non-random basis to obtain maximum geographical, industrial, and labor force coverage. Data represent 1,218 firms from private industry which includes 49 percent of the Michigan wage and salary workers as of January 1966. There is general agreement among employers that the need for technicians will increase substantially during the next  few years and that there is a present unmet need in virtually every classification. The major source of technicians is the up-grading of existing employees. Only recently have employers recognized community colleges and technical institutes as sources of technicians; however, the enrollments here will not meet employers' manpower needs.

The purpose of Phase II was to increase teacher effectiveness in encouraging self-exploration and developing judgement and decision-making skills in students. General approaches followed were (1) consideration of instructional content and methods appropriate to the career development of the distributive education student, and (2) group experiences designed to focus on the career and personal development of the coordinators and distributive teachers enrolled in the workshop.

Fiftee n graduating seniors from local schools were selected for the demonstration class. The program was evaluated through: (1) studies of behavioral and performance change during the time the teacher was enrolled in the training program, (2) the effect on the career and self-development of the participant in the demonstration class, and (3) the quality of teaching materials that were developed.

This question and other related ones will be considered in the study of which this paper is a preliminary report. To specify norms and to consider the structure of relations in a set of norms, nursing students' prescriptions of what various kinds of personnel in a hospital should do were studied. At different stages in their educational programs, 129 students (alphas) who had already completed a 4-year liberal arts program, and 53 students who were in the process (betas) responded to questionnaires which listed tasks and requested indications of who generally does and who should do each task. Extensive data include the following findings: (1) a trend toward the classification of tasks by the respondents as  intern tasks, professional nursing tasks, and technical nursing tasks, (2) a preponderance of do-responses over should-responses, and (3) greater imputation by alphas than betas of both performance of tasks and obligation to perform them to nursing students and staff nurses. It was suggested that the study of the relatively trivial prescription might be useful in the study of socialization, as a methodological exercise, and a means of generating hypotheses, as well as for the substantive relationship of the prescriptions to the professional development of the student.

It gives high school graduates, primarily from vocational and industrial arts education programs, as well as technical institute graduates, an opportunity to combine a cooperative work experience in their chosen trade or occupation with an approved academic program. Upon completion of the prescribed program, individuals will receive appropriate teacher certification and will have earned the bachelor of science degree. The cooperative aspect of the offering and the formal university program are compatible in that university college courses are offered in the late afternoon and evening, leaving the student ample time to work in industry. The student is required to accrue a  minimum of 5,000 hours of approved work experience under supervision of a coordinator. Time spent learning the trade in either the high school or technical institute programs would be counted toward the 5,000 hours experience requirement. Upon completion of the minimum experience requirement, the student is required to pass an occupational competency examination. Details on recruitment, public relations, the students, entry requirements, coursework and recommendations are included. (CH)",

A principle objective of the study was to examine in some detail the changes in the characteristics of the labo r force during recent years in an attempt to estimate the target unemployment rate, that point where additional increases in demand would produce continuing inflation as a result of labor shortages. This was done by measuring the contribution to structural unemployment of skill shortages, regional demand patterns, and employability of youths and Negroes and by determining whether structural unemployment from these  sources had changed since 1953. It was concluded that 3.7 percent is the upper limit of a band of unemployment rates within which the borderline of conditions of significant labor shortages is located.

Interviews were conducted with 221 of the 463 agricultural enterprises, heavy industry, restaurant, and service industry businesses in the sample area. Some major findings were: (1) 55 percent of employers considered current programs inadequate, (2) Specialized jobs were identified for which very little training is available, (3) Current enrollments indicate a lack of emphasis in training for new specialized jobs, (4) Sales, mechanics, mathematics, supervisory, and food service areas are in need of improved curriculums in the opinion of employers, (5) Employers desired  that their employees have training in courtesy, manners, conversation and other related areas, (6) Employers were generally willing to provide some work experience for interested students, and (7) Employers indicated a need for increased communication among business, education, and students. Several recommendations were made, among them that education in the development of personality be offered and the aid of business be secured in providing training. (DM)",

The study extended from April 1967 to March 1968. It was concluded that some waste, duplication, and inefficiency existed in the nearly 30 separate federally supported job training programs but that these failures rarely vitiated the usefulness of the programs. Recommendations include: (1) formulation and codification of national manpower policy,  (2) provision for training of individuals receiving welfare benefits without penalization, (3) expansion of apprenticeship and efforts to assist the flow of qualified minority group applicants, (4) assurance that training prepares for entry into jobs with opportunity for advancemen t and for adequate income, (5) establishment of residential vocational education centers, (6) more adequate funding and arrangement to permit time for programing operations, (7) integration of training activities with the Department of Labor.

A post-secondary institution was paired with each secondary school selected, resulting in a sample of 11,649 administrators, counselors, and teachers. Some major findings were: (1) Vocational teachers worked longer hours with fewer students than academic teachers, (2) Changes recommended by teachers were a broad, general education in the high school, a narrower focus on job-related studies in the post-secondary  vocational and technical programs, and greater emphasis on mathematics and humanities in the junior college transfer programs, (3) A majority favored more intensive vocational guidance and training in junior high school and more part-time student employment, (4) most teachers recommended a single post-secondary institution embracing both academic and vocational programs, and (5) most respondents felt a combination high school program was feasible for all students if unnecessary requirements were eliminated.

The five main categories of individuals identified were: (1) the aged, (2) the physically handicapped, (3) the farm operator primarily oriented to non-farm opportunities, (4) the farm operator oriented to commercial agriculture, and (5) the farm operator oriented to subsistence agriculture. The characteristics of the core of low-income subsistence farmers who normally do not respond to either welfare or economic development efforts were examined in greater detail. It was found that they (1) retained traditional values  while having lost many traditional subsistence skills, (2) failed to respond to greater agricultural efficiency and productivity efforts because commercial success was not highly valued, (3) placed extreme emphasis on neighborliness and friendliness as their primary goals, and (4) must respond to an attempt to change prestige orientation if their cycle of poverty is to be broken.

An assessment was made of each test's ability to distinguish between experienced teachers and the non-teacher with respect to their ability to achieve pre-specified instructional objectives. All subjects, teachers and non-teachers, were given sets of operationally defined objectives. They attempted to achieve goals during an instructional period of approximately 10 hours. Pre- and post-tests based explicitly on the objectives were given to each subject's pupils, and average class achievement was used as the index of the teacher's proficiency.  Twenty-eight auto mechanics teachers and 28 non-teachers instructed over 1,200 pupils while 16 electronics and 16 non-teachers instructed over 700 pupils. Comparisons of pupil performance data revealed no systematic differences between the performance of the teacher and non-teacher group of either auto mechanics or electronics. These results were attributable to problems associated with the training of teachers as well as the reinforcement structures operating when they commenced training. (EM)",

In evaluating the results of the institute, the Programmer's Aptitude Test by the Psychological Corporation, New York, New York, was given at the beginning to establish each participant's aptitude in areas of numeric, verbal, and abstract reasoning relevant to programming. In addition, pretest and post-test scores were determined in the following areas: (1) business organization, (2) cost accounting, (3)  systems, (4) COBOL, and (5) FORTRAN. Class schedules, textbooks, and a teacher-participant evaluation are included. Success of the institute led to the following conclusions: (1) Competent data processing and computer programming instructors, including teachers from other disciplines, can be trained in two summer institutes, and (2) Their success can be predicted from aptitude tests.

The study included 699 machine graduates and 750 manual graduates from two 2-year colleges and 14 secondary schools. Results  indicated: (1) although the manual shorthand writers were slightly more successful, it was not due to major differences in curriculum offerings or educational background of the machine and manual writers, and (2) a blanket recommendation concerning the introduction of machine shorthand programs could not be made since the introduction of such programs should be considered on an individual school system basis, after close consideration of the group and the employment needs of the area.

The samples were usually drawn from rosters furnished by the relevant national organizations. The responses of each occupation to the SVIB were used to construct empirical scales. For each occupation, the scale contained the items that those women endorsed substantially  more often than women in general. All of these scales successfully separated the groups from women in general and from each other.

The first phase of the SCOPE program is Coordination of Occupational and Non-occupational Curriculums and Technology (CONECT). The objectives of this first phase are: (1) to establish communication among the state-supported vocational curriculum development centers, (2) to assist center directors in becoming aware of behavioral approaches to curriculum development, devices, and evaluation, (3) to refine and test a scheme  for classifying educational objectives in terms of performance requirements and objectives, and (4) to develop a detailed plan of activity for Phase II of the SCOPE program. These two progress reports outline major accomplishments and developments during the first two quarters of SCOPE's first year of existance. (CH)",

        "description":"Structural analysis is a systematic approach to curriculum development representing an attempt to organize terminal performance objectives for a unit of subject matter into a sequence of prerequisite competencies which must be satisfactorily mastered if successful terminal performance is to occur. The technique involves asking the question: \"What competencies must a person already possess in order to obtain a satisfactory performance level on some specified objective, given no instruction beyond those definitions specific to the objective in question?\" By asking this question of all identified competencies, a hierarchy of requisite competencies is generated which parallels the learning process appropriate to the final task. In preparing instructional materials, the hierarchy  provides the developer with a guide of what to cover and the sequence to follow. The following progression is forwarded for preparing instructional materials appropriate for a single specific competency: (1) goal statement, (2) definitions, (3) recall of prior knowledge, (4) integration, (5) demonstration, and (6) practice. Such an arrangement of competencies based on their contingent relationship further requires the consistent use of behavioral statements in the description of desired-end states and their prerequisite competencies.

In order to stimulate more  interest throughout the country in cooperative job-oriented education programs, the three dissemination seminars were held in urban areas having diverse groups of disadvantaged individuals. Leaders in private industry, the schools, and important civic action groups were brought together to consider the job-related problems of the disadvantaged in their own communities. This mix of seminar participants appears to have been productive of action because a number of significant steps toward new cooperative efforts in behalf of the disadvantaged have resulted from the seminars.

Trainees completed identical 23-item self-rating scales on their teaching ability on the first and last days of the institute; comparison of the mean pre- and postinstitute scores of each trainee showed a significant growth in their perceived teaching abilities. Also, a majority of the responses to a followup institute evaluation form (completed by both trainees and supervisors) were positive.

Physicians viewed videotape presentations in a local hospital over a period of four weeks, with three one hour sessions (distributed viewing) and a single three hour session (massed viewing). On the fifth week they completed a learning achievement test over televised instruction. The results indicated that attendance was significantly greater under massed than under distributed viewing, especially when the sessions took place in the evening rather than the morning.

The sample under study included all students enrolled in ten MDTA projects, representing a geographical cross section of Minnesota, training to be technicians, sales and clerical workers, and skilled workers. Data revealed many significant implications: student confidence and skills increased after training; a relatively large number dropped out of the technician and skilled programs; and a large number remained unemployed after the sales and clerical training. Employment counselors need to be aware of personal characteristics which lead to  success, and training should concentrate on work related attitudes. Attitudes and skill together are the best predictor of success, but more research should be done to validate these results with a larger study and to identify ways of improving attitudes during training.

All the programs stem from industry's awareness that to develop his full potential, a person needs to have a broad education rather than merely a specialty; the assumption is made that for many people, a liberal education is most profitable after years of a specialized job, rather than before, and a special, often residential, program must be  devised so that one can see liberal education in the context of one's daily life. The programs are noncredit, have few participants in order to encourage discussion, emphasize humanities and values, try to provide experiences greatly different from those of daily life, and have had difficulties in attempting followup and evaluation.

Liberal arts department chairmen, liberal arts deans, and evening deans were interviewed. In all but two institutions, evening program decisions were made in terms of day program values and objectives. In allocating faculty (largely part time and lower ranking) and in other decisions, means were used that suggested that evening programs had low priority. Because of ambiguity in the assignment of decision-making responsibility in some departments and evening colleges, much confusion, and sometimes conflict, existed. In evaluating evening programs, department  chairmen tended to favor similarity in quality (same curriculum, instruction, and measurement) and quantity (substantial offering in the discipline) to the day program, to use enrollment statistics as a measure of effectiveness, and to judge evening programs by their contribution to the fulfillment of conscious departmental objectives.

        "description":"In this part of the Kansas City Study of Adult Life, educational implications of adult activities and goals were explored, with emphasis on effective living in middle life. Performance of adult developmental tasks and motivation toward effort in these areas were investigated. Criteria were offered for assessing high, medium, and low performance in the roles of parent, spouse, child of aging parent, male or female homemaker, worker, user of leisure, church member, club or association member, citizen, and friend. Task performance showed little or no variation by sex, some by age, and much variation by upper middle, lower middle, upper lower, and lower socioeconomic status. Areas of highest motivation were parenthood, work, and leisure; lowest areas were citizenship, church  membership, and association membership. Because of generally high motivation and only moderate performance, middle class people appeared most receptive to adult education. A special challenge to adult educational outreach was seen in citizenship and other areas of low motivation and high social need. (An essay on contemporary adult education is included.) (ly)",

        "description":"At the Syracuse University Conference held at Sagamore, New York, and attended by leading adult educators, four papers focused on the latest research in the field of psychology, relevant to adult education. James E. Birren stated that while changes in physiological drive, speed, and perceptual acuity may limit the older individual's learning performance, other factors, such as special motivation, may facilitate it. In general, tests involving perceptual content show decrements with age whereas tests which allow for accumulated experience (such as vocabulary) show increments. And, it may be that the number of years out of school does affect one's expectancy to learn and ability to seek out the crucial elements in a learning situation. Bernice L. Neugarten stated that the  development of the ego is, for the first two-thirds of the life span, outward toward the environment; for the last part, inward toward the self. Raymond G. Kuhlen declared that motives may be changed during adulthood if the individual is exposed to a new set of punishment and rewards, or when changing needs must be met. W. J. McKeachie maintained that the adult education teacher must adjust his approach as he sizes up each class and receives feedback from them. (se).",

        "description":"The book records the development of the program of adult education and economic cooperation sponsored by St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. The program dates from 1853 when a Catholic theological school was established at Arichat. In 1855 the school was transferred to Antigonish, named St. Francis Xavier, enlarged and converted into a liberal arts college. By 1939, the faculty was known for its interest in the people of its constituency. S.F.X extension workers organized mass meetings and small classes enrolling farmers, miners, and factory workers in economically oriented adult education programs. The study clubs proved an adequate means for organizing labor and credit unions and economic cooperatives. Eventually, the people owned their own lobster  factories and marketing cooperatives; economic power of the masses was being achieved. Basic to the philosophy of the S.F.X. extension program was the belief that educational emphasis should be on the material and economic so that ultimately the common man would be free to devote his time and energies to cultural pursuits. Although the program repudiates Marxism, economic cooperatives are advocated, since they reward the members according to the people's creative and productive ability.

Much of the work of the project staff was inconclusive, and in many cases the data were insufficient. Some conclusions were: (1) an annual census-type survey in the area, combined with an input-output analysis conducted by the regional planning body, can eliminate the deficiency in reliable, disaggregate data; (2) the most important  form of poverty is the lack of formal education; (3) transportation facilities, racial discrimination, and lack of skills contribute to this lack; (4) poverty can as easily be identified by its effects as by its causes, and these effects contribute to a circular process of continuing poverty over time; and (5) private charitable groups are totally inadequate to the task of eliminating poverty, but the American economy is capable of supporting the anti-poverty effort while remaining affluent.

The Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) was administered to all teachers and administrators in the centers in response to these questions: &quot;How does the director behave,&quot; and &quot;How should the director behave.&quot; Twelve dimensions of leader behavior were measured. Tests of significance were computed for variance within and between groups. On all but three variables, teachers and directors basically agreed on how a director does behave. On directors' self descriptions, mean scores showed ideal leader behavior to be scaled higher than real leader behavior. Significant differences appeared on eight variables when  variance was analyzed using the self descriptions. Teacher expectations of directors' leader behavior tested for significance on ten variables. Teachers' standards, then, for leader behavior were consistently higher than teachers' perceptions of the directors' actual leader behavior.

        "description":"This was a pioneer empirical study of the effectiveness of residential and nonresidential adult education programs. Two similar courses in insurance fundamentals were given by the same instructor, for the same length of time, and with the same objectives. One eight day residential course for 60 participants was held at the Michigan State Kellogg Center for Continuing Education and the eight-day nonresidential course for 74 participants was held in Detroit. Three methods of testing achievement were used: an essay type quiz, measures of knowledge application, and state insurance test results, to measure combined knowledge acquisition and application. The central hypothesis tested was that residential instruction results in superior achievement. Also analyzed were attitudes toward  fellow students, instructors, and the program. Results tended to affirm the superiority of residential instruction and it has been suggested that the determinants are the combined effects of isolation, continuity, and group influence. Further research is needed to clarify such emerging problems as the possible influence of subject content, methodology, and prior experience. (ly)",

        "description":"Originally given at a conference for administrators in higher adult education, these papers by Corson, Clark, Volkart, Becker, Babbidge, and Blau examine processes of educational change in terms of the nature of universities, the role of faculty and administrators, student culture, sources of power and influence, and universities as formal organizations. Corson discusses common impediments to change. Using Antioch, Reed, and Swarthmore as examples, Clark describes a method of historical analysis for identifying the character of a given institution. Volkart analyzes the faculty as a source of power; he concludes that such power typically is held by a small minority. In describing student perspectives for coping with their academic and other problems, Becker contends that efforts  to change student behavior must take account of these perspectives. Babbidge examines the role of outside groups over the years in bringing about change in the university. Blau suggests implications of administrative relationships, the basic tension between teaching and research, the unclear boundary between universities and the public, and the university's role in fostering social change.

Two short courses were organized for nonprofessional ABE teachers. Teachers in each course were divided in half to form an experimental group and a control group. Experimental groups completed an attitude and opinion survey about ABE students after having actually taught ABE students; control groups did not. A multiple-time series design was used to measure change over time since this design permitted the measurement of transition rates which showed shifts among responses when the same adults responded to the same questionnaire item on two different occasions. Results indicated significant shift in responses of the experimental group of  ABE teachers after actual teaching experience. The study demonstrated that: (1) training programs can be evaluated by studying changes over time of the attitudes of nonprofessional ABE teachers, and (2) the particular training courses being investigated were only qualified successes since they did not induce permanent change.

The immediate subject is the status of the copula and auxiliary &quot;be&quot; in NNE. The approach to the problem combines the methods of generative grammar and phonology with techniques for the quantiative analysis of systematic variation. The principal data upon which the discussion is based are drawn from long-term studies of six male adolescent and pre-adolescent peer groups in South Central Harlem and 20 working-class adults out of a stratified random sample of 100 adults from the same area. Two white peer groups from the Inwood section of Manhattan provide controls for comparison  with white nonstandard English. The author investigates the form and order of the grammatical and phonological rules controlling the appearance of copula and auxiliary &quot;be&quot; and on the basis of his data concludes that contraction and subsequent deletion of a single consonant is the correct explanation. This model for linguistic research demonstrates that data from the speech community can provide a much-needed, sound, empirical base for decisive solutions to linguistic problems. (MK)",

In the Detroit Language Study, analysis of subjective judgments of taped speech supported the objective data that multiple negation, cluster reduction, and pronominal apposition correlate closely with socioeconomic status of the speaker. The characterization of Negro speech as a distinct variety of speech is confirmed by correct identification, from taped samples, of the  race of the speaker over 80% of the time. The fact that the lower the socioeconomic status of the speaker, the more accurately it was identified indicates that the speech of the working class is socially marked and the speech of the middle class socially unmarked.

One purpose of this study was to determine whether some of the grammatical relations within a sentence were understood more readily than others. Sentences of varying grammatical form were presented to 26 subjects who were asked to verify them one at a time by comparing the content of each sentence with the content of a picture that was shown contiguously following the sentence. Speed of verification was taken as an index of understanding. The four independent variables (true-false, affirmative-negative, active-passive, subject-verb-object) were combined in a 2 X 2 X 2 X 3 X 26 (subjects)  factorial design. The results showed that the subject-verb and verb-object relationship was not significant at the .05 level of significance. Two-way interactions were found to be significant, namely subject-verb-object X affirmative-negative and subject-verb-object X active-passive. The subject-verb-object variable was found to be significant in part; specifically, in the case of affirmative and passive sentences, but not in the case of negative and active sentences.

The purpose of this report is to relate the English proficiency and bicultural attitudes of Japanese students who have all studied English for about the same length of time in Japan. The equipment used for testing consisted of a taped interview from which was derived an English proficiency score and two questionnaires designed to measure degrees of integrative motivation. The first questionnaire listed 30 adjectives which are  traits in a person's value system. The second questionnaire listed reasons for coming to America; students indicated the importance of each reason. Figures based on the results show--(1) Students with a high total English score tend to have a +IM sign; (2) Length of stay in America is not a significant factor in determining whether a student has a + or -IM sign; (3) There is no positive relationship between reasons for coming to America and English ability; and (4) Most of the students considered learning English \"rather important.\" This had no relationship to their English score, however. The final conclusion is that Japanese students with high IM--who tend to become somewhat \"Americanized\"--tend to become better speakers of English. (AMM)",

(b) Too much time is required to acquire the new set of language habits necessary to produce even a mediocre and restrictive performance in standard dialect. (c) The importance attached to being able to perform in a prestige dialect is far beyond its net social worth. (d) The aesthetic of a speech event involves the ability to project personality, style, self-assurance,  authoritativeness, and native coloring in a fluent manner regardless of dialect. The author feels that \"people's attitude toward other people's speech is merely an extension of people's toward their culture and the people of that culture.\" He believes that the ability to perform in standard dialect does not help Blacks find employment. There is little opportunity for reinforcement of the standard dialect outside the classroom. He concludes that teaching a prestige dialect is useless without the desire and cooperation of the learners. (DO)",

Many Chinese also migrated there when the Chinese quota was increased from about 100 to over 20,000 persons for 1968-69. In order to plan for effective occupationally related English teaching for these two groups, their characteristics and special needs were studied. The MPTD (Manpower Development Training Program) is a federally funded pre-vocational job training program in which trainees (unemployed and underemployed youths and adults) are recruited and processed by the United States Employment Service. The Chinese and Spanish-speaking trainees and their English-speaking classmates attend shop classes from the first instructional day. The  non-English-speaking have varying language proficiencies, and are programed from the shops on the basis of vocational aptitudes. For those with little or no English comprehension, paraprofessionals, such as interpreters and instructor aides, are provided. Special Basic Education English Language Classes may range from one to five hours. The five-hour program, for example, consists of an hour each of oral English language structure, reading comprehension, language-oriented arithmetic, reading and discussion of work-related problems, and individual remediation. A discussion of some techniques which have proved effective with trainees learning English in the MDTP concludes the paper. (AMM)",

        "description":"Generally speaking, the main purposes of second language tests are survey; didactic, psychological or sociological research; and evaluation, the latter being the concern of this paper. Evaluation tests measure the knowledge the learner has of the second or foreign languages, and may be subdivided into the following categories: (1) aptitude tests, which assess a person's capacity to learn another language; (2) diagnosis tests, which are either &quot;inventory,&quot; and attempt to make a complete list of what the student knows in the various areas of the spoken and written language, or &quot;error,&quot; which seek to identify and explain specific student mistakes; (3) classification tests, which divide students up into various levels of language competence for the purpose of forming homogeneous  classes; (4) prediction tests, which are used to predict the student's handling of the second or foreign language in specific social and work situations where the second or foreign language is the only language used; and (5) progress tests, which try to measure the student's progress in a given program. Once the purpose of the test has been determined, the following stages fall into place--level, type, selection, form, gradation, order, number of items, administration of test, correction, and validation. These points are discussed in turn and are followed by a listing of recent writings on testing in second languages. (AMM)",

        "description":"This paper reports on results of a questionnaire survey of 84 schools representing 25,928 Afrikaans-speaking pupils in the Cape Province of South Africa. The survey revealed that only 13 of the teachers were English-speaking; the rest were Afrikaans-speaking. Most of the children never hear English out of school, or hear it under conditions requiring only a fairly limited understanding. The majority of the principals maintained that the most important skill the primary school child had to master was to speak English. In addition to being the medium of instruction, it was needed in offices, at work and in commerce (because &quot;most businesses are in English&quot;), in the professions, as qualification for employment in the S.A.R. and civil service, and for a variety of other reasons. Of  the most troublesome language problems, verbs and tense seem far more difficult even than prepositions, word order, and vocabulary, both to learn and to teach. Other conclusions reached were (1) many young teachers in these schools are not competent to teach English; (2) the methods of teacher training need revision; (3) the teaching materials used lack systematic planning, do not have enough drills and exercises, and have too much emphasis on formal grammar. Also commented on in this report are results of a questionnaire sent to 240 post-graduate and post-diploma students entering the faculty of education for one year's training. (AMM)",

In attempting to discover the reasons for students' failure to attain a satisfactory standard of bilingualism, the author examines (1) the syllabuses and the teacher (the teachers are not linguistically trained); (2) the syllabuses and the pupil (the emphasis should be shifted to achievement of &quot;articulacy&quot; in language); and (3) the syllabuses and examinations (it is the examination even more than the syllabus that determines the kind of teaching which is carried out in all but the best schools, and an improved syllabus can therefore only be effective if the examination  permits it to be so). Questions concerning which current linguistic theory to follow and whether to use traditional or audiovisual language teaching methods must be decided before revising the syllabuses. These two decisions will involve the whole hierarchy of the educational system in the Transvaal and South Africa--the administrators, the provincial authorities who will install the language laboratories, the examining boards who will have to devise new language proficiency examinations, university departments of English who will have to train linguists to write contrastive analyses of English and Afrikaans, and teacher trainers.

        "description":"Pupils in South African Bantu schools spend one third of their time in Standards (Grades) 1 and 2 learning the official languages, English and Afrikaans. Nearly as much time is given to the learning of their own Bantu mother tongue, the language of instruction from Sub-Standard A (Preprimary) to Standard 6. In the Lower Primary schools, through Standard 2, the pupil is busy with language learning for over 45% of his time; in the Higher Primary school for 40% of his time. Surveys indicate that English teaching (as a language, and as a medium of instruction), is almost completely by non-mother tongue speakers of English. A 1963 survey showed that 45% of all Bantu teachers have had a primary school education only, followed by a three-year course of professional training. Other  figures indicate that the qualifications of teachers in the city tend to be higher than the average for the whole country. The author feels that if a realistic view is taken of the other school subjects, including Afrikaans and the pupil's home language, the standards of English will not be improved by devoting more time to its teaching. A solution can be sought only in the improvement of the quality of the teacher and in the language materials and aids at her disposal. Comments on the improvement in the Johannesburg Bantu schools, as well as statistics on teacher qualifications, test results, and other relevant information appear in appendixes to this paper.

The meeting was the direct outcome of the recommendations of &quot;The Study of the Problems of Teaching English to American Indians&quot; conducted by the CAL and sponsored by the BIA in 1967. (See ED 014 727.) Agreed on were (1) the endorsement of the concept of bilingual kindergartens for Navajo children; (2) the vital importance of involving Navajo parents and community; (3) the need for general information on bilingual education; (4) the teaching of Navajo culture in the kindergarten; and (5) the  necessity for listing English structures and vocabulary items to be covered during the kindergarten year, indicating phonological, morphological, and syntactic problems of interference from Navajo. Least agreement was on how to teach English at kindergarten level (a &quot;play&quot; approach using songs, games, and other activities, vs. more formal instruction using linguistically structured materials). It was suggested that several models be worked out, offering alternative approaches. Recommendations concerning general policy, the bilingual curriculum, and the preparation of teachers are presented. (AMM)",

The author's experience has convinced her that in a classroom situation, a language is not caught by mere exposure, but requires a sequential and systematic presentation of structural elements for maximum effectiveness and efficiency with students of all ages. When provisions are made for different interest levels and attention spans, language &quot;drill&quot; is compatible with the more informal curriculum of early childhood education. Illustrated are various types of language activities, developed specifically for teaching the contrastive sounds  of English to children in kindergarten, beginner, or first grade classrooms. Carol J. Kreidler's &quot;Teacher's Bookshelf&quot; lists and describes selected supplementary materials for the teacher's reference, for the classroom, and for adult education work. Ruth E. Wineberg's &quot;Information Exchange&quot; is devoted to descriptions of new developments in BIA schools, projects and activities of particular interest to educators of American Indians, and professional meetings, institutes, and fellowships in the fields of English for speakers of other languages and bilingual education.

This broader theory suggests that an individual's characteristic achievement motivation is accentuated when present performance is perceived as instrumental in attaining future achievement goals. Research evidence is given in support of this proposition. A mathematical model of the proposed theory is presented, giving the total resultant tendency to achieve as a multiplicative function of motive, expectancy, and incentive, perceived as a subjective, compound probability. Extrinsic motivation may also be increased when the activity has future  implications.

This theory consists of the following elements: (1) the major medium for molding the beautiful and noble person is the frequency and intensity of the subject's positive experiences expecially during childhood; (2) negative experience  plays a part; (3) positive experiences is especially important in the presence of people significant to the individual; (4) it is important for the person to have worked for the experience; (5) knowledge facilitates the intensity of the experience; (6) variation adds power to the experience; (7) excitement experience is necessary; (8) individual differences exceed group differences in choice of experience; and (9) in the specific ennobling process, two parallel experiences predominate, helping another person and being helped by others.

        "description":"It is suggested that greater attention be given to psychological development assessment in the selection of students for cross-cultural exchange programs. To date little effort has been made to evaluate such program objectives as: (1) fostering international understanding, and (2) attainment of educational experiences not available domestically. Thus, the program's effects on: (1) students, (2) host cultures, and (3) origin county of students are not known. Some identified student reactions are: (1) immobilization (inability to interact in the host country) resulting in early return or emotional breakdown, (2) overidentification with the host culture resulting in severe readjustment problems, (3) underinvolvement resulting in rejection of the host culture, pursuit of familiar  cues and ultimate self-recrimination or disillusionment, and (4) viable integration, the most common reaction (student accomodates his own and host country's values) resulting in profound respect for the integrity of the host culture. The most successful exchange student, however, transcends his cultural parachialism and during a transitional phase, termed cosmopolitanism, he achieves cultural and temporal relativity and self-objectification.

The major facet of the program is a student-student interview. Interviews are scheduled after each student reads a portion of the assigned text. One student, the listener, times and listens to the speaker without comment. When the speaker concludes, the listener, familiar with the material comments on the presentation. If both students are satisfied that the interview shows mastery of the text, results are recorded on a class chart. At the end of each chapter (three to five interviews), the student takes a written exercise. Student-instructor conferences are held after each written examination, and remedial  procedures discussed if necessary. There was one lecture a week, and a final examination was given. Students progressed through the course at different rates, but the overall frequency of interviews increased as the course progressed. The interview, in addition to maintaining student activity in the class, also served to reinforce study behaviors which produced well verbalized interviews. Informal contact with the teaching staff also contributed to each student's identification with the course. (SK)",

        "description":"Assuming the perception of similarities as a fundamental psychological process, the applicability of a multidimensional scaling, nonmetric technique called MAPP (Mathematical Analysis of Perception and Preference) is demonstrated using three case studies. Any technique which provides paired similarity ranks can be used to collect data necessary for MAPP input. From the set of similarity ranks and preference rank, MAPP determines: (1) the subject's perception of what is relevant in the stimulus, (2) clusters of perceived objects in terms of the attributes considered, (3) clusters of respondents, and (4) different perceived ideals and clusters of people sharing each ideal. In the first case study, hypotheses of perceptual congruency were tested, with four perceptual styles  differentiating among Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title III administrators. The results of the second case study suggest that, in an occupational hierarchy, &quot;agressive noncompliance&quot; is more characteristic of top-rung members, and compliance to institutional norms upon request is more characteristic of lower rung members. Data analysis for the third study is not complete. Since MAPP does not require verbal or introspective responses, and attempts to elicit how respondents feel about stimuli in relation to each other, affective measurement implications become apparent.

Some research on teacher effectiveness has considered personal or interaction variables. In order to study the variable of teacher test organization, a pilot study was conducted in two elementary schools in Eugene, Oregon. Each teacher was evaluated on ability to handle behavior problems or deviancies within the classroom. The evaluation instruments were a background questionnaire, behavior dimension ratings by principals, and ranking of global effectiveness by a panel. There was high correlation (.87) between effective teachers and smoothness of transition periods. Correlation (.78) was found between teacher involvement with outside activities and teacher effectiveness.  A study of teacher lesson plans proved many of those plans too vague to use as a technique for measuring length and variety of tasks. Specific hypotheses for further investigation deal with (1) organization of the teaching day, (2) activity variety, (3) transition periods, and (4) reinforcement. (KP)",

Although the first ten verbal conditioning sessions indicated no significant group differences, useful information regarding the effects of the different procedures upon producing  verbal behavior in individual subjects was obtained. The four extra-laboratory measures did not indicate generalization of the subjects' verbal behavior from the laboratory situation to the ward. The lever-pull experiment showed that the same stimulus which had not been a reinforcer in the verbal conditioning experiment served as a reinforcer for the lever-pull response. Increases in the verbal outputs of eight subjects indicated that some combinations of experimental treatments might be considered by therapists engaged in reinstating or developing verbal behavior.

        "description":"The need for objective evaluation of the social and emotional adjustment of elementary school children has become increasingly acute, yet few tools are available which can provide data on the epidemiology of psychopathology in the school-age child. The present study undertook to cross-validate a behavior checklist for boys, the Pittsburgh Adjustment Survey Scales (PASS) which, prior to this study, could only be used to enable teachers to rate the emotional and social adjustment of boys between the ages of six and 12. A scale was also added to measure academic disability. The purposes of this research were: (1) to replicate the factorial structure of PASS, (2) to determine if academic disability is an independent factor, (3) to determine if factor structures differ between males  and females, and (4) to provide general population norms for both males and females. PASS did not cross-validate in this study, nor were factor structures replicated. The differences are discussed at length. (BP)",

The first report presents the findings of a sample survey of 500 registered voters, measuring attitudes toward planned development of an instructional program on family life and sex education in the public schools. Evidence indicates that most parents would favor such a program, because parents feel children learn much erroneous and harmful information from informal sources. Parents also feel ill-equipped to provide adequate instruction without the help of trained professionals. The outline of a  teacher-training workshop in sex education is then presented, followed by the syllabus of a graduate education course in sex education offered by Tulane University. (BP)",

Many of these boys experienced learning difficulties in the traditional school setting and withdrew from school. In addition to providing work orientation, the WOC encourages those with a desire to return to a regular high school for their diploma. This study focuses on a group of 45 dropouts who come to WOC, then returned to other schools. Of the 45, 56% were still in school at the time of the survey, having established better attendance records earlier than the second-time withdrawals, and 77% of the persisters were passing. Over half received positive comments on school adjustment. WOC was seen as helpful in  their decision to return, helpful in earning credits, and helpful with personal problems. Those who had withdrawn the second time saw the future as less bright, more uncertain, and felt more general unrest than the persisters. (BP)",

Instructions to write many solutions yielded solutions of lower mean quality, but more superior solutions. Information about criteria for good solutions raised quality. Large quantity was associated with low quality, both for variations in conditions and for individual differences within conditions. Differences between problems in the quality-quantity relation were dependent on the number of superior solutions. These three types of judgment training: (1) individual, (2) dyadic, and (3) tutorial, interpolated between production of solutions and selection of best solution, were generally successful and, under certain  favorable conditions, improved over-all performance. The response hierarchy model can be modified to apply to the present data, and transfer of training can be demonstrated between tasks. (BP)",

A student interacts with the computer system from a terminal composed of a typewriter-input and readout device, a tape recorder, and a slide projector. With information related to the students' abilities, preferences, and educational plans stored in the computer, the student chooses one of 40 occupations about which he would like more information. After a brief description, if he wants more information, the computer summarizes his compatibility with the job, plays a taped interview with a worker, projects on-the-job scenes, and types a longer description of the job. The student may inquire about any number of jobs. Reactions to  equipment were generally positive, with typeouts seen as most helpful. Content material was seen as at least adequate, although interesting and very useful. Procedures were seen as satisfactory and desirable, although 49% of the boys indicated they missed the opportunity to discuss problems during their sessions with the computer. (BP)",

The Omnibus Personality Inventory (OPI), an Intellectual Activities Check List, and a questionnaire were used to gather raw data which was treated statistically with analysis of variance and Chi-square procedures. Clear differences between persisters and changers were noted in science students, with changers higher in flexibility, independence, tolerance of ambiguity, and general receptiveness. In humanities  students, however, the differences between persisters and changers were in the opposite direction.

A major weakness in teacher education is seen to be the traditional gap between pre-service training (the responsibility of the university), and in-service training (the responsibility of the school). Close cooperation and communication between university and school was intended to unify the student's training and to have a positive effect upon skills, attitudes, values, and behaviors. Tentative conclusions indicated that the closer communication, greater personal involvement of cooperating teachers in the design of the  program, and greater acceptance and involvement of student teachers in the affairs of the school were having the desired effect of making the student teaching experience a broader, deeper, more meaningful one.

        "description":"A workable theory of instruction appears to depend upon the development of measurement instruments, which operationally define concepts such as transfer, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, to make possible empirical investigation of the relationships of methods of instruction and learner variables to the attainment of different types of educational objectives. This project developed 31-item sets in the physical sciences, and administered them to secondary school students. The sets of items followed generally the levels of understanding postulated in Bloom's Taxonomy of Education Objectives. The reproducibility coefficients were determined for each item set (.75 to .95). It was generally found that the difficulty of the \"comprehension,\"\"extrapolation,\" and \"application\" items  was highly related to the nature of the principle involved. At the lower levels, item sets were typically very easy, while \"analysis\" items were often too difficult for the majority of students. Item sets as constructed appear to be useful as research tools, but not for evaluation of instruction as it exists today. It is probably possible to construct other cumulative and hierarchical taxonomies of educational objectives in which the items increase in difficulty with each level and are highly reproducible and scalable. Sample item sets are appended. (Author/CJ)",

Included in Section IV are 14 tables categorizing 14 designated indicators which measure \"the quality of life.\" These tables establish attainment categories, subcategories, and possible indicators. It is hoped that researchers will pursue some of the avenues suggested by the analysis, with particular emphasis on the role of education in social change. (Author/CJ)",

Curricular decision makers were identified as eight superintendents, one director of curriculum, and one assistant superintendent of instruction. Leader behaviors considered were those of Initiating Structure and Consideration. Teacher acceptance and implementation were evaluated for 335 curricular plans produced from 1962 to 1965. Analysis of the study's findings indicated  that there is a direct relationship between the consideration a curricular decision maker shows his teachers and the extent to which his curricular plans and guides are used by his teachers in planning their instructional programs.

Six conclusions concerning large group instruction were reached: (1) Teachers evidenced a high degree of creativity in planning for and presenting their lessons; (2) teachers were selected to conduct the lessons because of some special knowledge, talent, or ability; (3) the scheduling of teachers for supervision during those times when  they were not actually involved in the presentation could be done more prudently; (4) when planning presentations teachers should make provision for increased pupil involvement in the actual presentation; (5) those responsible for planning presentations did not make effective use of outside resources; and (6) the large group lesson is an effective way of helping teachers avoid needless repetition of materials.

Two groups of experimental reading materials, one group composed of three narratives with related graphic illustrations and the other composed of three narratives alone, were prepared and administered to junior high students of comparable socioeconomic backgrounds in two schools. Graphic illustrations used were (1) a time-line with a historical narrative, (2) a product distribution map with a geographic narrative, and (3) a bar graph with an economic narrative. Tests over the materials were administered and results were analyzed using multivariate analysis which considered student IQ scores and reading achievement as well as test  scores. Conclusions were both methodological and substantive. It was found that (1) multivariate designs and analyses are superior to other methods in research on school learning, (2) a bar graph with text is superior to text alone in facilitating junior high learning of social studies, and (3) a time-line with text and a product distribution map with text are not superior to text alone.

The thematic index is a means of identifying anonymous works, arranging and cataloging the works of a particular composer or genre, and collating the varied manuscript and printed sources of a particular form or style. Automated procedures make it possible to carry out more sophisticated analyses of larger repertories than is possible by hand.

Programs were written to analyze, extract, and print data in varying formats from the more than 30,000 incipits encoded. Conclusions are (1) that thematic  indexing can be carried out successfully on a large scale by use of the computer, (2) the idea of a data bank of research materials has great value, (3) ways must be found to incorporate the factor of rhythm into future studies, (4) a means of printing the actual music as part of the computer format is needed, and (5) further investigation is needed to determine the most effective ways to publish the results of automated thematic indexing.

The subjects were asked to respond to four statements concerning administrator-researcher relationships, using a four-point, agreement-disagreement scale. The four statements are (1) separate-functionalist (one need not understand the processes, objectives, or environment of the other), (2) communicator (administrator needs to understand methods  and language of researcher), (3) persuader (researcher needs to understand administrator and his methods), and (4) mutual-understanding (administration and research cannot be separated).

Research is concentrated on changing manpower needs and on the challenges they are likely to present for designing the educational systems of the 1970's and 1980's. Anticipated changes in career opportunities provide a frame of reference for considering the consequences of rapid technological change, growth in leisure, and the persistence of poverty and discrimination for the options likely to become available in education during the coming decades. Chapter I sets the scope of the report into the analytical context used, while chapters II, III, and IV discuss the challenge to education of changing career  opportunities, changing levels of educational attainment, and changing socioeconomic conditions. The educational system's response to socioeconomic change is analyzed in chapter V and is illustrated in chapter VI, which discusses institutional resistances to change in the area of educational technology.

The Washington study receives the most attention. The comparison is somewhat hampered by lack of detail about what was done and the techniques and instruments used. All four studies imply that curriculum and the instructional process consist of many components other than course offerings, and all rely on descriptions of students, teachers, syllabi, prescribed curricula, and materials. Little was done to analyze the interactions and relationships among the various elements of the instructional system. Each study presumes that curricular changes, improvement, and upgrading can all be generated within the present system. None of  the surveys recommended a radical reconstruction that would result in totally new programs, new support systems, or use of new personnel or material resources. Finally, although the studies suggested directions for change, they neglected the sequencing and timing of steps to implement these recommendations. A survey using a PERT approach is suggested to help overcome this latter limitation. (HW)",

A viable system growth involves a blend of both forces on both vertical and horizontal dimensions. It is often assumed that the disunifying impact of centrifugal forces is of such proportion that the administrative unit must grow in size at a rate faster than that of the system in order to provide adequate centripetal impact. Data compiled for all school districts in the United States from 1951-52 to 1963-64, however, show that the relative size of the administrative component varies inversely with the size of the system. Although evidence from the literature is scanty, general propositions can be tentatively advanced concerning the  relationship between system size and personnel absences: (1) Absence is associated with size in a curvilinear relations, increasing and then decreasing; (2) in a small system absence is a function of the total social system, while in a large system it is associated with the characteristics of the subsystem work group; (3) absence varies most in small system; and (4) frequency of absence varies inversely with the degree of compatibility of personal and organizational styles.

Some major causes of activism are analyzed with particular attention paid to societal causes, school related causes, and personal causes. Recommendations are made for using student unrest to benefit the educational process. Discussion covers the administrator's role, faculty role, communication, administration, counseling, student participation in government,  open forums, curricula, guidance programs, and student activity programs. In the event that activism becomes destructive and must be controlled, suggestions are made for establishing school policies relating to discipline, closed campuses, underground newspapers, the \"continuation school\" program, improvement of facilities, community news media, Parent-Teachers Associations, and emergency planning.

The objective of the study was to understand the resultant attitudes of these people in an attempt to ascertain whether or not the experience was beneficial to them. Nineteen negative and 11 positive elements were extracted from the interview replies, with a frequency of 64 negative and 50 positive elements. These findings indicate that conflict between the schools and their communities should be avoided because of the dominance of dysfunctional elements. However,  the gratification derived from conflict by certain individuals suggests that conflict eruption needs empirical investigation before one can safely generalize concerning its benefits.

Steps in product evaluation include (1) definition of educational objectives to be achieved, (2) translation of the goals into descriptions of behavior, (3) identification of situations in which the  behavior can be observed, (4) development of some measurement device, (5) application of the evaluation device to the educational program, (6) analysis of evidence obtained, and (7) statement of conclusions.

Moreover, the school administrator, long trained to manage schools, teachers, parents, and children with unquestioned authority, is approaching extinction. Schools have not been for educating children but for producing conformity to socially acceptable norms. The emerging social environment is not as supportive of uniformity, middle class responsibility, and quiet citizenship as it once was. If the administrator is to survive, he must recognize that the world is changing and change with it. The school administrator will need to focus on previously ignored dimensions such as the attitudinal stance of teachers, students, and parents. He will need to understand and be able to  accept the values of others which are contrary to his own. Administrators will have to learn new skills of institutional planning, organizational diagnosis, resource development, conflict management, and data utilization.

To help solve this scheduling problem, the computer based Stanford School Scheduling System (SSSS) was developed. Experience with the SSSS demonstrates its feasibility and shows that administrators can be freed from the burden of scheduling without losing the opportunity to make vital educational scheduling decisions. Costs of approximately $1 per student are comparable to costs of manually constructing schedules. Furthermore, a computer can investigate in a few seconds the millions of possible combinations of teachers, students, rooms, and limits of time, thus making it possible to satisfy a high percentage of student schedule requests.  Computer scheduling also increases the range of professional decisions possible. Since flexible scheduling is necessary for obtaining the freedom to experiment with a wide range of curriculum alternatives, restrictions imposed by manual scheduling techniques must be removed. The computer can provide maximum freedom to choose a schedule reflecting the abilities and interests of students as well as the special qualifications of teachers. (TT)",

Since evaluation often deals only with the question of effectiveness, performance indicators in education are designed to make evaluation more complete. They are a set of statistical models which relate several important variables to objectives of the schools. The objectives considered may be student achievement, noncognitive functioning, or social functioning. These objectives are analyzed for statistical relationships with such variables as demographic characteristics, student characteristics, and elements in the school organization. Steps in developing such models include stating the educational objectives, selecting and developing measures for each  objective and variable, collecting data from each school district, and analyzing the data to determine the best mix of variables related to each objective. By looking at the relationships between variables and objectives, descriptive, predictive, and optimization information is generated. Although absolute answers are not provided, the instruments should help school officials decide on allocation of funds, school organization, teaching methods, and instructional material best suited for achieving a school's objectives.

        "description":"A challenging problem for educational administrators has been the identification of effective teachers for purposes of reward. The lack of agreement on what an effective teacher is or does is a major reason for teacher opposition to merit rating. A study of 21 fifth grade classrooms in a Midwestern school system having homogeneous socioeconomic characteristics used multiple regression and correlation analysis to determine the effects on pupil achievement of classroom environmental elements controllable by teachers. Results show that the teacher through environmental manipulation does influence pupil achievement. Years of teaching experience were found to be insignificantly related to pupil achievement. The findings suggest a new approach to merit rating for teachers--rating the  quality of manipulation of classroom environments. This approach would probably be acceptable to teachers because they could be given precise information about needed and controllable changes and because bonuses of an improved environment would be a better rating and subsequent higher pay. In addition, a teacher's merit rating would be based upon factors over which he has control. (TT)",

Seven hundred and twenty-six teachers from the schools were given the Evaluation Modality Test, the Teacher Practice Questionnaire, and the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory. Statistical analysis of the results indicated  that (1) the organizational structure of schools is significantly related to certain psychological, sociological, and educational role orientations of teachers; (2) the nature of the teaching experience rather than the fact of teaching experience largely determines teacher characteristics; and (3) the structure of the school in which experience is gained partially determines teacher attitudes and values.

Analysis of the legislation regulating collective negotiation in public education passed by 10 States, with reference to the AFT and NEA models, shows that the models change to accommodate organizational and political exigencies. Further, State and local affiliates of the national organizations have deviated in their support of the policies promulgated in the models devised by the  parent organizations.

Evaluation is thus seen as the combination of effective decisions based on timely, relevant information. The system focuses on four classes of decisions and is designed to yield four kinds of information to serve those decision situations. These four kinds of evaluation are context evaluation, design evaluation, process evaluation, and product evaluation. Context evaluation consists of planning decisions and the context information that serves them. It deals with the setting of priorities and the selection of strategies.  Design evaluation entails structuring decisions which depend on design information. In this phase, objectives are specified and means to attain them are selected. Process evaluation deals with the possible need to restructure the program after results of pilot testing and previous evaluations are in. Product evaluation considers evidence about the program's effectiveness in attaining its overall goals. Problems in applying this system might include identifying decisions and decision makers, timing decisions, identifying relevant information, and reporting information in a useful form. (TT)",

The educational planner-administrator needs predictive quantitative models which can be used to identify longterm technological changes. Not all administrators, however, are willing to consider and be constrained by the requirements of the occupational purpose of their products. The problem, then, is to develop a system which would coordinate occupational requirements and occupational-technical education planning objectives. Three central \"follow-up\"  considerations to the objectives of a vocational- technical education planning process are (1) ensure that action follows policy, (2) develop improved understanding of technological developments among administrators, and (3) give primary attention to those generic-system environment relationships which are affected by planning decisions.

Job dissatisfaction, a potent cause of militancy, will not necessarily be removed by placing the emphasis upon higher salaries, better fringe benefits, a shorter work year, lighter teaching loads, and other extrinsic rewards for job performance. Rather, as other studies have suggested, militancy may be reduced if ways are found to enable teachers to feel a sense of intrinsic worth and job fulfillment in the performance of work. This would require a new approach to evaluation such as the following five-step approach for evaluator and evaluatee: (1) Agree upon specific relevant performance objectives, (2) plan a cooperative course of action to achieve the objectives, (3) establish ways to check periodically how well  daily instructional procedures are achieving results, (4) make a joint assessment of results achieved, and (5) discuss the extent of achievement and decide the followup that is called for. A climate of acceptance between teacher and administrator is essential. It is concluded, after the examination of six relevant issues, that teacher militancy will not make teacher evaluation obsolete provided that evaluation is restructured. (HW)",

        "description":"Big-city administrators face a multitude of problems falling under three general headings--finance, discontent, and educational programs. Factors contributing to the financial problems in big cities include (1) the decline in the proportion of manufacturing employment compared to that of suburban areas, (2) decreases in taxable assessed valuation, and (3) the failure of State and Federal aid to equalize the maldistribution of local available resources. Discontent is evidenced by teacher militancy, parent alienation from the power structure of the system, and student activists rebelling against authority. One writer argues that the trouble with much of the education of disadvantaged children is that it is not quality education. Compensatory education has been an attempt to correct  this situation, but with only marginal success. There has been an abundance of programs, projects, and processes introduced to improve urban education, including Head Start, Upward Bound, the Teachers Corps, Central Cities Projects (CCP), and many others. Under the auspices of CCP both old and new programs are being used to improve inner-city education in such cities as Syracuse, Seattle, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, San Diego, Memphis, and New Orleans.

Several possibilities exist for easing this crisis: (1) Increases in Federal support, (2) a State aid distribution formula that recognizes the fact of  municipal overburden, (3) a State aid formula revision that takes account of population density, (4) a State support formula based on median family income rather than on assessed evaluation of property, and (5) a metropolitan system of taxation set up so that those who move from the city to the suburb will help pay for the problems which this movement causes the city.

        "description":"One possible solution to the problems of urban schools--such as student disenchantment, community tension, and teacher aggressiveness--is to give some of the control over school districts back to the communities themselves, that is, to reverse the trend of centralization. Concerning school government, three types of values need to be considered--those concerned with the school program, those having to do with the financing of education, and those having to do with the consumer of public education. A study of the Louisville and Jefferson County, Kentucky schools recommended a mixed pattern of educational government for that area, but the plan was never implemented. Nevertheless, experimentations with new forms of educational government are needed as a prelude to large-scale  educational government reform. Two types of these experiments are invention and adaptation. Invention would include models of the completely planned, future-oriented urban environment without reference to existing economic, political, or social institutions. The adaptation model would be created out of existing social, political, and economic systems but capable of substantial adaptation to achieve a set of logically determined values. Decentralization is concluded to be no more than a partial answer in big-city school districts. (HW)",

A separate sheet solicited autobiographical information. Two hundred and forty-two responded. The results showed more nonethical than ethical responses. Replies based on actual experience (55 percent) were two to one, ethical to nonethical, while those based upon theoretical responses had an equal ethical-nonethical ratio. Other notable results were that (1) respondent's age was not a significant factor; (2) the humanities majors of undergraduate years had relatively low  (nonethical) scores; (3) ethical responses were negatively related to career longevity; (4) AASA membership, religious convictions, and graduate studies in ethical behavior were not significant factors; and (5) salary and size of district were positively related to ethical responses.

A grievance procedure should include the following ingredients: (1) A statement that it will be administered fairly and used only when other means fail; (2) a statement that its purpose is to minimize misunderstandings and promote positive staff morale; (3) clarity of all relevant definitions; (4) inclusion of at least four levels of grievance procedures--principal, assistant superintendent, superintendent or his designated  representative, and board of education; (5) a stipulation that during the appeal process the grievant must conform to the directive or action of his administrative supervisor which caused the grievance, and (6) a statement that the grievent may be accompanied by counsel. The procedure should not require that the grievant's complaint first be processed by a committee on professional rights and responsibilities named by the local education association.

        "description":"The administrator's role in the change process is not all clear. Role conflict has been a barrier to administrators acting as change agents. Although the functions of executive, leader, maintainer, and policy implementer are common to most administrators, the total dimensions of administrative roles are seldom laid out in any job description. The school administrator can react to change in three different ways--ignore it, react to its operational effects, or stay ahead of it. Everett Rogers constructed a time continuum for the adoption of new ideas ranging between the extremes \"laggards\" and \"innovators.\" Richard Carlson reveals three fundamental barriers to change in public schools--absence of a change agent, a weak knowledge base, and domestication of the public schools. He  notes that the administrator receives the change agents role by default. Thus a vacuum is created in the management of change, for most administrators do not enjoy the luxury of detachment from their organization and cannot assume the risks involved in innovation adoption. Recently, teacher militancy and student activism have shifted the opportunity to initiate change from administrators to teachers and students, who can both detach themselves from the school organization and assume the risks of innovation adoption.

        "description":"To assess current problems and achievements in education and to project directions for school administration beyond 1970, the AASA appointed a Commission to study the preparation of professional school administrators. This report is designed to provide background for the work of this Commission. The 1960's have seen teacher walkouts, use of armed forces to maintain public order in cities, unrest over the war in Vietnam, and student unrest. On the other hand, notable achievements were made in educational quality, quantity, and innovations. Also, advances in preservice and, to a lesser extent, inservice preparation for school administrators were made, but more advances are needed. The active practice of school administration changed, especially in areas of employee organizations,  minority group unrest, demands for economy, social conflict in cities, and school control. Such developments raise questions as to the focus of the Commission's study. The most likely areas for the concern of the Commission are, therefore, strategies for managing change, theories of system organization and structure, information systems, master plans for program evaluation, new technologies for managing school operations, and comprehensive planning as a basis for resource allocation.

In accord with these important trends, those responsible for planning programs for the training of educational administrators must (1) set new objectives for leadership  development; (2) adopt a perspective which is both national and future oriented; and (3) incorporate activities adapted from the private sector, including identification of manpower needs, a national computer based inventory of available administrative leadership and support personnel, improved allocation of training resources, program design incorporating systematic evaluation, and training objectives more clearly oriented to specific administrative responsibilities and qualifications.

        "description":"A study of demonstration as a technique in disseminating new materials and methods for educating gifted youth, the project was begun in April of 1963 and terminated December 31, 1966. Demonstration centers were established in nine Illinois school districts: seven in mathematics, five in social studies, three in English, and two in science. The gifted children participating in these demonstrations during the 1966-67 academic year totaled an estimated 22,810. Through 1967, an estimated 10,300 teachers had visited the 23 demonstration centers established in 1964-65. As the project evolved, a demonstration director was employed, and the coordinator acted as a liaison between the state and federal projects. Two-hundred-forty prospective demonstration teachers were given special summer  training; and followup services for teachers, including inservice training, were intensified. Administrators were given instruction in conducting inservice programs. While many Illinois teachers were aware that the demonstrations existed, knowledge of their purpose and significant components was not evidenced although legitimacy of the methods and curriculum was often confirmed by visitors interviewing students in the program.

Of the 100, 62 received and completed intensive training services, including vocational adjustment training, psychosocial services, and group counseling. Various job placement and promotion techniques were utilized. Of these 62, 25 were quadriplegics, 23 of whom were placed in gainful employment. Of the remaining 37 who had various degrees of severe disability, 30 were  placed. Also part of the project was a mail survey made to determine the current employment experience of the quadriplegic. Of 355 persons contacted, 177 responded, of whom 69 were employed and 18 were attending college. Further descriptive data, six case studies, four recommendations, and 12 references are included.

Eight major areas of teaching methods were found: feeling tone, guidance and reinforcement, individual and group control, involvement of children in lesson, motivation, nonverbal teaching, structure of the teaching situation, and teacher centered behavior. Conclusions were that teachers spent a large proportion of time in attempting to get responses from children, acknowledging and encouraging responses, and explaining concepts and activities; nonverbal techniques were greatly used. Indications were that better teaching occurred in smaller groups which had fewer brain injured children and children who  were more similar in IQ and closer in age. Of 15 major lesson categories, language development received the most emphasis while practical arts received the least. Teachers did individualize instruction but tended to work with one child only or the whole class. A teacher competency checklist and categories of lessons covering arithmetic, arts and crafts, dramatization, health and safety, language development, music, occupational education, practical arts, motor development, socialization, science, self help, social studies, sensory training, and mental development are included.

Pupils answered questions about their academic ability from the General Self-Concept of Ability Scale; scores showed an ascending linear trend over the last 1 1/2 years of their placement in a special class while those reassigned to the regular classes all declined in self concept of ability. Special class students did not significantly increase in their awareness that according to others' definitions they were failures. The students had a more negative orientation to the special class during their second year (p .05), but there was no significant change in academic  aspirations. Special class placement was found to have a positive effect on the children's self concept of ability which was based on self comparison with class peers. Students may have internalized the negative attitudes of others about the special class and not about their ability. (LE)",

Of 371 clients who were evaluated for occupational, academic, and vocational abilities, 337 completed the full diagnostic phase of the program. Clients lived at home or in a boarding home; in addition to job skills they were trained in family living, personal hygiene, conduct, citizenship, and work attitudes. Jobs were broken into separate tasks; clients received tryouts in from three to seven work areas and were evaluated in each. A number of trainees received on the job training at other agencies. Ninety-six or 28.5% of the trainees were dropped from the program  primarily because of behavioral disturbances that could not be resolved in the scope of the program. Of those who completed evaluation, 33 were placed in competitive jobs, three were recommended for further diagnosis, 26 for training in trade schools, and 179 for training in Goodwill Industries. Results indicate that the mentally retarded can successfully be trained to be employable and to live satisfactorily in the community; additional programs are needed to prevent or alleviate behavior problems which prevent otherwise capable persons from getting and holding jobs.

Each instructor had five or six students; about 100 periods of instruction were found to be necessary to develop mobility skills. Parents' cooperation was solicited by conferences with the specialists and a parent training program. The tendency of parents to overprotect their blind children, especially their girls, was found to be a major limiting factor. The students tended to have a limited knowledge of their  environment, were lacking in physical development, and made limited use of the training because they had developed few travel needs beyond their homes and the school.

Development of the method began with the child brought into the testing room by the trainer who assisted the child in pushing a button when a tone was presented. Reinforcements were presented after each push until the child was responding appropriately; conditioning occurred at different frequencies and with changing reinforcement schedules, and the child was conditioned to wear earphones. The final hearing test was then conducted. Instructions are  provided for the trainer who attempted to consider possible reactions by the subjects and provided for fading out assistance; directions for the examiner, who operated the equipment, are also included.

State departments of education and health reported on types of hearing services required by laws, and qualifications of testing personnel, and 15 estimated the number of hearing impaired children in their states. Local school districts, divided into six groups according to student population, provided information on hearing testing services, method of provision (directly or through other facilities), educational services,  and kinds of facilities providing educational services. Schools for the deaf indicated number of students enrolled, degree of hearing impairment, reasons for referral of hard of hearing students, and number and kinds of classes. Types of hearing testing services, kinds of programs for hard of hearing students, types of staff persons who usually perform services, and availability of other programs for children who complete the center program are described for speech and hearing centers.

The 58 subjects, whose original evaluation had shown no evidence of neurophysiological dysfunction or subnormal intelligence, were randomly assigned to four schedules in regular classrooms for experimental and conventional treatment. The simulated environments technique consisted of teaching strategies and procedures which revolved around role playing and was implemented in the unit framework of the social studies. Significant differences were found in behavior improvement and in interpersonal relationships, personal effectiveness in a social situation, and problem solving  favoring the long-term treatment (p .001). No significant differences were found in academic achievement. Subjects with behavior patterns such as hyperactivity, perseveration, and a slower rate of learning needed a longer period of placement in a special class or resource room. Conclusions were that a differential program design might provide a better learning situation for emotionally handicapped students who exhibit characteristics of the minimally brain damaged, and that a continuum of services such as special classes, resource rooms, and special placement in the regular class should be provided.

Such trees, suitably located, will not only provide shade but may aid ventilation and reduce noise from external sources. From the standpoint of initial investment and consequent maintenance, they will invariably be found to be an inexpensive complement to normal constructional devices for shading, ventilation and sound insulation. Well planted sites can contribute to the visual amenity of the district in which the school is located, and the trees themselves may be used as living material in the study of botany in the  school. It is hoped that the material presented here will encourage other countries to engage more vigorously in planting around school buildings. Topics discussed include--(1) functions of trees in relation to classroom environment, (2) planting and maintenance of trees, and (3) qualities of useful shade trees.

The approach basically involves simulating a variety of possible class schedules and then decisively implementing the one schedule that best approximates the existing standard for utilization and that best supports the institution's academic program. Use of computer simulation methodology allows for manipulation of a number of factors with rapidity and ease, therefore, one may maneuver detailed inventory data in order to forecast a variety of heuristic alternative sets of room assignments for achieving optimal utilization of existing facilities.

In discussing this subject, two distinct realities must be recognized and accepted at the outset. First, some changes have occurred in educational methods and techniques. Second, tremendous strides have been made in construction techniques and building materials. As new trends in school building planning are described, the educational function of the building still demands prime consideration. The design or style of architecture of a building will not in and of itself assure the best educational  program. The significant trends elaborated on include--(1) flexibility, (2) team teaching, (3) shape of modern school buildings, (4) windowless classrooms, (5) carpeting, (6) temperature controlled school buildings, (7) ungraded primary schools, (8) electric heat, (9) library as functional learning center, and (10) educational specifications.

The population to be served included 100,000 students in grades 9-14 attending 50 schools in an area having a hundred mile radius. Service requirements were defined to include administrative uses, instructional and practice use by students, and faculty analyses in support of academic studies. Procedure was then developed for translating parameters of school usage into load estimates a system would be required to meet. Following a review of the experience of twelve institutions currently using computer systems, two alternative systems--time-sharing with keyboard terminals and remote batch-processing with  reader/printer terminals--were selected. Finally a computer program simulated user loading behavior and systems capabilities. On the basis of cost effectiveness, a system with remote reader/printer terminals was favored. The concluding recommendation supported inclusion of the planning and budgeting requirement for a centralized facility in the near term program of the U.S. Office of Education. (SS)",

Pre- and post-viewing questionnaires and interviews were administered to assess self-attitudes and attitudes toward teaching performance. The results indicated that in the absence of standards or models, satisfaction with one's teaching performance was determined by initial self-attitudes. When low satisfaction with general performance was reported in the first interview, defensive reactions to self-viewing appeared to predominate with slight improvements in attitude occurring and few specific  teaching cues recalled in the second interview.

Lack of guidelines for expenditures on textbooks, failure to use sound budgetary practices, inadequate teacher involvement in decisions affecting texts, and lack of knowledge about the merits and usefulness of modern texts have hindered the acquisition of adequate texts. The amount budgeted for printed material should allow a selection of basic texts; additional material to provide variety, flexibility, and diversity of approach; and supplementary material for independent study and teacher use. Multiple adoption of texts would permit teachers to select texts on a more individual basis.  The Joint Committee of the National Education Association and the American Textbook Publishers Institute estimate that $42 should be spent for each elementary school child and $63 for secondary school students. Due to rising costs, these dollar guidelines will probably be realistic only until 1970. (JY)",

These propositions are supported in the review: (1) media are useful in extending frames of reference and providing models and motivation for the disadvantaged; (2) media can emphasize each individual's approach to learning (thereby de-emphasizing the learning disadvantages with which some children come to school); (3) media can teach basic skills, but seem to be inadequate to teach assimilation skills to the disadvantaged;  (4) projects that focus on older disadvantaged children or adults will have greater difficulty in achieving noticeable success in a short period of time, mainly because these individuals are more difficult to reach.

The manual covers a selection of topics appropriate to a general course for individuals with little or no direct experience. Following an historical review of computer development and antecedent concepts, an overview of components and their organization as a system is provided. Program and language concepts are introduced, and component interrelationships are demonstrated by following the sequence of a simple program in solving an exemplary problem. Storage devices are then considered in detail, including the meaning of data representation and addressing; a review of core,  drum, disk, and data cell units; methods of organizing stored data and access procedures; and the mechanics of input-output processing. Finally, data transmission and aspects of communication with the compute r in time-sharing systems are detailed with a concluding comment on social implications of computer utility and EDP effectiveness. The text is accompanied by illustrations of major systems components, and a bibliography of supporting introductory readings is included. (SS)",

Twelve specialists assessed materials collected from instructional television agencies across the country. They concluded that television instruction is generally inadequate.

Despite the present inadequacy of television instruction in Language Arts the assessors considered the media to be a potentially powerful teaching tool and they made recommendations as to how its potential can be realized. At present,  of the 124 telecourses in use, 74 percent are for use in elementary grades. Most courses are recorded.

Such an optimization procedure can be constructed to reduce the long and costly calculations associated with straight-forward decision tree optimization calculation. In this procedure the decision logic acts on the basis of the student's history, including his most recent response. A quantitative representation of the purpose of the instruction and the costs of alternative routes is weighted by the probability of the student's following that route. This defines the maximum expected total utility for a student with a given history, the  optimization equation. By then using this technique with general models of learning behavior and a branching network design, the optimum alternative at each level in the branching network can be stated. Using such an optimization policy, the total expected instructional cost is sixty to eighty per cent higher than the optimum policy. (BB)",

Adoption of new technology has been slow, however, due to its high cost so small school districts, the loss of local autonomy involved in accepting regional systems, and unwillingness to invest in systems of unproven success in the field. The fragmented nature of education tends to restrict the spread of new technology, especially to small or remote districts and to minority groups, where  its effect would be greatest in guaranteeing a minimum level of education. Quality materials must be developed for presentation, and larger cost accounting units are needed. Media use is ineffective unless the whole educational system is geared to take advantage of it: what is now needed are development projects to organize these research findings into effective systems.

Creativity was defined by scores on the Remote Associations Test. The two response modes were constructing responses and simply reading them. The material, drawn from a long program on heart disease, was divided into relatively familiar and technical sections. One hundred subjects, divided into two groups judged high and low in creativity, took pretests (to insure that familiar section was indeed familiar), versions of the program itself, and posttest (to determine how successful the programed instruction had been. The highly creative group was found to be more successful on all versions of the program, but a high  correlation between creativity scores and SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Tests) verbal scores suggested that the ability originally determined was most aptly termed verbal ability than creativity. In regard to response modes, constructing responses was found to be more successful than reading responses only for technical material.

The study, written in Spanish, examines the progressive reading habits and abilities of 12 first-grade classes. Teachers assigned to teach each method uniformly had equivalent training and similar qualifications. In addition to being grouped by reading method, the pupils were matched according to their socioeconomic levels. The research attempts to equate pupils' socioeconomic level with the most appropriate reading instruction, and the studies center on the reaction of the pupils in their group relationship. Each group was rated by various language and mental tests. Graphs, charts, and data tables illustrate test results,  and the appendixes include teacher, student and parent questionnaires, test result forms, tests, sample reading materials, and psychological profiles on some pupils. Conclusions explain the advantage of both reading methods and the degree to which the techniques affect student spelling, handwriting, and creative writing abilities. (DS)",

The disparity between new methods and most evaluation practices tends to minimize solid learning achievement. In order to specify realistic objectives that will prove meaningful in measuring student behavior as an indication of successful learning, educators must train themselves to think in terms of criteria that can apply either to observed behavior or to the verifiable product of behavior. In the field of foreign language instruction, the problem manifests itself in the movement of the teachers, in varying degrees, from inventory toward transaction teaching methods in which the chief learning objective is \"unstudied\" fluency in speaking. However,  the limited but clear-cut specifications of this objective afford an opportunity for the systematic, continuous readjustment of the means necessary to attain it. Course content revision is nonetheless, but a beginning in the reform battle for a relevant curriculum to accommodate the demands for individualized instruction. (CW)",

        "description":"Although America has almost achieved the goal of equality of educational opportunity for women, it is questionable whether the pathways to personal fulfillment are the same for women as for men. A synthesis of the findings of 4 major research projects, all of which involve national samples, reveal some interesting differences between the backgrounds, attitudes and aspirations of college men and women. Women tend to come from homes of higher socioeconomic levels than do men and higher proportions of men with lower ability, limited funds and middle class background attend college. Both parents and students seem to feel it is more important for a son to attend college although girls tend to make better grades in high school and are more satisfied with their performance. College  women are more likely to support liberal causes, though less likely to dispute dormitory regulations--an issue related to the double standard. Taking all the research together, most women expect to have careers but marriage and family life take priority. Academic disillusionment is common and upperclassmen emphasize the satisfactions of friendships rather than scholastic accomplishments. The college woman juggles 3 pursuits--husband-hunting gaining practical job training, and exploring intellectual potential. Flexibility in educating women is needed and the provision of independent study could meet this need. Women should be encouraged to develop academic programs suitable for their wants and interests.

        "description":"The traditional concept of the university is being challenged today by students, faculty members, and the general public. The news media have tended to aggravate, inflate, and distort university events. In some cases this kind of reporting has made public figures of those student leaders who attempt to make the university an instrument of political action or others who would preserve its structure but seek the power to govern it. Faculty interest in governance has increased, and an outraged public condemns the university's \"inability to keep its own house in order.\" The most obvious response to these pressures has been made by university presidents, who resign as their responsibilities increase and their authority diminishes. Another response concerns university governance. The  2-tiered system, or the existence of a Board and a Senate with faculty and student participation, has been successfully attempted at the University of Western Ontario. The classroom response has been less dramatic. There seems to be no viable alternative to current lecture and examination systems, even though some efforts are being made to experiment with new teaching techniques. An important question concerns how the university may retain its autonomy while participating in governance within a system flexible enough to adapt to the rapid pace of change. It seems that the university has already begun to defend its aims with a new enthusiasm reminiscent of the intellectual revolution that produced it 100 years ago. (WM)",

The Council of Graduate Schools and the Scientific Manpower Commission then sent questionnaires to US graduate schools to determine how many male students would not be deferred, and found that about 70% of the potential first-year and 40% of the potential second-year male graduate students were draft liable. Taking advantage of this fact, students of both sexes sought entrance to institutions of higher caliber than those they would have applied to the year before, and institutions admitted more than their quotas in expectation of a high loss ratio in the fall. But between June and December 1967 draft calls were  low, and a large number of young men returned to school without any assurance that they would complete even 1 semester of their graduate work. Because of these and other factors, 1967 graduate enrollments were not substantially below those of 1966. The National Security Council considered the deferment of graduate students to be unfair to underprivileged youth, who did not have either the opportunity or the funds to attend graduate school. It is felt that concentrated drafting of male graduate students could result in a loss to the nation of many years of needed technological service because of the interruption, and often discontinuance, of their graduate studies.

        "description":"A study of all Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores reported to Hofstra University between September 1963 and February 1968 revealed that 27 persons had repeated the verbal part of the GRE, 27 retook the quantitative part, and 39 retook the advanced test. The interval between test and retest ranged from 2 to 40 months. The GRE scores of students who took the examination more than once were compared, and efforts were made to relate changes in the scores to the time that elapsed between the taking and retaking of the examination. The data revealed that a higher score was obtained by 59% of those retaking the verbal portion, 70% of those retaking the quantitative section, and 90% of those repeating the advanced test. Although the results are tentative because of the smallness of  the sample, it is concluded that the effect of retaking the GRE varies, depending on the section of the test taken and when it is taken. The average increase in scores on the verbal section was 21, and there was little relationship between the increase and the time period between test and retest. The greatest increase was obtained on the quantitative test when it was retaken after one or two months, and the average increase was 30 points. The increase obtained in the advanced test scores was greater when there was a longer lapse of time between first and second administrations, and the average increase obtained was 64 points. (WM)",

The students responded to a 30-item questionnaire which was designed to assess their reactions to the particular course they had taken. The data obtained indicated that students in both courses would like discussion on a number of topics, and an emphasis on learning to think critically, although the relative emphases to be placed on these two points differed in each group of students. Those in the Freshman Seminar course felt that an ideal course would place more emphasis on discussion, and those in the Modes  of Inquiry course perceived an ideal course as one that placed more emphasis on learning, thinking, and ways of knowing. Thus the students' perceptions of an ideal course tended to be similar to the one that they took. Although students in the Freshman Seminar class were most influenced by discussion, they also appreciated learning to think critically. It seems that students should be exposed equally to both courses, or given the right to choose to take either or both of them. (WM)",

A list of 17 findings and recommendations are presented. Some findings indicate that computers are used in a few state-supported colleges and universities in Texas to register students, produce payrolls, and keep track of the various inventories that must be maintained. There is a shortage of specialists educated in the computer sciences at both graduate and undergraduate levels, and computer-oriented research programs are almost nonexistent. It is felt  that all college and university students should acquire some basic understanding of computers on their campuses, and students majoring in business, engineering, and science should be trained to use computers as tools of their trades, since their future careers will require this knowledge. Computer science departments should be established at selected 4-year institutions, and doctoral programs should be developed.

Eight alternative systems of governance (including the present system) are examined in an attempt to select the one that would resolve most of the immediate problems facing higher education in the state. Fourteen criteria were formulated to serve as a framework within which the overall analysis was made, and as the basis for appraising the advantages and disadvantages of the 8 plans. The existing public higher education system consists of 3 independent public segments (universities, colleges, and junior colleges), coordinated by a statewide  board with primarily advisory powers. The recommended system would have 2 independent public segments, one containing all public institutions granting baccalaureate and graduate degrees (colleges and universities), and another granting only associate degrees (junior colleges), coordinated by a statewide board. It is felt that this system would, among other things, simplify the financial structure and remove arbitrary barriers to development. The establishment of regional committees for furthering interinstitutional cooperation is also suggested, as well as advisory boards for keeping abreast of problems and needs of each 4-year campus.

Many administrators are academic specialists, but are not prepared to respond to the basic questions raised by students about the university's role as an educational institution and its role in society. The growing permissiveness of parents and exposure to today's communications media have produced more sophisticated college-age children over whom administrators can no longer assume an arbitrary authority. Administrators are usually confronted with problems arising from 1 of 2 sources: (1) militant student and faculty insistence that the institution should take leadership in social action, and (2)  student pressures for change in the institution itself. The numerous criticisms that evolve from these sources seem to be justified. Unfortunately, many administrators have resisted new ideas and maintained bureaucratic modes of administration, actions that have turned student agressions from the solution of educational problems to the achievement of student power. It is suggested that administrators be more qualified for their responsibilities.

It was found that: 4 out of 10 faculty were awarded PhDs within the past 7 years; of the recent PhDs, 9 out of 10 were engaged in research at least 20% of the time; of older PhDs, 8 out of 10 were. Little  correlation appeared between the proportion of young faculty in selected fields and the source of the department's research funds; 57% of young faculty and 70% of senior faculty were in federally connected research. Over two-thirds of the respondents said the division of available funds between young and senior staff was appropriate. Little relationship appears between the proportion of respondents indicating the distribution of funds was inadequate for young staff and the amount of federal science support awarded their institutions. Insufficient performance of research by young staff was related to fund limitations and allocation mechanisms. Some respondents felt that young staff should be granted a greater choice of research topics and be awarded specific support programs.  (JS)",

        "description":"From the systems point of view, the objectives of higher education cannot be defined apart from the economic and social context in which the university operates. The report presents the results of a 4-year research project during which a mathematical model was developed to describe the way in which the university, as part of a socioeconomic system, utilizes its resources in production. The model, designed to aid university administrators in the overall allocation of resources, consists of sets of equations that describe the relationship of resources to production and, based on these, the associated unit costs of production. Resources (input) are described as personnel, space, and equipment, and products (output) as developed manpower, research, and public or technical services.  The model does not tell the decision maker how to create a more effective educational institution, but provides him with a tool for evaluating the changes in the types of resources --or the potential economic gain-- which could result from proposed changes in the design of the institution. The report contains a brief non-technical review and a detailed technical description of the model, and discussion on and examples of how to use it in administration. Documented descriptions of data processing and simulation programs are also included, as well as a bibliography and auxiliary reports that were developed during the life of the project. (WM)",

An attempt was made to approach these 4 goals in a nationwide survey involving several thousand college students. The instrument used was the Polyphasic Values Inventory (PVI), which consists of 20 multiple-choice questions with responses organized on a liberal-conservative continuum. This paper is a preliminary report of the survey and concerns the responses of 765 male seminary students from 15 institutions. The 5 items in the PVI  selected for this report are freedom of enterprise, race relations, sex relations, belief in God, and belief about the Bible. A comparison of the seminarians' responses with normative data from a larger group of college students reveals that both groups endorse private enterprise, but the seminarians tend to support what may be described as the welfare state. They are more liberal in their views on race relations, and 77% of them, compared to 28% of the other students, expressed a belief in the God of the Bible. The seminarians held a less liberal view of sex, and 35% of them, compared to 22% of the other college students, subscribe to the traditional doctrine of Biblical inspiration. (WM)",

These variables were then measured against the same students' answers to a 20-item questionnaire ranging from \"purpose of science\" to \"man's responsibility.\" Data is presented on the significant differences within each variable for each polyphasic values inventory item and the significant differences from the norm group toward liberalism or conservatism for each of the groups (political, religious, philosophic or socioeconomic) on each polyphasic values inventory item. It was found that  Republicans, Protestants and realists were the most conservative of all groups and on most items the conservative groups did not deviate from the norm nearly as much as groups which were more liberal than the norm. These groups were quite large in contrast to the liberal groups which were quite small. Three groups were very liberal compared to the norm: Socialists, existentialists and those with no religious preference. But an examination of the interrelationships among these 3 groups indicated that, for the most part, 1 group is not heavily composed of students from either of the other 2. Pragmatists, idealists and those in the \"none of these\" philosophic group showed no definite conservative or liberal pattern and were only significantly different from the norm on a few items.

A Course Evaluation Questionnaire (CEQ) was developed.

A sample of 128 subjects included: 49 full professors, 24 associate professors, 35 assistant professors, and 20 instructors--figures proportionately representative of the faculty on the Urbana campus of the University of Illinois.

Three types of experimental projects are proposed to provide the experience needed to design and operate an effective communications link between the federal government and the higher education community as a whole.

Major goals of the present systems of federal support for higher education include greater educational opportunities for increasing numbers of students and the output of more highly trained manpower at graduate and professional levels. It supports high quality in education, basic research, both in its own right and in the hope that applications of new knowledge may help to solve some of the country's problems, and the mobilization and use of institutions' intellectual resources in a host of service functions. Yet the fiscal problems faced  by colleges and universities in 1968 were graver than they were in 1958. The Council suggests the elimination of cost-sharing and matching requirements in future government-university relationships, and points out the need for long-range planning, careful budgeting and sustained federal commitment for university programs that are federally supported. The Council also recommends adequate federal funding of existing programs, expansion of student aid and facilities construction programs, and provision of support for general institutional purposes.

In 1966, the graduate faculty adopted a more selective admissions policy, and ruled that final decisions upon graduate admission be made in the department provided the minimum college-wide standards had been met. Changes in the content of graduate programs include the elimination of the thesis requirement for master's degrees, and the reduction of formal courses in doctoral programs in favor of more independent study and research. In the drive for relevance, cogency and efficiency, some required foreign languages such as French and German have been found to be less  useful than others such as Spanish or Russian. Some departments have therefore dropped the requirement of 2 languages and now require the study of 1 language in depth, that language being one closely related to the student's special field. Another development has been the formation of a graduate student senate in the Fall of 1968. This may be the first group at a US university that gives graduate students in all departments, rather than those in specialized disciplines only, a voice in discussions about their education. (WM)",

Altogether, the 35 institutions award approximately 10,000 bachelors and 1,300 master's degrees a year, one half of which are in education and an increasing number in business and science. These public institutions have now reached a critical stage, brought on by chronic shortages of funds and rising student enrollments. Growth at the freshman level is outpacing many other state and land-grant institutions. The  average family income of these students is $3,300 a year, and they can barely afford current tuition rates. Almost 90% of their families earn less than $6,000 per year in contrast to the national median among college students of $9,500. State governments, increasingly pressed by new educational demands, are decreasing their contribution to operating funds of these colleges and universities. Increased private support would enable these institutions to raise faculty salaries, support advanced study for faculty members, attract and retain top scholars, increase scholarship and loan funds, modernize their facilities, and upgrade some of their programs.

Private philanthropy has also aided immeasurably in the creation of Negro higher education as well as higher education for women. However, it is the institutions and not the foundations that must come up with innovative ideas. Foundations are very interested in innovations, though many continue to support tired and weary projects. It is necessary for foundations and educators to get together to exchange ideas for the edification of both parties. Educational institutions through  consortia or other means are increasingly trying to work cooperatively to provide a better education for an area region or state. It might be useful for the foundations to get together with a consortium, or consortia to benefit from the thinking of a wide group of educators who have been working together for some time. Though it is important to involve the students, it is essential to involve the faculty in real life situations. Foundations should insist that the programs they support are relevant to the needs of society, which means that they are relevant to the students. (AM)",

Walls around a campus or geographic isolation cannot prevent social pressures from affecting the institution. Colleges and universities have always been politicalized. The danger lies not in that fact but in the sharp new exposure of the misuse and abuse of the substantial power these institutions now possess at a time when higher education has become essential to economic, political, social and spiritual survival. The character of the new knowledge and the technologies available for getting access to it have reduced the qualitative gap between those who teach and those who are being taught. Today's students want to consult the original sources  of knowledge. Therefore, the institutions must be prepared to share the process of academic lawmaking with those it expects to govern. New mechanisms must be found for integrating the new knowledge into the curricula and new efforts must be made to answer to the needs of the environment, particularly the cities.

The academic voluntary associations have in the last decade engaged in the process of narrow politicization in their participation in shaping educational policy. Encouraging the federal government to provide greater support to higher education has provoked little controversy. But conflict among association members has arisen over  broad political questions. Advocates of involvement argue that overspecialization and dependence on federal aid have reduced scholars' incentive to be responsibly critical of social ills. Those resisting broad politicization contend that members of a disciplinary society do not share ideological views and politicization would compromise the association's professional status and autonomy. Associations should show their concern by enhancing their activities related to solving social problems but they needn't engage in overt political activity. \"Academic organizations can function most effectively as contexts for the scholarly examination of social issues, thus helping to prepare their members for more informed participation in the political process.\" (JS)",

(1) \"Our fear of overt violence must be countered by our acknowledgement of covert violence.\" Covert violence is subtle and more destructive than physical violence because it is the \"denial of personhood\"--the insinuation by an act or by neglect that a person doesn't count. \"Institutional racism\" is a telling example. (2) We must recognize that \"the abuse of power must be countered by the creative use of power.\" Students are contemptuous of the older generation because of its monstrous abuse of power, the most glaring example of which is Vietnam. Priorities should be reallocated or a holocaust will result. (3) \"Misplaced materialism\" dedicated to providing unnecessary and soon obsolete  luxury items should be replaced by \"transformed materialism\" dedicated to sharing the earth's goods. (4) Within education, we must move from academic detachment to moral compassion. To help make these shifts, educators can force people to confront choices and to point out the consequences of given choices so that fresh decisions may be made. To be strong and visionary enough to undertake commitments in new directions, one must cultivate the quality of \"standing outside oneself\"--in essence, have a sense of humor. (JS)",

Some of these demands run counter to the traditional purposes of the university: the production and transmission of knowledge. Universities' responses range from isolation or withdrawal as recently espoused by Barzun in The American University to a call for direct social action which carried to its extreme could make the university a service station, a pseudo-governmental agency. Neither of these positions is acceptable, and universities must find a balance between isolation and invasion. Scholarship cannot be divorced from the world of reality, but scholars must be given some protection from the demands of daily action programs. At the same time, it would be useful to free some professors for a time from their  research and teaching roles so that they may participate fully in action programs. Or the university could employ action people to serve as liaison between those who study and those who practice. The university could also spin off into related but separate organizations many developmental and dissemination tasks based upon the work of scholars. Some of this spin off might involve the talents often found in business firms. (AM)",

Administrators at 9 San Francisco Bay area colleges were interviewed and data were gathered in the Bay area, in the Haight-Asbury section of San Francisco and in Portland, Oregon. Hypotheses concerning the hippies' academic background, ideological commitments, recruitment into &quot;the hippie scene&quot;, and views concerning higher education were tested. Because traditional research methods were inappropriate for gathering information, the  researchers acted as informal participant observers of the scene, which they later recorded. It was learned that college deans do not perceive hippies as either creating problems or affecting the dropout rate; hippies do not repudiate scholarship but question whether the university affords the opportunity to learn; most intend to return to college and claim satisfactory academic performance there; most were humanities or social science majors; most expressed only vague ideas about university reform; and younger hippies were more bitter about their high school experiences that older hippies about college. The recommendations deal with the distribution of power within the university and the nature of its involvement in the larger community. (JS)",

The selected sample consisted of students enrolled in conducting classes at Arizona State University, 20 of whom were in the experimental group and 18 in the control group. The control group was exposed only to the traditional method of teaching intonation, and the experimental group listened to 17 prerecorded magnetic tapes that aurally compared intonation errors with in-tune prototypes. The study was limited to the development of intonation sensitivity to the major third, the minor third, the fifth, the minor seventh, and to the pitch of these  intervals as they form the major triad, the minor triad, and the chord of the dominant seventh. Students in the experimental group were required to recognize and identify the voice in which the error took place, and to designate the direction of the error. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in their ability to recognize errors of intonation, and to identify the direction of errors that were flat and errors that were sharp.

The retrieval aspects of the system involve selecting cards representing characteristics that conform to the interests of a prospective college student, and stacking the cards so that they are in line. When cards are superimposed one on the other, points of light are produced at grid positions representing colleges in the stack that have common characteristics. The study sought to construct 300 of these  devices, place them in college admission situations in high schools, and evaluate their use and the characteristics they represent. For 5 months the College Suggestor was used by students, counselors and parents in 5 high schools in the Chicago metropolitan area and data were obtained from the students and counselors about its utility.

Six students in each of 3 consensus and 3 non-consensus groups discussed the University of Iowa's policies on grading, undergraduate women's hours, and undergraduates' possession of automobiles. Fifty pairs of consecutive statements were selected from each discussion and two-factor analyses of variance were made on the first statements in each pair on 8 separate variables. The variables were clarity of expression, opinionatedness, amount of information, interest, provocativeness, orientation, objectivity, and  length of contribution. No differences were found between the 2 types of groups on either clarity or length. The consensus group's statements revealed much more interest in women's hours and much less interest in undergraduates' possession of cars, and the group's discussion on this question was less opinionated, and more provocative, informative, and objective than those of the non-consensus group. The study has shown that there are some detectable differences in the discussion behavior of groups that reach consensus and groups which do not.

The main purposes of the exercise are (1) to provide students with an experience in crisis diplomacy and policy formation, and (2) to provide a case study of \"crisis\" in group dynamics. Rules for the game are flexibly designed to permit creativity on the part of the players, who are assigned to roles on the basis of their leadership qualities and their knowledge of the country in which the game is to be played. A PME committee is responsible for providing the framework within which the game is played. The framework involves a political crises that determines the initial actions  of the PME, a scenario that bridges the span from current time to the time of the crisis, and a complement of teams to play the PME. A control board, on which the success of the game depends, keeps the game running smoothly and represents groups such as ambassadors, spies, and unrepresented countries that are not represented in the game. In 1967, Caltech experimented with a double game that required 2 control boards and dealt with the international aspect of previous games and the complexities of internal US decision-making. The document describes this game, some of the difficulties encountered, and how it differs from previous games. (WM)",

They were also asked which recruitment practice had most influenced their choice of this particular college. Sixty-nine per cent said they were in the program that most interested them, 222 said they were not, and 378 were undecided. One hundred forty-one had been uncertain about their plans when they enrolled; 59% chose their program to train for a good job; 16% wanted a degree  in less than four years; 21% felt unqualified for senior college; only 35 wanted to postpone military service. The most influential recruitment factors were, in order: (1) high school counselor, (2) college counselor, (3) parents or other adults, (4) friends, and (5) brochures, leaflets, etc. available from counselors. Factors of little influence were: (1) college-and-career days in high school, (2) mass media such as mailings, newspapers, public displays, posters, billboards, etc. These results show that the career days at the high schools could stand re-evaluation and improvement as recruitment devices. The report also notes that this area survey shows results almost identical to a 1968 national survey. (HH)",

From the meager response, it appears that most dropouts felt no residual affinity for the college. Most of those who did reply, however, felt that the college, especially the General Education courses, had helped them. Some were slightly disappointed with the counseling, except when given by the faculty. Many felt that personal development was an important aspect of their attendance (an aspect the writer feels should receive more attention). Contradicting their expressed satisfaction  with the General Education courses, the curricular change they felt most needed was fewer of these and more technical courses. Half the respondents said they continued their education elsewhere toward a bachelor's--a figure the writer considers unreliable, as transfers would be more likely to reply and thus distort the response to this item. The dropouts had nearly the same number of transfer credits as those who graduated; those who transferred felt well prepared by the college for advanced work. Most respondents felt that the rules of dress and attendance were personally valuable. They also held the faculty in high regard and felt a sense of close student-teacher relationship. (HH)",

They are for first year graduate students preparing to teach English in junior colleges (or in the lower divisions of a 4-year college); they pay $2400 the first year and $2600 the second, plus $500 a year for each dependent. Course requirements and funding are given in detail. At the end of two years and an intervening summer session, the Fellow will receive an M.A. in English and be prepared for an Arizona Junior College Certificate. He will have received special training for the conditions encountered in 2-year colleges. The regular M.A. program will be supplemented with two Education courses required for certification and a series of  internships in which, in the last three semesters, the Fellow will participate in classroom instruction in freshman composition, literature, and humanities. He will receive a terminal professional degree, but will also be able to proceed without loss of time (after his junior college teaching) toward his Ph.D. He must meet regular admission requirements of the English Department and the Graduate College and pass the usual M.A. exam at the end of the program. Spanish will meet the foreign language requirement for the M.A. and also for the Ph.D. if the student returns for it. It is hoped that this program will alleviate the shortage of English instructors in the present and proposed junior colleges in Arizona. (HH)",

        "description":"For years, the University of California has sent an annual report to Los Angeles City College (LACC) on the academic performance of its transfers in their first semester and comparative data on all other California junior college transfers. In 1966-67, the report format was changed because of the switch to the quarter calendar and the use of a new data processing system. These changes produced some confusion before the process was debugged. Although some of the resulting data (especially for 1966-67) are incomplete and some in a form difficult to compare with earlier data, it is felt to be reliable within 5%. Tables of the findings show 1967-68 comparative data for LACC and other junior college transfers by number of entrants, GPA's at college and university, differentials in  GPA's, number eligible and ineligible at high school graduation; a summary of data for the past 11 years; an analysis of transfers by campus to which they transferred; an analysis, by sex and college major, of transfers to the UCLA campus; and academic performance of transfers to UCLA by other selected categories. Among the nine conclusions is that, of all California junior college transfers to the university, those from LACC made an outstanding record. Thirty per cent made a B average or better; only 11% earned below a C. LACC transfers had a GPA of 2.65 at the university, .22 below their college average. The 3052 transfers from other colleges dropped their averages by .45. (HH)",

        "description":"The relationship between the bureaucratic character of an adult education organization and its willingness to accept innovation in program development was investigated. An instrument was constructed and administered to 45 Cooperative Extension Service organizations to obtain a profile of each one in terms of five characteristics of bureaucracy as perceived by its members. From a pilot study of ten organizations felt to represent opposite ends of the bureaucratic continuum, 60 items with the highest positive value were chosen and the final instrument sent to 675 staff members, eliciting a 92% usable response. It was hypothesized that, between the most and least innovative organizations, there would be no significant difference between the mean scores for each of five scales  determined as measures of bureaucracy by the pilot study. The scales, which vary from rigid to flexible on a 5-point scale, are (1) hierarchy of authority, (2) division of labor, (3) rules and procedures, (4) rewards, and (5) impersonality. Budget and personnel were combined as resources; rules with rewards; and length of service and levels of authority were added to these variables in a regression equation. The five hypotheses were tested by Chi-square and the combined data analyzed in relation to each hypothesis using a multiple regression equation. Collectively the variables were significantly related to program innovations, but, individually analyzed, only resources and rules and rewards were so related. (MC)",

The junior college administrator who rejects IR because he thinks it abstract does his school and the taxpayer a disservice. A college without IR (1) deprives the transfer student of the research orientation the native has already encountered, (2) cannot easily recruit faculty with the usual attitude to research, (3) will dimish its academic reputation. Each college undertakes different IR, to fit its own role and staff. IR may be basic or applied, usually the latter,  stressing current operational problems and, although its value is acknowledged, it has not had a major impact on higher education thought. IR functions have been described as (1) motivating and initiating experiment, (2) evaluating results, (3) long range planning; or as (1) providing data for decision making, (2) evaluating line operations, (3) serving both faculty and administration. The value of advisory groups and theoretical vs. applied IR are discussed. The 1968 survey of IR by Roueche and Boggs (ED 021 557) is examined in detail. In summary, IR must be planned, have centralized responsibility, report to the president, have advisory committees, include staff and administration, and be adequately financed. (HH)",

Section IV, funding methods, finds the existing foundation program ineffective in equalizing differences in local financial ability. Four  modifications are suggested. Section V, budget process, calls for systemwide review at the state level and a more timely consideration of district budgets by local boards, based on improved information. The system should be moved from the public school finance framework to that of higher education. Four specific changes are recommended. Section VI, on equality of opportunity, suggests ways to insure that geographic and socio-economic factors do not keep potential students out, and warns against starting small colleges that cannot offer the broad programs of larger colleges without excessive operating costs per student.

The t-tests for the seniors showed that Group 4 differed significantly from Group 5, 6, and 7, but that these did not  differ significantly from one another. Group 4 achieved a higher GPA than the other three senior groups. The freshman t-tests showed no significant difference. Although Group 1 had a higher GPA than Group 2, and Group 2 than Group 3, the difference between any two of them was not statistically significant.

The counselor often wants to refer an individual to a more specialized agency. Such referral is hard to make even in an urban setting, where the existing agencies are usually overcrowded, and worse in a rural area, where few or no such facilities exist (e.g., medical centers, employment services, public assistance, juvenile care, volunteer organizations). Representative of those needing special care are the drug addict, the potential suicide, the pre-psychotic, the unhappily married, the homosexual. Since the rural-area counselor meets these problems whether he wants them or not, the author suggests he list area resources, establish interagency  contact, and encourage professional meetings for the whole community. The junior college, being so flexible, is a good starting place for expansion in (1) the use of its social science staff to coordinate social agencies; (2) anticipation of social problems with programs in child development, consumer economics, family relationships, etc. and seminars on issues of immediate local concern; (3) providing counseling services for the non-college population, even in remote areas and with some psychiatric consultation. A questionnaire was sent to 22 colleges, of whom 18 replied. The results showed a need for reappraisal of the college and its goal of full-dimensional service to the entire community. (HH)",

The college already provides in-service education credit as a start up the career ladder and will apply its experience to the present project to upgrade 30 indigenous nonprofessionals already employed in such agencies as Head Start. They will be bilingual, insofar as they speak barrio Spanish and ghetto English.

(1) There should be neither physical nor symbolic barriers between campus and community, this outreach to include pre-admission counseling, a search for both non-applicants and dropouts, continuing education courses, local business contacts, field trips, and reciprocal arrangements with neighborhood government agencies. (2) Programed instruction link-ups would make practical the decentralized campus and the high-rise building. (3)  Participant sports (handball, swimming), rather than spectator, besides being healthful, would strengthen the outreach philosophy. (4) A 24-hour Learning Center to accommodate students' varied work and study hours would combine student union, library, cafeteria, classroom, and enhance educational accessibility. (5) Experiments in housing should be made to help sever the student's ties with his familiar ghetto, e.g., rest cubicles, fresh-up rooms, or compulsory dormitories for underachievers. (6) To become a part of the new &quot;urban fabric,&quot; the college should take advantage of its situation in the newly developing surroundings of housing, commerce, parks, plazas, and parking and traffic patterns.

Some observations, however, may clearly be made: (1) a lecture, even on television, is still only a lecture, not a new instructional method; (2) since programing has a powerful effect on the programer, if not on the student, it appears that teachers should write program; (3) a multi-sensory approach is an attempt to find out what has an effect on which student at what time and suggests avenues of possibly  fruitful research. Although comparing effects of various media produces useful correlational studies, most needed is careful design of sequences using media in combinations that allow for maximum effect.

Data came from twelfth-grade students in 1960 and from a followup questionnaire in 1965. The study is descriptive only, because sound information on racial identity was unavailable in 1960 and because, for several reasons, out of 90,637 questionnaires with a 39% return, very few usable subjects were found. The research method and selected variables are described. Three null hypotheses were tested: (1) environmental parameter groups are indistinguishable in terms of post-high-school employment adjustment and student factors; (2) there are no significant differences among the groups related to environment; (3) there are no significant selected environmental factors that influenced  students in choice of or plans for post-high-school education. No. 1 was tested by a partial canonical discriminant analysis, No. 2 by a multivariate analysis of variance (Hall and Cramer 1962); No. 3 by Chi-square tests. The first was rejected in terms of geographic regions and community types, but not in terms of Negro density. The second was rejected because of significant regional differences. The third was not rejected, as it was concluded that the differences in regional, community, and Negro density groups occurred by chance and that those in post-high-school adjustment were not significantly affected by region, type of community, or Negro density in the school.

Fifty-one pairs of male students (42 seniors, 60 freshmen) were randomly selected from a residence hall. Half were appointed observers; the others were the observed. Observations were made and charted on two selected days about four weeks apart. The two groups then exchanged roles and the procedure was repeated. Of the possible 204  reports, 171 were received. The results showed that (1) the students study slightly more than three hours per day; (2) before an exam, they study slightly more than an extra half-hour per day; (3) there is a significant difference between divisions (e.g., Agriculture students average an hour more per day than the college average of 3.1 hours, while students in Business average about two-thirds of an hour less); (4) there is no significant difference in the number of hours spent during any one day, Monday through Thursday; (5) seniors average one-half hour more per day than freshmen; (6) the student's residence-hall room is used more for study than any other place on campus.

It was generally agreed they must not only be subject specialists, with broad general education, but must also be prepared specifically as teachers for the junior college. Interviews with 36 faculty members from seven colleges in six states were tape-recorded. Responses showed general concern for (1) junior college philosophy, (2) functions and responsibilities of nurse faculty members, (3) the instructor's image, (4) problems of the nursing faculty, and (5) the best preparation for nursing teachers. Responsibilities of the teacher are primarily teaching, advisement, and seeing that the students, working  as they do on an extended campus, provoke only good reactions from hospital staff, physicians, and patients. The instructor's good image comes from teaching ability, enthusiasm, depth of knowledge, and a personal interest in the students. Major problems include a lack of time, lack of criteria for teaching, interpersonal relationships, and a certain insecurity in the classroom, (due perhaps to a lack of orientation to the college). Responses on best preparation included broad general education, easy interpersonal relationships, background in both nursing education and nursing practice, knowledge of teaching methods, and teaching experience. Degrees, no doubt taken for granted, were little discussed. (HH)",

In the fall of 1965, students entering American River College were randomly assigned to either group or individual sessions, or not assigned, and these groups were compared over a two-year period in persistence, academic achievement, goal motivation, student attitude change, and counselor evaluation of students' growth in self-understanding. An analysis of covariance showed that students counseled individually were rated significantly higher by their counselors in growth in self-understanding, and students counseled in groups had a significantly more positive attitude toward counseling.  Although there were no significant differences between these groups in persistance, academic achievement, or goal motivation, when they were compared to students not assigned to either group or individual counseling sessions, they were significantly higher in these three areas.

Ten states have laws governing teacher aide employment and functions; 11 have policies or guidelines; 29 have neither statutes nor guidelines, although seven of these are developing regulations of some sort. Extreme ranges  of interpretation were found between teaching and non-teaching tasks, rather than clear distinctions. Nevada, for example, requires each local board to establish its own policies on teacher aide duties. California, on the other hand, has its Instructional Aide Act of 1968. The law specifies that aides may perform tasks that, \"in the judgment of the certified personnel to whom the instructional aide is assigned, may be performed by a person not licensed as a teacher.\" Although the use of teacher aides is nationwide, the study found not discernible direction or trend in the definition of their role or functions.

These latter correlations were no larger, a result interpreted to mean that personality-achievement correlations are not enhanced by the use of theoretically derived personality scales. This interpretation is discussed in terms of previous hypotheses and Type I errors. Consideration is given to the five personality scales and to their relations with achievement. In particular, adaptiveness is related to reading achievement. About 25% of achievement variance is  accounted for by personality, and about 50% by personality plus IQ. (Author/HH)",

As anticipation of change from customary habits expectably produces anxiety, resistance is mainly protective. The learner may reveal his resistance to or rejection of a new idea by ignorance, doubt, or merely a feeling of inadequacy to deal with it. The initial expression is \"arousal\" behavior, a form of attention; when it reaches active resistance, it is regarded as a prerequisite to further learning. Otherwise, if the teacher challenges or dismisses this rejection, the desired learning of the new concept will likely be blocked. If however, the teacher shows that the objections are reasonable, understandable, and doubtless shared by others, the  learner becomes receptive to persuasion, accepts the new idea, and acquires a broader outlook. The teacher must decide when or whether to increase the pressure for change, encourage further expression of objection, or remove the pressure. Resistance should be expected, accepted, even welcomed as a significant step in the learner's growth. Unless the forces operating against the change are exposed and examined, they may remain to undermine acceptance of new concepts, whereas, if the learner is encouraged to resist openly, he is more likely to become receptive to change. The author lists seven relevant questions on which further research is needed. (HH)",

Development and use of new teaching aids were also urged. Reconvening in October 1968, the Commission agreed that need for technicians is still critical, that colleges must strengthen their programs (particularly with more funds now available), and that present problems must be alleviated concurrently with work on new ways to meet mounting and changing needs. One proposal reviewed (among several) was the re-organization of colleges into communications, behavioral science, social science, science and  math, and humanities departments--each with its related technologies. The Task Force on Science Education was urged to make the plight of technical education known to all scientists and enlist their help in its improvement, and to continue its study of two projects--on innovation and experimentation and on cooperative work-study. Five other projects were specified for the Task Force. It was concluded that colleges must devise new systems of technical education to replace the old predetermined offerings, that \"status\" must be clarified before student needs can be met, and that the increasing complexity of technology makes it essential to bring scientists and educators together.

Activity in this area has been independent and autonomous. This situation is now giving way to a new environment which involves cooperation, standards, and a rigorous rational analysis of the traditional raw materials and processes of librarianship. There is a genuine rapprochement between librarians and computer specialists, resulting in a scientific approach to the problems posed by the control and retrieval of bibliographic entities. It is observed that the design of systems dealing with bibliographic data must respond to pressures generated by the structure of the data itself, as well as to inter-system and user  requirements. These pressures can take effect on several levels, ranging from programming subroutines, to file structure, to the organization of access modes and output formats. Examples of each are provided. This is a critical period for library automation, for the standardization of machine input records, and for the design of retrieval systems dealing with these records. Decisions made today will affect the access to bibliographic data for decades to come. (Author/JB)",

Each member of such a network is viewed to have three capabilities: 1)answering questions directly from his own memory, 2)answering questions with the aid of library resources, and 3)referring the question to a member of the same network or to an expert outside it. Conditions are derived which involve each member's ability to choose appropriately among the three alternatives. If he judges correctly concerning when and where to refer a question, such a network, suitable organized, has greater net utility than does a reference librarian by himself. Mathematical models are used to formulate and analyze designs for the referential  consulting function. It is argued that the existence of such a network makes possible a much broader range of information service to the community than is afforded by traditional reference librarianship. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"The checklist and date distribution methods are used to evaluate the reference collections of two New Jersey Area Reference Libraries, an older, traditional single unit public library and a newer unit in a system of nine libraries. Three sectors of the reference collection are tested: reference books, abstracting and indexing services and serials. The date distribution method has merit as an evaluation device, while the checklist method presents several problems which prevent its being recommended immediately as a testing device. It was found that the newer library fares far better than the older one in the date distribution test and as well and generally better in the checklist test, which leads to a question about the choice of libraries best suited for a role of a Level II or  Area Reference Library. General recommendations are made for clearer definitions of the elements within the New Jersey library plan, for date distribution studies to be made of present and potential Area Libraries, and for systematic research and experimentation to continue. Specific recommendations provide a second step towards evaluation of the Level II reference collections, and recommendations are also made for the production of a Core List of reference materials common to the Level II libraries, a Union List of Unique Titles, and a Recommended List of Reference Titles tailored to the needs of New Jersey.

The project also produced an introductory manual for use by personnel involved in  the planning and operation of educational information centers. This manual was used as a text at the OE-sponsored institutes conducted during the summer of 1968 for the training of center personnel. A revised edition entitled &quot;The Educational Information Center: An Introduction&quot; will be available by mid-July, 1969. The project team attended the summer training institutes and, as the result of interviews with staffs and attendees and classroom observation, made recommendations for future institutes.

        "description":"As an integral part of the library improvement program of the Atlanta Public School System, the library aide program, funded under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, was developed to relieve librarians of routine clerical and nonprofessional duties. In order to evaluate the inservice training and library aide activities, adaptations of the locally developed multi-purpose instrument, &quot;Determining Task Assignments in Libraries&quot; (D-E-T-A-I-L), were used to (1) evaluate a summer workshop for librarians, (2) determine the nature and extent to which library services were performed for classroom teachers and pupils, and (3) determine the nature and extent to which library aides performed nonprofessional library tasks. The Atlanta-Library Aide Observation Survey  (A-LAOS) was used to ascertain the librarians' perception of the performance of library aides in the elementary schools, and a statistical report was made on the materials processed at the Central Processing Center. It was found that the library aide program has made it possible for librarians to assume more professional duties, that the planning and development of the Central Book Processing Center has been a significant success, and that the team work situations have been a major source of strength in the program. Specific recommendations are made for expanding and improving the program. Appendixes include a bibliography of 28 items and data from the D-E-T-A-I-L subtests. (Author/JB)",

Special concerns  of the Nassau Library System Service Center involve: service to the disadvantaged, service to the chronically ill and homebound, and talking book service. Other major survey findings were: (1) that many groups are concerned with improving their proficiency in providing library materials to their staffs and clienteles, and they need help with professional collections, supplementary loans, and staff workshops and (2) that one of the greatest gaps in library service in Nassau County is service in the county institutions.

The educational program, conducted in three schools, was devised to compensate for behavioral deficits and to reward positive behavior in culturally deprived children, ages 3 to 9. Children were individually assessed and rated by stages of achievement. As a result, all children made significant gains on standardized tests and performed at norms for the population. Teachers noted positive differences in the subjects' behavior. The three parent education programs, aimed at changing parental attitudes and behavior to positively influence their children's educational development, varied in practice. Although no instruments were used to test results, social workers and teachers reported increased involvement by parents.  Through workshops, team meetings, and consultant services, a teacher inservice program attempted to help teachers be more effective in working with culturally disadvantaged children. The teachers and program director noted changes in the teachers' behavior and feelings. For the next year, teachers would assess new students. There was still a need for accurate instruments to assess individual behavior. (JS)",

Approximately 2,000 kindergarten children from two large cities were divided into lower and middle income groups. One group from each income level used the School Mathematics Study Group curriculum, and one group from each used the Science Research Associates Program. A battery of tests (K01) was administered to the children in September to evaluate their ability upon entering kindergarten, and a second battery (K02) was administered in May to measure gain. The tests measured cognitive processes and mathematical achievement. The lower  socioeconomic group performed consistently less well than the middle income group on all K01 tests except the test of visual memory. This same pattern persisted in K02 tests, even though the entire sample showed significant mean score increases from K01 to K02. Differential gains were found, however, between the two income groups, the lower group showing a greater gain on five tests, the middle group showing a greater gain on three tests, and no difference existing on five tests.

It uses a computer analysis and display procedure for reducing Cartesian coordinate position data to numerical and graphical statements about movement patterns. A time-lapse photographic system is used to obtain the position data for children during play. This study explored (1) the potentialities and limitations of this new method and (2) the difference in movement patterns of preschool children with succeeding play sessions. Four groups of preschool children were filmed while engaging in a 15-minute play session during nursery school. Each group was filmed for nine sessions. The playroom was arranged the same way for the first six sessions. On the seventh, a novel apparatus was introduced. The  data analysis indicated that as a group the children showed less movement over succeeding sessions. The introduction of the novel object was accompanied by a substantial decrease in movement, with play gravitating to that object. Teacher presence was found to influence movement also. The findings of this study, coupled with suggested revisions of the method, indicate that the technique can be used successfully to collect and analyze children's movement patterns in a closed environment.

It was the purpose of the present study to develop a program to enhance the functioning of the lower class mother in language style. The lower class mother needs activities designed specifically to increase her confidence and her ability to affect the growth and learning of her child in a socially valued manner. Seven lower class mothers of North Philadelphia were introduced to a program in which they learned to tell stories to their children. In cooperation with the Get Set program, mothers and their preschool children attended sessions in which an attempt  was made (by engaging the participation of the mothers in reading and storytelling) to increase the quantity and quality of the mothers' verbalizations and to help the mothers to encourage their children to do so. High-interest preschool-level books were used. The language abilities of the mothers and children were measured by a battery of tests. The mothers showed a good deal of interest in the program; and although they were quite limited in education, they clearly increased their language abilities in several respects. (WD)",

The contents of the monograph are divided into two sections: (1) the program and (2) the evaluation. Eleven specific objectives of the program are delineated. Evaluation of the program took the form of measuring the degree of attainment of  these objectives as reflected in the tests, inventories, surveys, and questionnaires administered to the pupils and teachers.

Because learning disabilities are only part of a disordered developmental process in a child, both clinical and competence theory and practice are integrated in the psychoeducational approach to evaluation and modification of the developmental disorder. Some dilution and fragmentation of effort may occur in certain settings, but the basic principles and specific techniques of the psychoeducational approach are generally applicable. These basic principles are concerned with structure, predictability, and clarity; management of environmental and intrapsychic  stimulation; the success-failure dimension; the student-teacher realtionship; the utilization of therapy for a child and his parents; and biological factors. A discussion of instruction for remedial efforts includes these topics: the basic skill subjects, cognitive training, motor skill training, and the use of special media, content, skill programs, and methods.

Before 1940, the desirability of multidisciplinary study of the child had been well established, and child guidance clinics had appeared. Until the 1960's, however, the focus was on the clinical study of individual patients and families, rather than population studies, and generalizations were made from the former to the latter. Concern for the poor and the black was dormant for too long in the past quarter century; it is in such areas as poverty and racism that serious psychological and organic problems in children occur. Specifically, research in child development must  be concerned with many important factors, including (1) the \"test bias\" in interpreting results of achievement tests; (2) the prenatal and paranatal factors that influence brain development; (3) nutritional factors, before and after birth; (4) the psychosocial environment of the child, especially the family environment; (5) the influence and role of school; and (6) the effects of racism.

Children who were from economically deprived homes received tokens for positive behavior. The tokens were redeemable for recess privileges, ice cream, candy, and other such reinforcers. All tokens were spent on the day earned so that there would be no saving up for a rainy day. The results showed that minor as well as extreme negative behavior was modified. For example, one boy would throw his lunch and shoes into a waste basket upon arriving at school. He would also throw temper tantrums. After the teacher continually rewarded the children around him for their positive behavior, the boy joined class activities more readily and had fewer outbursts of temper. To  measure more effectively the results of the program, a pretest and posttest research design has been developed and is being tested with more traditional first grades. (JS)",

Generally, the Title I children lacked previous group experiences; that is, at the time they entered public school, they had not participated in kindergarten, nursery school, or any other preschool program. Many of the children had physical or emotional problems. The children tended to live in marginal or substandard housing in rapidly deteriorating neighborhoods. The measured intelligence of the children was below average, and their school performance was poor.  The family relationships of the children were disrupted by poverty, lack of education of parents, and broken-home situations.

The subjects of this study were 173 fifth graders, who were administered a paired-associate (PA) task and asked to identify the strategies they used. On the basis of this data, they were then placed into one of the three classes of strategies and administered a criterion PA task. Then the subjects were again asked to identify the strategies they used. One week later the subjects were given a retention PA task and asked upon the completion thereof to state the strategies used. During the criterion task, three types of experimenter-supplied mediators (simple, complex, and none) were distributed among the three subject groups. It  was discovered that complex-strategy children learned PA's at a significantly faster rate than simple-strategy children, with the intermediate group falling in-between. The complex experimenter-supplied mediator condition was the most effective for learning, regardless of subject-strategy style. On the retention test, the complex-strategy children again performed significantly better than simple-strategy children. Thus, mediational style was shown to be an important variable in accounting for individual differences in rate of learning and amount of retention. (WD)",

        "description":"Learning disabilities are generally due to a variety of disorders, from the biological to the environmental. Unfortunately, today, the tendency exists to seize upon one such disorder and to investigate the learning disability concept in that narrow view only. Evidence, however, suggests that a multifactor approach should be used and that system concepts and models should be developed to understand learning disability as a multidimensional disorder. One problem with such an approach is the difficulty in effecting a commonality of effort among the many professional disciplines involved in the subject of learning disability. In short, it might be said that there are difficulties in (1) conceptualizing multidimensionality: (2) deciding on the approach to use; and (3) applying the  multidimensional approach, once it is decided upon. On the basis of knowledge gained from an integrated systems approach used at the day care center at the University of Colorado Medical Center in Denver, it may be possible to create a coordinated plan to utilize the efforts of the various professional groups and to institute cross-communication between them, in order to establish the integrated approach necessary to the investigation and treatment of multidimensional learning disabilities.

We gain information about how such stimulus inputs are experienced by a child, for example, by his responses or outputs. Outputs are in the form of vocalizations and motor acts. Thus, the perceptual process is frequently called perceptual-motor. But the concern is not only with inputs and outputs, but with what goes on in between. This process is cognition; that is, cognition is the process of the input being organized and processed within the mind for a response. Therefore, a perceptual-cognitive-motor (PCM) process is involved. The term \"perceptual handicaps\" refers to deviations in this process from the expected norms at a given age. Learning disabilities constitute the whole of which  perceptual handicaps are a part. Perceptual handicaps do not necessarily indicate central nervous system damage; a deprived environment can affect the development of a child's perception, language, and cognition. Important to remedial PCM training procedures is the effective use of motivation to learn. Performance on tests and general behavior indexes should be considered in evaluation a child's PCM skills.

Her school is the subject of a film by Lillian Weber. The interview was conducted by Courtney Cazden of the Harvard Graduate School of Education. The substance of some of her remarks follow: (1) The major differences between the traditional grade school classroom and the new form used at Gordonbrock are (a) the former was teacher-directed; the latter is child-directed; and (b) the new form involves more concern for teaching something to the child when the child is ready, and this necessitates a good deal of individual or small-group instruction. (2) The teachers' daily lessons, although preplanned, are not rigid, but fluid, depending upon how  the teacher-pupil interaction develops during the class period. (3) Much of the instruction is done, not with the whole class of pupils, but with smaller groups who have demonstrated the need for a particular type of instruction. (4) The classrooms are composed of about 40 children from ages five to seven. (5) The teachers keep informal records on each child's progress and abilities so as to be aware at all times of what type of instruction is relevant or necessary for him. (WD)",

        "description":"In the industrial Midlands of England, the County Education Authority in Leicestershire County has jurisdiction over approximately 250 primary schools and 50 secondary schools. A child attending an infant or junior school works at his own pace, is creative and spontaneous, and learns on his own terms. Principals are given complete autonomy and may innovate or experiment without interference. Within this nonrestrictive system, educational issues are discussed with the Advisory Center, which is composed of educators who are available to consult with teachers. A problem exists because some of the schools in the county, particularly secondary schools, do not subscribe to this system of education. University admission is based almost entirely on difficult, standardized examinations,  which children take at the end of secondary school. This report describes the classroom environment of two infant schools (for ages 5 to 7), two junior schools (for ages 7 to 11), one primary (infant and junior) school, and two high schools (for ages 11 to 15).

A teacher visits each child's home every other week to conduct a tutorial session lasting 1 1/2 hours. Three objectives of the program are (1) to develop a preschool curriculum based on Piaget's theory of sequential development of intelligence, (2) to develop a model of curriculum innovation in a school system utilizing a theorist, a diffuser, and a teacher, and (3) to develop a group parent education program. Goals of the preschool curriculum are (1) to facilitate the movement of the children from the sensory-motor period to the preoperational period and (2) to help children move from the concrete to the symbolic level.  The theorist derives specific goals from the abstract theory, which serves as the foundation for the program. The master teacher (diffuser) translates these goals into specific teaching activities and works with the classroom teacher (chosen for her interest in a new curriculum and her willingness to try unorthodox approaches), who provides feedback relevant to the effectiveness of the curriculum. In a pilot program in 1968, involving 20 children, the mean gain on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale was 13.7 points. (DO)",

        "description":"The main focus of this project was the improvement of the understanding of spoken language by lower class kindergarten children. Thus, the project was concerned with (1) identifying areas in which young children are deficient in listening skills, (2) preparing and evaluating instructional programs for the improvement of these skills, and (3) testing under classroom conditions a hypothesis regarding the value of having children speak aloud in developing listening and comprehension skills. Six studies were conducted to obtain information on the pupils' deficiencies, to use the programs constructed to improve the deficiencies, and to investigate the hypothesis. Several of the six studies used subjects other than lower class kindergarten pupils for control or comparison purposes. The  results of the studies indicated that (1) lower class children use a restricted language code, especially with regard to function words, and (2) instructions to verbalize and the subsequent overt responses have measurable value where there is a direct correspondence between the stimulus and the verbal response. However, the effect of oral responding was much less clear when the material was more complex. An important contribution of this project to education was the development and evaluation of a number of replicable instructional programs accompanied by criterion test items. (WD)",

Pretests were administered before prekindergarten. Two posttests were given, one after prekindergarten and the other after kindergarten. Evaluation was hampered by a loss of subjects, by an arrangement in which only subsamples  were tested, and by the use of various tests. The results on the Columbia Mental Maturity Scale showed that for the subsamples drawn from the first experimental wave and the basic control group, the difference in the means were not statistically significant on pretests, yet they were significant on the first posttest but not on the second posttest.

The experimentals were 4- to 5-year-old lower class, predominantly Negro, children. For 2 years they received instruction 2 hours daily, 5 times a week, in a group where the pupil-teacher ratio was five to one. To induce learning at an above-average rate, positive and negative reinforcers were used. A comparison group was pretested and posttested. After the first year of instruction, results from the Stanford-Binet showed a gain of 17.14 points for the experimental group; the comparison group showed a gain of 8.07 points. After the second year of instruction, the experimental group gained an additional 8.61 points; the comparison group lost 2.96  points. Interviews with parents and observations of the participating children revealed no behavioral problems after the second week of instruction and no regressive behavior in general. (JS)",

Together they provided a data base which identified prominent educational problems characteristic of impoverished urban and rural settings. As opposed to random sampling, an extreme group sampling procedure was adopted to specify problems peculiar to the least affluent rural teaching context. These rural, disadvantaged schools were identified first by county and then by the most disadvantaged elementary schools within these counties. The principal instrument used was the Teacher Problem Inventory (TPI) used for the first study and expanded by rural school teachers to  include a few specific problems. The expanded TPI was administered to 354 teachers. The responses were then classified on the basis of frequency or severity scales. Only those significant items weighted in the direction of the often or serious categories were reported. Comparisons of the data from both studies were made which show great similarities and notable differences, which are further depicted with tables. (CM)",

This change is attributed to increased agricultural efficiency and to expansion of industry and military services. From 1960 to 1966 the net out-migration averaged 804,000 persons per year from farm to city. Urban dwellers generally have completed more years of schooling, with rural non-farm people next and farm people having the lowest educational attainment. Rural farm and non-farm income has been shown to be substantially below that of the urban dweller. Two major factors seem to contribute to this situation: (1) earning capacities are low; and (2) incomes attained are below earning capacity. The most significant factors concerning small  communities as they pertain to the educator are that small communities have fewer children than urban systems have, have a smaller proportion of adults, and have a larger number of older and dependent people. These factors must figure highly in educational planning for small communities. (DA)",

These rural women were found to be less educated, slightly older, and willing to work for relatively low wages when compared to all working women in the nation. The working women  studied indicated favorable attitudes toward their work situation.

This study focused on the educational and occupational aspiration levels and 10 selected family factors of the students. Statistical analysis of data, collected by means of questionnaires, indicated that both educational and occupational aspiration levels related significantly to the following family factors: size of community orientation; socioeconomic status; father's occupational status; father's educational achievement; and strength of father's and mother's encouragement for post-high school education. Mother's educational  achievement related to both aspiration categories of the boys, but failed to relate significantly to occupational aspirations of girls. Religious background associated significantly with both aspiration levels for boys. Ethnic background and normal versus broken home situations failed to relate significantly. (SW)",

Specific teacher aide duties have been developed for routine record-keeping, small group and individual instruction, and supervisory activities. Teacher aides are used in ungraded primary grades, in intermediate grades, and to assist nurses, librarians, and home visitation officers. The aides are trained in operation of equipment, reporting procedures, and classroom operations through inservice training programs. Three aides attended a summer institute for teacher aides at Northern Arizona University for undergraduate credit. Seniors in high school who wish to become teacher aides upon  graduation may participate in a 28-week training program during which time they receive $1.25 an hour. (JH)",

Two principal factors pointed out as enhancing the chances of successful adjustment are the existence of a training and counseling program for the guidance workers before relocation and the availability of mobility money for relocation expenses. The second paper deals with the power structure of small communities, based on the comparison of 2 communities in Texas with widely divergent types of economic  bases. (JM)",

A questionnaire, disseminated to over 1,500 rural teachers in 10 rural states, was utilized to gather the data for the study. Seven findings led to the conclusions that rural teachers needed preparation different from that of  urban teachers, teacher education programs were not meeting the needs of rural teachers, personal identification with and liking for the rural community were important factors in teacher satisfaction with the rural school, the main advantages of the rural school were the opportunity for personal interaction with the students and the opportunity to belong to the rural community; lack of facilities was a widely noted disadvantage. Numerous recommendations were developed for teacher preparation programs and for further research. Sample size and questionnaire methods are noted among the limitations.

No single attribute characterizes any large proportion of Mexican Americans, and the many potential differences among Mexican Americans can be depicted on a three-dimensional cube, consisting of belief systems, regional differences, and socioeconomic  status. The dominant culture and the Chicanos themselves should recognize the undesirability of stereotyping; this awareness should help to free Chicanos to make socioeconomic gains, to adopt a new way of life, and to participate freely in both cultures.

Academic ability differences between the 2 ethnic groups as measured by achievement tests were found to be the direct result of the teaching provided by the school.  Further results indicated the following sources of influence on pupil performance: (1) family educational level was the most important for both groups, with family economic level contributing less; (2) pupil attitudes and values were important for both groups at all grade levels; (3) social context of the school contributed substantially to the performance of Mexican Americans at the elementary and junior high levels and minimally at the senior high level; and (4) English usage made a positive contribution for Mexican American pupils at all grade levels.

The next step is the translation between auditory and visual information as well as between temporal and spatial organizations. The factors contributing to such translations are divided into six subprocesses: auditory sequence perception, visual sequence perception, temporal sequence perception, spatial sequence perception, audiovisual integration, and temporal-spatial integration. Nine tests were devised to measure the ability of 40 third graders in these six subprocesses. The tests were based on sequences of dots or beeps to be paired with or differentiated from other sequences. It was hypothesized that the three tests based on the subprocesses requiring no  translation would be the easiest; this hypothesis was not confirmed. Difficulty was determined by the stimulus modality of the first pattern which had to be remembered for comparison with the second. A mean of 2.43 errors occurred on tests having a visual-spatial pattern first. A mean of 5.35 errors occurred when an auditory-temporal or visual-temporal pattern was first. Sequence perception scores showed low relationships with reading scores. (WL)",

Reading ability might be considered as a continuum ranging from lexia to dyslexia with no implication regarding the cause of the disability. Instead of labeling the child with a reading problem a failure, present teaching techniques should be evaluated on the basis of their effectiveness in individual situations. The initial stages of learning to read comprise a highly complex perceptual learning function that varies from child to child, and current reading tests frequently do not measure these differences. Until better tests are developed, it is the teacher's responsibility to diagnose individual differences in learning styles. A suggested model for classroom diagnosis provides all students with  a rich language experience program that allows early identification of quick perceptual learners. The slower learners could then be given special attention through the use of various individualized approaches to the teaching of reading. (BS)",

The reading consultant should have the full cooperation of the entire staff. He should examine the strengths and weaknesses of the reading program through observation, questionnaires, conference with teachers, and examination of test results. He  should make himself available and seek out those who may not be aware they need his services.

Since learning is a process which builds sequentially on past learning, beginning reading materials should include words that have personal relevance for the individual child. Meaningful material is learned more quickly than nonsense syllables. Materials related to the child's experiences are more easily comprehended by him. The development of attitudes and interests cannot be measured by reading tests, but do contribute to reading growth. According to Blom, Waite, and Zinet (1968), the content of preprimers, primers, and first-grade readers is remote from the child's life. While he is keenly interested in the world around him, his reading stresses family  attachment, younger siblings, and ambiguity in sex roles. Anthromorphic and animistic thinking which the child is exposed to are thought to be barriers to his intellectual development. Natural sentences of normal length often are understood more easily than short, artificial ones which are remote from the true language experience and normal speech patterns the child is familiar with.

Each year the study was evaluated by the Stanford Achievement Test, the San Diego County Inventory of Reading Attitude, and a record of the number of books read independently. Additional random sample testing was done with individually administered tests. The original population, composed of 415 first graders in five  classrooms per treatment, decreased to 262 pupils at the end of grade 3. In grade 1, while basal reader pupils read the most books, the other three programs generally appeared to help children to higher silent achievement. By the end of grade 3 the phonics approach scored significantly higher on Paragraph Meaning and Spelling than did the basal or combination classes. The phonics program was also favored significantly over the combination program at the end of third grade. At the same time the basal group scored significantly lower than the other three groups on Word Study Skills. Other significant differences are also reported. Tables are included. (CM)",

The measures selected for study were (1) number of T-units (communication units) spoken in an experimental situation, (2) mean length of T-unit, (3) ratio of subordinate clause length to T-unit length, (4) ratio of sentence-combining transformations to T-units, (5) percent of words at Thorndike-Lorge frequency levels 1 and 2, (6) percent of words at Thorndike-Lorge frequency levels 3-5, and (7) the type-token ratio. Subjects were 60 first-grade pupils from six suburban schools representing three socioeconomic levels. No single language measure nor any combination of these measures was found to have as much value in predicting reading achievement as did the  Metropolitan Readiness Test (MRT). Certain combinations of the experimental language measures added significantly to the value of the MRT i n predicting first-grade achievement in both word recognition and comprehension. Mean T-unit length added significantly to the value of the readiness test in predicting comprehension. Other findings and conclusions are offered. Tables and references are included. (Author/CM)",

The task was to assign to the artificial word a meaning which would fit all sentence contexts in the series. Preliminary data provided an estimate of the probability that a particular sentence, presented in isolation, would elicit a correct response. The sentence most likely to elicit a correct response in a particular series was called the \"best\" sentence. Two presentation orders were used: from best to worst and worst to best. There were two response conditions: one in which the subject responded after each sentence in a series, and one in which he responded only after hearing the entire series. Analysis of variance indicated  that significantly more correct responses occurred with the best-to-worst presentation order. Number of responses and the interaction of this factor with presentation orde r were nonsignificant effects. Further analysis suggested that, with the worst-to-best order, early sentences tended to interfere with normal processing of subsequent sentences. Tables and references are included. (Author/CM)",

The biology students in the 1963-64 school year were taught by a team-teacher approach which included large-group presentations. During the second year, the students enrolled in biology were taught through the team approach except that televised teacher presentations were substituted for large-group presentations. Tests were administered pre- (STEP Test, Form 2B, Science and The Metropolitan Science Test), mid- (unit exams in botany, zoology, physiology, and genetics), and post- (investigator constructed exam and Cooperative Biology Test, Form X) experiment. Concluded were that (1) students instructed in large groups  earned significantly higher scores on the botany unit test, the Cooperative Biology Test, and the Wausau Final Test than did the students receiving television presentations, (2) students instructed through television presentations earned significantly higher scores on the genetics-unit test than did students instructed in large groups, and (3) all mean differences for the biology achievement tests existed in the same direction for both high ability and average ability students. Student attitudes were favorable to both modes of instruction. (RS)",

Student IQ and the belief that the parents thought education important, related most significantly to achievement. Success was not related to either the size of the high school or the size of the college attended, and students of the same IQ received substantially the same grades in one type of institution of  higher education as they did in another.

Role-playing requires a student to assume an identity other than his own to increase his understanding of another person; sociodrama adds the element of problem solving for the role-players, usually in a simple verbal model; and simulation, the most complex, incorporates both techniques into a game structure. In preparing any of the techniques the teacher first must select the social process to be reproduced and the concepts and objectives to be comprehended and achieved, and secondly he must determine whether the illustrative situation  will be hypothetical or a replication of actuality. The situation must be thoroughly researched by the teacher, who is responsible for constructing the model and making his students aware of the purposes and theory related to their experience. For simulation, the game as well as devices to indicate power relationships must be designed. An annotated bibliography is included to provide the teacher with background information on the theory of the techniques, concrete examples and instructions concerning its uses, and materials enabling him to analyze a political process and construct a verbal model.

To attain accreditation in most states, paraprofessionals must participate in a college program of teacher education. Most colleges, geared to the needs of the middle-class white student, have not served the disadvantaged because of the defeatist attitudes towards these students held in colleges, high admission standards, and the inherent subjectivity and lack of accuracy in present teacher potential evaluation criteria. (In many colleges this is the result of a confusion between academic and professional standards.)  However, the success of programs such as The City University of New York's Paraprofessional Teacher Education program (which integrates a teacher education curriculum with paraprofessional work) shows that demands for a college education for the economically disadvantaged are slowly being met.

In the past year major strides have been made in organizing these human service workers to satisfy their concerns for better services, closer community ties, and new avenues of advancement. Representative of the trend was the formation of a National Association of New Careerists (growing out of the 1968 New Careers National Council) which now has participants in 22 cities. Such associations can work in harmony with present public service unions in education, health, welfare, and government employment. Minimum demands such as training, upgrading, and changing of testing requirements are not antithetical to  traditional union positions, while such demands as participation, community involvement, change in the character of service, and rights of workers in a broader sense may require the new types of organization. Since it seems likely that demands by the new public employees unions will affect public service employees at all levels, union strategy should be planned so that benefits for paraprofessionals are not obtained at the expense of the older, higher groups.

Teaching activities are being observed and described because other research methods, which search for what is \"good\" in teaching, have not yielded many discoveries or intellectually substantial information about a profession that is central in human affairs. Descriptive research has primarily confined itself, however, to the public interactive moments of teaching while neglecting the more private moments that illuminate the teaching process and pertain as much if not more than the public to conceptualization of the teaching task, justification of teacher-training requirements, and teacher evaluation. Private moments include preparing for the classroom  (preactive teaching) and working with students individually either when other students are present but separately occupied (semi-private teaching) or when alone (private teaching). If we look at what teaching really is, we might find that the teacher's actual goal is student involvement rather than learning (hoped for as a by-product, however), and that the teacher's chief contribution to learning (what the student \"gets\") is choosing the best activity for a student.

The descriptive research of today, even if it were to correlate teaching behavior and learning, would still share a drawback with the research on noncognitive variables: studying teaching and teachers as they are restricts the quality of teaching to that of today's best teachers. What is needed, as Stolurow proposes, are models of the teaching process which would embody computer-based facilities for programed instruction and would predict learning outcomes that can be tested and corrected. Programed instruction has the benefit of being able to cope with the complexity of teaching (a  factor in the difficulty of determining what in teaching behavior influences learning) and the momentary as well as permanent differences among students. Such a new approach would permit isolation of specific cognitive aspects such as oral explanations. (A 14-item reference list is included.) (LP)",

Each minicourse is provided with a specific  behavioral objective which is realized through the means of a clearly presented overt teaching skill. In a skill discrimination check to determine evaluative ability, students classify behaviors from short film clips and a model lesson, and model their behavior after that of a model teacher. Two basic reasons account for the success of this program: reinforcement derived from seeing oneself on video tape and reinforcement derived from the emphasis on and perception of student behavior change in association with increased proficiency in a skill.

Data, collected from systematic observations by four trained observers using a 13-category modification of the Flanders System of Interaction Analysis, were submitted to an IBM 1410 computer which produced matrices and information sheets weekly for the 40 students. Only the 20 designated as the &quot;feedback group&quot; (experimental) received the weekly matrices and information sheets. Data were analyzed by means of a Lindquist Type I analysis of  variance, and F-tests for group means difference were computed for each of the 24 selected dependent variables. Findings included these: The experimental group used significantly less teacher-initiated talk and significantly more student-initiated talk than did the control group. They also used more praise, more extended use of student ideas, and less corrective feedback. They accepted and clarified student ideas more, criticized students less, asked more questions, and gave fewer directions. (Implications for preservice and inservice programs are discussed.) (JS)",

Point 2 is the  Local School Committee, elected by teachers and administration, whose chairman is often a university professor assisted by graduate students. At Point 3, the Teachers and Administration perform evaluation under the auspices of the Local Committee, preferably with the aid of someone trained in observation techniques.

Student teachers were given Bogardus' Ethnic Distance Scale and Hinckley's Attitude Toward the Negro Scale to measure prejudice and a semantic differential scale to assess eight characteristics of teaching (such as rigidity and conformity) hypothesized to be related to prejudice. Content analyses of supervisor reports provided information about each student's behavior with regard to 22 characteristics (e.g., enthusiasm, self-confidence,  adaptability). Analysis of variance, t test, and correlational procedures were used to derive the findings. No significant differences were found between the three groups. Prejudice toward Negroes was found to be greater than toward other ethnic groups. Correlations indicated that students rated high on presentation-communication, enthusiasm, professional attitude, and sense of humor evidenced less prejudice than others, and those who had difficulty assuming responsibility and accepting constructive criticism evidenced significantly more prejudice than others.

Subjects were 32 experienced elementary school teachers, 16 of whom attended five 2-hour training sessions in the use of the Teacher Practices Observation Record (TPOR) and all of whom took the Personal Beliefs Inventory and the Teacher Practices Inventory to measure beliefs. Both groups viewed two films of classroom teacher behavior and used the TPOR to record observed behavior twice, once 10 weeks after training and again 10 weeks after  that. Reliability coefficients were computed for between-observer agreement and within-observer agreement (the stability of an observer's response over time). These and criterion validity coefficients were used as responses in linear multiple regression analysis. Conclusions were that if observers share a common perceptual framework (as these did), between-observer agreement can be achieved easily with little or no training, but within-observer reliability is difficult to achieve. Therefore , training should focus on establishing the reliability of the individual observer. (JS)",

Many student teachers revealed in interviews that they went through humiliation, trauma, and disenchantment with teaching in their interactions with cooperating teachers, with other school personnel, and with children in the student teaching experience. This psychological turmoil is parallel to Van Gennep's theory of transition (THE RITES OF PASSAGE) in which drastic change in social status is handled in a three-phased way: separation from the previous context (the sense of disenchantment and loss of idealism shown by student teachers), transformation of individual social attributes and behavior (the adoption of new priorities by the student teacher), and reincorporation of  individuals into the social group (the graduation to the teaching profession of the student teacher). A harsh induction into a new role may submerge the idealism of a student, or it may force his acceptance of a new reality (a coming to terms with the mythology in his beliefs) leading to his acceptance of new, more pragmatic beliefs. A study should be made to determine how damaging this transitional period is to the indoctrination which has taken place in teacher training colleges. (SM)",

Each student teacher was then requested to write an informal test which would measure pupil attainment of a specific reading objective and fulfill three criteria: it would require a pupil response, would describe an adequate response, and would resemble the three reading categories as defined by the investigators. The same 20 tests were graded by four investigators to  improve reliability. Each program part or reading area was administered in sequence and had four treatment groups: pretest-program-posttest (A), pretest-posttest (B), program-posttest (C), and posttest (D).

After identifying six areas covered in general secondary methods courses, two researchers independently constructed a series of statements representing attitudes, ideas, and dispositions about each area and jointly constructed a 50-item scale and key allowing four possible responses to each item. The instrument was administered on a pre-post basis to beginning education students to measure learning and dispositions before and after a general methods course to determine the direction and extent of changed behavior due to course influences. A series of exploratory studies at Northern Illinois University indicated that OSIPS had potential for predicting  achievement in student teaching. Test-retest studies conducted at the University of Alabama (N-122), Northern Illinois University (N-86), and Ohio State University (N-190) supported the reliability of OSIPS. A combination of statistical treatments were performed to assess the validity of individual items and the internal consistency. There is sufficient evidence to justify continued reliance upon the general theory used to construct OSIPS and to support its reliability and validity, but there is an apparent need to modify it by increasing the number of items and the range of responses to each.

The success or failure of a teacher in his relationship with students depended first on his ability to relate to them personally--his attempt to understand the reasons behind their problems, his willingness to listen and admit his own shortcomings, and his concern first for the students and secondly for subject matter. His success in subject matter presentation depended upon the degree to which his students could relate to the material and upon his own flexibility, dynamism,  and willingness to expend more than minimum effort. All successful teaching generated an atmosphere of positive acceptance of the students. The diploma program succeeded where the skill training did not for reasons which included the attitude of the administrator and teachers, scheduling, and the value attached to a diploma. Schools or programs for the disadvantaged should include individualized instruction and flexible scheduling and encompass a teacher education program that breaks down middle-class thinking.

Each of the 10 Flanders verbal categories (based on direct and indirect teacher influence) is combined with relevant dimensions of nonverbal behavior on a continuum ranging from encouraging to restricting interaction. The categories are: (1) accepts student feeling; (2) praises and encourages (congruent-incongruent); (3) uses student idea (implement-perfunctory); (4) asks questions (personal-impersonal); (5) lectures or gives information (responsive-unresponsive); (6) gives directions (involve-dismiss); (7) criticizes or justifies authority (firm-harsh); (8)  student talk, response (receptive-inattentive); (9) student talk, initiated (receptive-inattentive); (10) silence or confusion (comfort-distress). The Indirect-Direct/Encouraging-Restrictive (IDER) system encompasses instances in which only nonverbal behavior influences interaction and those in which nonverbal cues accompany verbal communication. By marking a slash (encouraging) or dash (restrictive) to the right of the recorded tallies, an observer can record both verbal and nonverbal dimensions within the three-second time intervals, and data can b e plotted on an IDER matrix (four 10x10 quadrants) providing four areas of study.

(Microsimulated teaching, as developed at West Virginia University, combines microteaching with simulation; the trainee teaches brief lessons to four other trainees who play roles corresponding to those indicated in a description of a hypothetical class.) Forty subjects in the methods and student teaching classes were randomly assigned to the four treatment groups, and RCS data for three 20-minute student teaching performances were  collected for each. Analysis of variance was calculated from the computerized data (measures of the 21 dependent variables, the verbal behaviors measured by RCS). Duncan's New Multiple Range Test and the Sign Test were employed to locate differences and determine general trends. The concurrent arrangment of microsimulated teaching experiences was found to be the most effective organizational pattern of the methods and student teaching block when offered with formal training in interaction analysis.

The Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory was administered as a pretest during the initial meetin g of each group, as a posttest on completion of the program, and as a resiliency test six months after completion of the program. Results showed that while postinstitute scores are  encouraging when compared to preinstitute scores, there was a regression in both groups to preinstitute levels after six months.

Two days of a six-day summer workshop were spent in structured game-like exercises designed to increase awareness of interpersonal work processes.. In the remaining days, the faculty moved through a problemsolving sequence, working on issues they thought were thwarting the organizational functioning of the school: insufficient role clarity; failure to draw upon staff resources; low staff involvement; and low participation at meetings of committees and area groups. A three-day December intervention included communication exercises, problemsolving techniques,  decisionmaking procedures, and skill development in group observations and feedback. The two-day session in February took stock of how the staff had progressed in solving problems of resource use, role clarity, and staff participation. Questionnaires, interviews, written reactions, and observations revealed that substantial organizational change had occurred during the year; more faculty members were involved more in organizational problemsolving and decisionmaking after the training than before. The project was also evaluated with a pretest-posttest design which included several comparison schools. (JS)",

Study 2 investigates which type  of lesson recording would yield ratings closest to actual classroom ratings and which teacher behaviors pupils observed with a free-response instrument. The latter investigation's finding, that good teaching and cognitive activities are consistently related, is supplemented in study 3 which categorizes 27 teachers behaviors (such as rule-example-rule presentation) in an attempt to apply objective measurement to rating teacher effectiveness .

Subjects were divided into four groups--one for control and three for feedback treatment, which involved minimally one or more personal interviews with a psychologist (Assessment Feedback). The first feedback group received only Assessment Feedback; the second, in addition to receiving Assessment Feedback, was permitted to view the sound films (Behavior Feedback); and the third, after receiving Behavior Feedback, was placed in student teaching situations judged maximally facilitating by observers. In general,  students with feedback evidenced more self-confidence, classroom ease, and positive attitudes toward observation procedures. In regard to two propositions about feedback (students would become more receptive to pupil feedback and would increase characteristics related to effective teaching), changes were not observed between different treatment groups but rather between the beginning and end of preparation and between polled experimental and control subjects. Striking differences between elementary and secondary education majors were recorded.

Multivariate composite scores derived from interaction analysis data were used to classify 180 elementary school students (who had the same teacher for grades 1 through 3, and a different teacher in grade 4) as having experienced one of four teaching behavior combinations: indirect or direct all four years; indirect for three years and direct in the fourth year; and direct with indirect in the fourth year. Student responses to a creative thinking test composed within the framework of two forms of creative expression, verbal and figurative, were compared with their teacher behavior experience. Results suggest that verbal creativity  is fostered more under the influence of indirect teacher behaviors, and that figural creative potentialities are encouraged more under the influence of consistent patterns of teaching behaviors. It would seem, then, that consistently indirect teaching behavior would encourage the growth of both verbal and figural creativ e expression. (A four-item bibliography is included.) (SM)",

The sequence graph consists of a series graph in which the series are joined according to specified behavioral pattern conventions and placed on a horizontal line indicating time at three-second intervals. A graph summary, presenting the information contained in the graph in sequence classes (more manageable units consisting of related sequences) is then constructed. However, because this summarization distorts time and sequence  relationships, a miscellaneous class and a time duration notation system were devised. Therefore, each interaction sequence graph reflects the teaching patterns of a given teacher for a given classroom period and can be compared (using a representative graph) to similar data for other teachers.

Sixteen observation records of interaction sequences for each teacher showed that teacher A exhibited the most complex system of verbal instructional techniques characterized by a very rapid rate of teacher pupil interaction; teacher B (displaying patterns intermediate between teachers A and C) was characterized by a lecture-question-answer sequence with a great number of student-initiated responses; and teacher C had a consistent, recurring pattern of extended lecture with short student responses to questions. An Interaction Sequence Graph (based on Flanders' 10  categories of interaction) was constructed from observation records. Comparisons of the teachers' patterns in the graphs (made in terms of those sequences which appeared in every observation record, those which appeared in half, and those which appeared in less than half) showed that each teacher did exhibit a repeating pattern of verbal instructional techniques, but because each teacher exhibited such diversity, it was not possible to demonstrate a common pattern among all three teachers.

To evaluate the effectiveness of a department's organization, such factors as the department chairman, the authority structure, the written curriculum guide, the physical arrangements, and the climate of the department must be taken into account. The relation of the departmental  organization to curriculum development and to the problems of staffing and supervising teachers are additional factors.

The specific stage innovations in this production included (1) actors performing on stage in front of a backdrop of moving pictures to give the effect of \"alive-ness,\" (2) sequences of live action on stage interspersed with the action  moved completely to the screen, and (3) scenes in which actors onstage conversed with actors on film.

        "description":"The teacher of literature can help children become aware of and sensitive to the world around them--its beauty, good, and evil. In teaching poetry, the teacher must choose poems he likes, read them aloud to the students, lead class discussions about student reactions to poems, and allow students to write and to memorize poetry for enjoyment. The teaching of drama should proceed from miming, charades, and one-act plays to full-length plays. Prose should be taught to be enjoyed, to make children conversant with a wide range of books, and to allow them to formulate moral concepts of the world around them. Although examinations cannot test sensitivity to literature, they are valid teaching devices and can measure interest, enthusiasm, and breadth of reading. Tests can require  students to evaluate critically a poem that they have not studied. In addition, tests can become increasingly more thorough as the children advance in school, proceeding from questions requiring simple descriptions of a character to more complex delineations of the central theme of a book.

Four areas of language usage and reading readiness are stressed--auditory discrimination or phonology, letter discrimination, stylistics, and morphology, grammar, and syntax. The presentation recommends that verbal behavior be developed in a stimulus-response situation that reinforces conditioned oral responses through repetition and the use of various materials and motivational techniques. Numerous activities and exercises are included to develop in preschool children such language skills as the recognition of sound-symbol relationships, initial consonant and vowel sounds and blends, rhyming  words, and complete sentences.

Students respond to cultural stimuli other than books, however; and since many justifications for traditionally narrow English courses are demonstrably not valid, English subject matter should be broadened to include methods of communication other than writing. In grade 9, students could listen to records, stage plays, view films and slides, and write about the relationships among these presentations of reality. In grade 10, teachers could tailor their English writing assignments to the subject content and writing assignments in other courses. In grade 11, a major work of literature could be used to draw many ideas together, or various arts could be studied  individually. In grade 12, students could take up more difficult classical ideas and examine contemporary methods of expression. Through such a program the student would acquire a better understanding of modern communications and of the media available for artistic expression. (LH)",

The papers deal with the general lack of knowledge about children in our culture and the too frequent failure to reach them, the reasons for the failure of higher education to encourage competent teaching, the results of cooperation between the disciplines and education, possible influences that higher education might have on public schools, the effect of more adequate professional training in clinical schools, and the problem  of training teachers to allow children to think and to imagine.

Survey questions asked whether or not the universities presently required certain specific courses in liberal arts and in education as well as whether or not such courses should be required. Liberal arts courses surveyed were foreign language, speech, oral composition, creative dramatics, written composition, the nature of the English language, American and English literature, and literature in a foreign language; education courses were the sociological and psychological bases of teaching, observation of children in schools, methods of teaching reading and language, children's literature, and  student teaching.

In acquiring the degree, the student must master material, acquire &quot;professional&quot; attitudes, and evaluate himself against a scientific standard that will often contradict normal human values. Because of these circumscribed interests and the fact that English Ph. D. candidates frequently receive little teacher training, most English professors are not concerned with the problems of teaching English at the elementary, secondary, or even college-freshman levels. College professors should become aware of needs in the teaching of elementary writing. They  should bring their critical ability and devotion to literature to bear on the production of children's anthologies, such as &quot;Children and Books.&quot; They must devise, for teachers, courses in critical explication, linguistics, and children's literature; they must publish in periodicals read by non-college teachers; and they must visit classrooms to become aware of the difficulties and challenges of elementary and secondary education.

Word-referent relationships ranging from denotation to connotation are illustrated by (1) Susanne Langer's analysis of the relationships between words and their referents, (2) selections from Paul Wendt and Vance Packard which point out the dimensions of extra-linguistic meaning, and (3) selections from Charlton Laird and S. I. Hayakawa which demonstrate referential and  expressive meaning and the primacy of spoken language.
