The GATB consists of 12 tests which measure nine aptitudes: General Learning Ability; Verbal Aptitude; Numerical Aptitude; Spatial Aptitude; Form Perception; Clerical Perception; Motor Coordination; Finger Dexterity; and Manual Dexterity. The aptitude scores are standard scores with 100 as the average for the general working population, and a standard deviation of 20. Occupational norms are established in terms of minimum qualifying scores for each of the significant aptitude measures which, when combined, predict job performance. Cutting scores  are set only for those aptitudes which aid in predicting the performance of the job uties of the experimental sample.

This is based on the premise that one successful initial approach to the improvement and individualization of instruction is through the improvement of teacher-made tests. Presented in this operational guide for teacher workshops are eleven Instructional Sessions, they are: One--Educational Objectives; Two--Defining Global Objectives; Three--Behavioral Objectives; Four--Hierarchy of Learning Behaviors; Five--Purposes of Achievement Testing; Six--Techniques of Measurement; Seven--Multiple-Choice Items; Eight--Basic Statistical Measures; Nine--Test Analysis Interpretation  of Computer Output; Ten--Validity and Reliability; and Eleven--The Liaison Role of the Workshop Participant.

        "description":"A report on the evaluation Workshop to define school objectives is presented. The three-week workshop in defining and measuring objectives in the areas of interests, attitudes and values was held at Emerson School in Elmhurst, Illinois. Some questions studied by the workshop group include the following: Can interests, attitudes, and values be measured?; Is there a continuum of affect, as in the cognitive domain?; Are there published instruments available?; How can examiners be certain that feelings are reported honestly? Participants included teachers from grades K-12 in mathematics, language arts, social studies, science, and foreign languages. This report is an attempt to disseminate both the information presented to the teachers and samples of the products of their efforts.  Hopefully, readers of this report will be motivated to construct objectives and instruments of their own using these examples as models. (Author/LS)",

        "description":"The program of the Bilingual Mini-School, funded under Title VII of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act, and located in a junior high school in that area of Manhattan commonly characterized as East Harlem, was designed to reach the junior high school student who had had all his previous schooling in Spanish, as well as those students who, having been taught in English, have achieved poorly as a result of inadequate English facility. The program at this school represents the first attempt in New York City at a bilingual program for junior high school children. Approximately 72 seventh graders and 44 eighth graders were selected to participate in the program. Eighty-five are Spanish speaking, while 31 are English speaking. The key personnel are bilingual. The general  objective of the bilingual program is to prepare children more adequately for the higher academic instruction of high school than has been accomplished in the past. By providing instruction via a language they now know best, by fostering pride in the culture of their parents, and by encouraging active participation of their parents in school affairs, it is hoped this goal will be accomplished.

        "description":"Biculturalism implies much more than bilingualism. Bilingualism has been defined in a variety of ways, but perhaps the most commonly accepted definition is varying degrees of understanding of two languages. But biculturalism implies knowing and being able to operate successfully in two cultures. This means knowing two modes of behavior, and knowing the beliefs, values, customs, and mores of two different groups of people. The language used at a particular time and place would have the referents in the culture the language represents. Not \"all little children are alike\": children are different because cultures force all of them to think, react, value, believe, and act in certain modes. It appears that one even learns in very distinct patterns because of cultural differences.  Teachers must accept these differences in students and start working to provide equal educational opportunity in the classrooms. One could capitalize on the language children bring to school. The students have already internalized the sound patterns of a language and their written work could be based on these sounds. If these sound patterns are Spanish, the instruction should be in Spanish. Simultaneously, with this instruction, the second language should be introduced systematically. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"To understand the phenomena of academic success or failure among black children in urban ghetto schools, one must look beyond the boundaries of the individual classrooms and examine the social and cultural milieu of the school itself. Both the milieu of the classroom and the milieu of the school appear to sustain one another in a pattern of reinforcement of the presently accepted values and modes of behavior. Thus, the factors which help to establish the atmosphere of the school affect that of the individual classroom as well. Thus, a cyclincal effect occurs whereby the milieu of the school influences the learning experiences of the children, which in turn help to define the behavior and responses of the teachers and principal who have major responsibility for the general social  themes present in the school. It is contended that such conditions as the negative expectations for the children, the utilization of violence on the children, the exchange of information among the teachers which allows the development of stereotypes as to performance and behavior, and the norms governing the use of classroom discipline are destructive of a humane and supportive learning milieu.

The evaluation was performed by a collection of information from parents, teachers, and students, and by  observations by evaluation staff members of shop settings and activities. Teachers rated students at two intervals in the program, once on the seventeenth of July and again on August thirteenth. Students who were able to write filled out questionnaires. The others were interviewed by project staff members. Parents also filled out questionnaires. Teachers responded to a questionnaire at the termination of the program. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Project Process, funded through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title VIII, is an integrated model within the existing school system concentrating on reducing the number of dropouts via an institutional change strategy. The basic goal of the project is to develop a flexible atmosphere where learning can take place. Within this goal is the assumption that this can be accomplished for a long run effect only if the project focuses on treating the underlying problems rather than the symptoms of the problems. This leads to the premise that adolescents do not by their very nature tend to drop out of learning (school), but are pushed out (of school) by factors within the school, home, or community that necessarily need to change. The evaluation program is designed to provide  the necessary procedures and skills for the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of descriptive data and comparative data throughout the entire project. This process began with the delineation of objectives in performance terms from the goals of Project Process and the programs to be implemented. Its nature is such that it allows for process modifications while insuring the interpretation of expected and unexpected outcomes in terms of recorded measurements, observations, input, and process information.

A subtle but crucial distinction is made between trends towards expanded opportunities in employment, housing, and education in the context of legal and mass demonstrations extending the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment to a wider segment of the citizenry; and trends toward an inherently educational response stemming from academic momentum and commitment to the training of an enlarged and more diversified student population. This suggests an examination of those trends that have supported expansion of higher educational  opportunities as well as those that ran counter more by virtue of alternate emphases and commitments than any direct opposition. The second article, \"Access to higher education,\" examines some of the political and social factors involved in expanding opportunities for higher education. Among these factors are: the role of the black college: the assasination of Martin Luther King; Supreme Court litigation; discriminatory systems of secondary and elementary education, especially with respect to tracking; and, the development of scholarship programs.

The local agencies expended about 26.6 million dollars, $102,000, and $544,000 respectively, of the 47 million dollars of Title I funds expended in Illinois for the fiscal year 1970 program. Under the Title I program, the three local educational agencies implemented projects that provided new or additional services which otherwise might not have been available, or which would have been available only on a limited basis, to educationally deprived  children. For example, contrary to Office of Education guidelines, the local educational agencies did not establish measurable objectives nor adopt specific procedures to evaluate the success of their major Title I project activities. The objectives listed by the local agencies in their project applications were generally held to be vague and were not stated in measurable terms by the types of changes sought and the degree of change expected in the child's performance.

In this regard, the school staff with the assistance of the staff of the Division of Research and Development evaluated the reading program with reference to its impact on the performance of pupils. The primary goal of the program was to provide more relevant activities for the pupils such that improvement in reading could be evidenced by pupils' performance on standardized tests. To assist the regular school staff in meeting the  educational needs of the pupils, Hardnett received the services of the following programs: (1) Title I Program; the school was eligible for such Title I program services as reading materials and three educational aides to work with the reading program. (2) Comprehensive Instructional Program (CIP); the primary purpose of the CIP was to guide and assist with the reading programs in schools where large percentages of pupils were below grade levels in reading. During the school year, Hardnett received reading materials along with the services of a CIP coordinator. (Author/JM)",

A basic assumption of the program was that teachers will change their style of interacting with students in the classroom if they become more aware of their own behavior. Given an opportunity to examine their own teaching techniques and to form models of desired behavior, teachers will create more effective classroom learning climates for their charges. Not only will the training sessions be positively perceived by teachers, but the modified teacher behavior will have a positive impact on the pupils. The Portsmouth test situation, therefore was designed to provide teachers with such an  opportunity to observe, discuss, and analyze themselves and others on video-tapes. The solution to eradicating disciplinary practices detrimental to learning seems to the authors to rest in providing teachers with systematic training in classroom management. The format of the training sessions was designed to provide teachers with these opportunities through observation, discussion, and analysis of video tapes. Not only will the training sessions be positively perceived by teachers, but the sessions will also have a positive impact on the pupils. (Author/JM)",

The most experienced teachers are generally to be found in schools attended by the less poor white children. More important, the verbal ability of teachers, an important predictor of teacher effectiveness (although not highly correlated with salary or experience) is also higher in these schools. An analysis of the physical plant--as measured by age of building, size of grounds, and presence of special facilities--further suggests that the allocation of physical resources may also be influenced by the economic characteristics of the neighborhood. The results of such  discrimination are, of course, that less-favored groups receive a lower quality education, on the average, than the average middle-class or white child. This unequal treatment might have been predicted on the basis that poor and non-white groups have least political power and social status; an analysis of the tensions that would be created by a system of equal expenditures in cities heterogeneous in social and economic makeup would further suggest the existence of such discriminatory education.

The objective of the program is to increase the physical and mental health, and nutrition and education of children living in circumstances of poverty by effecting cooperation and coordination between parents, school, and service providers and a project staff. The services to be coordinated with the school program are primarily those of federally funded programs--the Lincoln Community Health Center, the  county Community Mental Health Center, the county Departments of Public Health and Social Services, the ESEA Title I program in the schools, the National School Lunch, Breakfast, Special Milk, and Special Food and Nutrition Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture administered locally under the school food service department of the city schools, Title XIX Medicaid Program, and Operation Breakthrough (the local O.E.O. Program). Other services provided by local and state agencies and organizations in consultation with other services from universities will also be coordinated with the school program. (Author/JM)",

The second is \"The Student Transportation Moratorium Act of 1972\". This would provide a period of time during which any future, new busing orders by the courts would not go into effect, while the Congress considered legislative approaches--such as the Equal Educational Opportunities Act--to the questions raised by school desegregation cases.

Subjects were drawn from a larger cohort of 4075 students that comprised the total regular enrollment of a county school system in the sixth grade in 1954. Multiple correlation analyses were performed with 21 measures available in school records in the sixth grade. These variables were correlated with the criterion of subsequent withdrawal or graduation from high  school. Analyses were conducted separately for each of four race and sex groups and for the four groups combined. Although different patterns of variables were found to differentiate dropouts and graduates in the race and sex subgroups, there was a general similarity across all samples in that one or two measures of achievement or ability, age in the sixth grade which was considered to be predominantly a measure of school retention, absence, and one or two measures of family background appeared in each of the four samples.

Provision is made for  intensive pre-training and continuous in-service training of the entire faculties of the two elementary schools and the language arts teachers of the middle school participating in the program. The program was developed and administered in collaboration with a private consulting company specializing in innovative educational technologies. The intensive involvement of administrators, students and parents was also required. Each Center was initially staffed with a full time director and one teacher aide. The classroom teacher accompanies his students to the Center. (JM)",

For example, control groups are a necessity, as are adequate sampling procedures and adjustment for non-response bias and self-selection bias, and all studies do not employ this methodology. Another limitation is that currently a benefit-cost study will only show whether or not a program appears to pay. Further judgments must be made on whether to expand or cut back the program, and what to give up or take on. In spite of these and other limitations, benefit-cost analysis interjects a systematic analysis into a previously judgmental area. The cost and methodological limitations of such studies will inhibit their  immediate widespread adoption. This study, written for non-economists, surveys the various approaches to improving the analysis of vocational education and related manpower training programs. (CD)",

In order for learning to take place, educational programs for the disadvantaged should focus initially on personality enhancement. Cooperative education programs enhance personality development by allowing students to achieve an adequate self concept and identification and aiding in the developmental tasks of growth. Two approaches are suggested for initiating disadvantaged youth into cooperative programs at Grade 9. One conceptual scheme is offered for school systems which incorporate a program of career exploration in the elementary years (K-8), thus allowing  disadvantaged students to smoothly flow into a distributive program at Grade 9. The other conceptual scheme is designed for the traditional school setting but recommends as a possible dropout prevention measure that entrance into distributive programs be initiated at Grade 9 instead of Grade 11. This report includes a discussion of the two approaches along with a definition of special needs students, characteristics and specific educational needs of the disadvantaged, and qualities of exemplary programs.

The core curriculum is composed of three basic training components, including those which are relevant to all the human services occupations, those which are specific to the field of work, and those which are specific to the actual job the worker is expected to perform in a particular setting. A core curriculum for a 2-year community college program leading to an  associate degree in human services is outlined along with recommendations for improved technology, the application of available new technology for training, and the enrichment of training faculties by the use of agency personnel and community leadership. In addition, several alternative models for the management of the state's training responsibility are offered and evaluated. Other monographs are available as VT 016 354, VT 016 357-016 359 in this issue. (SB)",

The recommendations from the committee call for a network of child care mini-centers to be supervised by a central  support unit. The program model includes comprehensive school services to school aged children and parents, with full utilization of the resources of other community human services agencies. The document includes a staffing plan, a career development component, and an implementation strategy along with a description of how one community organization adapted the model for its residents.

Some major conclusions were: (1) Administrators and teachers have generally positive attitudes  toward the development of applied biological and agricultural programs, (2) Many teachers and administrators felt that not enough students are interested in these occupations, (3) Student interest in the applied biological and agricultural areas compared favorably with industrial and health occupations but not with business and office as personal and public service occupations, and (4) Ample job opportunities exist to merit the implementation of programs in applied biology and agriculture.

The dependent variables (measures of success) were grade point average (GPA) for Grades 10 and 11, shop grades for Grades 10 and 11, and Ohio Trade and Industrial Achievement Test (OTAT) raw scores, while independent variables consisted of: (1) ability as measured by selected scales of the General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB), (2) occupational values as measured by four scales of the Occupational Values Inventory (OVI), and (3)  vocational maturity as measured by the Vocational Development Inventory (VDI). Analysis by means of Pearson product moment correlations and multiple regression analysis yielded these findings: (1) Grade 11 GPA was found to be most predictable and OTAT least predictable of school success, (2) Verbal aptitude, numerical aptitude, vocational maturity, and value of salary seem to be the most useful of student characteristics used in predicting the measures of success, and (3) Grade 10 shop grade is the only success measure in which manipulative abilities are important predictors.

The result is a profile of the respondents' aspirations, occupational interests and educational plans. Since the majority of Wisconsin youth preferred less than baccalaureate education, the two year institutions should develop programs to meet this demand. The data in this report will help institutions realign their vocational programs. (JS)",

        "description":"In order to shed additional light on the vocational development process, this study was designed to investigate the construct of work values by administering the Occupational Values Inventory (OVI) to a sample of 680 high school students. The design called for examining the relationship between selected student characteristics which appeared to be related to work values and responses on the OVI at two points in time (end of ninth and tenth grades). Data analysis consisted of examining the zero order correlations between each student characteristic and each value as measured by the OVI and an artificially created change score. Further analysis examined the total relationship between all student characteristics and each value score using Multiple Regression Analysis. Some major  findings were: (1) The Interest and Satisfaction, Salary, Personal Goal, and Security values possessed the highest degree of relationship with the student characteristics, while the values of Advancement, and Preparation and Ability possessed the smallest relationships, (2) For the most part, the relationship between OVI values and characteristics were similar for both ninth and tenth grade analyses, and (3) The relationship between ninth and tenth grade values was fairly low (r between .38 and .48). Several implications are discussed. (SB)",

The need for developing career competence and awareness starts long before the student reaches the community college age. To effectively reach all populations, career education must be integrated into the curriculum at all educational levels. The elementary and junior high school levels should concentrate on occupational orientation and an awareness of work roles and requirements, while the high school level should prepare for job entry and concurrently for further education. The post-secondary institutions must be designed to fit career aspirations and requirements by providing meaning and purpose to job preparation as well as by preparing some students for  education leading to a baccalaureate and perhaps graduate professional preparation. Thus, from kindergarten through post-secondary education, students should receive a myriad of career opportunities and first-hand knowledge from which they will chart the course of their lives. Implications for post-secondary education are discussed. (SB)",

Comparisons were made among those who had taken jobs and stayed, those who had left jobs, those labor force nonparticipants who had worked at some time, and those who had never worked. Various attitudes were examined in relation to labor force participation and duration on a job. Discontent with work norms, perceived discrimination, and a preference for hustling (illicit behavior) were related inversely to labor force participation, while the importance  of home and family, the drive to get ahead, and some commitment to work values were related directly. Favorable perceptions of the current job showed the strongest relationship to duration on a job. Job \"stayers\" were more likely to be from the South. Fifty-five tables present the data. A description of the interviewers' interaction with the respondents and suggestions for further research are included. (AG)",

Following field testing, the job analysis method was pilot tested in a New York City hospital. This report  reviews the project activities accomplished during the first three phases, summarizes the methodology and results of the pilot study, and acts as a guide for the working papers, progress reports, and research reports resulting from the project.

In terms of providing broader and better services in adult education, several goals have been identified.

In the future, there will be only two kinds of people--the victims of \"future shock\" and the victors over it. To be victorious, one must recognize that there are two distinct problems regarding the post-industrial society. The first problem is taking full advantage of the opportunities accompanying super-industrialism. The second  is avoiding the unfortunate consequences which flow from the improper exploitation of these opportunities. Along these lines the central task of education for the future is to expand the adaptive capabilities of individuals and to teach individuals to be critical receivers of orders. (JS)",

It must also prepare its people to cope with the rapid change which new technology causes in their personal lives, such as occupational obsolescence, social mobility, world wide communication and social awareness, and others. The concept of career education has been developed in view of these demands of a technological society. Career education relates to all educational experiences from early childhood throughout the productive life of the individual. In early childhood it provides an awareness of the world of work and some direct, hands-on experiences to motivate the learner's interest. At the end of high school, the  burden is on the high school system to give strong, positive assistance to students in obtaining job placement or placement in a post-secondary institution. The development of a career education system requires the accomplishment of differing objectives at each level of the existing school system, including public and private technical institutes, junior colleges, area vocational schools, and colleges and universities.

Consumer education today can no longer be limited to the goals of teaching an individual to maximize his own resources because no one lives in a vacuum. Every consumer-related action taken by an individual today is likely to have many ecological as well as economic repercussions of which we may not be aware. Our society is strongly geared to consumption, and consumers are faced with making increasingly complex and varied consumer decisions. Consumer education is needed if there is to be a really broad-based, viable consumer movement. The present movement has had some success in making people aware of  how much and how often they are being gypped and endangered, but the movement has not played a significant role in governmental decision-making, largely because producers are well organized and informed while consumers are not. Immediate help is needed from the public schools if we are to effectively analyze and publicize the information necessary for intelligent and responsible consumption. (SB)",

It is suggested that one of the new realities is that education must be a lifelong process in order to avoid the catastrophe of human obsolescence. The assumptions and elements for a new model of education as a lifelong process are discussed. Based on the assumption that the purpose of education is the development of competencies for performing the various roles required in human life, the first element in a new educational model would be a taxonomy of these roles and their required competencies. From the second assumption--the primary purpose of schooling is to help children and youth learn learning skills--seven elements of learning skills are listed. Assumption 3 is  based on a spiral of \"learning projects,\" where the school is presented to learners as a \"learning resource center\" and teachers are presented as \"learning project consultants.\" Also, included in this report is an outline of life problems of American adults noting such areas as vocation and career, home and family living, personal development, etc., as well as a bibliography of the author's publications.

The IFYE program depends on young men and women volunteers who are sent to live and work with families in foreign countries; in turn, foreign volunteers are sent to this country for the same purpose. From a study of this process, it is concluded that the following variables indicate that the IFYE program does facilitate  cross-cultural, interpersonal communication: (1) objectives, (2) IFYE structure, (3) IFYE participants, (4) IFYE's responsibility, (5) orientation, and (6) the IFYE and the end product of communication. Three possible weaknesses of the IFYE program are noted. They are: (1) inadequate language training, (2) lack of emphasis on human relations skills in the training program, and (3) a short length of time with a host family.

Nonformal education encompasses learning and development  of skills (1) in the home, (2) in youth or adult activities; (3) in military training; (4) in social and political organizations; (5) on the job in private industry; and (6) in special government, foreign aid, or United Nations training projects.

The results indicated that (1) the Show-Me faculty primarily used clientele in planning specific events; (2) extension Councils did not play a major role in program development; (3) coordination and linkage within program areas was good, but that between program areas could be strengthened by more administrative attention; (4) almost 60% of the population was aware of  extension programs such as Home Economics, Agriculture, and 4-H Programs, but only 28% were program participants; (5) all three respondent groups identified community-public problems as the most prevalent; (6) there were no area-wide program development committees; the faculty used individual client consultation; and (7) the change to staff specialization on a multicounty basis has made program development more difficult for extension faculty; lay leaders felt that this specialization provided broader program offerings and a better trained staff, although they were concerned about the loss of personal contact.

Demonstration results are geared to increase the knowledge and understanding of possible solutions to the many problems that are impediments in reaching long-range goals established by the County's Program Building Committee. The current objectives are to reduce production cost per pound of lint and grain and improve product quality for increased profits. It is felt that production cost can be reduced by the following four principles: (1) reduce expenditures while maintaining yields, (2) take small yield reductions for greater decrease in expenses, (3) increase yields from the same expenditures, and (4) increase expenditures for a  proportionately large return in yields. It is noted that in interpreting demonstration results, it is necessary to look for principles of fitting production practices together rather than adhering to the use of any one practice. Cotton demonstration results indicated the harvesting of only about one-half of a crop due to the weather, the harvest rush, and yields too low to gin plots separately. (Author/JS)",

They are: (1) assessment of priorities, (2) effective program development, (3) program balance, (4) staff development, (5) maintaining effective relationships, and (6) faith and commitment. It is felt that those issues having the greatest bearing on the fate of the country and upon the Extension Service center around the crises of the time and the real dangers are found in the social environment; that is (1) in the sickness of our cities; (2) the alienation of youth, minorities, poor, and disadvantaged; (3) the inequitable distribution of society's power, privilege, rewards, and benefits; (4) educational system failures; and (5) rural area crises.  It is concluded that the Extension Service cannot stand aloof, morally neutral, and socially passive and ignore these issues; the Service must take part in seeking new knowledge, strategies, and methods in dealing with the problems of people.

        "description":"A Cooperative Extension Service action program in seven Mississippi counties, utilizing a nonprofessional approach to reach disadvantaged families with educational programs, is reviewed. Subprofessionals were utilized as systemic links between professional adult educators (home economists) and disadvantaged clientele. The report is divided into four phases. They are: (1) a socioeconomic description of home economists, Extension aides, and selected families being assisted in the pilot counties; (2) level of living index for the three groups; (3) an attitude study of home economists and Extension aides toward the poor; and (4) measurement of any changes in the practices of participating families as a result of the Extension aide efforts. The results indicated that behavioral  changes did occur, and it is felt that these changes plus the establishment of working relationships are indicative of the effectiveness of systemic links as a means of creating change. It is suggested that these pilot study results indicate that action agencies should consider the use of aides as a means of expanding and strengthening program efforts for the disadvantaged. This type of program is thought to have meaning for rural sociologists by providing an opportunity to apply principles of the experimental design in a laboratory setting. (Author/JS)",

In second stage, questionnaires were mailed to nine additional institutions and 33 individuals. Response to survey included 45 institutions and 75 individuals. In analysing responses and compiling directory, only those institutions/organizations reporting activities and/or research in comparative adult education or those reporting a library or documentation center were included. Only respondents to survey were included. Those who failed to respond, or could not be reached were  not included. Survey clearly documented that, on world-wide scale, comparative study of adult education still is in very rudimentary stage of development and that most activities and study are carried out at descriptive level. It also showed that comparative studies increased in the late 1960's, and are being undertaken by individuals and institutions in many places. (Author/NF)",

The model provides short-term training in applied research and development (R & D) for persons holding B.A. and M.A. degrees by featuring individualized learning and \"real-time\" experience on actual R & D projects. The training model was pilot tested with six unemployed physical scientists. During the three-month program, trainees spent approximately half of their time studying education topics and problems, and the other half working as apprentices on R & D projects. An individual set of objectives was determined for each trainee. Learning activities, including group events, guided independent study, and apprenticeship  tasks, were then individually prescribed on the basis of the trainee's objectives. The results indicate that the training model is effective, efficient, and appealing to both employees and trainees. It is concluded that the model can be of use in independent training programs, as an adjunct to regular academic programs, or for inservice training. It is also an example of how unemployed professionals may be cross-trained for a new field. (Author)",

        "description":"This study attempted to clarify the concept \"program\" by systematically examining the use of the term \"program.\" The term was examined as it is used in ordinary language and in adult education literature. After analysis of the term within these two contexts, a typology was developed from the uses identified. The typology was then utilized as an aid in determining those variables affecting the validity of propositions containing the term \"program\" or concepts referred to in the use of the term. The results indicated that there were five senses of \"program,\" that is, system, plan, document, performance, and planning. The implications that these results have for the adult educator are noted. They are: (1) the term \"program\" should be explicitly defined if it is to be used as a  symbol to communicate a concept within a useful principle; (2) the use of the term \"program\" should not be abandoned; (3) Hosper's idea of defining and accompanying characteristics can be used as a basis for clarifying other adult education central terms and concepts; and (4) if there is a cause-effect relationship between various senses of \"program\" then further study is needed of the various things that can go wrong and which mitigate the cause-effect relationship.

        "description":"This report presents a study undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of contacting previously unreached urban audiences through the use of films at automatic self-learning centers. To accomplish this, the study attempted to determine: (1) the extent to which people in an urban business (a large insurance company) would look at agricultural films during their lunch hour; (2) their reaction to this approach; and (3) the extent to which they would learn from this informal self-learning setting. Subjects were randomly chosen for both pre- and post-test phases of the study. From the results, the following recommendations are proposed: (1) More attention and emphasis should be given to publicizing the film to be shown in terms of its content, sponsor, and length; (2) The study should  be replicated in other urban settings using the same subject population for both pre- and post-testing to determine changes in knowledge levels; (3) Films should be made available three to five days in succession and shown in more than one area; (4) Additional super film cassettes should be developed; (5) A guide should be developed for viewers to follow as the film is being shown; (6) Additional sources of information on the film's subject should be posted; (7) The potential viewing group's characteristics should be determined to select films; and (8) other new media types should be considered.

An attempt was made to (1) determine the extent and diversity of the problems confronting the youth in the area studied, (2) analyze the problems and select those that could be programmed for within the scope of Extension youth work; (3) appraise those resources of the University of Missouri which might be mobilized to meet these needs; and (4) select responsible leadership capable of lending direction to a well-rounded program of youth assistance. To accomplish these aims, a survey and analysis of the literature on the characteristics of the area and of the youth was conducted as well as an indepth look at program  development literature, and a questionnaire survey of youth leaders to ascertain their attitudes and ideas of the needs of youth in Missouri's northeast area was undertaken. From the results, it is concluded that the questionnaire was of particular help although some of the findings might have been previously assumed. It is felt that the results did provide new information and reemphasize certain points. The study seems to have provided the beginning of some cohesiveness of youth leaders in the area. (Author/JS)",

Both six months after and five weeks before participation in this intensive T-group experience, the participants were described by themselves, one intimate, and one colleague on a variety of personality measures which reduced--as anticipated from theory-- to independent measures of Self-Acceptance (SA) and Other-Acceptance (OA). Covariance analysis of perceived changes (postlab score minus prelab score) revealed significant gains on both dimensions as well as significant variations in Self-Acceptance gains by T-groups. Within-lab ratings of trainers by T-group members on effectiveness, Self-Disclosure, and Feedback-Seeking generally correlated  positively and significantly with changes in both Self-Acceptance and Other-Acceptance by T-group units. Senior trainers who were Diplomats in clinical psychology were notably most effective. The need for a greater emphasis upon the acceptance of others was indicated by the much smaller overall gain in OA than in SA. (Author/BW)",

The OVIS, administered in 43 high schools in San Diego County, California, was intended to complement the existing school guidance and counseling programs by providing the students with their measured and expressed occupational interests to assist them in career planning. Through the administration of these tests a program was devised consisting of a demonstration of the use of a prepared kit of materials available to assist counselors and teachers in interpreting the OVIS. The kit consists of masters for the production of overhead transparencies for a group presentation on the interpretation of the OVIS, a teacher-counselor's guide, and an index that relates OVIS  scale scores to VIEW (Vital Information for Education and Work) occupations and Volume II of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. Research indicating the effectiveness of group interpretation of OVIS results with prepared visuals are presented.

One major problem mentioned is that of formulating a measurement model which incorporates the merits of established approaches to test construction yet circumvents their shortcomings. A brief review of approaches to such test construction is presented with some of the criticisms which have been made of them. A number of substantive and psychometric problems in the measurement of vocational maturity are identified. It is emphasized that their solutions are provisional and tentative, subject to further revision as the relevant data are gathered and analyzed. Problems which are not discussed include such imponderables as how to  partition developmental score variance from stable and error variance, and how to control for the effects of environmental change and repeated measurements in longitudinal designs.

There is now abundant, unsubstantiated anecdotal evidence, and some controlled experimental work, which suggests that the tutor benefits greatly from his involvement in teaching. The enactment of the role of \"teacher\" by a child may explain the positive effects for the tutor. The role demands of teaching require a mastery of the materials to be taught. Thus it is likely that some kind of restructuring of material occurs when a person enacts the role of teacher. This role enactment may be particularly beneficial for low-achieving children. Tutoring may lead to increased motivation and learning for the tutor. This experiment examines the  hypothesis that low-achieving children learn better when placed in the role of teacher than when studying alone. It is also expected that the tutee will benefit from tutoring; however, it is likely that the tutor will benefit as much as or more than the tutee. (Author/WS)",

An analysis of the results of the drug survey points out that many variables which had heretofore been regarded as being significantly related to drug abuse have not proven significant in the scientifically conducted Montgomery study. No evidence was found of significant correlations between drug abuse and race, sex, ethnicity, parental education, family size, position of sibling in family, and number of parents at home. From this study, the general use of drugs is seen as cutting across class, race and ethnic groupings. Certain other variables have shown themselves as  being significantly related to drug abuse. They are as follows: lack of family closeness or cohesiveness; lack of religious attachment; peer group influence; discontent with school; boredom; and influential relationships with siblings and close friends.

The authors hope this document will represent an identification of important issues, a challenge to think constructively about them, and some suggestions for their resolution. The authors have drawn heavily upon the publication of \"The NAPPA:  Pupil Personnel Services: A Position Statement\", April 1969. It was suggested that the position statement be read as a general background to this publication. (ED 031 749) (WS)",

Using relationship as a measure of outcome, it was hypothesized that a high degree of relationship would exist in the groups, and that pre-test scores on a relationship measuring instrument would be lower than post-test scores. The results indicated that post-test as compared with pre-test \"total relationship\" scores changed significantly and in a positive direction.

The topics explored in the six sessions were: Feelings and the Acquisition of Subject Matter; Self Perceptions and How They are Learned; Teacher-Pupil Interactions; Antecedents of Teaching Problems; and Systematic Instruction in Socialization Skills. In addition to opportunities to discuss the presented topics, teachers were also able to examine video tapes of their own classroom behaviors and to have these behaviors examined by their peers. These  experiences were related to a variety of classroom management techniques for effective learning environments. At the conclusion of the inservice program positive responses regarding the value of the training sessions were observed for the teachers. Further, significant positive gains in the self perception scores of the children were observed despite the fact that the children were not a part of the training program. (Author)",

A questionnaire was constructed and at the conclusion of the workshop, participants were provided an opportunity to evaluate their  experiences. Results indicated a very positive response.

In this study elementary school teachers were asked to rate their students on items describing specific observable classroom behaviors in two sessions with a two-week interval between ratings. The items used to rate students were determined in a pilot phase when elementary teachers were asked what concepts they considered important and not important for the satisfactory behavior of a child in the classroom. The results strongly indicated that teachers were not stable in rating the overt behaviors of pupils. The item reliabilities tended to increase as the number of rating categories available to the teachers increased from five to seven to  nine; however, no statistical differences was found. Assuming that teachers do rate and possibly refer children to an elementary counselor based on a single episode, it would seem imperative that the elementary counselor determine as quickly as possible the generality of the behavior problem.

These students were tested by Project TALENT in 1960, were followed up five years later, and were again surveyed in 1970 with selected parts of the TALENT test battery. These papers relate mainly to the increasing realism of choices, especially of the boys; the distinctive patterns of scores for career groups identified five years after graduation; and to the importance of earlier choices of at least the general nature of the career field. The paper reports new findings and relates these to some of the previously reported results. The findings are as follows: the unrealistic and unstable career choices characteristic of high  school students throughout the country in 1960 are no longer typical of today's students; later career activities could have been planned on the basis of information available in high school; and if secondary education is to be relevant to student's needs and plans, it is essential that students be assisted in selecting their careers at an earlier time.

The Children's Hospital Hotline is one of 300 existing throughout the country, with a steadily increasing number being created in other parts of the world. The Hotline is designed mainly as a crisis intervention resource. It provides an understanding, empathic, objective \"listener\" who is immediately available for a troubled youth. Hotline resulted from an awareness of the increasing alientation of youth and the relative lack of meaningful avenues of communication during periods of stress. The important features of the Hotline  are its immediate availability and respect for anonymity of the caller. The Hotline approach does not presume traditional professional training in psychotherapy or counseling on the part of the person answering calls. The approach used is based on the concept of \"creative listening\" and a regard for others, with a special awareness of and sensitivity to young people. (Author/WS)",

The design focuses almost entirely on the individual, using group communication and sharing toward this end. Each person's final commitment to action is the result of his or her own values and convictions.

Data about the influence of intervention on a social system was provided by an evaluation of laboratory training with a junior college student senate using sociometric methods to discern the normative structure of the group. The criterion for the choice which might be influenced was trust in the person chosen. It was found that the normative structure of trusting choices in the senate was not altered by the intervention. Changes were of a momentary rather than of a systemic nature; indicating the tenacity of norms governing choice in this continuing group. Sustained change in individual choice behavior appears to require intervention aimed at the  norms rather than at individuals. (Author/WS)",

However, court decisions, revised state policies, and changing attitudes of people of all ages are putting more and more pressure on local school boards and administrators to come up with new policies that offer expectant students something better than banishment from education. It appears that schools still have a long way to go before they are far removed from the policy which implies that school-age marriage and pregnancy are evil and insists that school will not see the evil, not hear about it, and not speak about it. This report describes what the schools are moving from and toward, pointing  out some of the promising developments and some of the most pressing problems along the way. (Author)",

The general hypothesis underlying the investigation is that for women in particular, marital status, age, and occupational level (high or low) might account for significant differences in personality and growth needs. The two separate studies were conducted. In the first, one counselor's interviews with single and married women were sorted, examined, and compared. The purpose was to determine whether single women's personal, educational, and vocational needs differ from those of married women. The second study involved a more systematic exploration of differences in background and personality scores among four groups of adult female  students. The studies suggest that the differences in personality and growth needs found in mature women students result from sex-based &quot;subcultures&quot; related to age, marital status and occupational level. The implications for the counselor working with these students is the importance of knowing and being sensitive to these characteristics. (Author/WS)",

        "description":"The question whether individual study of risk problems (familiarization) leads to greater risk taking was investigated. Several explanations of the risk taking shifts are explicit in their requirement for group or social interaction. Investigations of whether risk shifts can be produced in the absence of group interaction have produced conflicting results. From an information weighting theory it was hypothesized that the relative number of arguments favoring risk rather than some process inherent in group interaction produces the risky shift. 160 Ss in groups or 5 or alone developed arguments only in favor of the successful risky outcome in 6 Choice Dilemma problems or worked on risk-irrelevant tasks. Risk arguments (p .025) but not group discussion (F 1) produced shifts toward  greater risk taking. When the relative number of arguments favoring risk are controlled, individuals working alone show as large a risk shift as groups. Because of earlier failures to find a familiarization effect, it appears that groups may be more efficient or capable than individuals in developing arguments favoring culturally valued positions.

        "description":"This study evaluated the effectiveness of a lecture on behavior modification techniques given to three elementary teaching staffs that were volunteered by their principals. It was expected that the group lecture would result in significant increases of teacher compliments and decreases of teacher reprimands even though the teachers did not request the lecture directly. These changes in teacher response to student behavior were then expected to be reflected in increases of the percent of students observed to be engaged with the assigned task in each classroom. Thirty-four teachers selected randomly from three elementary schools were observed for ten minutes one week before and three weeks after receiving the behavior modification lecture. The results indicated that the rate of  teachers' compliments increased and reprimands decreased significantly following the lecture on behavior modification. The results, therefore, indicate that students' classroom functioning can be changed by teachers' application of behavior modification techniques. (Author)",

The 26 disadvantaged Caucasian subjects received extensive counseling therapy for a period of one semester. It was hypothesized that at the end of one semester there would be no significant change in the emotional problems and the probability of dropout. The overall results as measured by the Forty-eight Item Counseling Evaluation Test and the Demos D Scale at the end of the semester indicated the improvement in both areas to be significant at the .01 level of confidence. Furthermore, Chi-square analyses also revealed the  significant categorical changes at .001 level. Evidently, the significant behavioral and scholastic improvement in the disadvantaged could be successfully accomplished within one single semester. (Author/BW)",

The origins of the group encounter movement are examined with a particularly strong emphasis on J. L. Moreno and his introduction of Sociometry in 1931. This is followed by a discussion of Kurt Lewin and the emergence of the Bethel laboratories. The initial training centers established in the 1930's and 1940's are described. The discussion of the initial training centers points out a definite correlation between the Morenean Psychodramatic techniques and sociometric methodologies with that of the laboratory training concepts. A disturbing factor that the author emphasizes  is the misunderstanding prevalent among group leaders, group dynamicists, and group therapists regarding the ethics and validity of the many group approaches employed throughout the country.

It was concluded that the need for the counseling service is high, student counseling roles must be firmly established, and the existing program of counseling services needs expansion. Limitations due to staff and budget are recognized, but information resources must be expanded and improved. Section II of this report contains suggestions for improving overseas communication methods. These suggestions were: (1) decide institutional roles, requirements, and policies regarding enrollment of foreign students; (2) evaluate catalogs and publications for foreign students,  and (3) evaluate the system and procedure for serving foreign students.

Questionnaires were used in selecting trainees. After the needs of the trainees were identified, trainees were selected who had the appropriate skills to deal successfully with these para-professional needs. The training staff developed curriculum inputs to be presented to the para-professionals. The inputs were developed and tested for relevancy. Objective tests were administered to the para-professionals to obtain a description of the population. The findings were valuable in assisting training staff to prepare relevant curriculum units. Also, posttesting was done to determine whether there were significant attitudinal changes resulting from  the training program. Two pilot projects emerged from the training program. One served as an agent to help divert young people away from the courts and correctional institutions. The other emphasized the understanding of Spanish speaking culture and language. (Author)",

Retention was also of interest: however, a ceiling effect negated the opportunity to make meaningful comparisons. The results showed that: third grade males experienced more difficulty than their female counterparts; the ST resulted in faster learning for females, but not for males; and that the two learning procedures produced few differences across the age spectrum for males. The stage analyses showed that both response and associative learning stages contributed to the superiority of the ST procedure for  females. In view of the lack of variation for males, the present study concludes that learning processes vary with sex. Females in the study possibly exhibited more efficient learning strategies or males may have been more dependent upon immediate feedback. (Author)",

A sample population of 260 kindergartners was identified as having potential learning difficulties by the results shown on the Slingerland, Mahon and Metropolitan Readiness Tests. This sample was randomly assigned to either Group one, experimental, or to Group two, control. The research design applied was the Campbell and Stanley number 6, posttest two group design. Group one received the Mahon System of assistance given by teacher aides trained by Dr. Mahon. Group two received only the assistance based upon current reading materials used in the entire school system.  Time allotment was half an hour a day for each group. The results of the posttest confirmed the value of prephonic training where early diagnosis had identified potential learning difficulties. As a by product, the areas of early identification found to be most appropriate for individualized instruction were revealed. [Marginal reproducibility of some pages.] (Author)",

Written descriptions of commonly occurring visual scenes served as the stimuli in the new methodology. The reader's success in drawing a scene after viewing a written description of it served as a measure of his comprehension. Material was presented sequentially in a visual spatial mode or as a verbal description. The locations of scene objects were presented either in a random or systematic order, spatially proximal stimuli being presented contiguously in the systematic ordering. The results indicated that spatial presentation is better than verbal, and that systematic is substantially better than random. In addition,  moderate but consistent relationships between task performance and reading ability were found. Two studies were conducted to explore individual differences in perceiving sentence complexity. Multidimensional scaling and other more traditional analyses showed a marked difference between good and poor readers in their perception of a variety of sentence characteristics. (Author/WR)",

Three goals were identified: to recruit, select, and train aides for grades K through twelve; to provide workshops for master teachers to help them use and supervise their aides; and to distinguish clearly the responsibilities of aides and teachers. The report includes descriptions of the organization of the project, the recruitment of candidates, the selection of aides and teachers, the orientation of the teachers,  the preservice and inservice curriculum, a teachers' workshop, an evaluation of the program, a data and summary section, placement and followup, and an appendix.

        "description":"The acquisition of Literacy Project's basic goal is to determine the processes by which children learn to read, and to identify reasons many fail to learn. One part of the process is the formation of correspondences between letter patterns and the sounds for which they stand. To determine the extent of such correspondences, tests of pronunciation of synthetic words were conducted. A list of these words was prepared to test the pronunciation of predictable patterns, such as (final \"e\", \"c\" before \"e\" and \"i\", and \"c\" before \"a\", \"o\" and \"u\"), and unpredictable patterns (vowel digraph spellings such as \"ai\" and \"ou\"). Responses were recorded and transcribed by graduate students trained in phonetics. Participants were third, sixth and eleventh graders, and college students. A good  third grade reader showed mastery of predictable letter-sound correspondences. This mastery increased through high school, but correlation with reading achievement decreased, presumably because this ability is only one of many necessary for skilled reading. Poor readers made more and wild errors in correspondences than good readers. (Author/GR)",

The other groups were composed of middle class Blacks, middle class whites, and lower class whites. The data confirmed the existence of a well-formed argot known to all members of the South Central group. Although lower class whites live in close proximity, their knowledge of the argot was limited. Lower class Blacks in Venice, over 10 miles away, demonstrated a mastery of the argot. Middle class Blacks were not as fluent in the argot as lower class Blacks, but  their facility was greater than either of the white groups. Those in the white and middle class Black group familiar with the argot were linked through illegal or anti-social life experiences. (Author/RS)",

Using a multivariate subgrouping procedure, eight homogeneous clusters of units were found, varying in size from 8-65 units, and each characterized by a distinct behavioral profile. Within-cluster differences were described in terms of the 18 dimensions, overall unit effectiveness, and in terms of other \"demographic\" variables that were external to the clustering process. These variables included unit function, work setting dispersion, growth, technology employed, and skill level of the unit members. Significant relationships were found between the behavioral styles of the  clusters on the one hand and each of the demographic variables and the overall criterion of effectiveness on the other. The rationale and benefits of clustering organizational units into groups were discussed, and further research ideas were proposed. (Author)",

The author proposes a methodology for the measurement of organizational structure that appears relevant for both laboratory and field study research. In addition, the basis for concepts of structure that promise to bridge the research gap between the development of organization theory and the pragmatics of organization design is presented. The use of the methodology for studying the concept of organization is demonstrated, and one particular concept of structure that evolves from the methodology is developed. Finally, some results from research that has been conducted using early forms of the approach are presented. These  results indicate that certain patterns of communication, when distinguished by this methodology, are associated with particular a priori forms of organization, such as the authority structure and the task structure.

The material focuses on individual school districts and on the implications of district behavior that are developed from the economics theory of the firm. Examination of the teacher demand by use of a stock-adjustment model suggests that roughly half the difference between the desired stock of teachers and the actual stock will be made up in any one school year and that the sole factor with considerable impact on the desired stock is pupil enrollment. A human capital approach was used to examine the mobility of teachers across school districts. Experience, age, and training distributions of teachers were the  teaching force characteristics most significantly related to turnover, and turnover appears higher in those districts having a greater proportion of young teachers with little experience. In general, it was found that the greater the district size and the greater its growth rate the smaller was the turnover. Findings indicate there appear to be economies of scale in the operation of school districts. A 20-item bibliography concludes the document. (Author)",

The first chapter offers definitions of concepts that are the subject of chapters to follow. The discussion of educational planning in Chapter II develops the thesis that planning objectives, structures, and outcomes are shaped by the general educational policies that elicited the planning activities. Chapter III shifts attention from some of the more quantitative aspects of educational planning to the qualitative considerations of innovation, technological forecasting, and alternative futures. Two major problems that merit the attention of both the theorist and the practitioner  are discussed in Chapter IV: (1) the problem of bias in prescriptive theory and (2) the gap between planning theory and planning practice. The description in Chapter V of curriculum planning at a provincial level presents both an empirical report as well as some of the methodological problems in researching planning behavior. The final chapter offers some prescriptive theory along with a set of guidelines for the development and improvement of educational planning at various levels. (Author/JH)",

        "description":"This report is the third in a series devoted specifically to compiling comprehensive and timely information about public school teachers. The material in the document reflects data gathered from a nationwide questionnaire survey of samples of teachers in both elementary and secondary schools. The object of this report is to provide an account of the status of the American teaching profession at the beginning of the 1970's as well as of the changes that have occurred during the 1960's. The report is organized in eight sections, the first four of which concern different aspects of the teachers' professional lives. Two more sections cover their personal, civic, and community lives. One of these sections deals specifically with the characteristics of teachers as individuals and  members of families and their economic status, while the other of these two sections deals with teachers' relations with their communities and their activities as citizens. The concluding section gives a compilation of data from preceding sections in the form of selected profiles describing the elementary teacher, the secondary teacher, the man teacher, and the woman teacher. The appendixes include (1) a technical note on sampling variation and the interpretation of statistical data, (2) a reproduction of the questionnaire used in the survey, and (3) complete tabulations of responses to all questions in the order of their occurrence in the questionnaire. Tables accompanying the text are for the most part confined to reporting trend data and combining selected material from the last  appendix with comparable data from 1961 and 1966. (Author)",

Shortages occurred in industrial arts, special education, mathematics, trade-industrial-vocational-technical courses, remedial reading and speech, and in distributive education. Assignments most frequently reported by the large school systems as having an oversupply of qualified applicants include social studies, Language Arts, physical and health education (male teachers), elementary level, foreign languages, business education, home economics, and art.

To improve the local school district administrators' knowledge  and expertise, the project director utilized district seminars, consultative services to local district personnel, mobile seminars, statewide conferences, summer institutes, and research projects. Included in the appendix is a directory of recommended consultants in the area of curriculum improvement, a model for a 9-week semester school, two plans on individualized instruction and flexible student progression, and a model for assessing educational success in Kentucky's schools.

Some factors influencing the frequency of transfer requests are the degree of clarity of district attendance boundary lines, the placement of attendance boundary lines, the degree of differentiation between schools in specific school districts, the degree of differentiation within schools in specific school districts, the amount of information available about individual schools,  and the composition of each district's population.

An interactive computer program is a desirable means of speeding progress toward a feasible solution by permitting many alternatives to be examined easily. This article discusses the development of a data base, an interactive program, and a school district model based on U. S. Census blocks. It also comments on the application of the procedure to the analysis of the problem of  adjusting attendance area boundaries in a particular school district. A sample computer output is included.

The study attempted to determine (1) the status of Texas school boards, (2) the role of the board and the roles of the superintendent and the high school principal, and (3) to what extent Texas board members' role perceptions agree with the various roles as portrayed in educational literature. The study also attempted to determine the effect the following factors have upon board members' perceptions of the various roles: Size and type of school district served, age, sex, race, income, number of years served on a board, education, and having or not having  children in school. Ten hypotheses relating to these perceptions were tested. Findings indicate that there was no statistically significant dependency among size and type of school district served, the number of years served on the board, having or not having children in school, and the occupation of a board member on his perceptions of the role of the board and that of the high school principal. The findings also indicate that there is a significant dependency between the educational level of a school board member and the way he perceives the role of the board and those of the superintendent and the high school principal.

It focused on delineating the current interest in performance contracting, the technique's demonstrated strengths and weaknesses, and its potential as an alternative approach to school system resource allocation. Six commissioned papers in this report discuss respectively, major problems in performance contracting, the recent Rand-HEW evaluation of performance contracting, measurement and evaluation difficulties, a model for comparing costs of different performance contracting programs, more comprehensive measurement of educational outputs, and employment relations under performance contracting. Discussions of these papers and of administrators' experiences emphasized  the many problems of measurement and evaluation that have emerged in performance contracting. The papers and proceedings form the basis for several conclusions, including: (1) evaluations of performance contracting must be based on more than the measurement of student achievement gains; (2) meaningful measurement of student achievement requires multiyear testing of group gains; (3) performance contracting is so innovative that reliable judgments of its utility cannot be made for several years.

Although the model has been designed for developing countries in today's world, it has also been constructed with an eye to the future. With certain modifications, the model could be applied to any contemporary educational program. The three developing countries of Sudan, Kuwait, and Ceylon  were selected for case studies and as examples of the model's contemporary application possibilities.

        "description":"This volume represents the output of a yearlong effort to clarify and firm the conceptual base that underlies educational RDD&E. It contains three commissioned papers authored by Drs. Hendrik D. Gideonse, Gene V Glass and Blaine R. Worthen, and by Leslie J. Briggs and one paper prepared by H. Del Schalock and G. Roger Sell of the staff of the Oregon Studies. The volume also contains a formal critique of each paper, an author response to each critique, and an introductory and summary critique of the papers as a set. Individually, the papers deal with one or more aspects of the domain of educational RDD&E. Collectively, they deal with the domain as a whole. As a set, the conceptual papers and their critiques are intended to serve as (1) a benchmark document with respect to the  conceptual structures underlying educational RDD&E, (2) a primary reference for persons entering the field of educational RDD&E, and (3) a stimulus to the continued dialogue that these papers have only begun.

Then reported was a study involving 33 deaf and 19 hearing students at the post-secondary level in which the processing of verbal information (words) visually and the relationship of the deaf students' ability to identify words presented in rapid letter-by-letter graphic sequence and ability to read finger spelling and to speech read were investigated. A comparison of the relative  ability of deaf and hearing post-secondary subjects to correctly identify printed meaningful words when their letters were presented sequentially indicated that the deaf subjects were superior under all conditions tested. Lack of a statistically significant correlation between the ability to read printed words whose letters are presented sequentially and the ability to read words formed by speech suggested that the perception of these two tasks was different.

The rehabilitation program in the residential institution was explained to have been divided into four divisions of vocational rehabilitation, education and training, independent living, and development and training. Principles underlying the divisional concept were reported to be that every resident was programed, that programing was made meaningful and coordinated over a 24-hour period for both in-cottage and outside  cottage settings, that programing was comprehensive in nature since the program decisions for a child were team prescriptions carried out by assigned team members in reasonable harmony, that residents and program receive more frequent evaluation, and that parents of residents were involved more often in group and individual meetings. Studies on adaptive behavior indicated that the divisional concept was a more efficient framework within which personnel, social, and real or potential vocational progress may be expected. (CB)",

A total of 7,119 children were examined and were thought to be closely representative of the population from which they were drawn with respect to age, sex, race, region, and other demographic and socioeconomic variables. Selected major findings included: that nearly one-tenth of the children were found to have a disease condition or other abnormality in one or both eyes, that strabismus was the eye condition most  frequently found, that two out of five children were found to have some marked degree of eye muscle imbalance, that significant deviations in the position of the binocular image at distance were likely to be ones of convergence or downward, that the prevalence of defective color vision was higher among children with defective than among those with normal visual acuity, and that the most frequent eye problems reported by parents for the children were those such as visual acuity defects and symptoms of burning or itching around the eye.

The lessons are said to assume an average class length of 50 minutes. The lessons are generally arranged into sections denoting instructional objective, materials to  be used, activities to achieve objective, and occasional comments. Rationale for the remedial program precedes 31 lessons on auditory reception, 30 lessons on auditory discrimination, 68 lessons on auditory memory, 104 lessons on auditory sequential memory, 17 lessons on grammatic closure, and 23 lessons on auditory association.

Review of activities of the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped is stated to  concern new and developing programs and certain issues related to the Bureau's functioning. New program developments reviewed include the Handicapped Children's Early Education Assistance Program, current legislation for preschool children such as the Comprehensive Preschool Education and Day Care Act of 1969, special programs for children with specific learning disabilities, deaf blind centers, and regional resource centers. Task force reports then cover handicapped children in the inner cities and student involvement in special education, for example. (CB)",

Reaction time from initial trials of the test given in Study I was significantly correlated with the motor coordination factor on the inventory. In Study III, hyperactive boys taking methylphenidate medication and hyperactive boys whose medication was temporarily discontinued were tested. Reaction time on early trials was not significantly different for boys in the on-medication and off-medication groups. As testing  progressed, reaction times of normal boys and boys taking medication remained fairly stable, while the performance of hyperactive boys not taking medication declined. (Author/CB)",

Testing of 412 randomly selected MDC using the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation revealed a significant correlation and associative factor between MDC speech articulation disorders and the number of combat tours of duty spent by the soldier-father in Vietnam. No significant correlations were reported between comparisons of speech articulation disorders to geographical separation of the soldier father from his family unit, number of houses in which the child lived, military grade or rank of the father, father's age, familial placement of the child, or the father's military occupational specialty. The  types of speech articulation disorders recorded among tested MDC approximated those reported in the literature for the general school age population. The incidence rate among MDC was higher than the norm in grades 1 through 4, but lower than the norm in grades 5 and 6. In two of the three schools in which MDC attended with civilian dependent children (CDC), the speech articulation disorder incidence rate among MDC was about three times greater than that for CDC in grades 2 through 4, but lower in grades 5 and 6.

A total of 577 persons participated. Results showed that the majority of clients placed themselves at the middle of the scale. It was also found that the noncongenital group consistently rated themselves higher at the positive end of the scale. Younger clients were reported to have better self concepts than those individuals 30 years of age and over. Analysis of data included descriptive comparisons between clients interviewed in the field and those in the clinic, comparisons between races, age  categories, sexes, degrees of residual vision, age at onset of visual impairment, the length of impairment, and education categories; some emphasis was placed on rural distinctions.

It is controlled practice of specific teaching behavior; therefore, the role of the supervisor is important. Microteaching has the following advantages: faculty have to get together to agree on common purposes in its use; it becomes feasible to follow trainee performance closely; the program is individualized and not bound by any particular course structure; evidence of suitability for teaching is obtained; it is a useful resource tool; it simplifies the complex teaching process in the trainees' first contact with the tasks involved; it is efficient in terms of staff time, use of real pupils, their classrooms, and training facilities. \"Minicourse,\" an  adaptation of microteaching, differs from it in four ways: it is primarily an in-service, not a pre-service, model; it is a self-contained package that can be used wherever videotaping is available; trainees are self-evaluated by a structured critique, not a supervisor; films and tapes of model lessons serve as the basis for evaluation.

The survey described various kinds of systems, including varieties of community antenna television (CATV), master antenna television (MATV), and closed-circuit television, and asked the respondent to indicate whether such a system was in use at his school. Results showed that no particular pattern of use was favored predominently. Although rumors had indicated that at least some institutions felt that instructional television (ITV) was on the decline, the survey did not bear this out. The conclusion was reached that on campuses where ITV has been integrated carefully into the administrative and academic situation, it shows no sign of being  eliminated. On the contrary, it is now more than ever before an integral part of the curriculum. (JK)",

Verbal reports are vague, while other methods that have been used are idiosyncratic and depend on the way the teacher presents the course. Oral interviews and self-pacing studies have other flaws. Much of the research to date has been sloppy, and many procedures have been introduced with only the flimsiest bit of empirical justification. Since a primary aim of PSI is to stimulate interest in the course, some dependent variables with measure interest might be studied. These might include the number and pattern of withdrawals in the course, a question-asking  profile, or use of an interest library consisting of articles related to lectures which are stocked in student dormitories. Also, a self-management project might supplant traditional rat experiments in psychology courses. (JK)",

The manager is one who has taken the course previously; he acts as a chief proctor who gives oral examinations to the first four students who are ready to pass a unit and who then become student proctors for the rest of the course for that unit. All other students pass that unit by taking an oral examination from those four students, and advance through the course by becoming proctors of other units. The manager also gives written examinations for each unit. In this way, the material in the course is explained at a level of the professor who has been familiar with the material for a long period of time.  When the PSI was used in a beginning psychology course at Utah State University, the amount and depth of learning achieved was apparently much greater than is usually the case with other methods of instruction.

On the basis of these considerations and a ten-year financial projection, the report recommends construction of an interconnected network of six cable systems. The basic system consists of a dual cable plant providing about 40 video channels from the headend to subscriber locations, plus two or three video channels in the reverse direction to permit remote program originations and to provide capacity to handle  facsimile mail, data storage and retrieval, viewer interrogation and response, and other services that may be perfected within 5-10 years. For the large number of &quot;general&quot; viewers the report recommends access to ten channels on each of the two cables.

M.E.T.R.O. is a gaming simulation which uses techniques of war gaming as a tool for coping with current and anticipated urban problems. At this stage in its conception, M.E.T.R.O. was designed to have 16 or 17 players, plus a staff of six to 10 more people (composed of team advisors, a judge, and technical personnel). Each player belonged to two types of teams: 1) a team representing a central city, suburb, or urbanizing township, and 2) a team representing particular important urban roles that discuss metropolis-wide policies (politicians, planners, school people, and land developers). It was part of M.E.T.R.O.'s  intention to illustrate typical interaction patterns and joint-problem solving among urban decision-makers. In such dual roles, a player would be subject to contradictory pressures, depending on the teams he was on. The rules and techniques of the simulation, which used a computer, are described here. Extensive documentation on the later stages of M.E.T.R.O. is available through the Environmental Simulation Laboratory at the University of Michigan. (JK)",

After surveying the goals and needs of the nine diocesan television systems in the United States, an administrative design is proposed to coordinate the two national-level agencies interested in television and Roman Catholic education. The design, based on  system theory and a process of system linkage, should be applicable to any pair of systems with common goals who wish to coordinate their activities without losing any of their autonomy.

The second stage would provide subscribers with low-cost home terminals and a number of two-way home services such as interactive educational and entertainment programs, preference polling, catalog shopping, alarm communications and utility and maintenance services, for a basic monthly fee of $6.50. The third stage, several years away, would provide subscribers with typewriter-like keyboards and local storage devices to permit computer-communications  and individualized TV pictures, and would cost considerably more. Market tests indicate that while standard one-way services would be only marginally profitable, two-way services would meet high demand and could provide attractive profits. (MG)",

A four-page questionnaire was mailed to appropriate personnel in one-third of the high schools listed in the state directory. Comparison of the three states' journalism characteristics yields an apparent correlation between certification requirements and apparent status of journalism in the schools. Indiana has the &quot;strongest&quot; requirements, the most qualified journalism teachers, and the largest number of high school journalism offerings. Respondents agreed that present high school journalism textbooks are  inadequate and isolate students from the profession of journalism. They also agreed that the main purpose of high school journalism is to edit and publish the school newspaper, as opposed to helping students become intelligent users of mass communication media. Respondents agreed that college journalism courses were the most important background that secondary teachers could have. (JK)",

Factors relating to this topic, such as statistical methods, course development methods, training techniques, learning styles, motivation, and moderator variables are also included. Where new methods of training evaluation and student achievement measurement appear in the literature, detailed presentations are given. Among these procedures were cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis, criterion-referenced testing, sequential testing, confidence testing, convergent and discriminant validity, and computer-assisted branched testing. Conclusions  are that systematic approaches to evaluation and course development are receiving more and more attention. Most systems begin with a job analysis in order to derive a list of behaviorally-oriented job requirements from which training objectives can be formulated. The new techniques in evaluation and measurement have resulted from attempts to determine whether training objectives have been realized. (Author/JK)",

Telephone and cable television (CATV) facilities may help bring this about. For example a group of representatives could discuss some proposal for an hour and it could be broadcast over CATV or even radio several times during the day. Citizens who wish to discuss the issue could notify a coordinating center and could be assigned to small groups using conference telephone facilities. Elements needed for such experiments are (1) a broadcasting facility, (2) a means of receiving, processing and displaying audience feedback, (3) a way of receiving and rebroadcasting audio signals from the audience, (4) interconnection of large numbers of people into small groups. Although all of  this could be done using the telephone system, some modifications of telephone equipment would be required. CATV could be used for the same purposes, with the modifications built in when the cable is laid. (MG)",

The channels were to be provided on a first-come first-serve basis, along with adequate studio facilities and technical assistance, to any non-commercial individual or group. The channels were provided, but several obstacles prevented their full efficient use. The general public didn't know much about the channels or how to use them, no model program formats were available, there were too few skilled production assistants and too little equipment, and since  groups were prohibited from using advertisements many had trouble financing programs.

The political objective a two-way communication system should serve is making government more responsive to feedback from citizens. At the national and state level this means better education about public issues and more effective exchange of information between citizens and their representatives. At the community level this means helping the discussion of public issues, aiding community decision-making, and connecting members of the community with their officials. At the group level this means helping improve decision-making and helping new groups to form and express new interests. Subscriber  terminals that have been proposed for CATV systems vary widely, from a simple four-button pad to a full keyboard and printer with display screen and microphone.

The results showed that blacks have strongly negative views of whites, whom they see as evasive, critical, aggressive, ignorant, boastful, and of Mexican-Americans, who are considered emotional, radical, talkative, argumentative, and loud. Blacks perceive Japanese-Americans more favorably: they are intelligent, industrious, soft-spoken, reserved, and non-militant. (Although some of these traits may be seen as unfavorable, the overall impression is favorable.) Comparisons with previous research show that blacks and whites  stereotype each other in the same way to some extent, and also that blacks and whites share similar stereotypes of Chicanos and Japanese-Americans.

        "description":"In a review of over 25 empirical investigations of effects of communicating behavioral objectives to students, several trends were apparent. Advance knowledge of behavioral objectives led to improved posttest performance in five of ten studies and to improved retention in two of three instances. Only two of seven studies found an interaction between knowledge of objectives and type of learning: in one case knowledge acquisition but not comprehension was facilitated, while in the other knowledge of objectives interfered on a problem-solving task, but not on a discrimination task. A third group of studies reported interactions between availability of objectives and reasoning ability, personality characteristics, and state anxiety. Finally, when coupled with complete learner control  of the course, knowledge of objectives decreased learning time. (Author/RH)",

Recommended studio equipment includes two Raytheon 500 cameras and two Ampex videotape recorders for a total cost of $57,000. The basic field system should include an Ampex videotape recorder and camera, three TV monitors, three microphones, and an audio mixer for a total cost of $3,150.  Additions to the basic field unit could raise the field unit price to approximately $8,000.

Public broadcasting represents our common search for meaning through our efforts at forming and experiencing images. The brief declaration for &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;imagination&quot; written by Congress into the public broadcast law forms a symbolic utterance expressing the spirit of democratic man as the creative seeker of meaning. The greatest danger to this spirit comes from the broadcast organizations themselves, and the danger of institutionalization and bureaucratization. Perhaps an answer to this is continual examination of how public broadcasting is meeting the public interest. But it is insufficient to say the public interest consists in what is interesting. Neither can we claim the public interest  is simply a fair representation of various idealogies. To all of these must be added the need for philosophical and spiritual inquiry, to produce sights generative of insights. (MG)",

If the developing countries continue trying to build educational systems on historic Western models they may be headed for economic disaster and social bankruptcy. Part of the solution lies in more efficient use of educational research and technology; not the hasty adoption of technology to patch up shaky educational systems, but full and integrated use of all the resources of technology for helping each individual acquire and use knowledge. And instead of  continuing to let the technology do only what the teacher cannot do, we should ask ourselves what the teacher should do that the machine cannot.

A study was generally accepted if it compared performance of experimental and control groups on objective measures of cognitive achievement. Of 200 items studied in detail, only about a dozen met screening criteria. These are summarized under the following headings: programed instruction (the largest group); television, videotape, and motion pictures; slides, filmstrips, overhead transparencies, and still pictures; radio and tape recordings; and multiple media. A closing section enumerates common methodological defects in recent media research. It is  proposed that potentially interacting variables be 1) defined according to some theoretical framework, 2) used in multivariate designs, and 3) taken into account in planning more multi-media studies.

Task time and number of problems attempted were dependent variables. While results were generally not congruent with expectations, there was  some indication that the promise of a reward will cause students to work longer on a task than no promise of a reward, and the promise of a most preferred reward will be more potent than the promise of a reward of lesser preference.

Policy studies should include production -- the social and economic mechanisms for freeing production from competition that makes violence so attractive;  programming--the social and economic dynamics for reducing the utility of violence as a means of gaining audiences attractive to advertisers; and consumer action--social mechanisms by which various concerned public groups can learn what they should do, and broadcasters can become more conscious of public needs and dissatisfactions.

What is different in the communication patterns of the poor goes beyond the phonology and syntax of the sentence and linguistic analysis to the broad basis of communication skills and points out the need for communication training.

Initial comments underline the need for educating teachers in communication behavior and teaching methods. The complex nature of the problem under review indicates the need for careful delineation of the problem for effective research and clear distinctions between the structure and function of black children's language. The role of learning interference must also be determined. There is a growing mandate for accountability in such research, because inaccurate research has fostered hostility and resentment. The researcher must contemplate the need for justifying the research to the researched, lest he subject himself to the accusation of the acquisition of data pursuant to  re-making it into another group's image.

The varieties considered here are immigrant English, indigenous-minority varieties of English, pidginization and creolization, local varieties of non-native English, and English as a foreign language as a branch of study. The learning processes and dialects are discussed in terms of interlanguage, seen as the learner's approximate system, that is, the intermediate stage between the source and target language which results from transfer, transfer of training, strategies of communication, learning, and overgeneralization. The concept of interlanguage provides a basis for dialect and language variety  description, because it considers rules which are linguistic in origin -- derivable from the mother tongue and limited exposure to the target language -- and social in origin -- derived from communication and learning strategies. Implications of the interlanguage theory in terms of learning English as a foreign language are also discussed. (VM)",

This can be achieved by aural exposure to the language and by imitative verbalization of the auditory stimuli. (Author/VM)",

The contrastive analysis hypothesis states that while the child is learning a second language, he will tend to use his native language structures in his second language speech; where there are differences between the two languages, he will make mistakes. The L2=L1 acquisition hypothesis holds that children actively organize the L2 speech they hear and make generalizations about its structure as children learning their first language do. The mistakes expected in such a situation would be similar to those made by children learning that same language as their first language. Error analysis in terms of the two theories is discussed, and  the authors present their own hypothesis for error explanation and language development. (VM)",

Before training, the students were administered these predictive measures: the Modern Language Aptitude Test, the Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery, the Army Language Test, the Horne Assessment of Basic Linguistic Abilities, the Al-Haik Foreign Language Auditory Aptitude Test, the Foreign Language Interest Inventory, the Otis-Lennon Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test, the Need for Social Approval, and the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. In addition, certain biographical items were used as predictors, such  as age and education. Some of the students in the sample were also assessed for motivation with the Q by Q Interview. Results from preliminary data analysis after six weeks of training suggested that each language may have a unique factor structure with very little overlap between languages.

Control and experimental groups of students were selected from kindergarten, second, and fourth grades of elementary schools with a predominantly Chicano population. Experimental students were exposed to various techniques designed to strengthen English as a second language (ESL). To accomplish this goal, teachers of the students in the experimental group were trained by the experimenters in techniques to facilitate the acquisition of ESL skills. The control group received no special instruction. Students in both groups were measured on general school progress, English usage, general school behavior,  and aptitude prior to and immediately following the administration of the experimental techniques.

Written primarily by practitioners concerned with current unrest and its implications for the future of higher education, the papers express a belief in the academic community's ability to solve its own problems. The solutions offered settle basically on 2 major premises. The first is the assumption that colleges and universities should recognize their unique postures as separate communities, functioning within the laws of the larger community. The second is the proposition that colleges meet threats of lawlessness and disorder through preventive techniques, beginning with the  establishment of workable, progressive departments charged with public safety for the community.

The most significant faculty-student relationships were seldom described by faculty as impersonal, and almost all such relationships were associated with continuing faculty-student interaction. Teachers who were more accessible and more interactive with students were not merely being friendly or gregarious; they had considerable intellectual impact on students. Most students described the faculty members who contributed most to them as having stimulated them intellectually, demanded high quality work of them, made them feel confident about their abilities, and interested them in the teacher's field. These interactive  factors were also characteristic of faculty denoted as intellectually influential by students who became more intellectually oriented over the 4 years. (Author)",

        "description":"Prompted by the current debate over tenure, the spread of teacher's unions, and the concern of legislators for providing a uniform teaching load in institutions of public higher education, there seems to be great interest in the whole area of faculty evaluation, as well as in the improvement of college and university teaching. The central purpose of evaluation should be to help a person improve his performance, whether that person is a student or a teacher. It appears, however, that most evaluation systems work primarily to reject people rather than to help them attain better performance. Several options are open to educational administrators in the field of faculty evaluation. One is the growth contract, a system under which every faculty member must state, at 4- to 5-year  intervals, his personal goals for the next interval, even if he has tenure. Even on a campus with a tenure system, the faculty growth contracts inject a vital new dimension: the institutions expect faculty members to grow and change during their stay, and will help them to do so. Another alternative to traditional means of faculty evaluation is classroom observation of teachers either by colleagues and by video tapes. This would afford immediate feedback so that professors could improve their teaching before they developed bad methodologies. (HS)",

Previous instructional programs in this field have been based on teaching numerous rules applicable to particular problems, which must then be applied by the student to actual patients who supply feedback responses to the therapy. The FLUIDMOD program uses a mathematical model of the patient so that a student at a graphics console may work completely through the sequence of steps of a given therapeutic problem. Thus, he is actively involved in simulated patient management. FLUIDMOD also contains interactive programs to simulate the clinical patient-management environment: doctor's orders, nursing notes, the patient chart and record,  etc., are provided. Eventually, FLUIDMOD will contain instructional programs to which the student may branch as required. The utility of using such a system in teaching hospital environments is now being evaluated.

As undesirable as it may be, it appears that more and more of the costs of education will have to be borne by the college and university students. The Yale University Tuition Postponement Option Plan was created to help relieve both the student and the university of some of their financial problems. The central characteristic of the Yale plan is that it links the student's educational costs to his ability to pay for that education over a working career. To the extent that the burden of repayments varies with income, the Plan relieves the student borrower of the necessity to alter his work or study plans in favor of remunerative careers.  The proceedings of the second seminar on the Plan are presented in this document to share with other institutions Yale's work in the development of this kind of student financing. (Author/HS)",

(3) Recruitment of Mexican-American students was most frequently done by Mexican-American faculty and students, or by special visits to high schools enrolling large numbers of  Mexican-American students. (4) Chicano studies courses are offered by about 85% of all public colleges in counties with large numbers of Mexican-Americans.

        "description":"Any community, regardless of size, generates its own individual system of law, and only when such a system of law is in fact substantially just and substantially effective is the community able to function. Until recently, the legal systems within institutions of higher education have missed this point because for generations the traditional power holders in the academic community have gone largely unchallenged. As a result, systems of law active in academic communities or subcommunities are in accordance with the most traditional and strict ideas of fair play. This document analyzes the nature of communities generally in order to determine both the extent to which university environments reflect these characteristics and the ways in which they may be useful in identifying and  responding to the problems of the modern university. The process of analysis begins with the idea of the communitization process in academia, where the end product is both academic and a community, a small society and a small political order. Every such community must, either explicitly or otherwise, define for itself its own special nature and purposes and its own relationship to the general academic tradition of which it is a part.

The new program consists of 2 components. The first is a training program in which 50 faculty members participated for 3 weeks in the summer of 1970. The faculty members were exposed to the Thirteen-College Curriculum Concept and developed course outlines and lesson plans accordingly. The second phase was an internship program in which faculty taught freshmen students for 2 semesters. Tutorial  programs were initiated to aid the students, and faculty met once a week to assess the progress of the program. Results of the program were clearly beneficial.

Most of these exploratory efforts are aimed at improving the conditions for learning in a specific course or subject matter area, and were conducted by individual faculty under the direct auspices and support of the MSU Educational Development Program (EDP). This report describes only those instructional development efforts that were in progress from July 1969 through June 1970. The first part of the document deals with the function, organization and operation of the Educational Development Program and the second discusses projects funded by EDP by subject matter area. The subject matter areas include anatomy,  biochemistry, business, educational psychology, a training program for graduate teaching assistants, humanities, landscape architecture, microbiology, music, physical education, experimental psychology, social work, teacher education, and zoology. The final section discusses projects not funded by EDP but which affect educational development. (HS)",

The program of instruction that was devised had 4 principal objectives in mind: (1) transmission of accurate information and data about African and Afro-American culture and society; (2) substantive intellectual problemsolving through the interdisciplinary approach actualized by means of an interdisciplinary seminar every Friday in which 2 or 3 faculty members discussed a problem from perspectives representing their disciplines; (3) providing the participants with the tools of research and instruction that will enable them to pursue and transmit African studies on their own; and (4) incorporation of such material into the  college curriculum, problems involved, and the most effective means to actualize such an objective. There is a definite need for further training of professors in the area of Black studies. It is hoped that such training will soon be offered as a regular part of the undergraduate and graduate curricula. However, until such programs are initiated, summer institutes such as the ones described in this document are the most effective means for training professors in African studies. (HS)",

There are expressions of confidence in performing an administrative role and in involving faculty in decisionmaking. In addition, there are expressions on the evaluation forms that clearly indicate individual growth and sophistication in the administrative role.

This purpose has been expanded into 3 broad objectives that represent the major aims of the program. (1) The comprehension of selected major principles of college teaching with particular emphasis on: (a) clarification of the aims of higher education; (b) course planning; (c) basic principles of learning and instruction; (d)  characteristics of students considered important to instruction; (e) alternative teaching strategies and techniques; (f) innovative ideas in education; and (g) techniques of evaluation. (2) The application of these principles by each participant to instruction in his own discipline.

A questionnaire and evaluation form was devised and distributed to 79 of the student trainees at all levels of the program. The form was designed to elicit: (1) the relationship between work assignments and the academic phases of the program; (2) the level of work assignments; (3) the students' relationships with supervisors and co-workers; (4) the students' knowledge of the Redstone Arsenal complex and the U.S. Army Missile Command's organizational mission assignments; (5) attitudes  of students toward the cooperative program; and (6) students' plans for the future, specifically, immediately after graduation. It was found that (1) nearly half of the students felt that the work needed to be more related to classroom study; (2) one-third of the students do not find their work interesting or challenging; (3) students seem to feel the supervisors are poorly organized in relation to their jobs and that co-workers are more helpful in transmitting knowledge; (4) students' knowledge of the mission assignments and complex seems to be minimal; (5) students seem to be generally satisfied with the cooperative program; and (6) fewer students were planning to stay at the Redstone Arsenal after graduation than hoped for.

Several significant results of the survey are: (1) Only 38% of the respondents belonged to a national association, which indicates that there is far less membership involvement in professional associations than had previously been assumed. (2) The prime area of interest in priority ranking is the need for professional negotiations services followed by climate of learning and student  personnel programs as well as curriculum and course improvement programs. There was very low interest shown in programs dealing with the organization and administration of higher education and in research services. (3) The key issues in professional negotiations are: tenure policies and procedures, promotion policies, student/faculty ratio policies, faculty participation in college governance, availability of fringe benefits, and faculty participation in curriculum development.

This paper sets the stage for examining the effectiveness of voluntary interinstitutional cooperation first by discussing the domain of institutional relationships and relating the consortium to this larger framework; second, by pointing to some key issues that are raised when the question of interinstitutional cooperation is viewed in the light of 6 functions of higher education; third, by listing 9 purposes that colleges and universities give for joining resources in some common program; and fourth, by examining a select  group of outputs that might be usefully employed to evaluate the effectiveness of cooperative efforts.

The focus of this study was on the small college and the purpose was to identify, within the institutions of higher education investigated, the perceptions and attitudes of different types of students toward institutional functioning and institutional response to change. The study also sought to identify those factors that influence the kinds and degrees of student pressures for change, and the variation of institutional response to such pressures for change in 3 specific areas of  student concern most distinguishable on campuses today. These areas are changes in curriculum, governance, and student life. The Clark-Trow Typology of College Student Subcultures and the Peterson Student Typology of College Students were the means used in the investigative process.

        "description":"The recent advance of collective bargaining into higher education is such that many colleges and universities may anticipate several changes of potentially major proportions in their decisionmaking patterns. One feature of collective bargaining is the discontent on the part of many faculties to rely on informal or noncodified procedures in matters relevant to the terms and conditions of their employment and to the provisions for faculty participation in institutional decisionmaking. As a result, collective bargaining portends to interject major changes in faculty-administration relations in higher education. The major thrust of this paper is an analysis of some of the implications that collective bargaining has or is likely to have on traditional modes of academic governance. The  authors review the governance-related provisions in 31 collective bargaining contracts, and an exhaustive search of the literature has provided an extensive bibliography on the topic of collective bargaining in higher education.

These are: (1) the fundamental forces at play in determining the future of mankind and of the society within which the American universities operate; (2) the specific responsibilities of a big state university in the rapidly changing milieu that surrounds it; (3) the present image of the University of Connecticut in relation to these first two issues; and (4) possible mechanisms aimed at defining the options open to the University of  Connecticut in the coming decade.

Although a high percentage of students favor active community involvement, the alumni show some hesitation in having the University take on more responsibility.

The purpose of a lay governing board is to represent the public interest, particularly with regard to expenditures. The theory is that since public funds are used to support the institution, either as tax monies or in the form of gifts from the general public, representatives of the public interest should be in a position to control these funds. In addition to representing the public interest, the second historic role of lay governing boards has been to raise funds to support the institution. Thus, another important criteria for board membership has been wealth or the  ability to influence wealth. Recently, however, governing boards have been petitioned to broaden and democratize their memberships. College faculty and students feel they should have a voice in the governance of their institution, and in many cases they have been awarded board membership. (HS)",

The development of the GOALS product is accomplished in two steps: (1) identifying and classifying appropriate goals statements and (2) devising a strategy to achieve goal consensus and set goal priorities. Three types of goals identified were: (1) overall purpose goals, gleaned from publicly stated roles and college philosophies; (2) instructional goals which define desired college outputs; and (3) management support goals, which are statements of desired administrative ends. The strategy used to achieve consensus involves participation of a  representative sampling of the entire college community. Participants in a workshop rank order goals in three stages: the first and last stages using individual judgments, and the middle stage requiring consensus by heterogeneous teams (students, teachers, administrators, and citizens). The program, which has been tested in several community college environments, allows for a realistic examination of goals, utilizing both participation and consensus. (RN)",

Some of the findings, which supported the program's apparent effectiveness, were: (1) average performance on the registry exam was about equal to that of all other California programs and better than that for colleges  nationwide; (2) students' grade point average at LACC appeared to be a good predictor of their registry examination score; (3) success at anatomy or physiology is related to success in passing the registry exam; (4) graduates were generally pleased with their training at LACC; and (5) local hospital administrators generally regard the LACC program quite highly.

An expectations instrument, using semantic differential scales, was administered at the beginning and end of a semester to 209 social science students at three colleges. Some findings were: (1) there were statistically significant differences between expectations and evaluations, even for those classes where the actual evaluations were quite high; (2) freshmen and sophomores at all three colleges exhibited similar expectations; (3) sophomores, rather than freshmen, consistently revealed  higher evaluations; and (4) compared with sophomores, freshmen expectations appeared more in keeping with their evaluations. It was concluded that an end-of-course rating can be a generally reliable indicator of student reaction, but an accurate appraisal of the dynamics of the teaching-learning situation requires input of teacher and student expectations.

Results of the survey indicated that: (1) fiscal and financial structures under which the community colleges are operating lack necessary flexibility; and (2) the significance of continuing education, community services, and remedial education is denied by fiscal policy.

General conclusions were: (1) high risk students in special programs tend to persist to a greater  degree and achieve academically at a higher level than comparable high risk students in regular programs; (2) there is an indication that each year academic performance and persistence rates of high risk students in special programs are increasing; and (3) minority group students tend to persist and achieve academically to a greater degree than majority group students.

The sample hypothesis presented was that socio-economic and demographic characteristics associated with the census block in which a student's home address is located would be reflected in his classification score from a test instrument. The steps used in the procedure are described, including data collection and computer use for data manipulation and classification.

In summary: (1) there is a market for the \"external college;\" (2) the proposed use of cassette-mail mode of instruction should be tried at least on a pilot basis; and (3) traditional liberal arts courses are probably the appropriate ones to offer initially.

Forces to compel progress toward better articulation are: (1) concerned legislators; (2) emancipated students; (3) new forms of higher education; (4) an increase in influence and numbers of upper  level colleges; (5) more liberal accrediting associations; (6) more state agencies for coordination; and (7) increased interest of senior colleges in junior college transfers.

Problems of data as experienced by a state director, a college administrator, an institutional research office, and a national community junior college information service are discussed. Some conclusions were: (1) state agencies have planning and coordination as their fundamental purpose; (2) to be effective, state agencies need to define what information is needed, and how it can be made available; (3) institutional research is the means to successfully plan community college goals and purposes; (4) a college cannot afford not to know about its students; (5) an effective information system has potential in terms of making projections and designing models; and  (6) to develop self-knowledge, a college should have an information analyst and an ability to listen.

The object of the experiment, which was in three parts or phases, was to determine the acceptability of microfilm as a substitute for the public card catalog, the new book catalog, and the authority file for the new book catalog. Because many of the cards in the heavily-used public catalog are badly deteriorated and in need of replacement, various alternatives, including microfilming and book publication, have been studied. Part I of the experiment was designed to test the feasibility of the first of these alternatives. Parts II and III, involving the use of microfilm as a substitute for the authority  file and the new book catalog, as it related to the Processing Division, are reported on by the Chief of that Division. Part III also involved public use of The Research Libraries new book catalog on microfilm. A report on this part forms the final portion of the report. (Author)",

The study shows that it is common practice for Government ADP managers to obtain all required ADP equipment from computer systems manufacturers even though certain items of equipment can be procured more economically from the original manufacturers or from alternate sources of supply. The findings of the study are summarized in this report which is issued to inform Congress and  the head of each Federal agency of the opportunities for obtaining savings when acquiring computer components from sources other than the ADP systems manufacturers.

        "description":"The technology of cable television is advancing rapidly. Of prime importance to cable television in the 1970s will be the development of two-way interactive communication services on cable systems. This report describes that development; the technical, economic, and regulatory forces that influence it; and the public policy issues that it raises. This report has been written for several distinct groups of readers. Those concerned chiefly with broad policy questions may wish to read only the summary, the introduction, and the final section on policy issues posed by the evolution of two-way services on cable. Readers who want a more detailed description of potential services, including the \"subscriber response services\" that seem most likely to be feasible in the next five years,  should also read Sections II and III. Those interested in the near-term economics of this group of services should focus on Section IV. Finally, readers interested in the present status of two-way cable television will find a discussion of recent field tests and demonstrations in Section V. (Author)",

        "description":"Computer programs, as legitimate original inventions or creative written expressions, are entitled to patent or copyright protection. Understanding the legal implications of this concept is crucial to both computer programmers and their employers in our increasingly computer-oriented way of life. Basically the copyright or patent procedure involves (1) creativity, (2) an application for copyright registration or patent to the appropriate government office, (3) a notice on the original publication or patented process, and (4) various contractual agreements between the originator and the user of the written idea or invention. Both the creator and the user can lose financially by now adhering to these rules. If the programmer does not protect his procedures others may appropriate  them for a profit without compensating him. On the other hand, any industry using a computer program risks infringement of patent or copyright if the program's origin and reservations on use are not carefully screened. The dilemma occurs in the scope of protection. There are advantages and disadvantages to both forms of protection. The law of trade secrets provides some relief. Yet, until revision of copyright and patents laws consistent with the new technology is accomplished, complete protection may not be attained. (Author/SJ)",

The \"Gilmore\" decision, much discussed at this conference, says that the State affirmatively has to go forward and make sure that prisoners effectively have a way of making their claims available to the courts. This decision seems to also require law libraries and some form of legal assistance in all the jails in the country as  well as the long-term prisons.

User aids that were developed (search manual, truncation guide, frequency lists, KLIC index and bigram frequency list), and communication with the user are discussed. The reasons for using a selective dissemination of information service  (SDI) are presented. (Author/SJ)",

The program idea grew out of the recognition of the need to train librarians to service the needs and demands of a segment of the population that heretofore has not been sufficiently considered as serious library clientele because of its non-reading ability.

        "description":"Learning in infancy is based on activity, beginnings, and curiosity, the so-called ABC's. Earliest behavior consists of mass activity, the period from birth to 24 months of sensory-motor development which provides the foundation for all future learning. Adults must provide space, toys, and affectionate care to help infants proceed through successive stages of learning experience. These are divided into separate periods: birth to 4 months, 4 to 8 months, 8 to 12 months, 12 to 18 months, and 18 to 24 months. Individual differences occur from birth, and the development of a sense of basic trust is important. This is followed by autonomy in the toddler and his sense of success. Sexual identity and language formation, and the establishment of limits are other kinds of beginning  behavior. A baby's curiosity focuses on the newness of his world, and demands patience from parents as well as provisions of space and toys. The first two years are critical because motivation or enthusiasm for learning, along with emotional, social, and intellectual development can either be nourished or blighted. This makes child care a challenging opportunity. (LH)",

Using the pre-test, post-test experimental design with several testing methods, the analysis of variance and covariance were the major statistical tools used in the analysis of the data in addition to some a priori comparisons between treatment means on the results of the analysis of variance. The trends showed considerable support for the positive effects of socioeconomic mix. Included in the conclusions are: (1)  the positive effect on the cognitive development, with less positive effects on verbal skills than other areas of cognition; (2) an increase in interactions between the subject and adults, and a decrease in those between subject and peers as the level of socioeconomic mix increases; (3) the reverse of such interactions as the level of socioeconomic mix decreases; (4) positive effects on the social competency under problem and stress conditions; and (5) positive effects in the development of social directed behavior and less ego directed behavior.

Physical makeup of the facilities is described, along with daily procedures and staff activities. To study the effects of day care on babies, a comparison was made with a non-nursery control group. Almost no differences were found in the areas of physical-medical, mental-motor-sensory, social, and emotional-personality development. The low rate of illness and absenteeism and the general satisfaction of the parents seem to indicate the lack of negative effects on young children of day care. The key concept is quality care, reproducing as much as possible the home environment and the  best features of the &quot;establishment&quot; well-functioning nursery school. Quality is stressed in relationships, play experiences, and health care (by means of a Sick Bay). Goals still to be achieved are in areas of innovation in involving parents and grandparents, learning and social development in a mix of age levels in a group, and cost accounting. (LH)",

The other groups served as controls and the four-year-olds entered day care centers while the five-year-olds attended traditionally run kindergartens. Comparison on several developmental measures between the experimental and control groups made after each year of the program indicate that the children in the Learning to Learn Program made much larger developmental gains than their matched control groups.

The analyses indicated that CAA-operated programs were more likely to report parent participation in decision making and as paid staff, while LEA-operated programs were slightly more likely to report parent participation as volunteers; that CAAs had a higher proportion of paraprofessionals and LEAs more professionals; that CAAs recruited individual volunteers from a variety of sources, and LEAs mobilized formal community organization support; that CEAs were more likely to focus on family services and job training. Other findings included data on equipment, impact on  children, medical and dental programs, ethnic and economic class of staffs, child eligibility, substantive content of the classrooms, and characterization of programs. The analyses provide a static picture of how program directors, teachers, and parents report some of their experiences. The differences involve structure rather than process of impact, and relatively few statistically reliable differences were, in fact, found between LEA- and CAA-operated programs. (Author/LH)",

Sex effects were as expected, but birth-order effects highlighted the second-born child as representing a distinct category. In particular, second-born children manifested greater dependency behavior than either first- or later-borns. The results are discussed in terms of the relationship between maternal responsiveness to attention-seeking behavior in infancy and later dependency behavior; i.e., parental responsiveness leads to less not more dependency behavior in later childhood.

        "description":"A two-process model of infant visual attention is constructed based on research using the modified Berlyne technique with three- to five-month olds. The length of time an infant fixated a pattern was examined along with what caused him to turn to the pattern at all. The study was based both on a re-examination of previous research and on new experiments. Two distinct sets of processes were found in infant attention: Attention-Getting and Attention-Holding. It was found that in the four-month-old infant, habituation is primarily a function of the Attention-Holding process, and occurs more in males than females, although both sexes initially show preferences for, or look longer at, the more complex patterns. Performance on some trials indicates a tie-in between Attention-Getting  and Attention-Holding, with the information obtained from prior fixations of the stimuli somehow determining the speed of subsequent head and eye orientation. The model is followed from occurrence of an Environmental Event, to operation of the Peripheral Perceiver, to information processing and splitting up by the Perceptual Processor, to Memory. Detailed flow charts are included. (LH)",

Regarding socialization, changes in social behavior are found to be more a function of specific setting variables, especially teacher behavior, than entry age. The program also reverses the decline in tested IQ after age two in children with no pre-school experience, and it in fact increases his Stanford-Binet score. Although the program does not seem to have different effects on language development in comparison with children in various control groups, it is significantly more effective if continued for two school years or more and when the age of entry is four  years. However, in regard to academic performance, the children in the Education Improvement Program are not found to perform as well as children at the end of the first year of primary school. After two or three years of the EIP ungraded primary experience, the EIP pupils on the average score higher than their controls, but the differences are non-significant. (LH)",

        "description":"To identify any differences in emotional/personality development of a group of infants reared at home and a matched groups of infants enrolled in a day care center, data were obtained on behaviors of two groups of infants. The sample consisted of 15 demographically matched pairs of infants, ages 3-24 months at entrance. Data were collected through observation, questionnaires, administration of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and monthly telephone interviews with mothers. Five measures of emotional and personality development were used to assess the two groups: reaction to stranger, patterning, separation from mother, exploratory behavior, and eating and sleeping patterns. No significant differences were found between the Home and Center groups. However, since day care  services are growing rapidly, it is clear that more research is needed to: (1) understand the complexity of the acquisition of attachment, which is crucial to development; (2) analyze the components of contingent responding; and (3) provide more detailed and definitive analyses of care-giving situations so the results may be incorporated in training techniques.

The pattern of effects emerging from the data is complex in that meaningful differences are not invariably consistent between administrations of the test. However, the influence of Junior Kindergarten on DAC test scores obtained in Senior Kindergarten gives rise to effects that are not representative of those that occur during the normal growing up of the &quot;artist&quot; and which tend to diminish considerably after further experience in Senior  Kindergarten, indicating they are not of a permanent nature.

The infants' responses indicated that approach affects stimulus differentiation (in terms of fear), while age affects level of response intensity. Strangeness of the social event was not sufficient to explain the results, and ethological and cognitive theories are discussed. It is suggested that the cognitive construct of self be introduced to explain the results.

The report pinpoints the strengths and weaknesses of those Federal programs which have a significant impact on rural America and identifies the Administration's efforts to remedy existing deficiencies. Emphasis in this report is given to (1) income and population trends in relation to objectives for balanced growth; (2) the relationship of geographical distribution of Federal outlays to the patterns of population and income change; (3) an evaluation of the allocation of Federal outlays between rural and urban areas with particular reference to education, manpower, health, and welfare  services; and (4) recent changes in the allocation of Federal outlays between rural and urban areas. Overall, Federal outlays to urban and rural areas are allocated approximately in relation to the urban-rural populations ratio. It is concluded that some rural areas experienced significant increases in population and income in the past decade, and many did so without the stimulus of added Federal aid. Others declined in population and income despite continued Federal spending in those areas. The recommendations include broadening and expanding rural credit payments to include guaranteed and insured loans for community facilities and establishing industrial and commercial job-creating facilities in rural areas.

The subjects in this study, conducted in New York City, were the Youth Services Agency of the Human Resources Administration. Four instruments were designed to test the effectiveness of the training programs given to the Experimental Group and Control Group A. The instruments were designed to measure the abilities of the trainees in these 2 training groups, as well as Control Group B, which received no formal training. The basic hypothesis of this study, therefore, was that Roving Leaders exposed to  the training methods and techniques suggested in the guide would be more effective, as measured by the 4 instruments. The findings indicated that Roving Leaders exposed to the methods and techniques suggested in the RRLTG were more effective. Some recommendations for further use of the RRLTG were that it be implemented in those agencies currently offering other training programs or no training programs for their Roving Leaders and that in future experiments, the investigator be permitted greater control over the environment in which the training occurs.

Major conclusions were that industrialization tends to increase social contacts, that the presence of means of communication denotes a higher level of  industrialization impact on the traditional rural society, that exposure to industrialization creates changes in the class structure and in housing, and that the arguments surveyed were not sufficient to show change of the rural man's social values under the impact of industrialization.

Questionnaires were distributed to teachers, students, and parents of students at Las Cruces High School. The answers for the various subgroups were calculated into percentages and categorized, according to the 8 questionnaire items, into 3 or 4 possible answers. Major findings were that  analysis of student rights, due process, and administrative procedures cannot be made apart from analysis of institutional goals with regard to student offenders and that the majority of respondents value responsibility to the school.

The methodology utilized included a multimedia approach, instructor lectures, a simulation game, and home and community visits. A special inventory of beliefs was devised to discover the perceptions that educational personnel in East Los Angeles have about the nature and  incidence of problems encountered by Mexican Americans on the east side. As measured by the pretest and posttest inventories, it was concluded that changes in perception were small but did move consistently in a positive direction. Some recommendations for course improvement were that the specifics of the conflict between middle class American values and Mexican values should be identified and taught, and that specific values in the Mexican educational tradition and the ways in which American schools can relate to those values should be taught. The inventory of beliefs is included in the appendix. (HBC)",

Specifically described is the extent of changes noted during the 1-year study period extending from the spring of 1970 to the spring of 1971 in (1) the respondents' perceptions of racial prejudice directed toward them by local whites, (2) their desire for racial integration, and (3) their perception of the possibility for racial integration in the local area. A general and consistent change was observed for all 3 orientations toward race relations to become less extreme over the 1 year: although still perceiving high white prejudice in 1971, it decreased from 1970; the polarized  state of the respondents toward extreme positions on desire for integration in 1970 softened in 1971; there was a tendency for fewer blacks to desire a high degree of racial integration; by 1971 almost all respondents perceived integration as possible in most social contexts, except the church. Other more specific findings were reported on change relative to specific situational contexts and suggestions offered for future research.

A total of 21 students ranging in age from 4 to 5 1/2 years were enrolled in the kindergarten class. Two races were represented with 71.4% Negro and 28.6% Caucasian. The Hoffman Migrant Pre-School Checklist was used to assess the areas of self-concept, language development, specific psychomotor skills, and expanded experiences. The checklist was completed on each child at the beginning of the program and at the conclusion of the program. Weight gains were the only physical changes measured. Each student was provided breakfast and lunch daily at school. Each student  also received a physical examination, dental care, and professional help as needed. Major conclusions, based on an analysis of data, were that the behavior of the migrant participants in the preschool project appears to have changed in a positive direction in terms of self-concept, language development, specific psychomotor skills, and mastery of expanded experiences and that there was a small increase in pounds gained during the treatment period.

Formal questionnaires, informal &quot;speak-up&quot; sessions, and informal interviews were utilized to obtain data from staff members, parents, and students. It was determined that the concerns relative to educational materials and equipment included culturally relevant materials, recreational and classroom equipment, bilingual materials, and background information on students. Some concerns relative to the administration of the migrant program included  interim and remedial programs, consultants for specialized areas, the migrant workshop, the teacher aide program, information dissemination to parents, district staff coordination, and prescheduling of health services. Relative to the auxiliary services were health and food services. Self-image and social development were concerns relative to the student. Related concerns included adult education, housing, and the day-care center.

Many of the students are from remote Alaskan villages which do not have high schools. From the perspective of social exchange theory, this study considers how the mutual exchange of rewards and costs in the boarding home parent-student relationship influences each party's level of satisfaction. Rather than focusing on the characteristics of rural students who successfully adjust to the urban environment, attention is given to the characteristics of boarding home parents who develop satisfactory  relationships with students. The method of obtaining information consisted primarily of interviewing boarding home parents and students. Three recommendations were made: (1) a system of high school options is needed in rural secondary school planning; (2) as other secondary school alternatives become available to rural students, the Boarding Home Program should become much more selective in the types of boarding home parents chosen; and (3) the role of the boarding home parents should be defined in a way that confirms the status and legitimate authority of the student's natural parents. In the 3 appendixes, test scores are presented in tabular form, methodology is discussed, and the interview forms are shown. (FF)",

Sixteen distinct objectives of the program were evaluated. Conclusions based on the evaluation were that the Spanish Dame School Project has achieved an outstanding record in teaching English and Spanish to the preschool, kindergarten, and first grade children who have participated; that the project has demonstrated its ability to equal or exceed traditional school programs in school readiness, reading and mathematics; and that the parents of participating children actively supported the project.

Recommendations and observations were based on the experiences of the observers,  who were also participants. Major recommendations include that personnel responsible for the management of a project should be concentrated in 1 locale, that definition of roles and responsibilities should be formulated in the planning phase, that adequate provision must be made for the acquisition of skills and information, that those persons who are to assume primary responsibility should be heavily involved in all planning activity, that all capital resources be allocated at the time the plans for the project are approved, and that plans should include provision for monitoring, documentation, and evaluation.

Four broadly stated objectives discussed and evaluated in the report are language development, health, the record transfer system, and project monitoring. Accomplishments of the summer term program and some exemplary or innovative features of programs are described. Major findings include that the migrant program met its objectives, that participation of migrant parents in determining  program purpose and objectives was strong throughout the state, and that the weakest part of the program was the evaluative function and the reporting of project effect.

        "description":"Relevant problems facing rural Blacks and Chicanos are discussed in this paper. It is argued that the \"American Dream\" creates unrealistically high aspirations and expectations for rural youth and the disadvantaged minorities. If rural youth do not choose to migrate to the urban centers, their only alternative is to take whatever employment is available in their local community, thereby limiting paths for broader occupational and social mobility. If they migrate to the metropolis, greater limitations for social mobility are suffered owing to socially structured impediments in their background environments, their perceptions and self-conceptions, and the negative attitudes other members of the society hold toward them. Rural versus urban youth, rural Blacks and Chicanos, rural  Black youth in the South, and Chicano youth in the Southwest are additional topics of concern. It is suggested that strong and widespread social support for a high priority national policy coupled with massive funding aimed at serving rural youth's educational and employment needs be developed. Also, the concepts of formal education and educational programs, the use of advanced technology, and the use of nonschool mechanisms having educational potential need to be thoroughly reviewed.

The training of 5 teenagers in dramatics in the Lake Mills project, the open classroom program in Wantoma, the camping experience activity in the Oakfield project, and the student council and community involvement activity in the Watertown project are briefly described as exemplary projects or activities. Grade placement of the 1,495 children actually served in the summer and fall programs was facilitated by evaluations by the staff after observing the children for a few days in the program. The teacher-pupil ratio was extremely low owing to a severe cutback in labor in the area. Interrelationship with regular  Title I programs, coordination with other programs, inservice training, non-public school participation, interstate and intrastate dissemination, community involvement, program effectiveness, special vocational areas, supportive services, and staff utilization are additional topics of discussion. New programs include the Stevens Point School District's program at Lena, the Oakfield School District's program at Lamartine, and programs operated during the 1971 program year using 1970 carry-over funds.

The factors examined are residence, race, education, and self-concept. Group I consisted of 264 male and female black high school seniors in Louisiana. The rural subsample consisted of 157 students, 67 male and 90 female. Group II consisted of 484 high school students in 15 East Texas high schools who were interviewed in both their sophomore and senior years. The second sample was designed to insure the inclusion of male, female, black, and white students. Major findings were that lower-class southern rural and urban black youth have relatively high-status occupational desires, that significant  differences existed between rural and urban females in the high aspiration and expectation categories, that the respondents tended to show agreement in their perception of blocking factors, that the proposition that urban youth will experience lower levels of perceived goal blockage than rural youth was only partially supported, that white youth will experience lower levels of perceived blockage than black youth, and that the perception of goal blockage will not increase as high school students approach the time of graduation.

Data were obtained from interviews with 6,500 10th-grade students in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. The 4 independent variables were father's education, father's occupation, residence, and race. An examination of the models constructed revealed that (1) social class indicators accounted for the largest effect estimates, (2) residence was associated with a smaller portion of the variation, and (3) the effect of race was negligible when controls were applied. Application of the most efficient model to black and white subsamples revealed race variations in both  composite effect estimates and the rank order of effect estimates. Implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the developmental model of occupational choice, and suggestions for further research are presented. (Author/PS)",

The survey was concerned with the contemporary situation of urban American Indians and with the attitudes of local businessmen toward urban Indians. The method used involved recording respondent's answers, and much of the content of the respondent's answers are reported in the form of direct quotes. Respondents were selected from a representative sample of establishments in the area--public agencies, religious agencies, thrift shops, retail stores, and gas stations. Questions were based on the instructor's questions, and the data are presented in analyzed form. In evaluating the study, it was concluded that the respondents voiced what they believed the interviewers wanted to hear.  This suspicion was based on 2 observations: (1) Many answers were qualified in such a way as to contradict the basic response, and many ambiguities made it difficult to understand what the respondents felt. Many responses seemed to be given with an attitude of caution and lack of thought or interest, although a statistical summary of the responses was attempted. (2) The experiences of the informants with American Indians appeared to be extremely minimal. The only contact seemed to be through the buying-selling relationship. From this fact, it was assumed that much of the responses were based on hearsay and personally untested ideological opinions. (FF)",

What is taught agronomic technicians being trained for public service, as private sector agents, and as instructors for professional agricultural training is discussed in terms of the type of  material used, the practical tasks assigned, and the merits of visits to plantations versus visits to villages; and the professional choices open to agronomic technicians after graduating are considered. Localization of SATS and rural development are covered in terms of urban zone, peri-urban zone, urban couronne, and hinterland.

Sixty subjects were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups: 30 obtained computer search services by the traditional method and 30 were placed directly in charge of formulating their own search strategies via the CAI training package. Data from 58 subjects  were suitable for analysis. The satisfaction scores and search precision ratios analyzed indicated that the treatment groups did not differ. However, novice users of the CAI package acquired significant gains in knowledge relative to the use of the ERIC data base.

        "description":"For several years, the Eloy Elementary Schools have had a retention-failure pattern among a group of children consistently dominated by migrant children. After an investigation, the inability to profit from reading instruction was found to be one of the many factors contributing to this pattern. The lack of the ability to use the English language was felt to be a prime cause of this reading deficiency since migrant children are consistently confronted with the necessity to read in a foreign language. Reading is an extension of a child's language, and his language is an outgrowth of his experiences. Thus, it was thought, at the Eloy Elementary Schools, that an attempt should be made to extend these children's experiences in order to further develop their English language  competency. &quot;The Eloy Story&quot; describes the &quot;language-experiences&quot; of the Eloy migrant children during summer school. The &quot;language-experiences&quot; described include experiences such as eating breakfast and lunch together, swimming, and taking short, daily field trips; group interaction activities; sense awareness; language activities; and group committee work. Also discussed in &quot;The Eloy Story&quot; are the preservice and inservice training of the personnel and the subjective, objective, oral language, and oral language growth evaluations of the program.

        "description":"This paper is a master's thesis reporting research on the effects of two instructional variables, recall of relevant subconcepts and information regarding the attributes of the concept instances on immediate concept learning, transfer and retention. Three sets of instructions were written varying in the amount and type of information given. These instructions preceded five lessons dealing with geometric concepts. The subjects were 102 sixth-graders who were randomly assigned to one of five experimental groups which were defined by the content of the materials they received. Concepts were presented in a narrative style which was intended to be interesting to the students. After completion of the lessons, the students were given a test to measure initial acquisition of the concepts  and transfer. Eighteen days later the same test was given to measure retention and delayed transfer. Data indicated that recall of relevant subconcepts did not have a significant effect on the specific immediate test, on the specific retention test, and on the immediate transfer test. There was a significant effect on the delayed transfer test. (FL)",

Blacks performed between 12 percent and 16 percent below the national average at the four age levels: 9, 13, 17 and young adults (26-35). When results were partially adjusted for disproportionate representation of Blacks on the variables of size of community, level of parental education, sex and region, the reduced difference between Black and national performance was between 7 percent and 10 percent at the four age levels. Blacks  performed best on those science exercises largely dependent upon daily experience and common knowledge, and worst on those which involved a detached research attitude toward the objects and phenomena of science.

The list of human environmental use areas and characteristics  in Section III is a reflection of these activities.

Detailed descriptions, a rationale, and written examples of each of the initiating activities are given. Transcripts of each of the 20 video-tape clips, each with a summary which highlights the initiating activities being attempted and with  discussion questions related to the clip, are included.

Ninety-six seventh grade students in two low- and two average-ability mathematics classes participated in the study. One low- and one average-ability class played the nonsimulation game Equations twice a week for nine weeks in addition to receiving traditional instruction. The remaining two classes received traditional instruction only. In the games classes, the Equations tournament was based upon team competition using four-member teams. Students were pretested and posttested with the computations subtest of the Stanford Achievement Test in mathematics and a divergent solutions test designed by the experimenters. Analysis showed that the experimental  classes had significantly greater gains on both the computations subtest and the divergent solutions test. The low-ability experimental class obtained a posttest score on the divergent solution test that was almost double their pretest, while the low ability control class showed no gain. Learning rates were more similar in the two experimental classes than in the two control classes. (Author/DT)",

As originally proposed, the program sought to bring together in a series of symposia community leaders in the areas of education, agriculture, industry, business and government from 17 counties in southeastern Nebraska. To ascertain problem areas and determine community action or response, three symposia and eight follow-up workshops were held. These were conducted to assist community leaders in preparing objectives for creating a community environmental education program, followed by setting priorities, time schedules, and determining local action to achieve their objectives. The report deals primarily with the first series of workshops, addressed to educators  and keynoted by Dr. Robert Rienow. It reviews the objectives and accomplishments of their workshops, materials from which they developed their community analyses, and the findings and recommendations following assessment of community problems and solutions. Their analyses are given compositely as community profiles. The final section presents evaluations for the first two series, plus an overall evaluation, while the appendix includes the program format and evaluation forms. Dr. LaMont Cole and Stewart Udall keynoted the second and third sessions, respectively. (BL)",

Designed as a model to aid in the development of a state plan for environmental education, this interdisciplinary, field- and people-oriented project of the Northwest Environmental Education Center plans to establish model/pilot projects throughout the region. Implementation is by a three-phase plan. The first, at the community level, establishes a pilot program in the Sedro-Woolley school district aimed at staff improvement and development, development of curriculum learning packages, field program implementation, and disseminating information about the program. The second phase proposes a two-part study with the Watcom County  Park Board and schools participating to develop a county-wide model for the implementation of environmental education in the schools. A county environmental analysis project will be undertaken with the findings used in school program development. Regional applications compose the third phase and constitute a major portion of the document. The Whidbey Island site is to be utilized as a regional center for staff improvement and development, operating a program which will provide school districts with a hierarchy of environmental education specialists.

With a time frame covering a decade of water quality and pollution data, an attempt was made to devise projections for the next 15 years which might reveal how the urbanization process and the pollution process interact in the region. To implement this task, several stages of research were necessary, as described in the text: (1) development of a hydrologic data bank, (2) screening the data, (3) development of a projection model to estimate the impact on water of effluents associated with  industrial growth and population growth, (4) construction of a computer model to simulate the behavior of a river system under the impact of urbanization, and (5) changing the model's premises in accordance with different sets of assumptions and regional growth policies to cast light on how best to alleviate pollution effects.

Many of the laws analyzed are designed to deal with problems that are treated in the President's proposed National Land Use Policy Act of 1971, an act providing Federal assistance to states to develop programs dealing with land use issues of regional or state concern. The bill, for example, calls upon states to identify and control development in areas of critical environmental concern; assure that development of regional benefit is not blocked or unduly restricted by local governments; and control large scale  development and land use in areas impacted by key facilities. Legislation cited and analyzed includes the: (1) Hawaiian Land Use Law, (2) Vermont Environmental Control Law, (3) San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, (4) Twin Cities Metropolitan Council, (5) Massachusetts Zoning Appeals Law, (6) Maine Site Location Law, (7) Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Program, (8) Wisconsin Shoreland Protection Program, and (9) New England River Basins Commission. Summaries of other innovative legislation together with six key issues in state land use regulation are also given. (BL)",

At that time, NIMH produced television spots, radio announcements, newspaper and magazine ads, films, and general awareness publications. This guide was developed to make available educational guides and tools so that there can be better understanding and communication about drugs--the pressures, cultures, questions, and values--with students, young people, or patients. The guide includes films, audiotapes, a simulation program, and printed materials. They show the latest educational techniques of drug abuse prevention; how one becomes aware of his own and others' emotional reactions to drug abuse; various  proven approaches used in drug abuse prevention and educational activities throughout communities in the U.S.; and beginning approaches to alternatives to drug misuse.

A second, related study sought to determine whether particular values characteristically associated with the various disciplines could be modified by such a course experience. Experimental subjects, 61 students in the University of Tulsa, were administered an Environmental Events Awareness Scale and the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values, both prior to and at the end of a multi-disciplinary university course entitled \"Science, Technology and the Environment.\" The results indicate no heightened awareness of the experimental subjects, as measured by  the Environmental Evants Awareness Scale. Data indicate there was actually a decrease in the awareness of such environmental events at the end of the course experience. Similarly, the results revealed little change in selected values as a function of exposure to the course material. (BL)",

Subjects were administered an Environmental Knowledge Inventory and an Inventory of Societal Issues (ISI), both as pretests and posttests. Results indicate students taking the course increased significantly in their knowledge of the environment as compared with a control group. In addition, they showed significant attitude changes on four of five factors on the ISI (revised form). These changes are interpreted to mean that the students have become less sure that scientific and  technological advances are beneficial to the man-nature interaction and have become more aware that such advances may be detrimental to it; they have become more aware of the complexity of the problems; they are more concerned with the problems of population growth and the need to restrict it; they are less certain that science and technology are capable of solving society's problems; and they are more concerned with individual and personal responsibility and action.

Interest had been displayed by local civic groups, fraternal clubs, and private organizations in identifying environmental improvement projects that could be undertaken by individual groups. The Environteam thus saw the need for a coordinated, combined approach to resolving the problems, utilizing total effort and talents of multiple groups. To this end, presentations were given to various groups to stimulate their interest in the local area ecology, improve their environmental awareness, and encourage them to develop constructive projects for the betterment of the county. The main portion of this ideabook consists of five  such presentations. They deal with problems, possible solutions, and improvement ideas/projects associated with Brevard's beaches, recreational areas, bike paths, solid waste disposal, and waterways. In addition, 14 other projects which keep the public ecologically minded and stress moral responsibility are briefly described.

The inquiry and problem solving approach seeks to: (1) build a framework of reference to attain an understanding of the causes and effects of our present environmental crisis, (2) attain an awareness of both the beauty and ugliness of our environment, (3) develop a sense of pride and social responsibility for the preservation of our planet, (4) foster a realistic identity with the social problems relating to our environment,  (5) create the desire to become involved in finding solutions to these problems, and (6) realize the importance of attitudes toward making advances in the human conditions.

Teaching, then, concerns itself not with accumulation of factual information but, rather, with the development of concepts, theories, generalizations, principles, and main ideas which, according to this study, need to become part of the student's way of viewing the world in order to interpret and analyze the data of everyday experience. Thirty-five select social studies student teachers and eighteen English student teachers, asked to discuss and suggest remedies for one of four major social issues, were randomly  divided into two groups -- one cued to use theories and concepts from their social science field, and the other not cued. Demonstrating the apparent lack of emphasis on concept and theory learning, comparisons between majors and between the cued and uncued teachers indicated that study in their major field did not appear to have improved their ability to analyze and suggest remedies for major social issues. School instruction in general and the social studies specifically need to concern themselves with functional learning. (SJM)",

Hypotheses for study were that there will be no significant difference between: 1) observed verbal teaching behaviors of the highest and lowest ranked teachers; 2) the observed cognitive behavior of the highest and lowest ranked teachers; and, 3) the observed cognitive behavior of the students of the highest and lowest ranked teachers. Instruments used to measure the verbal and cognitive behavior were Teaching Situation Reaction Test (TSRT), the Observational System for Analysis of Classroom Instruction (OSACI), and the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior (FTCB). Thirty secondary social studies teachers were selected for the  sample--those ranking in the upper and lower quartiles of the TSRT. The variables under investigation were the verbal teaching behaviors as measured by the OASCI and the cognitive classroom behavior of the teachers and their students as measured by the FTCB. Findings indicate that the cognitive behavior patterns of teachers and students can be identified and the cognitive behavior differs mostly at the higher levels of cognition.

The substantive content is analyzed as  moderately sound, and the physical and technical content as very good, although more visual materials could have been included in the text. The author's rationale is implicit and fairly clear to the analyst, while the objectives set forth are very clear. Primary goals of the materials, as seen by the analyst, are for students to become skilled in the scientific method, questioners of existing knowledge and values, and creative, divergent thinkers. Cognitive objectives are stated clearly with emphasis on analytical thinking, and affective objectives are also stated. Cognitive content of the materials is judged as unbiased, of good quality, and balanced in values, with much emphasis placed upon analytical questioning and inquiry. (SJM)",

Examples of such vehicles for introducing change are: 1) Establishment of a University 4-credit course, Teaching About Africa in the Public Schools, for undergraduate and graduate students; 2) Development of an annotated bibliography of children's and adolescents' fiction and non-fiction material available from the University on loan; 3) Development of a resource bibliography of audiovisual  material available in eight centers within the Detroit Metropolitan area; 4) Development of teaching kits on Africa for loan to public schools teachers. Kits contain artifacts and other useful materials; and 5) Workshop and in-service participation by both University and public school personnel have taken place on topics of interest concerning Africa. The author also includes a list of reasons why others might be interested in knowing about the cooperative program described here. (ED 063 234 is a related document.) (Author/JLB)",

        "description":"Offered here is a narrative survey of international approaches to training for social welfare. For the purposes of the survey, social welfare tasks have been defined as those which involve the improvement of social functioning and social relationships in meeting social needs at individual, group, or community levels. The study also encompasses manpower policies and provisions for social welfare tasks in all sectors of national development. Only developments of an innovating character were selected for consideration. The survey was concerned with new approaches and experiments to develop manpower for tasks at different levels, ranging from policy making, planning, administration, education and supervision, to a variety of field activities. The developments covered in the study  took place principally during 1960-69. The main concerns of the study may be grouped according to: manpower policy for social welfare; organizing training procedures and resources; and realizing curriculum objectives. A chapter is devoted to each of these areas, and a concluding chapter is devoted to examining the significance of the expanding concept of social welfare and the implications of its developmental aspects against the background of the findings.

        "description":"The purpose of this lecture is to provide a perspective from which parents and school people can formulate reasoned opinions on what the school's role should be in regard to students' values. The author offers a definition of values and discusses three rough categories of values--esthetic, instrumental, and moral. The school is a creature of the society it serves--in our case, a democracy. Thus, the perspective from which we view questions about schooling and values should include a considered definition of a democratic society. It is important to recognize that teachers/administrators are agents of the society. The society is within its rights in refusing to employ those who would use the school for subversion. But, in light of the earlier discussion of values and pluralism, a  decision as to what constitutes subversion may be difficult to make. As agents of the society, the teacher/administrator must be beholden to a conception of democracy that goes beyond responding to strident local interests and prejudices. The basic position--that the school's role is to assist students to develop a basis for their values that is as rational as possible is a basic theme for discussing values and schooling, though there are some variations depending on the types of values under consideration. The democratic commitment to human dignity, especially if students are considered humans, has much to say about what the school should be doing, and what parents should demand it does, about values.

        "description":"The intention of the initial portion of the discussion is to show how residential displacement can affect the school child and why cooperative agency response is necessary. The major objectives of the research are twofold: 1) to determine the extent and nature of cooperation between elementary schools and relocation agencies in responding to the mobile child; and 2) to uncover the reasons for organization cooperation, or its absence--in terms of the particular traits of each organizational type. Organizational literature is used as a basis for conceptualizing the research design. Information used in the study was obtained through field interviews with the personnel of twelve schools and ten agencies providing relocation services in four cities: Detroit, Cleveland, Minneapolis,  and Milwaukee. Direct cooperative response to the mobile child by these two agencies was found to be virtually nil. However, certain relationships did occur between them. Organizational Properties of the public elementary school seemed to severely restrict any chances for the development of serious relations with the relocation agency. Findings suggest that public policy makers should give more serious thought to how human services can be planned and integrated so that they are fully responsive to the complex needs of the individual.

Fair verbal behavior is defined as following a standard of equal treatment toward all students and as free from bias, dishonesty, and injustice. Findings from previous studies indicate that communications in classroom verbal interaction carry cognitive, affective, and social meaning. Further, teachers who give fair verbal responses usually have classes who achieve in most subject areas. In two films of teacher-led class discussion, the teacher exhibits unfair verbal behaviors in the first and fair verbal behaviors in the second. Students are  asked to observe and identify consistency of teacher feedback and differences between the behavior patterns of the two teachers. A class discussion follows, after which pre-service teachers analyze the tapescript of the film for specific indicators of fair verbal behavior. Lastly, the students work on the criterion test for the unit in a role playing activity with a fair and unfair teacher, using dialogue developed by pre-service teachers. Student materials are included in the booklet. (Author/SJM)",

John M. Ball's paper, Toward a Humanistic Teaching of Geography, focuses on the need for more attention to the affective components of the teaching-learning process. Geography and Geographic Education: Paradigms and Prospects, by A. David Hill, begins with the question, \"Are today's ideas and events in geographic education a part of a more general pattern of development in geography and education; did they evolve from some recognizable antecedents, and are they likely to be related and responsive to probable future developments?\" James Gardner's paper  discusses some strategies for relevant learning situations in physical geography. George Vuicich offers a possible model for training geography teachers within the context of a preliminary report describing the rationale and organization of four RPW's developed to encourage the adoption of and maximize the use of the High School Geography Project. Some of the remaining papers deal with: the functions of a problem-oriented field seminar; developing a communications-content model for geography workshops; and a preliminary evaluation report of the AAG project on the improvement of college geography instruction.

Professional anthropologists, representing cultural and physical anthropology, archaeology,  and linguistics, analyzed the materials to determine the accuracy and representativeness of the anthropological content. The study is organized into seven chapters. Chapters I through III contain background materials; IV and V, findings of the analysis system and the results of the anthropology examinations; VI, a critique of the CMAS; and VII a review, conclusions, and recommendations.

The immediate objectives of the Workshop were to expand the pooling of knowledge and techniques in the field and to include in its report the first major statement of theory and techniques about CCI. The workshop also stressed that the accumulated knowledge and techniques in community crisis intervention should benefit grass roots, minority and  otherwise powerless groups in their quest for self determination.

Emphasis is upon examination and tentative evaluation of the major components of the Comprehensive School Project: a five year training program to educate 165 Thailand teachers in Canada in the physical and administrative organization of a comprehensive high school; the sending of advisers to Thailand; consideration of the Thailand project office as an administrative unit; and the outlook  for diversification of the secondary school curricula in Thailand. Evaluations indicate that the training program successfully reached its goals, the impact of advisers was excellent, the school project office was highly functional in implementing basic changes, and that as long as diversified secondary education helps the Thai culture survive, the Thai people will incorporate it into their educational system.

This paper furnishes information on their cultural background and lists multi-media resources to introduce teachers to Italian society so that educators may better understand their students. Immigrant children are faced with choosing between two conflicting life styles -- the values of Canadian society and family values and customs. When teachers are aware of the problem they can cushion the culture shock for students and guide them through a transitional period. The paper deals with history, geography, and climate, explaining and suggesting some ideas on why Southern Italy differs from Northern and Central Italy. Cultural differences can be  traced not only to the above factors, but also to ethnic roots and the &quot;culture of poverty&quot; -- attitudes of the poor which create a mentality that perpetuates living at a subsistence level. The low status of women as it affects society is discussed, since the family is seen as a society in microcosm.

        "description":"Secondary education in the United Kingdom is gradually being reorganized along &quot;comprehensive&quot; lines, although there is still resistance to it. Stemming from the Butler Education Act of 1944, a tripartite secondary system emerged, comprised of the grammar (for superior students), the technical (for average and above average students), and the modern (for average or below average students). After adoption of a bilateral system, omitting the secondary grammar school, the next logical step was toward a comprehensive school with no selection criteria. Feeling that it would destroy academic standards, many educators resisted the change. This occasional paper describes the experiences of a British social studies educator when in 1968, a secondary grammar school merged with a modern  school. Separate school sites created some problems for staff and students and destroyed the desired unity. Findings by 1971 indicate that most problems created by split building sites had been met; that teacher changeover from the grammar to comprehensive was somewhat traumatic; that a great deal of experimentation took place and continues; that academic achievement is as high now as it was before integration; and lastly, that the first five years were a challenge to make education more relevant.

        "description":"The pace of technological change, its impact and influence on human behavior, and predictions as to the state of psychotechnology in 1980 are discussed. The author deals with contributions of behavioral scientists working in military and industrial settings toward solving societal problems. Five topics are emphasized. The rate of technological change is gradual, for which a decade is not a long period. Technology of teaching and learning focuses upon two major technological improvements for the next ten years -- better ways to determine what to teach, and individualizing learning. Evaluation and assessment are viewed as having a more prominent role. Psychotechnology of organizations and public policy are the last topics. The author forsees psychotechnology making even more  important contributions to societal welfare between 1970 and 1980, since the problem areas are becoming more clearly defined, technologies are developing and much &quot;on the shelf&quot; information is now available for use, and decision makers in greater numbers are coming to understand and accept human goals, human needs, and crucial contributions that behavioral science can make to their fulfillment. Twenty-eight citations comprise a brief bibliography. (Author)",

The purpose of the project was to plan and establish a viable program in K-12 conservation education. An interdisciplinary approach was designed, encompassing all grade levels and focusing upon field experience learning programs within the community and emphasizing study of the interrelationship of man and nature. Teacher participation was voluntary, with the site, time, and content areas determined by the teacher. Stated project objectives are measured in a summative evaluation, concluding that in 1968-1969: 1) 112 environmental learning experiences were provided with overwhelming teacher response; 2) community and regional interest was aroused; 3) teachers were involved in planning,  analyzing, and evaluating curriculum; 4) students were exposed to different areas of subject matter; 5) a three-man professional staff successfully aided teachers in planning programs; 6) pre-service teachers participated in environmental experiences and training institutes conducted by LEASE; and 7) fifteen lay people were trained as field assistants to aid the classroom teachers.

        "description":"This address, given in May, 1970, as part of a UNITAR Special Lecture Series, proposes a revelant view of education; namely, that education should aim not at producing manpower but at manhood, helping each person achieve full humanity, thereby making the world a desirable habitat for mankind. Nation states use education as a means toward preserving their political, social, and economic status quo to foster national ambitions. Education, then, becomes an instrument of national policy whereby it is viewed as an economic investment. The flaw in this philosophy of economic growth is that it is inhuman and tends to enslave recipients to a current set of technological practices and to a given historical moment. Conversely, when education helps men to become human by helping them to  learn to use their minds, economic growth might favorably change and, moreover, such an education would be best for the national and world community. The world community of the future could be a continuous learning society in which every person in every nation rises to the highest cultural level attainable. (Author/SJM)",

Each proposition is examined and commented upon. In conclusion the author calls for teacher improvement, the setting of goals, assessment, evaluation, and accountability programs for education, and strengthening of local and state systems. The second part of the speech deals with advancing democratic human relations through education. A related document is ED 063 178. (Author/SJM)",

The largest number of immigrants in Toronto are from Southern Italy where the standard of living is exceptionally low and cultural traditions exert a strong influence upon individuals. In Italy, school facilities, equipment, and the quality of education are poor. Education is controlled by the central government through the Ministry of Public Instruction, providing a highly centralized curriculum with a set number of hours devoted to each subject. Teacher training for elementary teachers, criticized as superficial, begins at age 14 and ends at age 18. Secondary teachers are trained in Universities.  Schools maintain a formal and disciplined environment within the classroom. Education is free and compulsory for an eight year period. Elementary school consists of five years of schooling. Middle schools, for children aged 11 to 14, focus upon teaching Latin. Secondary education, dominated by academic, classically-oriented, prestigious lycees, offers five year courses for students aged 14 to 19, with emphasis upon Latin and Greek. The universities are bastions of classical traditions. Closely related documents are SO 004 351 and SO 004 339. (SJM)",

This study guide includes a description of the fifteen sessions. For each there is given a brief introduction and summary, an outline, questions for further study, and a bibliography of required and optional reading materials. Also included is a detailed bibliography and information about sources from which additional instructional materials can be obtained. The interdisciplinary approach begins with ecology and human environment and moves to the geographical concept of man's surroundings and his relationship to them. Two sessions on population discuss composition, sex ratio, age, growth, and economic development. Food,  resources and land conservation lead to a study of social problems: poverty, crime, educational disadvantagement, unemployment, housing and urban planning. Man's environment is again examined in terms of pollution; community action is explored; and, in the final session, questions are asked leading to ways of introducing in the curriculum the factors discussed.

        "description":"Inequities and injustices are not happenstance in America, but rather, exist as a way of life for many minority groups. All too often communication, understanding, and appreciation is lacking among diverse groups. It is suggested here that the need for education in intergroup relations is greatest in predominantly white communities and, moreover, in schools which have heretofore perpetuated intergroup conflict and inequalities. Schools are in a unique position to help young people develop a humanistic attitude toward others by re-educating teachers in white communities as a way of attacking the roots of racism. A model for inservice training in intergroup relations is presented as a strategy to provide educators with an understanding of the forces of racism, prejudice, and  discrimination. Implementation of the inservice program consists of three major aspects which focus on cognition, affect, and behavior. The model can best be described as the normative-re-educative strategy that assumes man is rational and intelligent -- and that changes in norms involve changes in attitudes, values, skills in relationship to one another, and changes in one's thinking patterns stemming from new knowledge. Lastly, a research design is presented consisting of several control and experimental groups to evaluate the effectiveness of the inservice program. (SJM)",

The program and its dissemination were considered a system, made up of three main parts: The ECON 12 course, evaluation instruments and procedures, and a teacher training program. The latter two were considered as vital as the course materials and the cognitive and behavioral objectives. Cooperation from the County Department of Education assured that trial courses and teacher participation contributed to effective course design. Materials are described and stages of lesson  development are clarified. A section on teacher training outlines the chronological sequence of a basic introduction to economic theory, practicum sessions, and teacher supervision. The to-date summary indicates positive acceptance of the project during trial tests and satisfaction with the application of system development procedures to the design of the course. At the date of this report, Units I and II were completed (ED 040 100, 101), Unit III and optional units were due for completion in 1967. Revised editions were published in 1968 (ED 053 048, 049).

Examining other future oriented studies, articles, and research documents, six projections are reviewed which indicate that the U. S. will be crowded, urbanized, mobile, technological, brain-intensive, and a medico-interventionist society, and which suggest many questions for considering the quality of life. Emphasis in the guidelines is upon the potential for education and for wise public policy to advance order and to preserve individual liberties by lowering the need for extensive regulatory and allocative policy. Citizens need to learn to take more responsibility for their own behavior and compromise in  the many kinds of interactions with others. Because there is much to learn from other nations which appear to yield a high degree of security and well-being for their people, the study and comparative analysis of the three small nations of Denmark, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia offers ideas for developing guidelines for U. S. education and public policy. It is expected that this study will point toward the need for additional studies and for creative ways to draw upon experiences and policies in other nations to improve education and public policy in the United States.

Special emphasis is upon writings since the 1950's. During earlier development, music analysts concentrated upon the elements of music (i.e., melody, harmony, rhythm, and form). Since 1950, varying viewpoints on the teaching of music analysis have emerged, producing a surge of various analytical trends and philosophies derived from other than musical contexts. Information theory, phenomenology, and the application of computers have made the strongest impact upon music theory in recent years. Classified headings in the listing cover: 1) general discussions of music analysis,  2) the analysis of specific elements of music (melody, harmony, etc.), 3) principal trends and approaches to the subject, and 4) samples of analytic models.

        "description":"This investigation assesses the environment of the elementary child experience, rather than his academic achievement or personal adjustment. Subjects included 22 collegiate teams in 11 open space schools, and 11 teachers in 7 self-contained classrooms. In each self-contained classroom, a minimum of 15 observations was made (five each of reading, mathematics, social studies and science). A new instrument was developed for scoring the activities of the children, the group children worked in, and the amount children moved. The four basic measures used were 1) the amount of movement not specifically directed by the teacher; 2) the proportion of time children spent waiting, listening or passive; 3) the proportion of time spent in large groups; and 4) the proportion of time spent in  educational games, cooperative work, and doing, when not in large groups. An original questionnaire measured the degree to which teacher and principal respondents believed in formal control of children. Results indicate that school environment experienced by the student is affected by school organization: a high degree of activity is more likely to be found in an open space team teaching school than in a self-contained classroom. Implications of the findings for school design and possible long-range effects of the active classroom are presented. A 16-item bibliography and attitude questionnaire are included. (Author/MJM)",

Participants included 220 cooperating teachers and 165 student teachers whose superintendents comprise the Joint Teacher Education Council and 37 college  supervisors in 13 teacher training institutions. Five conclusions were that: 1) The practicum experience should not be limited to the final phase of preservice training; 2) Careful thought must be given to those qualities which may predict the most productive interaction between experienced and prospective teachers; 3) New staffing patterns and compensation agreements may need to be explored in order to maximize practicum effectiveness; 4) Integration between the practicum and other components of the teacher training process is necessary; and 5) Collaboration between school systems and teacher training institutions must be real.

        "description":"The Reform in Teacher Education project originated as a counter proposal to the USOE Bureau of Educational Personnel Development in reaction to Task Force '72. The proposal from the National Education Association suggested that teachers should and could be involved in reforming and managing in-service teacher education. The project engaged local teacher associations in designing the reform of teacher education. The first phase of the study involved steps that led to deciding what reforms should be undertaken. First emphasis was given to the study of the learner. Each local site decided on its own approach to child study. From that point they proceeded to work on redesigning their school, redefining their staff, and describing the in-service education needed for such redefinition.  The project is action oriented. It deals with teaching and schooling where it's happening. The project results are not disappointing. Success at the four sites ranged from moderate to distinctly successful. Consultants and evaluators recommend continuing the project into phase two, which involves agreements, negotiated or otherwise, at the local level. A 36-item bibliography and appendixes of related project material are included. (Author/MJM)",

The program provides a means for college entrance and a subsequent support program for disadvantaged and physically handicapped individuals. A secondary objective concerns the training of undergraduates as tutors, tutor-counselors, and teaching assistants. Prospective teacher experiences involved the individual tutor-counseling, group counseling situations, and a teaching phase of the program. The teaching phase involved tutoring an individual or small group in a skill or content area. The trainee can advance to a teaching assistant either in the deficiency area or in the training component itself. The training modules are designed for pre- and post-student teaching  experiences and include various types of group instruction, program development, teaching strategies, diagnostic procedures, remediation, and clinic techniques. The counseling role involves academic and personal counseling on a one-to-one or small group basis. Each component has an instruction package and &quot;on-job&quot; work experience. The experiences provide the trainee with an exposure to a variety of individuals ranging from 50-year old adults to young children, and from non-readers to cultural and racial differences.

The one group technique of the experimental method was employed wherein two potential teachers who exhibited talent and academic strength in English, speech, drama, and mathematics were assigned to teach a class of 30 deprived pupils for a period of six weeks. The instruments employed in the research consisted of the California Achievement Tests (arithmetic and language sections); a behavior rating scale; and a  self-concept inventory.

Thirty-six junior year elementary education students use four elementary schools in the Chandler School District as training stations. The training program consists of three phases. During the first phase, students carry a 15 semester hour course load. The students are observer participants in their classrooms for a 2 hour 20 minute period each morning 4 days per week. Every 5 weeks students are reassigned to different schools and different classrooms. Phase II allows students the opportunity to  choose grade levels and cooperating teachers as part of their student teaching experience. Fifteen semester hours of work are required, in addition to communications and reading the student will also teach mathematics and social studies. Phase III is tentative and its realization is contingent upon funds being made available. This phase involves the students as seniors acting as paid interns. Evaluation procedures and contributions of the project to teacher education are listed. Appendixes include evaluation forms, observation data, and verbal lesson strategy. (MJM)",

One purpose was to test the hypothesis that classes taught by teachers who showed evidence of expectation effects would show polarization over time, with differences between high and low expectation students gradually becoming increased. A second purpose was to investigate the form in which expectation effects would be manifested at the fifth grade. Subjects included five fifth grade teachers and their respective students. The research design and methods involved systematic naturalistic observation rather than experimental manipulation or treatment. Teachers' naturalistically formed expectations were determined, and then student-teacher interaction  was observed with a version of the Dyadic Observation System to see if teachers show favoritism toward high expectation students or inappropriate treatment of low expectation students. Results suggest that student ability level does not affect the stability of classroom interaction measures, and that correlations between measures taken in different subject matter classes taught by the same teacher tend to be only very slightly higher than correlations taken in classes involving the same subject matter taught by two different teachers.

These are problems of skills and behavioral objectives, intelligence and holistic behavior, the nature of learning and the causes of behavior, humanistic goals of education, and professional accountability. General comments about methods of assessment initiate the study of the problems. The problem of skills and behavioral objectives is presented in light of rationale for behavioral objectives and some hazards of the behavioral approach. Assessing intelligent behavior and implications of accountability are seen as major issues of the problem concerning intelligence and holistic behavior. The nature of learning presents the causes of behavior and learning as personal  meaning. Self-actualization and the assessment of personal meaning are discussed in relation to the humanistic goals of education. Finally, professional accountability is observed in terms of the delegation of responsibility. The summary indicates the need for a balance of behavioral and humanistic objectives in education.

It attempts to establish the role of the faculty in initiating changes in an assessment of an hypothesis regrading the conservative role of such bodies. Following some developments in organizational theory regarding processes of organization, faculty differentiation was examined. It was expected that faculty whose careers are closely associated with the employing institution would be less able to sense extra-organizational pressures for change than those with strong extra-organizational professional ties. Further, among faculty who recognize the need for change, those with local career orientations would display less evidence of initiating or collaborating with attempts at planned change. It was  also hypothesized that some faculty would display an active role associated with ideological concerns regarding organizational purposes of such a college. A survey of faculty indicated that the first hypothesis regarding their conservative nature was not sustained while the hypothesis predicting the positive relationship between professionalization and receptiveness to change and between awareness of external pressures and receptiveness were on balance confirmed. The prediction that those with local career orientations would be less aware of pressures and, less likely to support planned change was supported. Appendixes include related project materials.

Included in this battery was a 300-item Educational Opinion Inventory (EOI). On the day immediately following the administration of each inventory, each subject taught a 40-minute lesson to 20 to 30 secondary school students. After the lessons, the students were asked to rate each subject on a 20-item Pupil Inventory that elicited responses from the students concerning the teacher-student rapport developed over the 40-minute lesson. Between 18 and 21 months after they completed the teacher education program, 150 subjects in the original samples were contacted. Of these, 84 were teaching full-time in a secondary school, and 66 had never entered or left the  teaching profession. The EOI responses of these two groups were analyzed to find items that differentiated them. The study indicated that potential teachers approach teacher training with educational attitudes that markedly affect their relationships with students and their probability of remaining in teaching. Students are able to infer something related to these attitudes, i.e., expected degree of rapport, from their first impression of the teacher with no knowledge of the teacher's behavior or beliefs. Recommendations indicate the need for further study to determine the potential effectiveness of the scales for selecting and guiding the training of future teachers.

        "description":"The study investigates some of the procedures involved in training teachers to use their verbal attention (to students) on a contingent basis. The results suggest that a combination of modeling and feedback can increase a teacher's positive responses to students. Both film-mediated modeling and feedback of performance were used to change one teacher's behavior in his classroom. The relative contributions of each of the techniques in increasing the teacher's positive statements and decreasing the negative ones were measured using a multiple baseline design. The modeling treatment produced changes in the desired direction, but a trend analysis indicated that the new behavior was not maintained. Feedback of performance served either to maintain or to accelerate changes in the  desired direction. The results suggest that proper scheduling of feedback would lead to better maintenance of new patterns of behavior. Consistent with observational learning theory, modeling stimuli can promote initial change, but sustained performance requires systematic reinforcement. (Author)",

The concepts of serial correlation and autoregressive models are illustrated. It is demonstrated that standard inference procedures may be quite misleading when applied to polynomial regression models involving time dependence. Little consideration has been given in the literature for the case of individual series to the development of alternative procedures or to the problem of providing a more reliable basis for inference except for the econometric model.

The ten areas selected for assessment are Art, Career and Occupational Development, Citizenship, Literature, Mathematics, Music, Reading, Science, Social Studies, and Writing. Criteria of the National Assessment Committee in the setting of assessment of objectives include: (1) The objectives must be satisfactory goals for each subject area as seen by subject matter  specialists; (2) The objectives must be ones which currently are accepted as goals of American education by most schools; and (3) The objectives must be ones which are acceptable to thoughtful lay adults as reasonable goals of American education.

The College Board Mathematics Level II pretest was administered to 10 students in a senior mathematics course, to 30 juniors in a mathematics honors course, and to 35 juniors and seniors in  mathematics courses. Fifteen selected students were then interviewed as to their methods of problem solution. The original pretest was then administered to the pretest population, and a pretest consisting of 16 questions identical to those in the original pretest and 9 questions that were revisions was also administered. Results of the study show that the answer to question (1) above was \"yes\"; in answer to question (2), nine questions in the pretest (items 2, 10, 14, 18, 20, 21, 23, and 24) were revised; and the answer to question (3) was a definite \"yes.\" Appendixes provide the Item Interview Record and Test Interview Record, Procedures Used in Carrying Out the Study, Score Distributions for Total Group and Interview Group, Item Analysis for Total Group, Item Analysis for Interview and  Pretest Groups and Interview Results for Each Item and Graphs.

The questionnaire, &quot;How I Feel,&quot; was composed of a packet of directions to the teacher, directions to the student with sample questions, and 11 concepts, each of which was evaluated by six bipolar adjective pairs that were chosen because of their relevance to the type of information desired by the researchers and by their high loading on Osgood's evaluative dimension. Nine of the concepts were scored whereas two served as validity-type scales to identify those students who did not understand what they were asked to do or who may have filled in the blanks with random checks. The students to whom the questionnaire was administered were 238 who were attending a school using Individually  Prescribed Instruction (IPI). Each of the individual bipolar adjective pair scales was scored along a five-point continuum. The questionnaire was administered again to 201 of the original subjects seven months following the first administration, using the same instructions but a different &quot;special&quot; teacher. Results showed the coefficient alpha reliabilities for the individual scales ranged from .86 to .92. A factor analysis of the entire instrument indicated that the six bipolar adjective pairs used to evaluate the nine concepts were essentially measuring the same factor and could therefore be summed, thus reducing the original 54-items to 9 items. The test-retest reliabilities for six of the nine questions ranged from .35 to .44; they were considerably lower for the other three  questions. Tables present the data, and appendixes provide the questionnaire and related materials. (DB)",

The two objectives of the Anchor Test Study are: (1) to provide the ability to translate a child's score on any one of the seven most widely used standardized reading tests into a score on any of the other tests; tables for this purpose will be prepared for tests appropriate for fourth, fifth, and sixth-grade children; (2) to provide new nationally representative norms for each of the seven tests. The first phase of the  study is the equating phase, which involves administration of pairs of tests to fourth, fifth, and sixth-graders in approximately 500 public and nonpublic schools. Two appropriate reading tests will be administered to each participating student, and equivalent scores on the seven tests will be determined. In the restandardization, or norming phase, the study will provide a new set of norms for the Metropolitan Reading Test for Grades 4, 5, and 6, using a sample of approximately 940 public and nonpublic schools. The results of the two phases will be combined to produce new norms for the six other tests. The intitial study operations began on July 1, 1971. The final report of the study will be submitted in November 1972. (DB)",

Of the several available methods for determining test bias, probably the most effective means involves collecting criterion information. This data collection process often provides a considerable barrier to the researcher, especially for the small test user and for someone who needs an immediate solution to a test bias question. This paper presents a method for identifying and analyzing the nature of test bias. This method is intended as only a preliminary analysis prior to, or concurrently to, a criterion data collection process. (Author)",

Occupational norms are established in terms of minimum qualifying scores for each of the significant aptitude measures which, when combined, predict job performance. Cutting scores  are set only for those aptitudes which aid in predicting the performance of the job duties of the experimental sample. The GATB norms described are appropriate only for jobs with content similar to that shown in the job description presented in this report.

The listing encompasses document citations in \"Research in Education\" from November 1966 through December of 1971, and journal citations in \"Current Index to Journals in Education\" from January 1969 through December 1971. Much of the literature cited is research oriented, and is divided into seven sections: women in the society, counseling women, women in academia (as students), continuing education for women, career choice and development for women, and women in the world of work. Documents cited are concerned to a large degree with the woman who has completed at  least her high school education. The literature does bear out the claims of discrimination which have been raised for so long, and, indeed, throughout the bibliography materials appear which talk to this issue. Other areas discussed in the literature cited are the attitudes and concerns of women in relation to society in general, the academic world, or the working world--career, job, or education in relation to marriage and family being the dominant theme; and programs and institutions for women such as special univeristy programs, Women's Talent Corps, and the New York State Guidance Center for Women.

It contains findings by selected demographic and socioeconomic variables. A probability sample of the nation's noninstitutionalized children six to eleven years of age was selected and examined. The examination focused primarily on health factors related to growth and development. It included an examination by a pediatrician, assisted by a nurse; an examination by a dentist; tests administered by a psychologist; and, a variety of tests and measurements by specially trained technicians.  Field collection operations started in July 1963 and were completed in December 1964. There were 7119 children examined. The examinees were closely representative of the roughly 24 million noninstitutionalized children, six to eleven years of age, in the United States. The psychological test battery included the Vocabulary and Block Design subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the Draw-A-Person test, five cards of the Thematic Apperception Test, and the reading and arithmetic subtests of the Wide Range Achievement Test.

At the close of the 1968 school year, a decision was reached to revamp the existing program into an Attendance Counseling Department. Working throughout the County as liaisons between school and the children's home, the Attendance Counselors attempt to work out problems which may be preventing children from attending school. Leflore County Schools presently employ eight full time counselors and one full time director. Each counselor is located in a particular school within the county and serves as part of the staff of  that school. As a member of that staff, the counselor receives referrals of children who are exhibiting symptoms of social or emotional difficulties which are interfering with their learning, their attendance, or their social adjustment. If a child misses two consecutive days, an attendance counselor visits the home and discusses with the parent the child's problem. During the last five years Average Daily Attendance has risen nearly six percent over that of the 1965-66 school year. This represents an average of 360 children attending school each day who otherwise would have stayed home. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The purpose of the demonstration programs in intensive reading and mathematics instruction for low-achieving students was essentially to enable school districts to establish and operate exemplary and innovative projects to improve the competence of junior high school students in reading and mathematics. Projects were limited to students in grades seven, eight, and nine attending schools located in low-income areas. Participants were educationally disadvantaged students who would otherwise find difficulty in achieving success in high school. Project proposals were required to contain statements of specific goals with respect to student achievement and to show a level of cost effectiveness that would make it possible for other, similar school districts in California to adapt the  projects to their needs. Projects that proved least cost effective were to be terminated. Seventeen projects were approved and 1970-71 was their second year of operation. Projects were continually reviewed by the Division of Compensatory Education regarding their effectiveness in improving the achievement level of students in reading and mathematics. Through reports, questionnaires, observations, and interviews, projects were evaluated on the basis of several criteria involving program development, student achievement, and cost analysis.

        "description":"This study is concerned with the effectiveness of teacher aides in the eight Indianapolis Model Cities Schools as perceived by themselves and others. These paraprofessional personnel were hired for two basic purposes: (1) to provide additional help to teachers and children in the classroom, and (2) to provide career opportunities for a limited number of indigenous residents from the school attendance areas. These two basic purposes were resultant from the apparent need for additional adults to whom children could relate and interact in a positive way during the school day, as well as an approach which provided employment opportunities as an encouragement for furthering the formal educational background of those hired as teacher aides. Aides who were hired from this commitment  were those whom Model Cities School personnel thought would benefit both the children in the schools and themselves as teacher aides. These determinations were made primarily upon the basis of personal interviews. The formal educational background of those hired varied greatly. Some were high school graduates; others were not. A number of training sessions were held with them to assist them in upgrading their own personal skills and job skills so as to be of greater assistance in the school of their employment.

Of the 14 instructional centers in nine Hartford Catholic schools, five serviced primary grade students, five intermediate grade students, two serviced both primary and intermediate grade students, one serviced the junior high level, and one provided tutorial service at the secondary level. Thirteen centers provided remedial reading and related language arts service, and one provided a mathematics program. In addition, two pilot Follow-Through  Programs and a program for foreign language students were operated. For the purpose of determining the amount of academic gain in reading, language, and mathematics, the following tests were used: (1) pre and post testing--the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, for the primary grades; and the Stanford Achievement Test, for grades four through eight; and, (2) pre test only--the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, used for grades one through eight. The results showed that, based on an eight month instructional program, the main gain at all grade levels was significant. (Author/JM)",

The majority of the statistics in this report are from the Bureau of the Census, but some are from other government and private agencies. The 1970 data from the Census Bureau are from the 1970 Census of Population and Housing and Current Population Surveys. Families and unrelated individuals are classified as being above or below the low-income level, using the poverty index adopted by a Federal Interagency Committee in 1969. This index centers around the Department of Agriculture's Economy Food Plan and reflects the differing consumption requirements of  families based on their size and composition, sex and age of the family head, and farm-nonfarm residence. The low-income cutoffs for farm families have been set at 85 percent of the nonfarm levels. These cutoffs are updated every year to reflect the changes in the Consumer Price Index. Data for standard metropolitan statistical areas, except where noted, are defined as of 1960. The standard Census definition is used for the four regions within the country. (Author/JM)",

The other objectives are to change the self-image of students from one of failure to one of success, and to change their behavior patterns as students by providing them with immediate success experiences. The project started in the spring of 1970 when students were in the second semester of the seventh grade. It included all seventh grade students at one school. In 1970-71, these same students participated as eighth graders, and the 1971-72 program continues the program for these students in the ninth grade. The major components of the ninth grade program are reading, mathematics, studies in advanced simulation, and intensive involvements. Project R-3 was designed jointly by the San Jose  Unified School District and the Education Systems organization of Lockheed Missiles and Space Company (now Technicon Education Systems) with the help of consultants from San Jose State College. Project R-3 includes a curriculum that interrelates reading and mathematics with reinforcement through gaming-simulation, intensive involvements (a series of extended field trips), parental involvement, and an in-service training program for staff development. Program students are grouped into heterogeneous classes, each reflecting the achievement range of the entire program population.

In the second section is traced the legal history of desegregation and the logical steps through which the U.S. Supreme Court decided that busing is a proper means of accomplishing desegregation. The third section focuses on some of the fears and myths about busing, and the arguments that are commonly used against busing. Some of the issues discussed are: a child has a  right to attend a neighborhood school; busing puts a child out of reach when school illnesses and injuries occur; buses are not safe; fights and racial clashes occur on buses; busing forces children to spend long hours away from home; minority Americans are just as opposed to busing as majority Americans; busing is too expensive; money spent on busing should instead be spent on education; busing prevents students from taking part in extra-curricular activities; busing would carry students to dangerous neighborhoods; busing penalizes white students by setting them back until other students catch up; and, it is not for the schools to cure social ills.

Racial similarities and differences were explored via a factor analysis and analyses of individual items. The factor structure obtained for blacks was virtually the same as that obtained previously for a 95 percent white sample. At the item level, the greatest similarities occurred with respect to attitudes toward educational  innovations. Such items produced the smallest between-race differences, in general, at the two grade levels studied, 5th and 11th grades. The greatest differences emerged on items which reflected feelings of control over job choice, expectancies of job success and satisfaction, and feelings toward people who differ in status and beliefs--whites claiming more positive job attitudes and less anxiety about individual differences than blacks. Appended are questionnaire formats and tabulated test results emerging from the study. (Authors/RJ)",

A pre- and post-test experimental and control design using standardized and locally developed instruments was used to evaluate the academic performance of the students in the study. Eight groups of subjects were compared: Dale Avenue experimental--kindergarten and first level; experimental performance objective record groups--kindergarten and first level; disadvantaged control groups--kindergarten and first grade; and, advantaged control groups--kindergarten and first grade. The standardized instruments used include the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the Skill Assessment Tests I and II, and  the Anne E. Boehm Test of Concept Formation. Locally developed instruments include the Identity and Body Parts Tests I and II, and the Performance Objectives Record. The latter is a unique device which lists specific skills to be mastered. It acts as the teacher's diagnostic pre-test and also as a post-test. The record goes along with each child to his next class. This helps the new teacher to ascertain what the child is able to do and to help him to continue at his own rate; thus, it enables her to use her own creative talents and to find the teaching method that best suits each child.

Interviews were conducted with staff members in HEW's Office for Civil Rights in Washington, and in the Atlanta and Charlottesville Regional Offices; and guidelines, reports, memoranda, letters, and other written materials were analyzed in an effort to develop a comprehensive picture of the HEW Title VI compliance program. Of the more than 30 departments and agencies involved only a handful--and especially HEW--have sizable Title VI responsibilities as measured by the specific relationship of their programs to minority group members, and the amount of  Federal financial assistance available for these programs. In common with these other Federal agencies, the Title VI program at HEW has been in flux for the past five years. There have been a number of changes in organization, in structure, in lines of authority, and in personnel within the Title VI program. In addition, the number and dollar volume of Title VI programs have grown significantly since 1964, thereby compounding the task of Title VI enforcement, but, at the same time, providing additional scope and leverage for achieving its objectives.

The specific aims of the first year were to select instruments to assess the attitudes and classroom behavior of both children and teachers, and to ascertain the relationships, in a small sample of classrooms, between characteristic teacher behaviors and children's end-of-year achievement and attitudes. The sample was composed of six third-grade classes and their six teachers from a low-income,  predominantly black district; measures were taken early in and at the end of the school year. Since the sample for the first year of the study was small, the results described here are considered to be tentative. Evidence from the first year suggests that an individualized style of teaching, as contrasted with group instruction, significantly increases students' verbal achievement; individualized teaching appears to be especially effective with those children with a relatively positive self concept to start with. The development of such a self concept and a belief in internal control of reinforcement appears to be more likely among children who are well regarded socially by teachers and peers. (Author)",

Ergometrics, which is psychometrically based work analysis, stems from the need for a comprehensive taxonomy of human performance as related to occupational variables. Various studies of job attributes and commonalities are cited, and possible rating methods for human behavior, work activities, and skill requirements are discussed. Theories and research related to work motivation, learning capabilities, factor analysis, and occupational data  could be utilized for systematically developing and applying ergometrics to career education.

        "description":"The objectives described in this report were to develop and implement an elementary school curriculum to meet students' needs and an inservice training program to show the teachers how to teach career development to the students. The six elementary schools in the Newport Independent School District are in a high poverty area with all of the problems of the socially, economically, and culturally disadvantaged. The academic-centered elementary curriculum in use was not relevant to the children's needs nor did it help them to relate to the world of work. To overcome these deficiencies, instructional units for each grade were written, media and materials purchased, field trips made, community resource persons consulted, and inservice workshops held. Achievement and intelligence  pretests and posttests administered to the students showed a definite improvement in scores as a result of the new curriculum. The most significant gain was in the area of grades, a random sampling showing that 57 percent of students sampled improved at least one letter grade or more. Although parent involvement in the program was poor, school personnel and the community demonstrated a positive attitude toward career education. The growth of career awareness for elementary students is believed to be a way of alleviating the present high drop-out rate in the high schools. (MF)",

It is not intended to be a legal treatise, although pertinent statutes and court decisions are reviewed and suggestions made for legislative change. A brief history of the laws of arrest is presented, together with a review of the constitutional limitations on the power of the law enforcement officer. The study focuses on the following primary areas of concern: (1) definition, history and elements of arrest, (2) authority to make arrest, (3) constitutional limitations on the power to arrest, (4) arrest with warrant, (5) arrest without warrant, (6) ancillary arrest authority, (7) use of force, (8) immunity from arrest, (9) disposition procedures  following arrest, and (10) problems relating to unlawful arrest. Existing &quot;model&quot; legislation is presented, including the Uniform Arrest Act and the Model State Statute on &quot;Stop and Frisk.&quot; This document previously announced as ED 052 375.

Data on costs of vocational training and potential earnings with and without vocational training were used to estimate rates of returns on vocational education. Findings of the study indicate that all but one of the 14 vocational programs studied result in benefits--increase in earnings--that exceed costs. The study also indicated how worthwhile these various programs are from a private and social point of view. It points out and attempts to explain inter-program and inter-school differences in rates of return, and points to the existence of economies of scale in this provision of vocational education.

        "description":"This study suggests that jural parenthood, i.e. socially recognized parenthood, is the basis of the creation of personal kinship networks, commonly referred to as personal kindreds. From 1968 to 1970, field work was conducted among second generation welfare families in an urban black community in a midwestern city in the United States. The majority of the adult men and women involved in the study had been raised as children at a poverty level, as are their children. Domestic arrangements and strategies among the black poor there assure that children are cared for, and kin and friends in need will be helped. New alliances are formed daily between kin and friends who exchange and give and obligate one another. Cooperation among people is not limited to households or nuclear  families. Men, women and children, kin, and friends participate in domestic networks, aligning themselves to provide the basic functions often attributed to nuclear family units. Participants in domestic networks are primarily drawn from personal kinship networks. From the individual's viewpoint, he is immersed in a domestic circle of a large number of kinfolk he can call upon for help. Friends pass in and out of his domestic network, just as he passes in and out of the domestic networks of his friends. (Author/JM)",

However, the authors of this paper were invited, in January 1971, to assist four sixth-grade teachers who wished to \"teach something about other people to our children,\" although not committed to engaging in a research project designed to assess the effects of their instruction during the implementation of the unit. The entire sixth-grade class of 86 served as the experimental group and another school's entire sixth-grade class was secured as  the control group. Both groups were given a pre- and post-test using the Paired Hands Test. The experimental \"treatment\" was sequenced into eight increasingly interactive steps: panel discussions, film-strip presentations, buzz sessions, open-ended stories, discrimination day, field trip to an all-white inner city school, field trip to an all-black inner city school, and a cooperative, three-school skating party and luncheon.

What has been done and what is being done in the field of compensatory higher education programs are only the beginning, but they are efforts in the right direction. Until American society recognizes the challenge to provide equal access for all segments of society to higher education, then all efforts in this direction have to be characterized as token. This recognition is based upon the assumption that there must be a dynamic reordering and restructuring of national priorities. Special compensatory programs should be instituted in all institutions of higher learning. There should be a concerted effort by Presidents, Deans, Department Chairmen, and  Instructors to exhibit a willingness to create a conducive learning and living atmosphere for disadvantaged students. Consideration of curriculum changes and modifications are essential and must be instituted to assist disadvantaged students. Consideration within the traditional curriculum to lighter academic loads for disadvantaged students is advisable, so as to allow the disadvantaged student time to complete a four year degree in five or six years.

        "description":"In October 1970, the Commission on Civil Rights published a large-scale study of &quot;The Federal Civil Rights Enforcement Effort.&quot; Based on an evaluation of more than 40 departments and agencies with significant civil rights responsibilities, the Commission found that enforcement was characterized largely by inaction, lack of coordination, and indifference. In May 1970, the Commission issued a follow-up report to determine what progress, if any, had been made in the seven months since its October 1970 study. The basic conclusion was that some advances had been made, in terms of tentative first steps, combined with promises to do better in the future. The Federal civil rights enforcement effort is held difficult to evaluate as of November 1971. When compared to the situation that  existed a year ago, the structure of the Government's effort has been improved in a number of important respects. But judged by the more objective standard of civil rights performance, the Federal Government continues to get low marks. Wide disparities exist in the performance of the many departments and agencies with civil rights responsibilities. Some are taking actions necessary to perform effectively. Others still barely recognize that they have any responsibility at all (Author/JM)",

Educational programs were created or updated to deal with what whites believed to be the \"authentic but forgotten blacks\" whom educated blacks and black leadership had supposedly spurned and for whom the White Establishment had previously shown no care. These new black students came into largely alien environments with few role models of their own from whom strategies for survival could be learned. Blacks need not equal opportunity but equitable opportunity: Hundreds of thousands of blacks between the ages of 35 to 50, and even older, find themselves limited in the utilization of their talents in the quality of  employment available simply because they do not have college degrees or credits. The younger, \"low-achieving\" blacks who were brought into higher education could have fared much better if they had had the encouragement, companionship, wisdom, and added collective strength as would be afforded by the presence of older blacks with them as peers and colleagues. This should be the goal of such programs when reorganized, now and for the future. (Author/JM)",

First and foremost, the \"white mask\" of the university must be removed. Large numbers of blacks, Chicanos, Puerto Ricans, Indians, and poor whites must be recruited and admitted to the university. Once there, these students must be exposed to a \"new morality\" of the university that is aimed at the urban areas of our country and committed to changing social and urban policy. Urban programs must assume the authority of training students and granting degrees in urban development and social change. The  leadership for the urban commitment of the university must come from top university administrators. Within this context, action or service is not incongruent with scholarly, academic efforts and research. Urban colleges and universities must aim to provide a scholarly action for the community based on hard data. This philosophy is not a foreign concept to many universities which began as land-grant colleges and universities, which traditionally serve the society of which they are a part. (Author/JM)",

As we all know, many institutions profess to offer programs of this type. However, if we look beneath the slogans and the back-patting, we often find that students entering college with low Grade Point Averages and poor academic skills are not being given the kind of help needed to enable them to successfully compete in the university. The Challenge Program, sponsored by the University of Michigan-Flint, in conjunction with the C. S. Mott Foundation, could serve as a model, and as proof of what supportive services can do. Their supportive services program is designed for freshman and sophomore students at the University who do not meet the standards for  regular university admittance. The Challenge student differs from a regular student in that he received more intensive followup, counseling, tutoring, and other supportive services during his freshman and sophomore years at the University. Since 1969, 113 students have been serviced through this program. The Challenge model is at present largely academically oriented. The service which this paper envisions must be able to lead the student to a pragmatic conclusion in his search for a career. (Author/JM)",

Several approaches might be taken in describing and analyzing the American experience. One might focus on the major pieces of legislation enacted since the Kennedy era. Another focus might be on a number of reports and studies produced in recent years which studied conditions and  recommended policies affecting educational programs and school organization. A third focus might be on the hypotheses or theoretical bases or explanations--implicit or explicit--which have been advanced to account for the problems of the disadvantaged and which underlie various strategies for intervention in the home, school, and community. Yet another focus might be on the patterns of programs and projects aimed at improving educational opportunities and performance of the disadvantaged. (Author/JM)",

These experiences, in turn, depend upon nature of the social structures within which he lives--upon the quality of his neighborhood, his school system, his church, and his government. Recognition of the differences among these life styles determines the quality of educational planning, of testing programs and student assessment, of teacher attitudes, of curriculum subject matter, of classroom structures and student groupings, and of educational life in the community, as well as in  the self-contained classroom. What follows in this book is an attempt to describe such educational processes as comprehensive planning, student assessment, school and classroom structures, and teacher attitudes, in the light of this rationale, as such innovations have been noted across the country by one observer during the years since the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.

The SAS contains 10 personal or social situations where race might be a variable in reacting to the situations. For each situation, ten bipolar Semantic Differential scales were written. The SAS was administered anonymously to University of Maryland students in classrooms or attending freshman orientation programs. Students were asked to indicate sex, class, and college of enrollment. Results of analyses of variance indicated that whites generally respond negatively to blacks in most situations except those removed from close personal contact. White females tend to react negatively to situations where potential fear of physical harm or sexual contact is  involved, and particularly negatively to blacks in the rape situation. The positivity or negativity of the items was based on previously reported factor analyses and correlations. The results of this study strongly support the independence of the situations in regard to race and sex. The answer to the question &quot;What are the attitudes of whites toward blacks?&quot; seems to depend greatly on the context in which the question is asked and to some extent on the sex of the respondent.

        "description":"The Pluralistic Assessment Project, which has been funded for three years by the National Institute of Mental Health, was developed in response to the results of earlier studies on the epidemiology of mental retardation. During 1963 and 1964, data were gathered for a comprehensive epidemiology of mental retardation in the City of Riverside, California. It was found that the criteria for classification of persons as mentally retarded varied as a function of sociocultural group. Two follow-up studies involved a clinical epidemiology on 3000 households and a survey of 241 agencies, as to the classification procedures used to classify persons as mentally retarded. The present project will produce an Adaptive Behavior Inventory for Children standardized on representative samples of  Anglo, Mexican-American, and black public school children, five through 11 years of age, which can be used to assess a child's performance in non-academic roles using socioculturally relevant norms. The project will produce socioculturally relevant norms on the 1973 edition of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children for use with Anglo, Mexican-American, and black children. The project will also produce a Health History and Impairment Inventory standardized on a representative sample of Anglo, Mexican-American, and black children. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In a recent study, the mothers of 268 children who were in classes for educable mentally retarded in two public school districts in Southern California were interviewed. The responses of some of these mothers dramatize three issues: (1) biases in the assessment procedures used to label children as mentally retarded; (2) the stigmatization associated with special class placement; and, (3) inadequate programming. Disproportionately large numbers of black and Chicano children are labeled as mentally retarded by the public schools. Public schools rely more on IQ test scores than any other community agency. The schools label more persons as mentally retarded, share their labels with more other organizations, and label more persons with IQ's above 70 and with no physical disabilities  than any other formal organization in the community. Proportionately more low status persons and persons from minority ethnic groups were defined as comprehensively retarded as the cutoff level for subnormality was raised. Stigmatization was a major concern of parents interviewed. Of a group of 108 children followed for several years and classified as retarded, only one in five ever returned to the regular class. Thus, many parents were justified in seeing the program as a &quot;sentence of death.&quot; (Author/JM)",

Subject rated trigrams for both \"association value\"--having word-quality versus lacking word-quality--and \"reinforcement value\"--liking versus disliking the trigram regardless of word quality. Paired associates lists were then constructed in which association value and reinforcement value were counterbalanced. Subjects learned two different lists. Experiment I established that the order of positive transfer across lists (best to poorest improvement) was as follows: dislike to liked, like to liked, disliked to disliked, and liked to disliked. Association value meaningfulness failed to produce interlist effects. Experiment II found  that the left-hand member of a paired-associate contributed more to nonspecific transfer than the right-hand member. Experiment III found that the learning style of whites is relatively more along an association value than a response value dimension, whereas blacks reflected the opposite tendency. It was concluded that (1) affective factors play a greater role than hitherto acknowledged in theories of human verbal learning and (2) blacks may be socio-culturally different in style of learning than whites, thereby contributing to much of the confusion regarding relative capacity between races.

        "description":"This experiment deals with a test of auditory discrimination between standard Black English and nonstandard Black English. The test consists of two sections, one emphasizing phonological variables and the other emphasizing grammatical variables. It was administered to 83 black and 71 white children who were second, fourth, and sixth graders in schools attended primarily by children from lower to lower middle class socioeconomic backgrounds. The analysis of variance of the test results showed that: (a) test scores increased with maturation; (b) girls performed generally better than boys; and, (c) black children performed better than white children. For black children, achievement on the tests correlated significantly with scores on standardized reading achievement tests at all  grade levels. For white children, the correlations were significant only at the sixth-grade level. The results of the experiment indicate that the awareness of the standard/nonstandard difference is more highly developed in black children than in white children--perhaps as a result of training, perhaps as a result of greater exposure to both standard and nonstandard black speech. They also suggest that for black children recognition of the difference is related to reading achievement in standard language from the beginning of their school career. (Author/JM)",

Those invited included generalists from the curriculum field and those with experience in ethnic modifications. The conference included four sessions. The first session was an orientation to the Association for Supervision and Curriculum  Development and its relation to the purposes of the conference, followed by a general discussion to sharpen the issues and prepare for the later seminar. The second and third sessions included talks given by participants already actively involved in efforts to modify the curriculum to get at distinctive needs of various ethnic groups. The fourth session began with discussion of the differences in rationale in the approaches to curriculum modification. Participants with curriculum responsibility were then invited to present a short oral statement on the kind of questions that should be posed to persons called upon to exert leadership in this area.

The first address, \"Dare to Care/Dare to Act\" by Price M. Cobbs, M.D., deals with the symptoms, the virulence, and the infectious nature of racism. He emphasizes the essential role played by blacks in the development of modern America, and the necessity for American education to make the changes necessary to cope with the racism prevalent in American society. The second address, \"A place to come from,\" by Uvaldo Palomares proposes a system of communication which he believes extremely effective in bringing people of divergent viewpoints together, so that they at least understand each  other and are communicating. Jerome S. Bruner's address, \"The process of education reconsidered,\" discusses the context in which the book was written in 1960, and developments since then. The fourth address, \"And they of the middle years,\" by Fred T. Williams, discusses the most urgent national priorities for action, as seen by its author. John D.

This study is an analysis of data collected in the summer of 1970. The area of inquiry is the subjective one of emotional climate, feelings of affect, evaluations, and socio-emotional behavior in an integrated setting. The study investigated the behavior and attitudes of black and white junior high school boys in small, \"task-oriented\" groups. The focus is on the assertive member in each group. The most assertive group member is defined as position number one on initiation and/or influence in his group. The investigation was to answer two broad questions: (1) Are there any differences between the way black and white  subjects feel and behave toward assertive members who are black and toward assertive members who are white in these groups? and (2) Is the nature of assertive behavior different for black and white subjects? The practical importance of studying assertive behavior and responses to it lies in the necessity of school personnel to plan for possible differences in behavior in integrated classrooms. The data analyzed in the study was collected by Elizabeth Cohen in her Expectation Training II project. The major purpose of her study was to change the racial status in small, \"task-oriented\" groups composed of two white and two black junior high school boys. (Author/JM)",

This report takes the position that compensatory education can be made to work, and that the application of concentrated compensatory resources (usually at higher dollar costs) in basic learning programs enhances the probability of success in compensatory education. To substantiate this claim, this report investigates whether one may conclude from existing compensatory education programs that reasonable numbers of disadvantaged children in these programs have learned more effectively. To this end, compensatory education programs in various States across the country are evaluated in light of State reports and large scale evaluations of  several cities. The programs are evaluated in terms of educational resources, achievement gains, program strategy implications. [\"The urgent need for experimentation,\" by John P.

        "author":["Lebra, Takie Sugiyama"],
        "description":"The recent anthropological literature contains both linear and non-linear models of acculturation. The non-linear model assumes that acculturation generates biculturality, that is, the addition of a new culture to the old one, whereas the linear model involves replacement of the old culture by a new one. Biculturality in the non-linear model gives freedom of choice, whereas the linear model implies culture conflict. The non-linear model stresses that acculturation processes are contingent upon social environment and therefore should be seen as a function of social reference groups. The linear model seems to take for granted the direct and entire embracement of the individual by a culture. This paper attempts to reinforce the three points of the non-linear mode--biculturality  selectivity, and social contingency--while accepting what is valid in the linear model. As far as Issei (first-generation) immigrants from Japan and their Nisei children in Hawaii are concerned, social contingency attains full significance: the Japanese individual is trained morally as well as psychologically to be sensitive to the social setting. The native culture here facilitates acculturation, although the reverse is not true. This is demonstrated by analysis of the content of moral education textbooks used by Japanese language schools, expressed attitudes and opinions of school principals, and Nisei informants in various professional fields.

Project VIII contains three major components and a management system: (1) a classroom intensive unit program providing highly specialized learning processes plus motivation and personal adjustment activities; (2) two project staff members providing extensive training for regular classroom teachers of the target  area schools in Paducah and Louisville in order to modify their behaviors toward creating a more positive classroom atmosphere; and, (3) a home-school program involving the parents in many school activities. Four home-school coordinators and two assistants work full time to help parents understand their children's behavior and to help in the development of better parent-child relationships.

The NEC encompasses four elementary schools in Region 8 of the Detroit Public Schools system. This region serves approximately 75,000 persons, providing direct service to a pupil population of 31,000. Enrollment in Region 8 schools is predominantly black. The following are some of the features unique to schools in the NEC Project: (1) Instructional plan that embodies the concept of individualization of instruction in a manner that provides diagnostic and prescriptive assistance to each pupil; (2) Teachers and pupils are organized in a series of  instructional units with four teachers to each group of 66 pupils; (3) Teachers are recruited and assigned on the basis of demonstrated expertise and commitment to the critical conceptual and operational elements of the project; (4) Duly elected community representatives serve on Planning and Evaluation Councils with direct access to the educational process; and, (5) There is an intensive and extensive program of in-service education during regular and after-school hours.

The Anacostia Community School Project (ACSP) was founded in 1968, and comprises 11 schools. The population of the school district is poor, black, and young, and lives largely either in the housing projects or more expensive but often dilapidated garden apartments. Typically, families have recently moved, often because of eviction for urban renewal. ACSP has provided an opportunity to use a variety of techniques in mental health consultation. A group of consultants has encountered several issues which impede the education of poor, black, urban children: mistrust, prejudice, and despair appear when divergent groups have attempted to work together. A consultant, too,  must confront issues of his own in moving into this setting--especially his messianic ambitions. Sharing both hopelessness and hope, discussing techniques which succeed and those which fail, and supporting firm leadership, appear to be useful principles of consultation. Ultimately, local community control of schools appears to be a necessary prerequisite of educational reform (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Current state and federally funded educational programs seem to focus on four major themes: remediation, curriculum innovations, correcting racial imbalance, and compensatory education. Compensatory education refers to education programs which are designed to make up for deficiencies in a child's home environment. The ghetto child will never have a meaningful school experience unless the onus of his failure to learn is removed from his mode of life, his economic condition, and his lack of motivation. It is hypothesized that school failure in urban ghetto neighborhoods need not be attributed to the fact of de facto segregated schools or to our failure to understand the perceptual or cognitive style of a particular subculture. Ghetto children can learn equally well in all-black  schools as in integrated schools. Many of the large city public school systems already have non-white enrollments which make up more than 50 percent of the entire student body. Programs designed to improve education in de facto segregated schools must aim at increasing the frequency of success and the heightening of levels of aspiration of each child. Both white and black children, separately or together, can learn in neighborhood schools which ideally would be developed as community schools. (Author/JM)",

They may be culture-loaded, but there is no evidence one has been able to find that the culture-loading differentially affects the performance of Negro and white children. Difference in mean score cannot be a criterion of culture bias. One must seek other evidence. The following types of evidence have been examined in the PPVT, the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Test, and Raven's Progressive Matrices, these studies having involved very large samples of  Negro and white children in several California school districts: (1) The rank order of item difficulty is virtually the same for Negroes and whites; (2) The matrix of item intercorrelations and the factor structure of these tests is not significantly different for white and Negro samples when these are roughly matched for mental age or total score; (3) In multiple-choice tests, there is no systematic or significant racial difference in the choice of distractors on those items that are answered &quot;wrong&quot;; and, (4) The intelligence tests show essentially the same correlations with scholastic achievement in Negro and white samples.

The sample in the segregated black school consisted of 56 male pupils in several classes which were assigned by the principal to participate. The sample in the interracial schools consisted of 45 volunteers from the 92 potential subjects. Both groups included students taking college preparatory, business, vocational, and general education courses. All data were collected during May, 1970. The academic achievement of the subjects was measured by the Crary American History Test. When the raw scores of  this test were analyzed holding age and IQ constant, the difference between the groups was significant with the subjects in the interracial schools having the higher mean score. The total score made by each subject on the Self Concept As a Learner scale was considered indicative of his feeling of competence in the classroom. The mean of the segregated, inner-city school sample was significantly higher than the mean of the sample in the interracial schools. (Author/JM)",

Occupational aspiration is defined here as the social status level of an occupational title which is presented as a perception, hope, preference, or expectation. Subjects were 143 mothers, fathers, or guardians, and their children who had recently graduated from a senior high school. There were 29 parent informants whose child was a black male, 42 of white males, 31 of black females, and 41 of white females. Each parent was interviewed at home. As a rule, black interviewers were sent to black homes, and white interviewers to white homes.  Six months earlier, upon high school graduation, each of the child subjects had completed a parallel questionnaire. Among the findings was that, regardless of race or sex, the child is more likely to start out in college immediately after high school graduation when both the senior and his parents entertain aspirations for a high status occupation.

The groundwork for many of the relatively recent legal developments in Northern school desegregation law had been laid more than a decade ago. Because the Southern cases were absorbing black organizational resources and preoccupying the federal authorities, and because questions as to which Northern practices were unconstitutional had not been judicially answered, the possibilities inherent in the early groundwork were not quickly exploited. Although many educators and lawyers find the reasons for maximizing desegregation to be compelling, as have a majority of the courts in Northern cases, it would be premature to characterize that, until the Supreme Court has spoken, as the standard always and  everywhere. The courts have held to be illegal a wide variety of Northern assignment devices that have resulted in pupil and teacher segregation. And no less than in the South, the courts are requiring school districts and, where appropriate, state authorities, to adopt and implement desegregation plans that promise realistically to work now.

These  facts lead to the conclusion that all proposed legislation or constitutional amendments addressed specifically to the prohibition of transportation for purposes of desegregation of schools would be racially restrictive legislation. These facts also strongly suggest that specific prohibition of transportation of children for purposes of school desegregation would be violative of the letter and the spirit of the Equal Prgection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and would neutralize any further effect of the Brown decision of 1954.

The subjects were 32 black second grade boys and girls from an afterschool community center located in a low income housing project in Harlem. A black undergraduate male functioned as the experimenter. The stimulus materials consisted of a dialect proficiency task and an auditory comprehension task. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of four groups in a 2 by 2 factorial design. The factors were: (1) order of the  dialect proficiency task, with either standard dialect first or second, and (2) dialect of auditory comprehension task. Each subject was individually tested. The major finding was that regardless of oral language proficiency in Standard English and in Black Nonstandard English, black second graders presented with oral stories scored higher on the auditory comprehensive questions than did comparable subjects presented with the same stories in Black Nonstandard English.

Comparisons were made between the demographic groups and between children who have grown up in a nuclear or mother-headed household. The Northern sample was located in a working class, urban center outside the Detroit. All were attending a year long child development project under Head Start. The staff and children were about evenly mixed black and white. The Southern sample was located in a working class, rural  area in Bolivar County in the Mississippi Delta area, where there is little contact with whites. The children were enrolled in two Head Start Centers in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. The subjects were 63 black children in Michigan and 58 in Mississippi. Four sets of materials were used: Peabody Pictures Vocabulary Test, Williams and Roberson Pre-school Racial Attitude Sex-Role Attitude Picture Series, Thomas Self Concept Values Test, and Racial Identification procedures.

The hypotheses were as follows: (1) Racial attitudes will be modified, using operant learning procedures and a black consciousness curriculum; (2) A black consciousness curriculum will result in greater positive change in racial attitudes than operant learning procedures; (3) There will be no significant difference in racial attitude change: (a) between boys and girls and (b) between black preschool children from intact and non-intact--e.g., father present and father absent--homes; and, (4) There will be a positive relationship between a preschool child's racial attitude and his racial preference. Sixty-five lower socio-economic  black preschool children were randomly selected from three integrated day care centers located in three suburban communities within the Detroit metropolitan area. Four sets of materials were used: (1) a revised picture-story procedure; (2) the picture-story technique; (3) a modification of the Clark dolls test; and, (4) materials developed by the author to provide a preschool curriculum, from which the children could learn black culture and history.

The investigator developed an instrument comprised of ten Likert-type scales and one true-false scale to test for differences between groups of students on their perception of labor unions, area vocational schools, blue collar work, middle-class values, their parents' perception of education, their friends' perception of education, the concept &quot;education is good,&quot; the concept &quot;teachers are good,&quot; the concept &quot;counselors are good,&quot; and their knowledge about area vocational schools. The subjects were randomly selected from the population of male high school seniors attending two inner city high schools  in St. Paul, Minnesota. There were two randomly stratified random samplings: students were randomly selected within the parameters of race and (a) what they expected to be doing the next year, and (b) what they would like to be doing the next year. Analysis of variance, using orthogonal contrasts, was the principal statistical technique used. (Author/JM)",

The subjects were 366 children and 20 teachers from first-grade classes participating in Project Follow-Through in the Eastern United States. The total sample consisted of those 190 Negro and 176 Caucasian children for whom complete test batteries were available. During the school year, teacher-pupil verbal interaction in the selected classrooms was observed and recorded. Measures of verbal reward, verbal punishment, and a control ratio were derived from observations by trained observers for each teacher. The test  battery, administered in the fall and spring of the school year, consisted of samples of items drawn from the Metropolitan Readiness Test, Early Childhood Inventory Project Test, and Educational Testing Service Examination. The principal finding was that Negro children gained more on the Word Meaning subtest when they were in integrated classrooms. However, of interest was the inability of this research to substantiate a relationship between teacher verbal behaviors and subject-matter growth of students. (Authors/JM)",

        "description":"The all black, economically disadvantaged city of Lincoln Heights adjoins the Princeton school district. In February of 1970, the Ohio State Department of Education, after making several inspections of the Lincoln Heights Schools, revoked their charter and ordered them closed. After a series of meetings with three adjoining school districts, the State Board of Education transferred the Lincoln Heights District, with its enrollment of about 1900 black students, into the Princeton City School District. Two weeks after the transfer, approximately 175 black students and 40 parents staged a sit-in at Princeton High School. The superintendent of Princeton immediately established an Advisory Committee of blacks and whites representing every community in the Princeton School District. A  three-year phase-in program was developed by the Advisory Committee and the Princeton staff, approved by the Board of Education and given wide publicity. With a superb effort during the 1970-71 school year, the people of the Princeton District far exceeded this first phase-in plan. The Board of Education announced in February, 1971, a two year step-up in the phase-in process to be effective September 1, 1971. There was no overt opposition to this plan. (Authors/JM)",

The sample ratio was 42 per cent black and 48 per cent white. Interpersonal distance and angle of orientation, gaze direction, status, position, locomotion, sex, race, smile, and audible communication of dyadic subjects were the variables observed. A simple observation technique  was used to gather data, with the observer present--sitting or standing in the least conspicuous place available. Subjects were not aware of the nature of observer's interest and recording. Selection of dyads for observation was made by the sequential scan method, with the observer noting the nearest pupil. Five hundred dyads were observed. (Authors/JM)",

A few children come from a &quot;run down&quot; section of the community, including most of the disruptive children. The 13 regular teachers, four special teachers, and the pupils of the Brewer School were the subjects of the study. The teachers selected 33 pupils to serve as target children for study. Each of the latter was selected because of his habitual disruptive behaviors. Each teacher was asked to randomly divide target children into experimental and control groups. Operant conditioning methods were equally applied to both  groups, but mediation training methods were applied only to the experimental target children. Teachers were also asked to employ other less widely known methods of experimental control, including the &quot;multiple baseline&quot; technique, &quot;probes,&quot; the &quot;reversal&quot; technique, and the like.

        "description":"The present investigation reviews the racial comparison literature in order to make specific predictions about racial differences on the psychosocial maturity scale developed by Greenberger, Campbell, Sorensen, and O'Connor (1971). On the basis of this review, it was predicted that blacks would score lower than whites on the scale, and that this difference would primarily affect the self-acceptance and independence subscales. It was also anticipated that similar but lesser differences might be found on the identity and acceptance-of-change subscales. Results of the analyses indicate a clear small-to-moderate race effect with blacks scoring lower than whites. The sex effect is more ambiguous. Girls score higher than boys but the effect is negligible. A large effect due to Grade  Level emerged, as expected. The multivariate analyses indicate significant but small main effects for sex and race. The findings are primarily due to differences in the Independence subscale, such that girls score higher than boys and whites higher than blacks. The failure to obtain other hypothesized race differences may have been due either to the inadequacy of the subscales at their present stage of development, or to the incorrectness of the hypotheses themselves.

The experiment was conducted in three third-grade and three kindergarten classes in an elementary school district in the San Francisco Bay area. Seventy-three black third graders and 68 black kindergartners were used as subjects. Although there is considerable variation in their speech patterns, their speech is by and large representative of lower- to middle-class black dialect. The six classes were randomly divided into groups for three different treatments. The treatment period lasted for five  weeks, with 15 to 20 minutes a day devoted to intensive language training. In Treatment A an attempt was made first to establish the concept of a difference between standard and nonstandard speech. In Treatment B the materials and approach were the same as in A, but no attempt was made to introduce a concept of standard as opposed to nonstandard speech. Treatment C was a control activity in which the participating teachers were free to devise their own language arts activities. (Authors/JM)",

Local development will require support from Federal, state, and private sources, and improved coordination of change activities among and between all levels of the education structure--from Federal to classroom level. The primary focus must always be on developing local vocational-technical programs which are continuously innovative and self-renewing, with change efforts devoted to improving  what the teacher does and how he does it. The literature is reviewed by (1) rationale for planned change, (2) the change process, and (3) alternate strategies for implementation. (JS)",

The purpose of this paper was to gather pertinent information about job training efforts in industry so that vocational and technical educators can make informed decisions aimed at improving job training programs. More specific objectives were: (1) to describe the state of the art of job training in industry, and (2) to determine the best possible linkages that can be developed between vocational and technical education and industry. Points brought out in the study include: (1) Industry was mostly concerned about the increasing number of people-related problems, (2)  Industry considers cooperative student training as the best type of vocational and technical education for skill development, and (3) Large industries are making great progress in improving job training through the use of the systems approach and better evaluation strategies. Major sections of the report include: (1) Factors Influencing Job Training In Industry, (2) The Description of Job Training In Industry, and (3) The Synthesis of Selected Job Training Programs in Industry.

Following a review of the manpower and educational contexts of vocational education planning, the report examines the concepts of manpower supply and demand and the sources of relevant information and methodologies for their estimation, considers criteria for determining vocational education priorities, and describes a method for allocating resources among vocational programs. From a review of alternative manpower educational planning models, including manpower, rate-of-return, and social demand approaches, elements were selected which were feasible for a modestly inexpensive planning system. The proposed system acknowledges the existence of more complex planning models, discusses the data  inadequacies and costs preventing their complete implementation, and suggests a methodology feasible in terms of existing or relatively inexpensive data and methodologies.

Using literature review, experience, observation, interview techniques and a systems analysis approach, micro models of rural, urban, and metro county offices and a macro model of the extension service were developed, designed, and illustrated. Critical elements and variables were identified, and formal and informal relationships and communication networks were outlined briefly. The models were presented along with supporting written text and a questionnaire to high level administrators of extension in state universities and land grant colleges for constructive suggestion and reaction. Results from 63 percent of the institutions surveyed  revealed that: (1) The models could provide assistance as a methodology to improve the extension outreach of both merged and non-merged organizations, (2) The models could assist in bringing about a merged extension service where a non-merged structure now exists, (3) The models could help solve program planning and implementation problems, and (4) The use of business and industrial concepts was considered a contribution to the body of extension knowledge.

The second explores the sources of dissatisfaction with education. A variety of programs throughout the country are described in the third chapter and a conceptual model of career education is offered. The fourth and longest chapter provides guidelines in 10 action steps for use in implementing the program. Implementation must occur at two levels--the policy level  and the instructional level, and state leadership bodies must take the responsibility for supporting implementation. No matter what the level, there are ten action steps which must be undertaken in four phases: (1) define the goals and sell the program, (2) organize resources, (3) implement the program, and (4) evaluate, improve, expand and maintain. These ten steps are described in some detail. (CD)",

The study is basically a replication of an earlier study which derived a set of work dimensions for classifying jobs for educational purposes. Using a new sample of 400 jobs, the present study is designed to determine the stability of the originally derived factor structure and to derive first- and higher-order factors from the OAI ratings of a combined sample of 814 jobs. Evidence of factorial stability was obtained through factor comparisons across the two samples. Although the results were comparable to those obtained in the earlier study, they were not as favorable as expected. Factors derived from the combined sample were found to be more stable  than those obtained from the two smaller samples. Factor analyses of seven groups of OAI work elements yielded 90 first-order factors, 88 of which were interpreted. Factor analysis of the first-order factors produced 22 interpretable higher-order factors. It was noted that the factors obtained are subject to a different interpretation than those obtained in the earlier study, in which OAI items were intercorrelated on the basis of estimated attribute--requirement profiles.

The primary objectives of the project were: (1) to instill and maintain positive attitudes in student physicians, nurses, and social workers toward interdisciplinary teamwork in the delivery of comprehensive health care, and (2) to increase mutual understanding of the differing orientations and skills of these professions. Based on data collected by such means as closed-circuit television and objective testing, significant differences between experimental and control groups were not revealed. However, the comparison group showed some significantly  less favorable attitudes toward certain concepts. Subjective evaluations from students, preceptors, and families indicated project success. The study points to the need for more opportunities for student teams to work together early in their professional education and has implications for curricular modifications in health professional schools.

Eight persons served as a jury to evaluate the packet and suggest revisions. The packet, contained in this document, is made up of eight basic parts: (1) The Importance of Advisory Committees, (2) Types of Committees and Their Functions, (3) Selection of Committee Members, (4) Operation of Advisory Committee, (5) Activities and Services, (6) A Suggested Audio Visual Presentation, (7) Effective Use  of Advisory Committees, and (8) A Suggested Agenda for Newly Formed Committees.

Factors responsible for the strong interest in day care include pressures for welfare reform, the growing number of women in the labor force, minority pressures for equal opportunities, and research findings stressing the importance of development during the early years of a child's life. Day care has taken many forms ranging from baby sitting to full-day group care and 24-hour care. Along with variations in the type of day care offered are variations in the services offered by day care centers, including operating hours, provisions for health care, special lessons or tutoring, and transportation services. All-day programs must be planned wisely to help children develop and to meet their needs. Guidelines for  providing individualized care along with a discussion of the costs of day care and issues relating to licensing, community coordination, and education of day care personnel are included in this publication.

Two groups of female students were presented with information about the work and leisure activities of the nurse using the two identified methods. Findings included: (1) Girls who were presented the occupational information with slides and an audiotape achieved higher scores than a control group on a test of information retained, while the girls who viewed the videotape recording received scores lower than the control group, (2) The slide-audiotape  and videotape groups did not differ significantly from each other, (3) The receptivity of the two methods appeared to slightly favor the slide-audiotape method, and (4) The cost of the equipment used slide-audiotape method was about one half that required for using videotape recordings.

These studies were undertaken because: (1) Achievement motivation might help children think more seriously about their work habits and career planning; (2) It might improve the grades of potential dropouts; and (3) Attempts at direct motivation might be an educative effort in itself. The two groups sponsoring these efforts were the Harvard University and the St. Louis group at Washington University. No very convincing evidence is provided by the Harvard studies which shows that achievement motivation improves grades. Results reported by the St. Louis group include: (1) improvement in science and math performance in the year  after the training, (2) larger gains for pupils coming from a high school containing a high proportion of minority groups, and (3) more effective training for teachers when it is spread over the entire year. Training effectiveness varied according to age and maturity, sex, subject matter and classroom structure. A manual detailing techniques of motivation was produced. Two questionnaires on the effects of organizational climate on motivation were also distributed. The overall conclusion is that achievement motivation training courses improve classroom and life management skills. Curriculum materials developed from this is research available from Education Ventures, Inc. (See ED 053 481 &amp; ED 054 997). (Author/CK)",

The point is made that higher education in North America includes a variety of post-high school institutions, including universities, senior colleges, junior colleges, community colleges, technical institutes and professional schools. A study of the organizational structure of the National University Extension Association (NUEA) reveals the pattern of the historical evolution of higher adult education. At the time of organization the emphasis was on methods of extension, primarily classes and correspondence study. Now the structure not only continues to recognize the common concerns for methodology but has expanded to provide for sharing concerns in program content, e.g., social  problems, professional continuing education. It is stated that the most distinctly innovative expansions in higher adult education have occurred since World War II. Two are: (1) the development of residential centers for continuing education, and (2) the development of special degree programs for adults. Finally, it is pointed out that the universities in the 1970's face receding public support. Various possible responses to this lack of support are discussed. (Author/CK)",

One simulation used focused on providing students with realistic experiences in dealing with varying kinds of office communications. A second simulation was of a detailed office procedure for processing a letter from its initial development to mailing. The third simulation involved the formation of two small companies which were in competition with each other. The teachers reported that the \"office\" simulations seemed easy to design and implement. The  students were all actively involved in their learning and in making some decisions about the content of their learning. Individualization was accomplished in the simulations via student self-evaluation and self-selection from a variety of realistic office tasks. (Author/CK)",

In this report, the vocational training commission attempts to make suggestions for improvements and new directions in the New Jersey Correctional System. It is proposed that the Correctional Institutions be established as a school district under the State Department of Education. The following needs are listed: (1) a 12-month program of education, (2) rotation of inmates to maximize education opportunities, (3) week-end and evening classes, (4) specific credits against  parole eligibility dates, (5) the utilization of ex-offenders in education and therapeutic programs, (6) viewing the teacher as an education specialist, (7) availability of college programs, (8) improvement of inmate reading level, (9) improved capabilities for testing, and (10) correspondence courses.

The point is made that most evaluations of basic education programs are inadequate for two reasons: (1) The economic aspects of remedial education for the disadvantaged are infrequently studied; and (2) Most evaluations are based on unsophisticated research designs. It is also pointed out that to society, the primary economic benefit of basic education programs is the increase in trainee earnings during the posttraining period, which are directly attributable to remedial educational instruction. Three problems, however, which must be considered in measuring these benefits are: (1) Distinguishing between permanent and transient changes in earnings, (2) Married women with no  need or desire to work, and (3) A worker who chooses to reduce his work effort. Possible evaluation designs include: the income equivalency approach, the before-and-after design, the quasi-experimental approach, and the true experiment. It is concluded that basic education programs should be designed to include an evaluation component as part of their normal administrative procedure. It is also concluded that the knowledge gained from evaluation should be funneled back into the program to produce more effective program operation. (Author/CK)",

For purposes of this study, test-wiseness (TW) is defined as a cognitive factor, one which is measurable and subject to change either through specific test experience or training in a test-taking strategy. The specific purpose was twofold: to gather empirical evidence about the level of test taking skills in the CLU population, and to develop an instructional program designed to improve these skills, if such a program were needed. In order to determine level of TW in the subjects studied, a test was constructed to measure selected-test-taking skills: (1) recognizing and eliminating similar options, (2) recognizing and eliminating absurd options, and (3)  selecting an option which has a logical relationship with the stem. The students were divided into three groups: Program Experimental, Test Experimental, and Control. All were subject to pre-and post-testing. Because of the nature of the design of the present study, the norms for the CLU population on the TW Scale remain to be established. (Author/CK)",

Educational values and levels of education appear to relate very differently when we cross socio-cultural boundaries where unique historical developments have prevailed. Adults who live in societies with relatively high-step social crystalization seem to demonstrate their educational values according to their level of education. This means that the higher the education one has, the more one is motivated for additional  adult education, and the higher are one's educational values. Those with very low levels of educational attainment have little chance to further their adult education. On the other hand, adults who live in a more open social atmosphere seem to accept more general educational values which are independent of social class and levels of formal educational attainment. Psychologically, they possess great potential for their continuing education. With their high educational values, they want to learn in one way or another, even via self-directed learning.

Part One discusses whether there is a relationship between the rate at which citizens participate in politics and their effectiveness. The way in which political structures affect the rate and effectiveness with which citizens participate is examined. Part Two describes how participation may be used to relate an individual to an organization and explores the  conditions under which bureaucracies distribute benefits to particular groups.

Appendix A briefly summarizes the data on private non-economic benefits, or the social consequences to the individual of attending college (from which various consequences to the public can, in part, be suggested). Appendix B discusses eight additional areas of possible benefit or disbenefit that are not included in the main body of the memorandum because of ambiguity as to their extent, permanence, and/or value. Appendix C raises four fundamental questions bearing on the question of the social costs and benefits of higher education. The benefits discussed in this  memorandum are as follows: (1) Benefits from Liberal Education--citizenship, parenthood, and volunteer services; (2) Benefits from All Higher Education--symbolic benefits, removal from the labor force, and other educational services. Disbenefits from \"Credentialism\" discussed are: Artificial demand for education; artificial restraints to learning; and artificial social classes. Higher education as a vehicle for attaining equity in our society is seen as having both benefits and disbenefits, with the middle class benefitting most. (Author/DB)",

The paper industry was chosen for case analysis because of the nature of the upgrading problems, the vast adjustments required by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the fact that these ABE programs have been operational for several years. The programs studied were utilized by companies in an attempt to increase the potential for promotion of Negroes who were originally employed for unskilled jobs and consigned to permanent occupation of those jobs. The objective was to improve the educational qualifications of such employees so that they could handle jobs on progression lines or in maintenance. Results were: (1) The ABE programs promised more than they  could deliver; and (2) The relation of training to promotion was neither brought out carefully beforehand nor demonstrated after the programs were in effect. The following points were also brought out: (1) Relatively few Negro disadvantaged workers completed the courses; (2) Those who completed the courses showed little improvement in arithmetic and virtually none in reading; (3) There was no relationship between the taking of courses, improvement in test scores, and job advancement; (4) The packaged courses disregarded the cultural characteristics of the trainees; (5) Programmed teaching methods were largely unsuccessful; and (6) The particular conditions and incentives were not such as to produce successful literacy training.

An elementary method for estimating the short-term evolution of the number of illiterates forms the subject of the first part of this analysis. This method is based on the demographic growth rate, the product of the school system and past trends. The second part is devoted to the examination of the evolution of the number of illiterates and of the rate of literacy in an attempt to arrive at coefficients which may facilitate the adoption of a literacy policy based more on rational than on empirical considerations. It is divided into two chapters, the first one relating to the evolution process of illiteracy. This evolution is influenced by the growth rate of the number of newly literate, the initial  literacy rate, the rate of demographic growth, these various factors being taken together. The second chapter shows how to measure changes in the literacy rate and in the number of illiterates. Changes in the literacy rate depend on: the initial literacy rate; and the difference between the rate of increase of those made literate and the demographic growth rate. The number of illiterates diminishes when the rate of increase of those made literate is higher than the result of the demographic growth rate divided by the literacy rate of the previous year.

Information included in the second section pertains primarily to methods of recruiting apprentice candidates, entry requirements, and selection procedures for different trades in the Kalamazoo area. The barriers to increased minority participation are detailed in Section III. Assessments and recommendations are given in detail in Section IV. The central theme of the recommendations is the  importance of security positive action by all groups associated in any manner with local apprenticeship training programs to increase minority participation in these programs. Recommendations that pertain to the school system's vocational education programs emphasize that the availability of quality vocational education programs can lead to increased employment and training opportunities for minorities in the apprenticeable trades, as well as to a wider range of alternative career opportunities for all students.

Ecological relationships in Chicago and their impact on human behavior were assessed. The number of persons per acre, Standardized Mortality Ratio, and General Fertility Rate were gauged, as were Public Assistance Rate for persons under 18 (a measure of ineffectual parental care), Juvenile Delinquency Rate, (a measure of aggressive behavior), and the Rate of Admissions to Mental Hospitals. Social class and ethnicity were also considered. Great differences were found between the different measures of population density: (1) Persons per room accounted for most of the variance  for mortality, fertility, public assistance and juvenile delinquency. (2) For admissions to mental hospitals, rooms per housing unit accounted for virtually all the variance associated with density. (3) Number of housing units per structure was less important; rooms per housing unit and structures per acre appeared relatively unimportant. The causal relationship between density and pathology is discussed for each of the five pathologies. (KS)",

Affirmative and conjunctive problems were solved more frequently than negative and disjunctive problems (all are defined in the text of the articles); however, the mode of representation in which the problem was presented had no effect. Analysis of the mode of representation actually employed (based on Ss' written protocols) revealed a marked tendency for Ss in various conditions to change the original representation of the problem. When these changes were taken cognisance of, the matrix representation was superior to other forms on all but negatively stated  problems. The somewhat poorer performance of females on this task was related to their greater reluctance at changing the representation of the problems. The original hypothesis of the instrumental role of representation of information in problem-solving was supported. Suggestions are offered for subsequent investigation. (Author/KS)",

Every fifth word of their transcribed speech was eliminated (the Cloze procedure), and these experimentally altered transcripts given to adolescent peers and adults professionally trained in the field of mental health, to decode by filling in the missing words. Results were: (1) The speech of the adolescents differed significantly in how understandable it was, primarily due to individual variability in vocabulary, syntax and verbal style; (2) The language used by the adolescents differed in response to the different classes of stimuli, and (3) Adult professionals  were significantly more successful than the adolescent peers in decoding the teenage speakers. The results indicate the sensitivity of the Cloze procedure to individual characteristics of adolescent speech and the qualities of language affected by stimuli evoking the speech, and that the \"generation gap\" is a reflection of disparate values rather than an inability to communicate, or that professional training helps overcome this.

In Experiment II a teacher decreased her smoking rate by contributing 25 cents to charity for each cigarette she smoked and made further gains when she added the condition of not purchasing cigarettes. When Baseline conditions were reinstated, the smoking rate increased, but again diminished  when she used a procedure of not buying cigarettes. One year after the study ended she was smoking only in stressful situations. (Author)",

Marihuana usage was found to be rejected considerably more after the course than before it, and the low pre-test correlations found between their attitudes and those they perceived doctors would have changed to a high correlation in the post-test situation.

The subject pool consisted of 154 students enrolled in basic psychology at the University of Massachusetts. Three aptitude tests were administered to all subjects. These tests measured (1) short term memory, (2) memory for ideas, and (3) memory for sentences. The results were presented in respect to each of the three variables mentioned above. The prevalent pattern was for the memory aptitude to be only slightly positive or negatively correlated with achievement on the criterion test when AQ was the treatment. It was also demonstrated that at the high levels of memory aptitude NT is a very effective instructional strategy for  the learner. In addition, this study showed an interaction between the NT and PA treatments. The basic conclusion was that incorporating the aptitudes a subject brings to an instructional situation into a regressive analysis, provides information such that subjects may be assigned to different treatments, each with the greatest potential for individuals with similar aptitude scores.

It is suggested that high and low achievers diverge behaviorally in the achievement situation because they conceptualize the causes of success and failure in different ways. The results of a study are presented which show that subjects high in achievement needs tend to attribute outcome to effort more than subjects who are intermediate or low in achievement needs. Having established that these different levels of achievement motivation can be characterized in terms of their cognitive dispositions with respect to causal attribution, the author presents further evidence which supports his hypothesis that these different cognitions of causality are the antecedent conditions of achievement-related behavior; that  is, the behavior characteristic of a given achievement group will be elicited whenever the causal cognition typical of that group is induced. This formulation is contrasted with the current view of achievement which differentiates achieving behavior on the basis of differences in the affective states of pride or shame elicited by the task situation.

The intent was to bring about an interaction of ideas concerned with the genetics of behavior and learning. The emphasis was upon interdisciplinary study among scientists from several fields. Specific issues were isolated in those areas where the research of one scientist was applicable to the questions of another. The workshop format consisted of the presentation of prepared papers and informal discussions among twenty invited participants. Among the topics discussed were heritability, frequency-dependent genetically-controlled behavior, inheritance of somatotypes, methods of I.Q. measurement, and the use of cooperative studies in the collection of core data. No  specific workshop conclusions were reached, since the intent was the stimulation and facilitation of interdisciplinary interactions. Post-workshop communication among the participants indicates that some long range benefits will be realized.

The reports given at this conference represent detailed applications of these concepts to limited areas of experience. This work is unique in that both structure and process appear together, rather than being studied as independent concepts. All the papers may be interpreted as talking about processes that apply to structure. This represents the beginning of a new kind of work in cognitive psychology. These papers are directly concerned with semantics. This suggests that semantics is providing a setting for further work in cognition. The workshop did not produce any specific conclusions of findings. The interrelations between the structures and processes studied in each of the papers have  been worked out. Each paper analyzes a limited range of phenomena. There is not one view which at the moment can cover most of the phenomena. Rather, these papers may be the basis for the future development of an adequate general theory of cognition.

This report is divided into two parts. Part I contains the findings of a survey questionnaire designed to identify the status of health education in the public schools. Further examination and identification of the health needs of school age children and the population in general provided justification for curriculum development. Part II of the report consists of a curriculum guide which was designed for local planning of health education programs for the 70's. The guide is to serve as a basis for local  school systems to plan their own individual programs. It is organized into four broad areas: physical health, mental and social health, consumer and environmental health, and safe living.

Not only does the ISVD provide career development data/information, but it is intended to assist the client in promoting a sense of personal responsibility for the career decisions he makes. To clarify this latter purpose, the decision-making paradigm (Tiedeman) is discussed, with a focus on the discontinuities which exist between where the client is at vocationally and where he gradually (step-by-step) decides he wants to be. Throughout, the process of differentiation and integration of the personality is seen as the mechanism of career development. This process, facilitated by a computer-based system (ISVD), must be an integral part of the more general  educational and social framework within which the clients function. The knowledge and skills needed by the supervisors of clients using the system are categorized and discussed. (TL)",

Two major goals of ISVD subsume much of what is elaborated throughout the paper: (1) to bring a person to a condition of readiness and confidence at each of the several discontinuities of vocational development; and (2) to permit the accumulation of data about vocational decision-making, as experienced and undertaken by the individual.

Results of this study indicated that classical conditioning of attitudes occurred in the experimental group, and that conditioning was effective without subject awareness. There was a further implication concerning the early development of attitudes, and the  authors feel it is possible that the classical conditioning paradigm could make a significant contribution in the early development of attitudes of children.

The author attempts to convince the reader with empirical data showing that interference during learning facilitates subsequent retention or transfer, and also attempts to describe this relationship in a way that makes good intuitive sense. On the basis of the empirical evidence presented, it is concluded that these psychological experiments on the effects of intratask interference during original learning on subsequent retention or transfer, leaves no alternative but to take seriously the  facilitative nature of these effects.

The sample consisted of six elementary schools in Massachusetts which reported having adopted team teaching within the past two years. Staff members (130) of these schools provided information about the communication network and informal organization of their school as well as personal data. This data were related to four measures of innovativeness based on the within-group diffusion of team teaching. Findings were mixed, but in unanticipated finding indicated the vital role of the elementary principle as  an agent of change. Independent research found that the most innovative school also possessed an \"ideal\" learning environment as perceived by its students.

More specifically, the hypothesis was that indirect supervisor styles will result in higher quality interpersonal relationships with respect to the dimensions of Regard, Empathy, Unconditionality of Regard, and Congruence. The general procedure involved the tape recording of a supervisory conference between a student teacher and the college student teaching supervisor. As soon after the conference as possible, the student teacher responded to a questionnaire designed to measure his perceptions of the quality of the interpersonal relations existing between him and his supervisor. Data were  collected from twenty-two college supervisors and eighty-five of their student teachers at two central New York universities. It appears from the data that the independent variable is not a useful predictor of the quality of supervisor-student teacher interpersonal relationships. (BW/Author)",

In addition to the goal ratings, each principal also filled out a short questionnaire which investigated the demographic characteristics of his school. The data were school-pupil population, size of school community, racial-ethnic composition of student body, socio-economic composition of school neighborhoods, and geographic region of school. These characteristics were analyzed with the priroity ratings to determine characteristics giving rise to priority differences. The  statistical vehicle was a two-way analysis of variance. Surprisingly the demographic variables seemed to have little influence on the priority ratings of the goals.

        "description":"This study was undertaken to determine whether differences in characteristics exist between public school dropouts and graduates. The need for such a study is indicated by the fact that dropouts are finding it more difficult to achieve success in most life ventures. A random sampling from 304 school systems in Indiana produced twenty school systems that volunteered to provide data for the study. Each system completed a twenty-item biographical questionnaire from cumulative record information of a random sample of fifty graduates and fifty dropouts. Four elements in a grade-school child's life seem to offer the best clue to whether one can predict him to finish his education through high school or to drop out. These factors are (1) the child's scholastic record; (2) the degree to  which his classmates accept him; (3) his tested mental ability; and (4) the educational level his mother achieved in school. The upgraded primary, skill development in social relations, peer tutoring, and parental involvement were suggested as partial solutions. (BW/Author)",

It was believed that understanding the effects of aptitude, instructional methods, and their interaction is important in the study of learning and problem solving. Two experiments were performed to investigate the effects of aptitude and instructional methods on learning concepts of probability. The two methods were learning by discovery and learning by rule versions of programmed instruction. Results supported the hypothesis that the outcome of discovery is the structural integration of previously known concepts, while the outcome of rule learning is the addition, subject  scoring low on tests of relevant abilities performed better by every measure when instructed by the rule method. The data indicates that the result of learning by discovery is a well integrated cognitive structure because subjects can solve problems that require relating principles previously learned. (BW)",

The subject pool consisted of first, second, and third grade students from four of the eight elementary schools in San Jose, California district. The major purposes of this pilot study were to formulate the process of implementation of an incentives program and the methodology which would underlie subsequent field studies of incentive models. The statistical  findings are generally supportive of the initial research hypothesis of the effectiveness of objective-based incentive techniques in promoting student learning in reading and mathematics at the primary level.

It appears that the great majority drop out because they simply cannot tolerate more failure and the commensurate feelings of low self-worth and self-esteem. It was emphasized that success experiences for elementary school youngsters are important because they can be numbered among those positive early happenings upon which an increasingly more complex psychological superstructure can be built. The negative effects of elementary school letter grades were discussed and it was noted that low marks function more as a threat of failure than as a motivation for improvement. It was concluded on the basis of both clinical and empirical evidence that the effects of early school failure  experiences have long-term consequences for both a child's subsequent achievement in school and eventual mental health. Six major implications for school counselors are listed. (BW/Author)",

The expectation was that the traditional stereotypes of affiliative females and achievement-oriented males would not be as strong today as most people believe. Subjects were 465 college students who responded anonymously to a brief prospective survey for which a coding-by-example scheme was developed by the Bureau of Testing to measure need affiliation and need achievement. Of four chi square tests of differences between the sexes in the two needs under two stimulusconditions, only one reached significance, although all differences were in line with traditional expectations. It was concluded that six-stereotypes in regard to these needs  are changing in the college population both by men becoming more concerned with interpersonal relationships and women with pride in school and work.

Data on student-student interaction was related to small group work and gathered by paper-and-pencil sociometric questionnaires and measures of group cohesion. The MATCH curricula were used in 10 fifth and sixth grade social studies classes for an hour a day over a two to three week period in five different elementary schools. A 12-item group cohesion question questionnaire related to such elements of group cohesion, as satisfaction, solidarity and loyalty was administered both during and after MATCH Kit use. The findings suggest that status in classroom groups does affect attitudes and  feelings toward group members and toward small group work. It was suggested that lower chosen students may be able to increase their social interaction skills with practice in appropriate learning settings provided by process-oriented curricula like MATCH.

The rationale for using an individualized model was that each trainee brought a unique set of experiences and educational competencies to the training situation. In addition, although every participant expressed a commitment to constructive educational change, each differed in approach to change and views of education. Systematic provisions were made for taking account of the needs and learner characteristics of individual trainees throughout the entire process from  recruitment and selection through program planning, personal/social counseling, planning and monitoring on-the-job experiences, job placement and follow-up. Data were collected in the form of academic records, tests, reports of training and job performance, observations, and interview protocols.

The reasons given for this approach are that Olson's empirical practices are of interest in their own right, and alternative interpretations sometimes arise from a careful reading of Olson's procedures. \"Cognitive Development\" bears on a variety of issues germane to the design and development of instructional systems. Olson extensively studied the concept of diagonality using American and Canadian children aged 3 to 6, whose acquisition of the concept was compared with that of Kenyon  children of two tribes, aged 5 to 13. A subject typically was required to construct a discretely-formed diagonal on a matrix, under various antecedent and criterion conditions.

(2) Analyses of performance in a transportations problem indicated that the cognitive process of solving the problem is considerably simpler than the external structure of the problem, and gives considerable  doubt to prospects for inferring cognitive process directly from overt responses in problem solving. (3) Observarion of subjects' acceptance and rejection of conclusions showed that a previously noticed tendency toward induction of class membership is very general, and also led to a new hypothesis about the psychological rule of inference that corresponds to logical implication.

        "description":"For the past two years McKinley High School has been operating on a quarter system in which the September through June school year is divided into four 9-week instructional periods. A formal evaluation was conducted with the intention of getting firsthand information from students and staff on the advantages and disadvantages of the system. A total of 1,337 administrators, teachers, and students responded to the survey. Of this number, 57 percent indicated they liked the quarter system, 27 percent said they did not like the system, and 16 percent were undecided. The document contains the questionnaires; percent distribution and rank order of responses categorized by interest groups, i.e., administrators, counselors, teachers, and students; and write-in comments and suggestions.

This report describes modular scheduling, student achievement, and student and teacher attitudes toward modular scheduling. In a survey of attitudes, 95 percent of the students and 85 percent of the teachers preferred the modular over the traditional schedule. Also discussed are program costs, grade distribution, placement tests, dropout and attendance comparisons, class skipping, the open campus, the lunch program, and student use of unscheduled time and the media and resource centers.

The first year seminars resulted in the conception of a 2-dimensional system into which all independent and individualized instructional programs could be fitted -- i.e., the means or media (the ways of getting to the objectives) and control (the determination of who sets the objectives.) The participants were polled for their chief concerns in the area of individualized and independent study, and a checklist of questions was developed from expressions of teacher concerns. Seven headings resulted that comprise an analysis of the management function and which were then used as the structure for the second seminar in 1971. Among these headings were the  processes whereby students responsibly entered worthwhile independent study programs, new learning environments were created, new learning environments were sustained, guiding students became a cross-educator responsibility, and student and program strengths and weaknesses were responsibly evaluated. Provisions were made for modifying these processes when necessary. The papers submitted to the seminars are listed in an appendix. (Pages 33-35 may reproduce poorly.) (Author/MLF)",

For example, the author argues that under local control too much energy goes into financial rather than into educational concerns. He suggests that States should be charged solely with the responsibilities of collecting and distributing funds, leaving to the local authorities the decisionmaking powers regarding the expenditure of the funds. The speech concludes by pointing up the need for identifying those powers and those decisions to be allocated at the local level and for providing the implementation forces to establish them within the local level domain.

Staff reorganization included a move away from self-contained classrooms, the restructuring of the role hierarchy, an increase in staff, some changes in role differentiation, and a re-allocation of major decisionmaking responsibilities. Curriculum changes involved the institution of a program to improve the quality and quantity of arts instruction. However, these proposed changes were only partially implemented, and many of the characteristics of the previous instructional organization and curriculum were retained. Some of the major impediments to the implementation of the proposed changes included the norm of teacher autonomy, the inability of the staff to  reach consensus relative to the group decisionmaking processes, and a lack of clarity with regard to instructional change.

Particular attention was given to such student characteristics as ability levels, quality of group performance, and attitudes toward problem solving. Small groups of students were videotaped while working on curriculums identified as process-oriented. Videotaped protocols were also recorded on the same groups while these groups were involved in nonprocess activities. Comparisons were made between several measures of group performance taken before, during, and after exposure to process curriculums. In addition, attitude and personality inventories were administered both before and after the use of process curriculums. Process-oriented  activities seemed to mitigate the relationship between students' ability levels and their performances. The emphasis on conceptual activity in process curriculums is discussed as a possible explanation of this finding. Attitudes toward solving were also found to increase after exposure to process curriculums. Greater increases in attitudes were found in students who had used highly structured curriculums.

To alleviate this problem, a method was developed by which a forecaster could prepare probability distributions of enrollment predictions.

The method required separate estimates for such variables as migration, retention, and transfer; and it was modified to require three estimates (high, low, and most likely) for each variable. A Monte Carlo computer simulation program was written to combine these various estimates into probability distributions of enrollment prediction. (Appendix A, pages 150-161, may reproduce  poorly.)

        "description":"The Twenty-Third Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which convened in 1968, directed that universal secondary education be implemented in 1970. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the difficulties and successes of implementation procedures. Party and State decrees after 1968 necessitated such concomitant changes at all levels of secondary education that implementation was postponed until 1972. Reforms of an administrative-organizational nature were accomplished, but the results of structural and qualitative reforms to the secondary school curriculum have not been successful. This study led to the conclusion that the impact of new secondary programs on the competency of secondary school graduates cannot be fully known until implementation has been  completed.

The project attempted to (1) identify those perceptual skills that appear to be directly related to the basic classroom tasks of reading and arithmetic at the primary level, (2) identify perceptual skills that relate directly to classroom achievement and determine if such skills can be trained effectively, (3) determine if training in perceptual skills can be measured in terms of classroom behaviors, and (4) describe the training graphically and persuasively to permit its implementation and management in public school classrooms. These four goals have been attained, and resulting data further demonstrate that transfer effects in classroom behavior are  evidenced. (Author/RA)",

Of particular interest were differences between EMR children who were integrated into the regular classroom and their non-retarded peers. A time-sampling method was used to count frequencies of 12 behavior categories selected to cover attention, deviance, and communication issues. One of the clearest findings was that the integrated and special class children engaged in significantly less interpersonal interaction than did their non-retarded peers. Differences between the groups also emerged in terms of behavior patterning. Factor analysis of the behavior categories yielded three  factors, one identified with the special class EMRs (unusual guy syndrome) and the other two correlated with the non-EMR control children (bad guy and good guy syndromes). The integrated children were described less by an identifiable pattern of their own than by the absence of a pattern. It was thought that the integrated children may be avoiding engaging in any noticeable active behaviors. (For related studies, see also EC 042 063 and 042 066.) (Author/CB)",

In comparisons of regular and special class groups using a picture paired-associates learning task, special class high-scorers performed better than gainers and nongainers and did not differ from regular class subjects, thus following the nonverbal learning potential pattern. Verbal mediation training improved the performance of all learning potential groups, as well as the regular class groups, but contrary to prediction, no differential effects were found and no learning potential group was able to give evidence of using the strategy in subsequent testing. It was  suggested that educable mentally retarded students have a verbal production (Expressive) deficit rather than a mediation deficit. (For related studies, see also EC 042 065 and 042 067.)

Learning potential was strongly associated with the fact of discharge. The more able patients by the learning potential criterion also had higher scores on various performance ability measures but these higher scores were not systematically related to discharge status. Among patients institutionalized below 11 years of age, high learning potential status Ss had been discharged, whereas less able (LP) patients were not. A multiple regression analysis indicated that the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children full scale IQ, age entered, and immediate post-training scores on the  Kohs LP accounted for 35% of the variance associated with discharge.

The report also points out some obstacles, such as the academic goals of detachment and generalizable theory, which stand in the way of good policy research. As a specific example of policy research, the author describes the NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) sponsored research on television and social behavior, and points out some shortcomings: an industry veto on advisory committee members, the failure of the advisory committee to specify the research question, and the pressure for a unanimous report which allowed the  industry representatives to obscure the research findings. Unless social scientists learn from mistakes such as this, the author warns that policymakers are likely to stop consulting social scientists, and social policies will suffer. (RH)",

In particular, this paper describes the use of computer geocoding in the development of a plot of student density in Milwaukee, where school boundaries were being redrawn. The objective of redistricting was to solve school overcrowding and identify possible future boundaries for smaller school districts. The computer produced location grids which, when superimposed on conventional maps, allowed analysis of the school population on several variables, and hence more efficient redistricting. Such geocoding could have many possible applications in the study of  other school demographic problems, such as the distribution of minority groups. (RB)",

This study sought to determine whether selected methods of rendering pictorial illustrations influenced the number and type of descriptive words evoked in a verbal association task. Normally the verbal responses evoked by a pictorial stimulus may be ranked as to frequency, with high frequency (called high dominance) associated with ease in learning. Experimental results indicated that color photographs elicited significantly more descriptive responses than black-and-white photographs, which in turn did better than line drawings. Both the stimulus objects were factors in determining the number and type of verbal responses elicited.

However, the specific nature of the impact of interactions and media on cultural assimilation appeared to vary, depending on the particular roles which interpersonal or media communication play in the learning of various culture contents.

Although the two samples used in the study were drawn from two cultures which fall into the modern or neomodern stages, it was anticipated that the unility of various communication sources would vary. A ten-page instrument was administered to high school students in the United States (Seattle) and in Canada (Vancouver), consisting of questions to measure orientation to nine concepts related to war and peace, and devices to assess the value of 16 sources of these orientations. The results of a one-way analysis of variance showed  a consistently higher utility of print and nonprint media sources among Canadian subjects, while a significantly higher utility of interpersonal sources and religion was found among United States subjects. Also, the findings show that more sources of orientation in the U.S. were geared to the development of notions about war and causes of war, while Canadian subjects seem to regard parts of the communication structure more conducive to the development of about peace and prevention of war.

The primary criterion for auditing the effectiveness of such an agency was \"communication adaptation.\" The uniqueness and universality of the methodology employed allowed for accurate auditing. Ideal and empirically-derived communication models were conceptualized from appropriate theoretical and empirical data. Varied methodological techniques, including participant observation, interviews, and cont analyses, were necessary to provide holistic models. The results indicated that because of formidable political and social restraints, antipoverty agencies have extreme difficulty in appropriately adjusting to negative information input. In fact, because the center under  observation could not deal adequately with negative messages, it was forced to close. Also, the ambiguity of these organizations operating under the aegis of an established institution creates institutional schizophrenia. The concept of power is important in understanding this problem. That concept has been neglected in communication research. (Author/JK)",

Finally, a comprehensive plan of communication education and curriculum is discussed. This curriculum runs from elementary through graduate education. In elementary school, the focus should be on development of communication  behaviors. What theory there is should concern the affective domain. In secondary school, half the time should be spent on theory and half on skills. In college, there is a shift to theory and research in the affective domain.

As a student advances, the amount he owes the state for his education decreases. This system depends on several assumptions: 1) toleration of overt modification of people's behavior; 2) belief that extrinsic controls of behavior are better than intrinsic controls, and 3) behavioral specificity must be understandable by both the learning-manager and the student-learner, worthy of being  learned, and valid. Implications of this sytem include: 1) shift of communication from a &quot;field&quot; to a &quot;discipline&quot;; 2) revolutionary changes in instruction strategies; 3) need for taxonomies of communication careers; 4) inadequacy of today's methods of training, and 5) new means of financing graduate education.

They devote an average of 2.6 percent of their professional time to mass media communications but feel that they should spend more time on this task. Their highest priority audience is specialists and teachers who use the results of their work. The general public is a low priority audience. Although they tend to distrust somewhat their co-workers who use the mass media  extensively, they qualify this attitude by saying each case should be considered individually. About 50 percent feel they should be evaluated on their use of mass media as well as on their contribution to professional and technical journals.

        "description":"The classification of communication activity into interpersonal and mass communication is inadequate. A third category, \"medio\" communication, is also needed. Examples of this third type include point-to-point telecommunication (such as the telephone or mobile radio), surveillance telecommunication, and closed-circuit television. Medio communication shares characteristics of both interpersonal and mass communication. Like the former, the audience is usually small in number. The message is not public. The interaction pattern is fairly unstructured. Like mass communication, the audience can be heterogeneous and be spatially distant. The message is transmitted rapidly, and the channel used is usually expensive. Also, a technical instrument is used for message transmission. As one  moves from interpersonal to medio to mass communication, the following characteristics appear: 1) the audience per communicator becomes larger; 2) the message becomes less specialized and more public; 3) the cost is higher; 4) the opportunity to participate diminishes; 5) there is less feedback; 6) there are more taboos in what is said.

These networks tend to be 1) primary in nature, containing four members from primary relationships and one from a secondary relationship, and 2) reflective of neighborhood and occupational lines. Central communicators tend to be 1) people, or those auxiliary to them, to whom others go for services, 2) whose service is performed in a relatively short period of time, 3) who can have more than one person at a time on the premises, either waiting for or performing the service simultaneously, and 4) of either sex and 5) of any age above 18. There were no distinguishing characteristics between high participating  central communicators and low participating central communicators. Several social characteristics of the central communicator parallel those of the influential in communication literature. (Author)",

The general consensus was that programs were better balanced and developed than station managers felt they had been in a previous survey, and that there was interest in the development of new programs for teenagers, low income populations, and consumers. Also, station managers generally felt that the PBS staff was attentive to inquiries if a little slow in responding, and that they understood PBS operations sufficiently well to know the correct individual to contact for either routine business or emergencies. They indicated  mixed feelings about the usefulness of information distributed to stations by PBS and about the use of advertising. (Author/SH)",

The staffing of the system should grow out of the community itself, and programming should serve the community's needs. Some program concepts which might be included are a general home show designed for the inner city housewife, a program on credit and installment buying, programs which demonstrate how people can use government, and other programs which might cover such areas as courts and legal  systems, insurance, medicine, health and nutrition, children, housing, price levels, opportunities outside the ghetto, over-commitment in buying, utility companies, and environmental protection. It is most important in developing such community programming where names will be named and specific products and practices endorsed that the responsibility for accuracy as well as candor is recognized.

If the reason that the arts have been largely neglected on television is its limited channel capacity that democracy must devote to more popular entertainment, then the multichannel cable solves that problem. However, there are still the problems of producing and financing fine arts programing. Some of the ways that these missions can be accomplished include pay-TV, setting up cable as a technical variant of broadcast programing with programs supported by advertisers, and cable programing as a gift to cable subscribers. An obvious source of arts programing which has not been  taken advantage of is the university--and it seems clear that the talents of the amateur performer should be used to help reduce the economic problems of production. Finally, there may be something to be said for different approaches to fine arts programs, such as the counterculture's use of videotape. (SH)",

In addition, even though direct presentations of many works of art suffer from the translation to television, it is possible for talented people to creatively adopt classics to the medium of television. In fact, television, especially cable television, and perhaps two-way cable television in particular, may have its greatest potential as a new creative medium for works of art, rather than as serving existing arts. Finally, cable television provides sufficient channel capacity that larger numbers of  educational and informational programs about the arts will become feasible.

First, increases in satellite power are reducing the cost of ground stations. Second, a connection between one ground station, the satellite, and any other ground station is no longer necessarily fixed. Now one station can communicate with another, and then have the circuit switched or reconnected to some other station. Lower-cost ground stations could make possible a multi-channel network of broadcast receiving stations. Circuit switching could make possible a switched two-way communication network that would allow a group of CATV systems to interconnect for special interest programs at any time. A proposal to start building such a system has been made by Hughes  Aircraft. It calls for two 12-channel satellites, a number of receive-only earth stations, and two two-way stations to transmit to any of the others. Two steps may be taken to improve program quality and reduce centralized program control: 1) require the operator to donate some capacity to a free national instructional TV network; 2) authorization for operation should require experimentation and be for a limited time only.

Thus far, however, the CATV industry has made minimal efforts to realize the potential of CATV for community protection--the use of cable for public safety purposes has been confined to a handful of communities. For example, several Florida CATV systems operate weather bureau hotlines, Kansas has an &quot;Emergency Alert&quot; channel which is often used for locating lost or runaway children, a station in West Virginia has devised an efficient fire alert and public address system, closed circuit street surveillance and burglar alarm systems have been initiated in Olean, New York, and apartment house  surveillance systems have been installed in Sarasota, Florida. These modest applications of cable technology for public safety purposes make it evident that considerable innovating and technological development will be necessary for some of the predictions for its use to be realized. Further, consideration will have to be given to psychological and social consequences of applications such as intense police surveillance of high crime areas. It is clear, however, that the medium holds considerable promise for public safety improvement. (SH)",

Origination by persons or groups who are too poor or too controversial to obtain access in the current system raises the problem of financial and legal responsibility for injury which their broadcasts might cause. However, the narrowing scope of libel, sedition and pornography laws, home console&quot;locking&quot; against certain types of programs, and free access for reply all lessen this problem.

If this is done, cable companies will want to sell services that take advantage of this capability. The growth of cable television runs some risk of being aborted by new methods of over-the-air broadcasting, said to be capable of increasing the number of TV bandwidth channels and involving far less costly transmitting equipment than existing VHF-UHF stations. The telephone  companies are attempting to meet the demand for better data transmission lines.

The report maintains that a multiplicity of channels will lead to a highly fragmented audience, with political material going mostly to very small audiences; secondly, the fragmented audience will have to be organized, and this will lead to a revitalization of grass roots organizations and local politics; finally, as politics becomes increasingly localized, public  attention might be drawn away from its current focus on national problems. Consequently, the report suggests that a federal channel be provided as part of all CATV systems so that national information, which otherwise might be too expensive for local franchises to offer, will still be available to the public.

One possible use of the surplus is simply to permit unregulated cable development, by&quot;bribing&quot; various interests, the FCC, the broadcasting industry, local government, and program producers, not to fight development. Another use is the purchase of certain non-remunerative services, such as providing public broadcasting with free access to channels.

It begins by explaining the importance of such satellites and offers a layman's guide to the technology of satellite systems. It reviews the history of communication satellites and predicts that ATS-F, a NASA satellite scheduled to be launched in 1973, will be the beginning of a boom in satellite use in education. The direct effect of this boom on the classroom teacher is discussed, noting that satellites will bring the power of large, sophisticated computers to students and teachers whether in remote or urban areas. In talking about the problems of the ground links to  the satellite, the monograph explains the problems caused by spillover, freeloading, copyright infringement, and institutional cooperation. Several policy questions raised by the use of satellites in education are explored. A glossary and other supplementary material is appended. (JY)",

Results of analyses of the 40-item multiple choice posttest showed that learning occurred under all conditions with the greatest learning in the linear condition and the least learning with four simultaneous messages, and that the difference in amount retained among the three presentation conditions was less as the retention period was longer. Since  investigation of the mean scores indicates that performance levels in the three treatment conditions became more similar as time passed, the study lends support to the hypothesis that subjects use a focusing strategy when presented with large amounts of information which initially limits learning but which aids retention.

Analyses of the data from attitude scales and questionnaires which were administered upon completion of the study materials showed that for concepts involving time, mean scores in the movie condition were significantly higher than for both slides and still photographs. However, with concepts involving motion, mean scores in the movie and slide treatments were significantly higher than those  in the still photograph condition. For concepts involving space no significant differences were found, although there is a suggestion that still photographs are more effective. No significant interaction between format and presentation mode was found except with concepts involving time, and this difference can be attributed to an artifact. The study demonstrates, then, that the three modes of presentation differ in their ability to convey concepts of time, space, and motion, but that there is no demonstrated superiority of any one form of media in an independent study format.

Two variables were manipulated in the study: similarity of interpolated stories (dissimilar or similar), and the response requirements (completion-recall or multiple-choice). The 190 students in introductory psychology courses who participated as subjects in the study were randomly assigned to a treatment group; they were given an original and two interpolated stories (which could be similar, both be dissimilar, the first similar while the second dissimilar, or the first dissimilar and the second similar) to read, and tested on (completion or multiple-choice) material contained in the original story. Results showed  that retroactive inhibition in prose is greater when interpolated passages are similar to the original passage. Further analyses indicated that when the similar story is the first interpolated story, the same percentage of total errors result from interjections from that story as when it is last. Finally, the subjects responded correctly more often on the multiple-choice test than on the completion test, and tended to make different kinds of errors on the two tests. (SH)",

Little attention has been paid to the processes of learning. However, some studies have identified cognitive strategies used in solving problems of concept identification. The task now is to find out the relationship of strategy used and the terminal performance. Preliminary studies have shown that subjects use all of the following six strategies in solving three concept problems: successive scanning, conservative focusing, focus gambling, start-over, multiple, and ambiguous strategies. It appears that increase of the use of the conservative focusing and successive scanning strategies are in direct relationship with the overall performance. But  conclusive statements about this are premature, since no direct relationship was found between the overall performance and the use of each strategy. What is significant is that it is experimentally possible to use the type of strategies employed by subjects as another dependent variable in this problem. (JK)",

The slides were produced in three versions: black-and-white, authentic color, and contrived color (without the normal color reversal step in production).

Studying attention within the context of those conditions under which an organism will come under the control of certain stimuli, such as a film or audio tape, might be facilitated by studying the manipulation of stimulus conditions and the behavioral effects observed. Stimulus control procedures and techniques currently being used in infrahuman studies are presently being modified for use  with human subjects, and a review of the literature suggests that the \"conjugate reinforcer system\" which provides some measure of responding during a stimulus presentation may be most useful for application in learning situations.

The second paper suggests that ID is a process for improving the quality of instruction, but stresses the importance of human factors in the design and management of an instructional system. A different approach is taken in the third paper--it is argued that ID needs to rest on a solid basis of theory rather than on raw empiricism, and that it can be viewed within the  context of information processing. The discussion in the fourth paper centers around the idea that ID is data based by its very nature, and for this reason, its basic assumptions and procedures must be constantly re-examined. The final paper argues that ID is a systematic activity designed to ensure that relevant instructional objectives are realized in the context of an effective learning activity. (Author/SH)",

Results of analyses of the data did not support the hypothesis, although there is some reason to believe that limitations other than a faulty hypothesis may provide explanations for the lack of relationship  between employee-perceived supervisor performance and employee knowledge.

        "description":"A study sought to identify the engaging characteristics of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) and to determine why engagement in CAI programs remains high, whether engagement can be increased experimentally by changing the level of difficulty of the lessons, whether engagement is highest when lessons match the student's level of competence, and whether engagement and disengagement scores are related. Subjects were 40 fourth graders who had been working with a drill-and-practice mathematics CAI program since first grade. Five lessons of varying difficulty were presented to the students. Their behavior while working on the lessons was videotaped and classified. The engaging characteristics of CAI that were identified were: its curiosity provoking aspects, its immediate feedback,  its provision of a form of competence testing for the student, and its presentation of lessons matched to the student's level of competence. Engagement was highest on easy lessons and did not begin to drop until the subjects missed more than 20% of the problems per lesson. The maximum point of engagement could not be dteremined. Measures of engagement and disengagement were found to vary somewhat independently. (JY)",

About 75 percent of the sample of 320 students came from Mexican-American backgrounds. A two-group pretest-posttest design was used. The subjects could not be randomly assigned to treatment and control groups because the CAI program had been operating for several years in the school. The conclusions of this study are: the CAI program promoted realistic attitudes toward math; CAI may be an efficient, effective form of remedial instruction; CAI did not prove dehumanizing, and no across-the-board negative attitudes  resulted from the program; there is no best way of presenting educational material to all students.

Student reaction was so unfavorable that the televised course was discontinued. For the 1968 school year, a series of 64 videotaped lectures were produced, each approximately 35 minutes in length; they were designed to fully exploit the visual advantages of the television medium. Abridged audio-video scripts for each lecture were made available to students so that no note taking would be required. After the televised lectures students spent 15 minutes with an \"integration leader\" who was supposed to answer questions and integrate course concepts. When students were questioned about the restructed course, it was found that  their attitude toward televised biology instruction had shifted from disapproval to over 80% approval. In addition they liked the availability of scripts and the provision for interaction with the integration leader. (JY)",

        "description":"This document presents some ideas about initial reading instruction in bilingual education. The bilingual programs created in 1969 seek the creation of equal educational opportunities through the use of instruction in a native language to children who speak a language other than English. Such programs attempt to teach two languages concurrently and to deal with subject matter instruction in both languages. The problem of teaching reading skills to accompany the oral language skills is a current topic of research. One reading theory states that the ability to understand what is read depends upon the child's experience with like subject matter as well as his comprehension of the language in which it is written. The \"Initial Reading in Spanish\" project produced a detailed,  descriptive analysis of procedures used to teach Spanish-speaking children in Mexico to read in their native language. Evaluation of student achievement in the experimental use of the Mexican reading instruction methods in the United States indicates success in learning to read in both Spanish and English.

The child must learn to separate, yet identify with, each system as a useful and necessary means of communication. The teacher-directed method is being used currently to teach Spanish as part of a bilingual curriculum. According to this method, children receive teacher-directed instruction in Spanish as a native language and Spanish as a foreign language, in bilingual switching, and in rhetoric to teach effective speech in both languages and an awareness of human emotions in both cultures. Another method currently being used is the small group process which groups together children  with varied language abilities, backgrounds, and academic skills. It is based on the theory that children from different language backgrounds, if exposed to one another's language in a bilingual setting which encourages and reinforces both languages equally, will develop the second language naturally and easily, while improving the first language.

A presentation introducing a new strategy in the laboratory lasts about 30 minutes and is followed by exercises.

The second paper is the translation of a Russian article on the typology of causative construction. The article presents the study of a universal classificatory schema which would be appropriate in different languages. The third paper considers why sound change is gradual and discusses the factors and processes involved. The final paper explores the feasibility of the basic idea of natural phonology and considers  whether the restrictions on inventories of underlying phonological segments are due to processes rather than abstract hierarchies or morpheme structure constraints.

The importance of several preliminary measures is discussed; these include intensified teacher training, educational experiments, and analysis of the intrinsic differences between academic and vocational curriculums. In addition, practical  concerns such as student-teacher ratios and financial needs are taken into account. A series of tables provides a chart of learning goals for all grades, a break-down of schools by region, and a tally of student population by institutional type. (RS)",

At the early elementary level, children should be encouraged to use their own language to the fullest extent. Reading instruction for these youngsters should concern characters and experiences they can identify with. Having readers in the dialect may only further confuse the reading process. Standard English-as-a-second-dialect is a definite asset in our society but kindergarten or even earlier is not the place for drill to start. There has to be desire and inward motivation on the part of the individual to switch his/her dialect. Until a youngster is old enough to reason and conceptualize the consequences  involved in either acquiring or not acquiring the standard dialect, drill per se is a worthless endeavor on the part of the elementary school teacher.

The author also attempts to demonstrate that if a language, Swedish, possesses a universal feature--personal pronouns of address--and if the speech community systematically avoids this feature under specific situations, then this language usage is indicative of cultural-political conditions in that social structure, in this case the dichotomy between social class stratification and Social Democratic idealogy. Examples of ways to avoid pronoun use in the  question \"What do you want?\" are provided, and remarks on the data solicited from informants are included. (Author/VM)",

The Encounter-Communication Workshop, a program of study conducted in small groups in the bilingual school setting, is designed to give the individual a better understanding of himself within the context of interpersonal communication. The study program involves two types of activities: an objective analysis of role dyadic interactions in the school in terms of a linguistic-communication model, and an analysis of the subjective  aspects of interpersonal relations, including social contracts, trust, risk-taking, self-image and its management, and personal metaphysics. Included in these activities are an initial diagnosis of the prevalent modes of personal interaction in the particular school setting and action programs designed to introduce changes coupled with constant feedback and evaluation of the results.

The educational objectives of this approach are to teach the student to identify the features which distinguish standard from nonstandard usage, to recognize the appropriateness of dialects to situations, to identify the features which distinguish the registers with special emphasis on those of the formal written register, to recognize the functional interrelationship between  registers and dialects within the speech community, to write compositions in the standard dialect on many topics using standard rhetorical techniques, and to organize and carry out a research topic in acceptable academic form.

Certain questions arise in light of current theory and research. To what extent are currently available measuring techniques useful for identifying the characteristics of linguistically different learners? Are they helpful in planning instructional strategies? How might the learning potentialities of linguistically different learners be measured? What are the high-priority test needs? Two main branches of investigation exist: the individual's ability in language as contrasted with his ability in standard language. Current understanding of language, language learning, and curriculum design  indicates some confusion of goals in these three areas which must be clarified before test findings may be used with the same meaning in each area.

S. Institutions. Federal loan programs have been increased consistently, enabling more and more students to attend higher education institutions. However, these programs can be of no benefit unless institutions are also enabled to expand their facilities to accommodate the ever-growing needs of the new students. Basic and applied research is encouraged as a major priority for higher education as well as the installment of continuing life education programs. Corrective efforts for potential college dropouts is a definite need, although the Commissioner sees a program of prevention  in the elementary and secondary schools as being even more important. It is projected that only 20% of all jobs in the U.S. during the 1970's will require bachelor's degrees, and it is recommended that the colleges and universities institute 2-year occupational training programs for those who do not desire 4-year liberal arts programs. It is concluded that the U.S. Office of Education and the American Council on Education should work closely together to promote the best interests of the higher education community. (HS)",

Nontraditional grading practices such as the pass/fail or pass/no credit systems are being used in some fashion in many American colleges and universities today. However, most of these institutions limit considerably the amount of credit that may be earned on such a system, and very few will allow 50% or more credit to be earned on this basis. Employers in private industry appear to be less concerned with the type of system a student was graded on than his previous work experience record, and government employers base their hiring on government-designed tests rather than grades. Acceptance to medical or law school is, however, highly determined by previous scholastic records,  and professional schools of this sort do not seem to be very receptive to records with nontraditional grading symbols. Students on these grading systems are, for the most part, enthusiastic. They feel that absence of the traditional grading system relieves pressures about grades, gives freedom to explore new areas, facilitates close student-faculty relationships, and reduces competition with fellow students.

The unit for which the prediction of course grades and overall GPA has traditionally proved most refractory has been the College of Fine and Applied Arts (FAA). This is assumed to be so because these evaluations include a judgment of the student's exhibited creativity as well as his technical competence. One would expect to find significant relationships between measures of creativity and grades in courses presumably eliciting creative behavior. Therefore, in the  fall of 1968 over 300 freshmen in FAA were administered the Figural Test of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking during the diagnostic testing. The results show that the Torrance Figural Test has little utility in enhancing the prediction of course grades in FAA.

The dependent variables discussed are: attitudes, personality, pacing, achievement, future choices, and varied instructional outputs. Personality has never been used as a dependent variable in any research and therefore is only suggested as a possibility for future research, as are the variables of future choices and instructional outputs. Achievement, as might be expected, is mixed with regard to experimental and control groups and no positive statement can be made either way. However, research has been conducted using student attitudes toward and student pacing of work. Student attitudes are more often positive and least often  negative if the students are given choices of coursework. In experiments concerning pacing, it has been proven that students, given a certain amount of work to be completed in a specified amount of time, are able to pace themselves to complete that work. A list of references is included. (HS)",

The program was initiated because of the need presented by the ever growing concentration of blacks in the urban environment who, in many cases, face poor housing, unemployment and no political identity. The concentration of population and high level of unemployment in urban American emphasize the urgent need for educational programs designed to develop marketable skills for individuals. There are demands upon universities to offer such programs for the training of individuals from poverty areas. This training, hopefully, would raise the educational level of the participants, provide them  with a set of skills, and create on-the-job training that would lead to full-time employment.

Previous research indicates that generally one-third to one-half of university undergraduates change from one major field to another. This study attempted to show that when students change from one curricular specialization to another, they are matching themselves to the characteristics of other students. More specifically, the study assessed the degree to which university undergraduates changing major fields are similar to students in the fields they enter and in the fields they leave on measures of activities, attitudes, family background, aptitude, and personality traits. The findings of this investigation imply that after curricular transfer there is greater  homogeneity within each major field and greater heterogeneity between major fields than before transfer. This study therefore gives evidence that major field turnover is to some extent logical, orderly, and predictable. There may be significant implications for institutional and departmental admissions, counseling and guidance, and for curriculum evaluation, planning, and reform. (HS)",

The study took place in the Fall of 1970 when the freshman students at Indiana University and their parents were issued questionnaires concerning various criteria for choice. For both groups of participants, the academic reputation of the university and the reputation of the specific department or school in which the student intended to study were the 2 most important reasons. However, financial, geographical and academic factors were more important to parents than students, while students attached greater importance to social and cultural and to informal advice factors. The findings suggest that university admissions  officials should be sure to provide high school counselors and teachers with relevant information about their institution that the counselors can pass along to prospective students. It also appears that there needs to be increased recognition of the importance of alumni in attracting students. (HS)",

The first stage is the pre-encounter stage, in which a person is programmed to view and to think of the work world as being nonblack, antiblack, or the opposite of black. Behavior and basic attitudes toward self are determined by the \"oppressor's\" logic. The second is the encounter stage, in which some experience manages to slip by or even shatter the person's current feelings about himself and his interpretation of the condition of the Negro. In the third stage of immersion, everything of value must be relevant to blackness, and in the final internationalization stage the person focuses  on things other than himself and his own ethnic or racial group. One hundred eighty (90 black and 90 white) were tested to explore the hypothesis. Within the limitations of this study, the hypothesis has received general support. (HS)",

The first question is treated in Part 1. Two types of applications are considered. A student in the computer engineering area will need a program that allows him to master all aspects of hardware, software, and system design. The minicomputer, therefore, provides him with a unique educational tool to explore all of these areas. Other students in electrical engineering may not want or need to go into this depth of knowledge in the use of minicomputers. This section presents the different types of courses and  laboratory work required to satisfy both of these needs. Part 2 considers the problem of specifying the facilities and equipment needed to implement the various aspects of the recommended program.

The descriptions were analyzed and 7 categories of student performance were developed: (1) general intellectual ability; (2) inquisitiveness and intellectual venturesomeness; (3) problem-solving ability; (4) specific course-related intellectual performance; (5) approach to course; (6) academic performance; and (7) personal qualities. The first 4 major categories form a progression of capabilities from (1) those that students bring to college already well developed,  through (2) capabilities they may acquire through exposure to intellectual activity, through (3) more specific learning acquired by observation of instructors and more advanced students as models, to (4) specifically taught knowledge and skills. Category 5 deals with attitudes and inclinations rather than capabilities, and category 6 includes specific kinds of academic behavior such as characteristic ways the student approaches college work and his style of academic behavior. The final category is something of a residual category for elements such as self-assurance and integrity. (HS)",

Besides being key institutional resources, faculties are primary users of financial resources. Their salaries often represent 60 to 80 percent of institutional operating budgets. In the context of other NCHEMS projects dealing with program costing, it is imperative that faculty salaries be distributed to programs. Data on faculty activities are on way to do this. For these reasons, faculty activity analysis (FAA) is the subject of the present project. The purposes of the FAA project are to develop (1) techniques for collecting data that will serve as a  foundation for allocating faculty salaries to institutional programs, and (2) standard procedures for analyzing faculty activities. This document presents a discussion of the broad purposes of FAA, an overview of the issues that must be addressed during the design of faculty activity studies, and a review of the literature.

The Committee and Commission staff reviewed the complaints and decided to conduct an inquiry into problems associated with minority enrollment, more specifically, black enrollment, in the Wisconsin State University System. The complaints received pertained mostly to events at WSU-Whitewater and WSU-Oshkosh. In each case the local WSU administration instituted disciplinary action against a group of black students who allegedly committed acts of mass violence. In each instance special academic disciplinary proceedings were instituted by the Office of WSU  Regents in Madison, and students were additionally tried in court on criminal complaints. This report is based on the data and impressions gained from the extensive interviews conducted on campus and in the local communities, and from the responses gained from circulated questionnaires.

Although public assistance alleviates the private colleges' financial problems, it also obligates them to increase state supervision of their activities. Several state boards and independent associations believe the private sector's problems warrant special concern and action. Reflecting this view, the reports and position papers listed in this bibliography generally agree on the necessity for state funding of private higher education. They affirm the importance of maintaining an independent sector and of a state's special responsibility for all higher education institutions within its borders. These  convictions are supported by proposals for both student and institutional assistance. Beyond funding, there remains the question of the long-range impact these proposals will have, if implemented, on the distinctive qualities of the private institutions. (Author/HS)",

The results of the primary validation were reported in the document entitled, \"Phase 2 Final Report,\" (ED 039 879). The primary validation showed that the consortium-wide empirical validity varied from .65 to .67 depending upon whether or not the ACT aptitude test scores were incorporated into the predictive equation. In terms of the primary validation the research question was, \"What proportion of first-time, full-time freshmen were correctly identified by the Nor Cal questionnaire predictive equation as either potential dropouts or potential persisters?\" For the secondary evaluation, another research question also dealing with the predictive validity of the instrument  emerged: \"Are there significant differences between the subsequent performance levels of these groups?\" This secondary validation is therefore concerned with comparing attrition rates, units completed, and grade point averages between groups of entering freshmen for whom appropriate scores were known. The results of this validation study show that when performance levels of students who are designated as potential dropouts by the Nor Cal questionnaire are compared with the levels of other students, it is clear that potential dropouts do: (1) have a significantly higher dropout rate, (2) complete fewer units, and (3) have lower grades.

Collective bargaining exists in 10% of the higher education institutions in this country, but it indirectly influences all institutions. There is a need to study diverse faculty motivations (power gain, due reward, alienation, etc.), as well as the common and often invalid assumptions concerning collective bargaining, such as its contributing to radicalism, polarization, and reduced professionalism. Although the process is recognized as a change agent, many questions still exist concerning its functions, such as who should bargain, who should negotiate, and what is negotiable. The Education Commission of the States is working to  increase information and raise the level of expertise in collective bargaining by observing the following recommendations for activities: (1) initiation of a study of the impact and implications of collective bargaining on postsecondary education; (2) creation and maintenance of a monitoring \"clearinghouse\" and \"stations\" to collect current information; (3) promotion of competent and extensive research; and (4) support for regional seminars to enlighten and train those involved.

        "description":"This paper reports the results of an investigation of the relationship between scores on the School and College Ability Test (SCAT), the College English Placement Test (CEPT), and grades earned in American History and Constitution (History 27 at Cerritos College, California) in order to ascertain if predictability of &quot;successful&quot; or &quot;unsuccessful&quot; achievement in History 27 would be enhanced by prior knowledge of students' placement test scores. Grade reports and placement test scores were obtained for all who had enrolled in a History 27 course in Fall 1970 and Spring 1971. Students were classified as day or evening and full- or part-time. Grade distributions were constructed for all day and evening students. Content and predictive validity between test scores and academic  achievement were established. Final observations revealed that the CEPT and SCAT tests might be of limited assistance in placing future students in History 27, but that it is highly possible that tests having greater content validity may also have greater predictive validity.

They asked the national office of the American Association of Junior Colleges to develop a series of workshops on problems of, and programs for low-income students in the junior college. Using a questionnaire, it was determined what the colleges themselves felt were the main problems faced in meeting the needs of low-income students. Five fall workshops were set up, involving 330 persons from close to 100 colleges. The workshops dealt with the following subjects: (1) problems faced by the community college in dealing with low-income students; (2) the world of the low-income student; (3) recruiting and  testing the \"new student\"; (4) financial resources for the low-income student; (5) motivating the new student; and (6) developing more effective learning systems.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the LMC approach upon Math-30 students, and to compare results with analagous data from traditional lecture Math-30 courses, which were randomly selected. Final course grades, operationally defined as measures of achievement, and course retention rates were used as measures of course effectiveness. Conclusions reached were: (1) analysis of the SCAT-Q Placement Test scores revealed no significant difference in  mathematical aptitude between LMC and traditional Math-30 students; there is probably no difference in retention rates between LMC and traditional Math-30; and (3) of students withdrawing, 42.3% of those in LMC re-enrolled in a Math-30 course, compared with 21.2% of the traditional students who re-enrolled.

Sources used were a withdrawal card (non-persisters only), high school transcript, college permanent record, and closed-form questionnaire. The results of the study supported the research hypothesis that all types of students, including those of serious intellectual interests and high  academic ability, withdraw from the comprehensive community college. Recommendations are: (1) community college instructors should be better trained in order to decrease student dissatisfaction; (2) since &quot;financial problems&quot; were given as the largest factor for attrition, an emergency fund should be established; (3) the &quot;open door&quot; policy should be continued; (4) the high rate of withdrawal of summer students should be examined; (5) an expanded work-study program should be provided; and (6) informal &quot;drop-in&quot; centers might be started where students could receive academic help.

With many kinds of resources available the library becomes an integral part of the remedial and rehabilitative program. Strong and sustained motivation is necessary because the institution is an artificial environment in which regression is likely to occur, and an assessment of the complex circumstances which brought the individual to the institution call for remediation. The librarian must develop an active program which is therapeutic in nature, and which will also support the therapy staff in its activities. Bibliotherapy, the application of reading programs to solve individual problems, may be carried out independently or in groups. Based on  psychological principles and a broad understanding of literature, this technique can be a strong motivating factor. The present tendency of shifting treatment programs to the community rather than the institution calls for greater coordination by local agencies. The public library will be called upon to extend its services to the handicapped in greater measure than in the past. (Author)",

There have been no libraries for Indians because there were no books in Indian languages, and no one to read those in the English language. The governmental programs to educate Indian children have not failed entirely, but have only begun to meet the needs of all children. To narrow the search for library service to Indians requires a close study of the entire area of Indian education. There is a whole plethora of material on the subject of education, but little on the role played by libraries. To find out what has been done in the way of library service to Indians, particularly in the Southwest, letters were written to the state librarians of  New Mexico, Arizona, Kansas, California and Colorado, and others concerned with Indian affairs. The information on existing services and programs which resulted from these inquiries is presented as the major portion of this paper. (Author/SJ)",

This Library lends almost entirely by mail, at a rate approaching one million items per year. After outlining the origins of the NLL in government circles shortly after World War II, it attempts to present the picture of its operations today under the following heads: Coverage and Acquisition; Principles of Storage; Records; Techniques of Postal Lending; Personnel Structure; The Reading Room; Russian Translating Program; The Educational Campaign. Some prospects for the future are surveyed in the conclusion. Throughout the essay, emphasis is laid on the innovative approach of the library's first Director, Dr. D. J.  Urquhart, and the successes his techniques have had in coping with the national problem of disseminating scientific information in Britain. A bibliography is included. (Author/SJ)",

        "description":"A retrieval system is considered in which document descriptions are stored and accessed in groups called clusters. All items in a cluster meet common similarity criteria and are represented by a composite entity called a profile. In large collections, profiles themselves are clustered and additional levels of profiles are generated. This entire process establishes a file organization for the system in that records are composed with a logical structure with a directory (profile hierarchy) to facilitate searching. Clustered files have the following advantages over other organizations: complete document information is stored in the same location; storage overhead is low; and flexible, economical searches can be realized. The problems investigated in clustered file organization are:  profile definition, updating, hierarchy storage, and secondary profile uses. A comparison with an inverted file is included. Nearly all work has an experimental base and uses the SMART retrieval system. The proposed organization compares favorably in terms of speed and storage economy. Various request-document matching procedures, and feedback schemes are easily implemented. Search precision is less, but compensated by a flexible level of recall--low or high. (Author/SJ)",

Utilizing the MARC format for processing serials, the objectives were: (1) to create a machine-readable file containing live serials in the fields of science and technology, (2) to produce a number of preliminary listings, and (3) to produce one or more written reports covering procedures, problems and results. Data were input via an administrative terminal system to a 360/40 computer; processing of data was done on a 360/50 computer. Among the conclusions and recommendations are: (1) a national serials data bank in machine-readable form is both technically and economically feasible; (2) such a data bank should have its own machine-readable authority file for corporate names; (3)  input and output in upper case only would be more satisfactory from both the systems viewpoint and the cost viewpoint, but probably would not be accepted by the library community; and (4) serious consideration should be given to the question of applicability of existing cataloging rules in the determination of main entry in a machine-readable file.

A total of 40 kindergarten children were randomly assigned to High Frequency and Low Frequency word groups. No significant differences were found between the two groups on the dimensions of IQ and age. Lists of 32 high frequency or low frequency words were presented for a single trial by magnetic tape at a 5-second rate to individual subjects. Number of words recalled served as the major dependent variable. The results show that although some increase in recall occurs with repeated presentations under MP, the recall curves clearly confirm the superiority of a DP schedule at all levels of repetition. To the extent that educators can control the presentation to  young children of words to be learned, it would appear that well-distributed, more frequent presentations should be utilized if more effective recall is the goal.

The program is a hierarchical skills oriented approach which provides a broadly based set of guidelines for teachers; a wide array of manipulatives, picture cards, transparencies, independent worksheets, take-home tasks, and audio tapes; and frequent assessment procedures. Some of the critical skills that are taught in the program are verbal fluency and vocabulary skills; visual and auditory discrimination skills; ordering, classification, and sequencing skills; and skills involved with making predictions, formulating hypotheses, recognizing incongruities and  analogies, and synthesizing ideas. The teachers of three four-year-old and three five-year-old Head Start classes were selected for participation and training in this program. Comparison groups were comprised of other Head Start classrooms of the same age and same number of children. The comparison teachers used other recently developed innovative preschool curricula and/or approaches. The Apell Test was administered to all students in a pre-post fashion. Multivariate analysis of covariance indicated significant treatment effects due to the CEMREL curriculum. In addition, there were significant age differences. (Author/DB)",

In the development of the categories several theoretical approaches provided an  organizing framework, e.g., social learning, many of Piaget's notions and operant conditioning. The categories are divided into six broad classes: two for the child and four for the teacher. For the child these categories are those involving interaction with materials and those involving social interaction and affect. For the teacher these are: transmitting skills and knowledge; activities concerned with encouraging, modulating, and inhibiting child's behavior; providing feedback and contingent reward or reinforcement; and providing praise and experiences which would tend to enhance the child's feelings of self worth. It is concluded that there is no single approach that can be used to derive a set of variables from a larger set of categories. (Author/CK)",

The project staff consisted of two home visitors, a materials specialist, an infant examiner, and a project coordinator. This study assessed the effectiveness of the program for mothers and infants. Infant abilities and psychological development were tested and homes were rated. One home visitor worked directly in each home for a maximum of 24 home visits. Throughout the project, the home visitor demonstrated and reinforced behavior of the adult caretaker that provides for the physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development of infants.

        "description":"A two-year project established to develop a kindergarten-primary curriculum to help all children become aware of significant aspects of Black culture and learn to confront the problems they will face living in an integrated society is presented. The program was designed in four phases. Phase I concerned itself mainly with collecting resources and background data for the black curriculum. Phase II concentrated on developing a series of teaching units in Black Studies for use with young children. Phase III included the final organization and field testing of the resource units. During Phase IV revisions were made in the teaching units as a result of the information gathered during the field testing and the final report was written. Instructional materials included The Continent of  Africa, Language Experiences - Black Media, the Aesthetic Curricula and Black Arts, and Music. There were five workshops. In the final workshop, the teachers discussed with the researcher the relevance and effect of the entire curriculum. Findings include: (1) Racial attitudes improved; (2) Improvement in racial attitudes was greater for girls than boys; (3) Pupils in the study made less stereotyped choices in their role identification of Black Americans; and (4) The pupils in the program showed an increase in their knowledge of Black Americans. It is concluded that Black Studies are effective in increasing the self concepts of Black children and in improving academic readiness. (Author/CK)",

The point is made that a teacher who expresses a desire to move toward an open classroom environment must first come to trust beliefs and values that may be alien to her own beliefs and must learn to value the following ideas: (1) The life of a child in school is not a preparation for the future; to live like a child is the best preparation; (2) Knowledge is a personal synthesis of one's own experiences and learning proceeds along many intersecting paths; and (3) There is no set body of knowledge that must be transmitted to all. In order to clarify some of the beliefs toward an open approach to teaching, the following steps are recommended: (1) an interview with teachers intended to determine their beliefs  about certain aspects of teaching behavior, (2) systematic observation of teaching behavior within the natural school environment, and (3) a synthesis of the interview data with the observation data in order to make some inferences concerning the relationship between what teachers say and what they do.

Preliminary observation reviewed teacher goals and decisions for the Open Classroom. This research is based upon Hall's theory of culture reflecting the communication model. There are five basic structural components in the theoretical model of decision making: (1) the period of decisions, (2) the locus of activity, (3) the interactive phenomenon involving the above activity, (4) the composite of decisions forming a pattern, and (5) the consequences of the decisions. The point is made that the levels or criteria of decision making directly affect the structural components of the teacher decisions and that the levels or criteria of  decision making are represented by the policy goals, technical goals, and the institutional goals of the curriculum. The preliminary phase of the research included observing and recording classroom phenomena in the naturalistic situation. Goals centered around the essence of the educational philosophy in the open-concept classroom and learning routine order and providing several options for children. It was found that the teacher is faced with four basic questions concerning the decision for use of Group Meetings: Why it is necessary to have a meeting; What it is for; How the process will be selected; and When would be the most effective time to use the particular Group Meetings.

For all experiments, children of the same age and same sex were matched in dyads. The children played various two-person games where they could obtain prizes in a variety of reward contingency conditions. The responsiveness of children to certain situational characteristics was investigated. The need for mutual assistance and the possibility for an equitable outcome were considered as, and were expected to be, situational cues for cooperative behavior. Conflict of interest and the possibility for an inequitable outcome were expected to be cues for competitive behavior. The results supported a general hypothesis that the  potential responsiveness of children to both cues for cooperation and cues for competition increases with age. For older children, conflict of interest was a particularly important determinant relative to other determinants of cooperation and competition. For older children, but not for five-year-olds, prior game experiences led to greater cooperation. Sex differences did not generally approach significance. The results suggested that the predisposition of older children to be competitive in conflict of interest situations caused them to interact in maladaptive ways. (Author/DB)",

The sample consisted of 79 Caucasian, middle socioeconomic status nursery school children (mean C.A. 57.80, S.D. 4.47 months), 44 boys and 35 girls. Spatial organization was operationally defined as ability to copy patterns by drawing and walking in an expended spatial field and to identify by verbal response the correct spatial position of objects in relation to each other and to self. No association of lateral awareness or lateral usage measures and the spatial organization tasks was identified. A clear sex difference favoring boys was found in pattern copying in an expanded spatial field. Boys had  significantly higher objective scores in pattern walking than did girls; they also appeared markedly more task oriented. Findings were consistent with the field dependence-independence construct, and suggest that sex differences in styles of field organization are identifiable by the late preschool age period. Differences in task orientation, cue selection, and cue organization may well be keys to understanding children's strategies of problem solving; these warrant further study. (Author)",

Two samples of like-aged boys and girls from urban (76) and suburban areas (105) were selected for the study; one sample was tested with the Word Learning Tasks in May of the kindergarten year and the other in September in first grade. Word learning and reading samples were collected in December and May of first grade for all subjects. Mills' Learning Methods Test scores and readiness information (test scores and teacher ratings) were collected for selected subjects. The combined Tasks were found to be  reliable measures, with a moderate degree of validity. A comparison of the Tasks, Words Learned-December, kindergarten teacher ratings, and the Metropolitan Readiness Tests showed that the Metropolitan Readiness Tests were generally the best predictor of reading in May of first grade; the Word Learning Tasks were less effective predictors, and the kindergarten teacher rating was the least effective. Words Learned-December was the most useful measure in indentification of children with low reading skill at the end of the first grade. (Author/DB)",

The first objective was to increase the value of the teacher's social responses of attention and approval in children who seemed to value these responses least, and the second objective was to assess whether an increase in the value of the teacher's social responses would produce increases in classroom adjustment. One member of each of 12 pairs of low attraction children was rendomly assigned to the experimental condition, and the other was assigned to the control condition. The assistant teacher in each class served as the treatment agent who implemented a 19-session program of interaction with the child. The treatment program,  derived from principles of desensitization and positive attitude conditioning, was designed to reduce aversion or dislike and increase attraction to or liking of the teacher. All nursery school children were pre- and post-tested on a 26-item rating scale of classroom adjustment. Significant increases were shown in social interaction and compatibility by the children nominated as shy/avoidant or unresponsive. (Author/DB)",

A sample of 172 Anglo and 160 Mexican American students from 16 elementary schools in a southern New Mexico city was stratified by 3 socioeconomic levels. The Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale and a 5-item factor-analyzed scale developed from existing research were used to measure self-concept. Student achievement was measured by teacher-assigned grades in reading, arithmetic, and social studies and by the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. A 3-way analysis of variance model (with students classified according to ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic  level) was used to test differences between students. Results indicated no significant differences between ethnic groups in terms of academic and global self-concepts, and no sex differences were found. Significant differences were found in both self-concept measures between socioeconomic levels. High socioeconomic level was associated with high self-concept and low socioeconomic level was associated with low self-concept. However, middle-socioeconomic-level Mexican American students' academic self-concept scores were almost the same as those of low-socioeconomic-level Anglo and Mexican American students. Results of actual achievement were consistent with findings of previous studies, and correlation analysis of the relationships between self-concept and achievement did not yield a  consistent pattern across socioeconomic levels.

Although the author's expertise is mainly in the field of housing, this final report was critiqued by individuals knowledgeable about New York's migrants and their problems. Since it is concluded that &quot;the best way to improve the environment for the migrant is for the migrant to drop out of the migratory stream,&quot; development of a New York State alternate agricultural labor force is suggested. Also recommended is  the establishment of a Rural Development Corporation (as a corollary to the existing State Urban Development Corporation) to provide growers, migrants, nonprofit groups, and local governments technical and financial assistance for rural needs in the areas of environmental improvement and low-income housing (including migrant housing). Among the 8 major recommendations, it is further noted that greater emphasis should be placed on job training programs both in New York State and in the migrant home areas to aid transition from migrancy to a sedentary life-style. Included in the report in addition to discussions of the problem, the forces of change, and a program of housing are findings and recommendations, 10 references, a 57-item bibliography, an appendix interpreting a special 1968  survey of farm camps, 6 tables, 3 maps, and 2 graphs.

A generalized critical analysis of different facets of rural education--primary and secondary education; vocational training centers; youth service (wherein youth are given the opportunity to work in return for food, clothing, shelter, and a few hours of education and training per week); government-sponsored farm (training) institutes; agricultural colleges; agricultural education at the universities; adult education; and teacher training--is given. Recommendations include change from a  subsistence to a cash economy and increased agricultural output to the point of exportation; \"gentle\" innovation; formulation of a comprehensive rural-development policy aimed at raising living standards of the rural people through increased and diversified economic activity; coordination of activities through an executive governmental council which includes an experienced agricultural educationist and provides academic and advisory support through a university department of agricultural education; provision for manpower planning; and improvement of the status and role of rural teachers, trainers, and extension workers.

The Spanish Americans of north-central New Mexico were compared with the Anglo Americans living within that region. Data were collected on 799 adults from the 2 groups by means of personal interviews. Factor analysis identified a factor labeled the modern-traditional dimension which consisted of 6 value orientations: activism-fatalism, risk-taking, time, integration with family, preference for secondary social relations, and superstition. Analysis of variance was used to explore the relationship of the modernism score to various reference group characteristics. This analysis elaborated the nature of modernism and allowed assessment of  changes taking place among various subgroups. Findings showed that acculturation is taking place, but Spanish Americans are not blending completely. Regression analysis indicated that, when other relevant factors are held constant, there are significant income differences between Spanish and Anglo household heads. (NQ)",

In order to satisfy this objective, 100 industries and products were identified which have the highest potential for development in the total region, as well as in specific subregions. The resources of the subregions and the requirements of these 100 industries were analyzed. The industries were ranked according to the number of subregions where they were among the top 40 feasible industries. It was found, for example, that production of metal office furniture ranked high in all subregions, while production of engine electrical equipment ranked among the top 40 industries in only 1 subregion. Using tables in the document,  industries which are most feasible for the region as a whole can be ascertained, as can those industries which are best suited to each of the subregions. In addition to identifying the industries most suitable to the region, the document contains analyses of (1) the region's existing industrial and economic base, (2) barriers to industrial development, and (3) types of support required to attract new industries and strengthen existing ones.

        "description":"A theory of learning and forgetting is proposed which uses an information processing (IP) model. The IP model views learning as a process of storing, retrieving, and outputing information from a permanent memory. The concept of information pattern is important to the IP model because the pattern of information determines how the information will be processed. The pattern is composed of those aspects of the impinging stimulus situation and the requirements of responding given by the learning task. It is suggested that the perceptual aspects of an information pattern are important in determining the storage location in the long term memory. Information patterns are stored in and retrieved from a specific address. The possibility of several addresses for the same information pattern  may help account for forgetting: within a limited amount of time for a response only a limited number of searches can be made of the storage address system; thus the information may not be retrieved. The IP theory can account for output interference (inability to output recalled information): if the initial stimulus and elaborative information (which determine the address of the stored information) cannot be reconstructed, the information will not be retrieved. Educational implications of this theory are suggested and references are included. (AL)",

Specific reading skills such as word perception, literal comprehension, and inferential comprehension are discussed. Evaluation and diagnosis of reading ability and material selection for teaching reading  are studied in individual projects. Preparation of lessons enable students to see how content and process can be integrated in the classroom. Other topics of discussion include reading flexibility, materials, machines, readability, testing, retardation and remediation, and organization for instruction.

In reviewing the 70 studies which compare i.t.a. programs to traditional orthography (T.O.) programs, it has been found that two-thirds of the studies indicate that i.t.a. is more successful in teaching beginning reading and writing skills than the T.O. approach. The remaining one-third of the studies shows that i.t.a. is equally as successful as T.O. in teaching reading. No studies show adverse effects of using the i.t.a. approach. It is emphasized that the studies conducted were highly varied and were done in a variety of school situations in a number of countries. The report  replies to frequently occurring criticisms of the i.t.a. program, such as (1) children who learn i.t.a. have difficulty transferring to T.O., (2) children regress to i.t.a. after they have moved into a T.O. class, (3) i.t.a. materials are expensive, and (4) children in i.t.a. programs experience the Hawthorne effect (learn better because they are participating in an innovative program). It is argued that such criticisms are not supported with evidence or research and that the research on i.t.a. can refute such claims. Further research is encouraged by an offer from the i.t.a.

Although the i.t.a. children were generally highly mobile and less advantaged than the T.O. children, it was found that: (1) the rate of failure (as evidenced by repeating grades) was three times higher for the T.O. group, (2) twice as many T.O. pupils received remedial reading training as did i.t.a. pupils, and (3) on subtests of a standardized battery, i.t.a. pupils scored higher on capitalization, knowledge and use of references, and dictated spelling.  Further, T.O. children needed help on word recognition and comprehension, while i.t.a. children needed help only on comprehension.

        "description":"In a study utilizing high school sophomores with reading problems and their tutors it was found that significant changes occurred when students were taught to identify and classify their own reading errors as a regular part of a corrective and remedial reading program. The instructional program began with the students analyzing their results on a standardized reading test. From this analysis they formulated general reading goals. Skills packages employing self-correcting formats were utilized in meeting general and specific reading needs. Study questions with \"key words,\" or concept words, were used to scan literature and determine answers. If tutorees needed extra word identification skills, they could select skills packages to study. Students' oral reading was recorded and  errors were noted and classified by the tutor. Gradually students were asked to detect and classify their own oral reading errors. Such self-evaluative procedures encouraged students to engage in more frequent assessments of reading performance, conserved teacher time for instruction, promoted student self-competition, and encouraged a more amenable attitude on the part of students toward teacher suggestions for improvement.

Research has shown that by giving proper training to paraprofessionals (e.g., use of the Peabody Language Development Kit), more positive results in students' reading progress--increased attention span, gains in readiness, and increased word recognition--are achieved. Proper training also makes possible the use of educable mentally retarded adolescents, juvenile delinquents, senior citizens, and Viet Nam veterans as paraprofessionals. Studies  further show that when the behavior of paraprofessionals is programmed, they are successful not only in developmental reading programs, but also as remedial reading assistants. Furthermore, use of paraprofessionals fosters positive community attitudes and increased community involvement.

The initial and final perceptions of the teachers, concerning their responsibilities for providing for pupils' individual differences in reading abilities, are measured by use of attitude inventories, self-rating scales, and/or summaries of their needs related to reading skills instruction. Verbal data are acquired during in-service training sessions, individual conferences, and classroom visits. Training content includes assessment procedures, teaching techniques, classroom management, grouping, and lesson planning. Four factors are considered strong influences on the in-service programs: training processes, training content, institutional  influences, and consultants' influences. Three conclusions are reached: (1) teachers tend to give attention to existing reading programs in their schools as one means of providing for pupils' individual differences in reading abilities; (2) teachers tend to change their instructional procedures when receiving help with the problems of immediate concern to them; and (3) teachers tend to require instruction in classroom management and lesson planning before learning techniques for teaching reading skills.

Achievement tests designed to test concept attainment at the levels of Knowledge and Comprehension (Level 1), Application (Level 2), and Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation (Level 3) yielded the following results: (1) upper ability groups did significantly better than low ability groups; and (2) exemplar moves were more effective than non-exemplar moves for Level 1 performance, but  the CEC strategy was better than ECE for Levels 2 and 3.

With each statement there are four response choices: agree strongly, agree mildly, disagree mildly, and disagree strongly. Construct validity of the instrument was established by a field test with 31 elementary school teachers using a type of time series design. The scales were administered to the participants in the spring of 1971 as a pre-pretest, at the start of a four-week summer  session on Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS) materials, and at the end of the summer session as a posttest. Results showed no significant difference between the pre-pretest and pretest total scores. There was a significant increase from pretest to posttest on the total scores, which is interpreted as evidence for construct validity of the scales. (PR)",

Voluntary citizen organizations, environmental organizations, interested individuals, and educational groups are pictured as having combined to fulfill a watchdog role, exerting pro-environmental influence on public opinions, the press, industry, and the government. The scope and impact of their influence is demonstrated by several examples of their undertakings. In addition, the role of private citizens in the environmental quality movement in three American cities (Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Chicago) is described in more detail. It is concluded that citizen activities are an outgrowth of  rising public awareness and understanding of environmental problems and of public frustration with the pace at which government and industry have moved to solve these problems. Working within established systems, citizen action groups have helped to focus public opinion on the environment. This case study was prepared by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency for submission by the government of the United States of America in response to an invitation from the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment.

Scope of the inventory encompasses a broad spectrum of research in the biological, medical, social, and behavioral sciences. The information it provides should prove valuable to those working in the population field by identifying the types of research supported by Federal agencies and by assisting in the identification of areas needing expanded efforts to help solve the population problems. Over 700 projects are classified by research area and grouped under the following major headings: (1) Reproductive  Processes and Contraceptive Development, (2) Fertility Regulation Techniques Presently in Use, (3) Animal Behavior and Ecology, (4) Social and Behavioral Sciences, and (5) Population Centers and Multidisciplinary Biomedical-Behavioral Programs. Citations provide: title of project, principal investigator, grantee agency and subdivision, funding mechanism, FY 1971 funds, project period, and total project funds. An alphabetical index of investigators, keyed to projects described, is appended. This updated report for FY 1971 is the third in a series of such inventories. (BL)",

To support these two facts, the author has outlined statements giving an overview about the profusion of population control literature and the moral problems of control methods, particularly abortion. A mathematically-oriented point of view regarding demographic aspects considers man's future prospects in the world, the ultimate capacity of the earth, and the lack of controversy over population control.

Romania legalized abortion on request in September, 1957. Nine years later, October, 1966, the right to abortion was severely restricted, while other legal measures with pronatalist intent were introduced. Speculating upon the utility of this legislation in attempting to influence human fertility behavior, it is shown that well-established behavioral patterns of fertility control are resistant to significantly prolonged change by governmental edict alone. The second article, &quot;Family Planning Patterns in Sierra Leone,&quot; is a sequel to  Thomas Dow's paper which appeared in &quot;Studies in Family Planning&quot;, Volume 2, Number 8 (SE 012 796). While the focus of the earlier paper was on presentation of data and interpretation of dominant trends, this one is more speculative in nature and attempts to identify those elements in the social structure that are indicative of the course family planning developments in Sierra Leone may take. Highlighted are the difficulties expected in the transition to greater approval and practice of family planning. (BL)",

Topics and sub-topics include: location and description of the islands; population--size, growth patterns, migration, age/sex structure, rural/urban distribution, ethnic and religious composition, literacy, economic status, future trends; population growth and socio-economic development--relationships to national income, size of the labor force, agriculture, social welfare expenditures;  history of population concerns; population policies; national family planning program--objectives, organization, type, operations; research and evaluation; and private efforts and foreign assistance for family planning activities. Summary statements indicate that the presence of a climate favorable to acceptance of family planning has facilitated the achievements and progress of the national family planning program. However, two areas needing intensified and further study are: (1) community motivation and education, and (2) research and evaluation.

Restoring man to a harmony with nature and his environment and insuring a clean and livable home for the posterity of all mankind are the goals we must strive for. The problems of our times are set forth--lack of faith and trust in the principles, institutions, and accomplishments which reflect a common tradition or shape a common purpose. The assumption of utopia is perhaps undergirding many cries for reform today and adding to the crises of confidence we as a nation are experiencing. To combat these situations, we must be realistic in our assessments and honest about the limits of human solutions  to human problems. The emergence of environmental concern gives us a unique opportunity to prove we can create a society that is clean, safe, quiet and beautiful, yet also provide for man's legitimate material needs. True environmentalism teaches a new ethics and new reverence for life. It can help unify the American people and, if carried to fruition, will inspire new confidence in man's power to control his own destiny. (BL)",

At present, multiple-use management in all four United States coastal zones (Pacific, Gulf, Atlantic, and Great Lakes) is not optimizing recreation potentials. This has resulted from a narrow view of recreation, adherence to unsuitable water-quality criteria, and the failure to assign adequate economic values to the recreational potential of pollution, chemical and biological contamination, energy, environmental  action, total economic value of marine recreation from data on the sale and registration of boats, the expenditure on fishing equipment and the like, it has not, so far, been possible to partition these data according to region.

Topics and sub-topics include: location and description of the country; population--size, growth patterns, age/sex structure, geographical distribution, topographical obstacles, ethnic and religious composition, literacy, economic status, migration, future trends; population growth and socioeconomic development--relationships to national income, agriculture, and nutrition, education and health services; history of population concerns; population programs--organization, operations, education and information, research and evaluation; commercial distribution of contraceptives; achievements in family planning; and foreign assistance from  USAID, IPPF, UNICEF and WHO. Summary statements indicate that dominant among the strengths of the family program in Nepal is its general ability to fit technical problems to Nepali conditions. However, weaknesses are indicated by a friction between nonmedical and medical personnel, the poor condition of supporting infrastructures for family planning and the overdependence on foreign assistance. A map of the country is drawn. (BL)",

The bill, originally introduced as the National Environmental Laboratory Act of 1971 provides for the establishment of a parent agency, the National Environmental Center (NEC), and regional national environmental laboratories (NEL). Committee amendments suggest the research program of NEC be directed toward a universal view of the environment, thus, any comprehensive research effort must match the scope of the problem. A specific mandate was made to carry on training and education jointly with and through other institutions, universities, and colleges. Also, an amendment provides that the  Center be located and operated in a manner to avoid overlap and conflict with existing private and public research organizations activities. The report includes a summary of committee amendments, a statement of need (studies supporting the establishment of national environmental laboratories), estimated cost of the legislation, changes in existing law, roll call votes, departmental reports (from various departments and agencies during Committee hearings), section by section analysis of the bill, and appendix (summary of agency responses to letter of inquiry on federal research in environmental science and technology).

He does not write in a prescriptive fashion but attempts to arrive at a definition for process education by a successive convergency of ideas and tentative but logically consistent definitions. The author suggests that the operationalization of educational practice toward the goals of process education can be achieved by stating behavioral expectancy categories for pupils and teachers. A method for this procedure has also been suggested and is discussed briefly. The author concludes that process education is what education should be but has never been. Educational practice is still far from approaching this ideal. (Author/CP)",

Definitions for five dimensions of educational quality are advanced: human quality, quality of skills, quality of knowledge, learning quality, and civic quality. These five dimensions of quality are proposed as goals. Specific educational ingredients that emanate from these components of educational quality are appraised, and some school services and processes that demonstrably advance student  achievement toward goals are identified. Among school services are teachers, instructional resources, curriculum facilities, and administration; while school processes include the teaching-learning process, individualized instruction, flexible scheduling, nongraded class levels, and many others. The author then considers measurement of student progress and evaluation of school services and processes as means for judging the relationship between the process of education in the school and student advancement toward goals of educational quality. An annotated bibliography accompanies the essay. (Author/JLB)",

        "description":"In this nontypical dissertation the author develops a McLuhan-like style of writing and presents a holistic, humanistic social theory. This dissertation is a break with past approaches because it makes the humanistic assumptions that human action is: 1) value-centered and, 2) intricately holistic. The humanistic approach overcomes some current problems of overspecialization and underemphasis of values in understanding human action. Also, it breaks with the current disciplinary techniques by exhibiting a value-systemed, holistic approach leading towards an interdisciplinary theory. The majority of this dissertation describes, formalizes, and shows uses of the humanistic general social systems theory. The thesis is that the self subsystem is becoming prevalent in our society, with  the characteristics of idiosyncratic style, reference to oneself, a valuing orientation and self consciousness. Thus, the author blends the self subsystem with the expertise subsystem. He also emphasizes the importance of the internal interrelatedness, interdependence, and circularity within a system of thought. The dissertation's three sections are: 1) theory, 2) the theory as a set of concepts for reanalyzing some studies of higher education, and 3) the theory as a base for applications and speculations in higher education, society, and the social sciences.

The project staff first set out to learn whether secondary school students were concerned with greater participation in institutional decision making, and to consider the implications of student responses to the project goal. Approximately 7,000 junior and senior high school students were given an open ended questionnaire that asked them to describe a dilemma in democracy with which they were personally acquainted. The principal findings of the survey were that a large majority of students feel they are regularly subjected to undemocratic decisions, and that most of these students perceive their schools as  essentially undemocratic. Drawing on these results, the project drew up a Manual of Objectives and Guidelines for High School Civic Education. It focuses on democratic decision making as the heart of an appropriate civic education, and sets out ten objectives that define an operating code of democratic citizenship. The manual also provides guidelines that identify ideal points in the educational sequence at which civic competence should be stressed.

The purpose of this summary is to supply a guide for new staff members, interested students, and parents. An overall instructional goal is to individualize instruction by whatever means possible. The schools are therefore given the latitude to develop teaching strategies and to organize the school day most appropriate to meet these ends. A major portion of the publication is devoted to course descriptions of the Campus Upper Unit for grades 9 through 12 which is organized on a modular schedule--each module being 25 minutes in length with a total of 16 modules in the school day. The West Middle  Unit and the Campus Middle Unit for Grades 7, 8, and 9 are on a &quot;floating period&quot; schedule. Four large blocks of time make up the student's day allowing each student to operate on a different time schedule each week. Cherry Creek Middle Unit is structured on a non-graded basis. Unit descriptions are given on English, social studies, mathematics, science, foreign language, fine arts, practical art and vocations, physical education and special course offerings.

        "description":"This handbook is based upon a new social studies curriculum designed to give students guided experience in the responsible use of personal freedom. The new approach seeks to provide actual experience in the making of choices and judgements in order to improve man's relationship to his social and physical environment. Thus, the new social studies is organized around experiences which allow students to clarify their personal values and to understand the values of others. The valuing process should be the major activity of social studies students. A second characteristic of the new social studies is flexibility. Therefore, this curriculum allows for decisions to be made by those who will be affected by them. The values orientation and flexibility imply a definite de-emphasis on  covering knowledge from history, geography and the social sciences. Knowledge should be uncovered not for its own sake but only as it is needed when students are engaging in the valuing process. The handbook outlines cognitive and affective objectives; how to plan for the attainment of multiple objectives; an elaboration of program components in the new social studies; how to plan instructional units; and, teaching-learning activities. Sample units for grades 1-6 are included. (Author/AWW)",

Eleven institutes were offered in this year: three in music; two in art; two in theater; two in humanities; one in Latin; and one in film. A primary purpose of the institutes is to change the ways arts and humanities are taught in elementary and secondary schools. This report describes who and what was taught in these institutes; summarize what those who directed, attended and observed the institutes thought of them; and speculate about some of the issues and promises raised by their achievement. The report draws on three sources of information and opinion: analysis of the  responses of about 300 participants to a questionnaire, final reports by the directors of the institutes, and detailed observer reports. All together these institutes enrolled about 430 participants. Most of the participants teach in secondary schools, and most of these teach in senior high schools. The participants generally thought very highly of the institutes; visitors were more impressed by those that concentrated on one subject, those that were innovative, and those that concretely defined proposals for new kinds of courses.

During the summer of 1966 five pilot Institutes in Civics were funded by the Office of Education. The purpose was to utilize the initial experience for the improvement of civics institutes expected in greater numbers in subsequent years. There is no doubt that the pilot institutes served this function. This report includes: 1) an evaluation of these pilot institutes; 2) specific suggestions for improvements which might be adopted in the years ahead; and, 3) a discussion of some of the more profound background questions which emerge not only from the institute experience but which are  also inherent in the problems of civic education. The five institutes served a total of 190 social studies teachers. (Author/JLB)",

By studying the history and medicine of drug use, students learn background information that helps them define and categorize legitimate and illegitimate drug use, and describe physiological and psychological effects of drugs. Consequences of selling and possessing drugs illegally are studied. After evaluating reasons why drugs are used, and what problems drug users face, students will form a personal opinion and a position on drug abuse. Relating to problems in their own school, students develop plans to deal with drug abuse and then go on to develop guidelines for drug education for the Dade County  community. Finally students are able to synthesize knowledge toward formulating drug therapy programs. Eight activity units are coordinated with course goals.

The Northeastern, Central, and Western  regions achieved at similar levels, while the Southeast performance usually fell below. Among community sizes, average differences for citizenship results as a whole were small and fairly consistent across age. Appendices include group definitions, citizenship objectives, results for released and unreleased exercises, and procedures for estimating reliability of differences.

        "description":"Specific music objectives for which exercises were developed to assess music achievement, and actual procedures for establishing these objectives, comprise this brochure. The Educational Testing Service (ETS), awarded the task of developing music objectives in 1965, met with a group of experts in music to define the scope of music assessment. The panel viewed tasks and objectives as synonymous, pointing out that since music is a personal, aesthetic experience it is not easy to assess. With the advice of specialists, a final set of objectives, including attitudes, for music assessment was completed. Six broad major objectives, measured by certain proficiencies at specific age levels -- 9, 13, 17, and young adults 26 to 35 -- are for students to: 1) perform a piece of music; 2)  read standard musical notation; 3) listen to music with understanding, perceiving the elements and structure of music; 4) to be knowledgeable about some musical instruments, terminology, methods, literature, and history; 5) know about musical resources of the community and seek musical experiences by performing music; and 6) make judgments about music, and value the personal worth of music.

The purpose is to furnish information based on both American and Czechoslovakian sources. In an outlined form social, economic, and political facts are provided along with additional information on geography, population, and history. Cultural information on religion, traditions, languages, popular foods, sports, and holidays contribute to an understanding of the people and country. Lists of persons who contributed to and are representative of Czechoslovakia such as former monarchs, presidents, and outstanding and famous personalities born in and from the country are given. Since 5% of the people in  Texas are of Czechoslovakian extraction, an attempt is made to show the relationship between Texas and Central Europe which began in the early 16th century. Lists of the most famous personalities from Czechoslovakia now living in the United States and ten greatest moments in the history of American-Czechoslovakian relationship comprise the latter half of the volume. Special features include a short bibliography of Czechoslovakian sources and a listing of collections of available teaching materials pertaining to Czechoslovakia located in the U.S. and Czechoslovakia.

The outline of content suggests a range of possibilities only, and, as conceived, the unit would take about 10 days of instruction. It is the intent of the authors that students plan with teachers in developing the substance of this unit, and teachers are  encouraged to orchestrate the content of the unit according to the nature of changing events and perceived needs of students. The behavioral goals and learning experiences in the instructional model draw from the content outline but do not attempt to cover every point in it.

The first twenty years of the history of the People's Republic of China is categorized in terms of six distinct periods of educational reforms. Each of these six periods is analyzed by Dr. S. M. Hu according to its political emphases, educational policy and curriculum trends. The first period of 1949 to 1952 was a consolidation of the regime built, the second period of 1953 to 1957 concentrated on the Five-Year Plan with strong Soviet influence, the third period of 1958 to 1959 impressed the  world with the movement of communes and the &quot;Great Leap Forward,&quot; the fourth period of 1960 to 1963 proceeded cautiously with a &quot;retrenchment&quot; program, the fifth period of 1964 to 1965 marked by a sharp two-line Party struggle, and the sixth period of 1966 to 1969 alarmed the world with the &quot;Great Cultural Revolution&quot; which means to prepare a new breed of generation.

An analytical appraisal of social, economic, and political aspects is provided with emphasis on the interaction of these societal elements in an attempt to convey to the reader an understanding of the country and the people of the area who widely differ in ethnic backgrounds and from one territory to another. The handbook provides a description of not only the physical characteristics of the territories but also of changes that are expected to  occur. Since none of the territories are economically self-sufficient, the need for economic diversification and development is a recurring theme. Other information about the territories includes historical background, physical environment, population and labor force, ethnic groups, languages, religion, culture and security.

The first two chapters depict features of Colombia essential to understanding the context within which its educational system functions. Chapter 3 discusses educational landmarks and traditions in hopes that by reflecting on unsolved problems in the past current problems in education can be better understood. The National Government has been responsible for educational activities, plans, and programs since the Ministry of Public Instruction was created in 1903. Chapter 4 explains school organization and administration, while chapter 5 emphasizes  planning and development of education identifying problems and determining priorities. Enrollment increases are evident in kindergarten, elementary, secondary, vocational, and higher education. Much of this report (chapters 6 through 19) is devoted to reporting the history, purposes, structure and organization, facilities, curriculum, methods, problems, and criticisms of education at each of these levels. Other chapters on Colombian education are included on teachers and teacher education; private education; other educational programs; and international and foreign educational influences. The final chapter focuses on achievements and prospects for the future in Colombian education. A selected bibliography is included. (Author/SJM)",

Many available works describing affective techniques offer little guidance to teachers who wish to design their own learning experiences or to administrators and researchers who want to understand and analyze what's going on in affective education. This taxonomy not only describes some objectives of learning experiences, but classifies affective education into seven major types and eight subtypes giving teachers, curriculum designers, and administrators a means of adding reason in their selection of affective experiences. When planning affective experiences teachers can cast affective methods within categories of personal awareness, creative behavior, interpersonal awareness, subject orientation, specific content (joining  affective and cognitive), affective styles of teaching/learning, and teacher, administrator, and other educators (the focus here is on the educator as a growing person). A perfect technique would meet the criteria of all seven. Transfer values high in this typology which applies to educational situations but can be adapted to business situations and also to other fields. A short bibliography is included. (Author/SJM)",

        "description":"A relationship exists between an individuals' perception of his ability to learn and his academic achievement. This paper reports the findings of a study designed to identify the level of self-concept of academic ability of 121 students, comprised of 108 blacks (64 males and 44 females) and 13 whites (7males and 6 females), upon enrollment in and completion of a pre-college compensatory education program in New York State during 1968-1969. Enrollment in compensatory education constitutes one academic role, while completion constitutes another role. The Brookover Self-Concept-of-Academic-Ability Scale was administered to subjects upon entering and again upon completing the program. It was theorized that there would be a positive change in self-concept of academic ability of 1)  each subject as a result of moving from one role to another; 2) black and white subjects from test 1 to test 2; and, 3) both male and female subjects from test 1 to test 2. It was concluded that changes in academic roles had a positive effect on the self-concept of academic ability of male and female black subjects; but only for white male subjects. The research indicates that compensatory education programs could positively affect self-concept improvement contributing to academic achievement. (Author/SJM)",

Presented are enumerations of statements on 1) essential environmental components that exist in a successful classroom in which the childs' needs, intellectual, and social abilities are the focus of education; 2) roles of teachers; and 3) responsibilities of teachers. Criteria provided for teacher success in an open classroom are that competent teachers demonstrate achievement in cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains; are committed and involved; and maintain positive attitudes about children, learning, and knowledge. An explanation of Barths' dissertation, \"Assumptions About Learning and Knowledge\", a teacher  attitude scale dealing with teachers' beliefs about childrens' learning behaviors, is included. In an open environment children are expected to develop a number of listed measurable skills enabling teachers to evaluate each students' development. Several statements are given on prevalent misconceptions about open education. It is concluded that successful implementation of open classroom methods is a unique gradual process and has no predictive time: success occurs with smoothness of procedure and evidence of learning and growth.

Too often programs espousing an ideology are touted as the best approach toward solving social problems in America when in fact they soon become obsolescent, predetermine student judgements, and predispose a conclusion. Project Wingspread, a social intelligence building program with ideological roots steeped in liberal tradition, goes beyond acknowledgement of social injustice. Rather it emphasizes cross community cooperation of suburban and urban students exposing them to racial and cultural diversity. Ten program objectives  espoused no single ideology: each student formulated his personal views on issues after investigating community problems. Implications of these types of exchange program are: 1) social studies curriculum development; 2) cross community cooperation; 3) alternative types of exchange programs; and, 4) role of ideology in social action programs.

        "description":"Studying about non-Western cultures not only helps children enjoy the differences that exist among people, but also prepares youth for meeting change in life. It is suggested that cultural awareness and appreciation by American pupils transfer to and affect the African's self-concept and image. Being a developing nation resembling American at a former period, with similarities in the historical development such as nationalism, Kenya offers topics for cross-cultural study. Suggestions on topics of interest for teaching about Kenya in the primary and intermediate grades focus on the people and their ways of living. Primary students can study about the ways children in Kenya work together through &quot;Harambee&quot; to assist in national building by planting school gardens to help defray  school costs, by teaching others and by participating in worthwhile youth services. Other topics to be studied are how the National Anthem of Kenya was chosen, and the meaning of the national holidays of Kenya. Values which Kenyans hold dear offer study for intermediate grades. Nationalistic price in being Kenyan, respect and consideration for others, and group cooperation form value bases of Kenya culture which American youngsters can appreciate. Lastly, five resources offering information about helpful materials for studying Kenya are presented. A related document is SO 003 207. (SJM)",

The aim is for students to gain an understanding of the various contributions made by the composite ethnic groups to a city; to be aware of the various problems that groups have in their process of urbanization; and to work toward solving problems involving racial groups. Community field class programs expose students personally to the problems of minority groups. The major portion of the unit offers to teachers information arranged in content outline form on the history, development, and patterns of black settlement in a Chicago community. The essential linking components of the  black community--housing, education, employment, social and political forces--are explained. The remainder of the unit focuses on a field class experience. Students analyze Operation Breadbasket, an agency located in Chicago, in order to gain an understanding of the rationale, objectives, and effectiveness of agencies trying to help urban minorities.

The few job descriptions found in this field differed in emphasis. Some focus on the techniques of integration, while others focus on multicultural curricula, human relations in-service training, or student relations. A questionnaire was sent in April 1971 to all school systems enrolling 12,000 or more pupils and to eight smaller school systems identified in the Educational Research Files as having human relations specialists. Of the 583 questionnaires sent, 378 responses were received. Schools were divided into four strata depending on enrollment size. Tables were prepared to record the response of 108  systems with full- or part-time specialists regarding a) specialist's title, b) percent of time spent on human relations activities, c) the specialist's position on the superintendent's staff, d) to whom he reports, e) his staff, f) his 1970-71 salary, and g) his qualifications for the position.

The areas of childhood development, adult learning, college influence on students, college student characteristics, and present selection practices are all explored. In particular, Haberman discusses the durability of values learned in childhood, the outstanding cognitive and affective characteristics of adults in their twenties and thirties (usually considered too old to enter the profession), the relatively weak influence of the college environment on vocationally oriented students, the cultural pluralism of the new student population, and the use of grades as the currently most popular selection criteria for  admission into teacher education programs. These observations lead Haberman to the formation of selection criteria which emphasize a candidate's values and capacity for adult growth and which define student characteristics in terms of program goals rather than in terms of typically acceptable student characteristics.

Data were obtained at the University of Georgia for student teachers of English who student taught during the winter and fall quarter 1969 and the winter quarter 1971. The class each student teacher had taught the most was tested one week after the student teacher had left. Pupils were asked to respond to a 74-item Inventory of Student Perceptions of Instruction (ISPI). The frame of reference was the instruction carried out by the student teacher. The ISPI was concerned with six aspects of student perception: instructional objectives, classroom human relations, use of instructional  resources, student motivation for learning, meaningfulness of learning, and measurement and evaluation. Students were asked to read each item on the ISPI carefully and express a degree of agreement or disagreement. Results of the inventory indicate four evaluation uses: student teacher self-evaluation, cooperative student teacher evaluation participated in by the student teacher, supervising teacher selection, and appraisal of the program to prepare student teachers.

Basic preparation programs are divided into three categories: traditional, transitional, and modern. Traditional programs are compartmentalized into general studies, subject specialization, and professional sequence. The two major concerns of traditional programs are student teaching and methods. Transitional programs provide up-to-date courses of study and educational experience. Areas of concern include block core or curriculum packages, course proliferation and pilot programs. Should the transitional programs develop fully, modern programs will include a) the functional mixing  of theory and practice, b) the organization of study and experience into some logical order, and c) the reorientation of the basic design of the college program to fit student needs. A model modern curriculum resulted from this study. Basic developmental tasks and provisions to provide mastery by the student fall into three areas: a) self realization, b) academic competence, and c) practical expertise. Conclusions indicate that field experience shows promise as playing the role of \"integration vitalizer\" in mutual interaction with personal and academic development in a modern student-oriented teacher preparation curriculum.

The substantive issue concerns the impact of teachers' expectations on students' expectations. The subjects, 6,032 high school students, were drawn from a major Canadian city in 1959. Variables include social origins, intellectual ability, program, academic achievement, teachers' expectations, and educational ambition. The model, a system of cause-effect relationships, is presented in block-recursive form. That is, the relationships among the blocks are recursive but reciprocal causation is possible within blocks. The parameters of the model were estimated via path analyses, a generalization of multiple regression to systems of causally related variables. Results of this study include three  major findings: a) Students affect teachers much more than they are affected by the expectations teachers hold. b) The effect of teachers' expectations on student is negative. c) In general, teachers' expectations are irrelevant for girls, with the exception of the fourth year of high school, while, for boys, an early influence from students to teachers increase from year to year and the effects of teachers' expectations increased dramatically in the fourth year.

Both experienced and beginning teachers may earn a masters degree while demonstrating theory in the classroom. After a summer of child study, graduate students in teams of two design, create, and staff a multi-age learning center in a cooperating school district. Individually, they return to campus one week per month for independent study, related course work, and seminars. Local school districts provide children, classroom space, instructional materials, and a paid aide. State Department of Education personnel provide resource visits to the learning centers, help to identify potential center sites, meet with  the advisory committee, and take part in the project's international field trips. The program helps the student to deal with young children and to develop early childhood specialist competencies through provision of educational experiences for local teachers, parent groups, and undergraduate students; production of a monthly newsletter written by students; and the planning and execution of the annual early childhood conference in which they provide the program of slides, films, video tapes, panel discussions, talks, and displays.

The second meeting is a lecture hour; new  material, group experiments and demonstrations are presented. The final meeting is optional; instructor and teaching assistants are available for assistance at this time. Materials for the courses have been organized into 15 sequential phases called P.E.P. (phases of educational psychology). Each phase begins with specific behavioral objectives. Assigned readings and activities are prepared and submitted for teacher approval. After teacher approval is obtained the student must take a mastery quiz and achieve an 80 percent before moving to the next unit. All phases must be completed to take final exams or to do an applied project. Each year the course has been in operation there has been an increase in student performance.

This analysis revealed four major findings: 1) There are few, if any, skills of teaching whose superiority can be counted as empirically established. 2) Teacher education programs are doing very little that is different from what they did 5 years ago to train teachers to work with minority groups and  low income areas. 3) Teacher education is an economic arrangement within a school of education and its larger university community; the changing role of the teacher, the increasing teacher surplus, and increased emphasis on instruction technology will greatly affect this economic arrangement as well as teacher selection, training, and placement practices. 4) Teacher education suffers from an imbalanced, fragmented, and obsolete curriculum.

Eleven teams of volunteer teachers, used in a previous study (Molner, 1971 SP 005 510), supplied material for audio tapes. Teams met approximately once a week, and the data was originally gathered over a 3-month period (March-May 1970). Team size ranged from three to eight members. Discussions reflect three areas of concern: a) the request and offer of professional assistance, b) the use of technical and personal expertise, and c) the evaluation of team and individual efforts relating to the functioning of the team. Each meeting was listened to by two observers whose task was to identify major  agenda items within the meeting. The observers identified 1) the agenda items, including descriptive titles for each item; 2) the starting and ending point of each item; and 3) the major components discussed within each agenda item. The content analysis instrument was composed of eight types of communication identified as representing different features of a team discussion. The content analysis instrument differentiated the kinds of comments made by team teachers discussing different topics. These differences validate at least some of the categories in the content analysis. Reliability for this study is not entirely satisfactory and indicates the need for refinement of the content analysis instrument. A 2-item bibliography is included. (MJM)",

The two major movements described include a) \"deschooling\" the society as proposed by Ivan Illich by disorganizing public school organization, and b) personalizing instruction by encouraging the individual needs and interests of students to greater depth and broader range. Major methods described cover independent study, lectures, the discovery format emphasizing the student role as investigator, programmed learning as a modified lecture, and discussion-inquiry dealing with student feelings. Results of the examination of the above movements and methods led to a major conclusion; none of the teaching approaches described, or passed over, used to  the exclusion of others is sufficient for the needs of modern-day schooling. Only together do they begin to offer a range complex enough to cope with today's education. Fitting teaching formats to situations and desired ends is necessary and reemphasizes the need for an applied theory of eclecticism. (MJM)",

Five areas of study include a) outcomes, b) help for whom, c) the helpful situation, d) the helpful treatment, and e) the helpful helper. The first section briefly describes the outcomes of self confrontation in three areas: self-esteem, realism, and anxiety. The next section studies self-concept, dogmatism, and body image indicating who needs help. The third section concerns the establishment of a secure &quot;psychological safety&quot; situation. The helpful treatment is divided into procedures most often used in counseling, including nonvideo procedures, audio versus video, and facilitative conditions. Finally the helpful helper  summarizes the qualities required of a person to be helpful. Several conclusions were reached concerning self-confrontation. Self confrontation: 1) provides a powerful source of information about those aspects of the self which are perceived by others but not by self; 2) presents new information about feelings of which the individual is not aware, and which are probably temporarily disorganizing; 3) fosters placebogenic effects in a low threat situation; and 4) permits the subject to derive what he will from treatments with non-specific effects.

Two information gathering procedures were used: a) an investigation of selective literature search and correspondence with the programs producing limited results and b) individually typed letters were sent to colleges and universities with 10,000 or more students. Respondents were asked to describe in letter form or existing printed material their overseas student teaching programs and suggest names of existing institutions sponsoring or collaborating on such programs. The programs are described and structured as follows: 1) Programs are  reported by state. 2) Reporting has been limited to overseas student teaching programs. 3) Only programs in operation during the development of this monograph are included. 4) An attempt to preserve the integrity of every program description has been made through close scrutiny of the materials provided by the respondents. Six recommendations were made. Followup studies cannot be implemented until a greater number of returning participants are employed in positions in which the relative effects of overseas student teaching experience can be measured. The appendix contains sources contacted during the course of study development. (MJM)",

The materials are prepared as a number of handouts which participants receive in sequence. Participants engage in four major activities, and there are four phases to each activity. Workshop participants are divided into groups of from 5-10 individuals. In the first phase of each activity, participants are provided with information concerning a \"hypothetical\" curriculum implementation project. This information is typically contained in a handout and is briefly discussed and clarified by the workshop leaders. The second phase of the activity is a problem posed to the participants.  The problem requires the participants to act on the information provided to operationalize some aspect of the project. The third phase allows the workshop groups to communicate to one another a summary of the action each group took relative to the problem. A brief discussion follows as the workshop leaders clarify and summarize the main ideas presented by each group. Finally, the fourth phase to each activity is a series of examples of action taken by the workshop leaders in the actual design and implementation of the hypothetical project. During the four activities it becomes clear that project evaluation is an integral part of project design, implementation, and monitoring. Handouts and tables are included. (Author/MJM)",

At each meeting a single concept was presented as follows: 1) As the students entered the lecture hall each received a set of mimeographed materials. The materials consisted of from 17-22 multiple choice questions dealing with concept development, data interpretation, and explanation and prediction. 2) A carefully planned demonstration, 20-30 minutes long, was supported by visual aids. 3) After the completion of the demonstration, students answered the questions. When at least 80  percent of the students had finished, answers were flashed on the screen. Forty-four concepts were presented for a 2-semester course with a 2-hour lab each week. The project was evaluated by a committee of five who had no other connection with the project. To determine the attitudes and preferences of the students, both personal interviews and a Likert scaled Inventory of Student Attitudes and Opinions were used.

The approach adopted was to limit consideration to simple learning tasks for which adequate mathematical models could be developed. Optimal or suitable suboptimal instructional strategies were developed for the models. The basic idea was to solve for strategies that either maximize the amount learned in a fixed time period or minimize the time necessary to attain a prescribed level of performance. Once strategies were formulated, experiments were carried out to evaluate their relative efficiency. The program of work involved a mathematical analysis of optimization problems relating to the learning process and also representing a fairly unique method for testing learning theories. In this sense, the project was an  attempt to bridge the gap between the psychologist's laboratory experiments in learning theory and the practical problems of divising efficient instructional strategies in the classroom. The optimization strategies developed and tested during the course of the project were fairly restrictive in character and applicable primarily to simple tasks such as those found in initial reading, language arts, and elementary mathematics.

The sample consisted of 739 pupils and their teachers from 36 fifth grade classes in two Indiana public school systems. Five sub-tests from the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking were administered to all teachers to determine their level of divergent thinking ability. A median split was then used to divide the teachers into a high group and a low group. Pupils assigned to PTP (Productive Thinking Program) and PCTP (Purdue Creativity Training Program) studied 16 instructional units over a period of 4-8 weeks. Teachers assigned to discussion treatments interacted with the pupils, discussing the materials and attempting to foster creative thinking and  problem solving among pupils. Teachers assigned to non-discussion treatments distributed the materials and supervised the students, but had minimal interaction. Classes assigned to the control group continued their normal classroom activities with no special instructional treatment. All pupils were given pre-and post-tests. Results provided evidence that some creative thinking and problem solving abilities of fifth grade pupils can be positively influenced by deliberate instructional efforts. Three major problems are identified: a) difficulty in defining treatment, b) validity of teacher divergent thinking scores, and c) complexity of the construct of creativity.

The research covered 1) the extent of satisfaction with accountability, by program; 2) teachers' perceptions of extent of accountability by program; 3) identification of source of pressures for accountability, by  program; 4) extent of pressures for accountability from administrative and parental sources, by program; 5) extent of work created by level of accountability; 6) the effect of level of accountability upon teacher effectiveness and sense of professionalism; and 7) the satisfaction with in-service training, cooperation of supervisors, and supervisors evaluation process, by level of accountability and program. Results indicated that greater accountability may increase a teacher's sense of effectiveness and professionalism, in-service training along with positive assistance from supervisors may increase satisfaction and teacher effectiveness, and regarding the placement of teachers into contract learning or highly structured programs, preference toward less experienced teachers may be  warranted.

The individualized instructional module was used as an effective learning instrument. The Weber Individualized Learning Kits (Wilkits) formed the basis of course blocks. Related course blocks were organized into systems for preparing elementary and secondary teachers. Each Wilkit was a learning activity divided into eight sections: title, introduction, content, preassessment, behavioral objectives, learning experiences, self evaluation, and proficiency  assessment. In 1970 an evaluation specialist was added to the staff for one year. Data were collected from students and faculty; tentative observations resulted. Observations included 1) Both students and faculty are working harder than under the previous system. 2) Students are learning more. 3) There is a friendlier more cooperative student-faculty relationship. 4) Students are accepting responsibility for the decisions concerning their own preparation. 5) Students work to achieve competency in the absence of grades. 6) Students and faculty can adjust effectively to new behavior patterns. 7) Public school teachers and administrators show enthusiasm for educational innovation. The program received the Distinguished Achievement Award for 1971 from the American Association of Colleges for  Teacher Education. Appendixes are included. (MJM)",

An experimental design was employed with the experimental group (n = 7 pairs): a) receiving training in analysis of verbal interaction, b) analyzing their own verbal interaction and, c) considering the results of the analysis of their verbal behavior. The control group (n = 7 pairs) did not received systematic training, did not engage in analysis of their verbal behavior, and did not have the opportunity to consider results of analysis. Data were  secured by means of audio-taped conferences analyzed using the Blumberg Interaction Analysis System and a 47-item questionnaire constructed by the researchers and given to student teachers in the experimental and control groups after each of four sequential conferences. Results indicated the student teacher's perceptions were consistent in three areas: human relations, verbal process, and substance. Lower ratings were given to statements involving student output in problem solving, pursuing ways of collecting data pertinent to teacher behavior, being asked thought provoking questions, and being allowed time to think, discover and explore ideas.

Outcomes of the study are as follows: no significant differences were found between the graduate interns and the two control groups on the FIAC. Significant differences, ranking  superior teachers first and graduate interns second, were found on major variables of the COR; the most striking result was the sameness of the three study groups on the FIAC.

Questionnaires were developed and sent to over 2,000 public school teachers and principals (primarily secondary school level) in the State of Washington and Sweden. Usable responses were received from 1,054 teachers and principals. The Porter and Lawler subtractive method of ascertaining attitudes was employed which allowed for analyzing need deficiency scores. Six major hypotheses were tested by means of correlation analysis and analysis of variance. The significant findings were: 1) a positive relationship between attitudes of Washington teachers and most demographic characteristics (age, sex, and  amount of teaching experience particularly strong); 2) highly positive relationships between level of satisfaction with a global variable and specific responses to the other two variables (for all combinations of job satisfaction, professionalism, and collective negotiations); 3) significant differences between the Swedish and Washington secondary school teachers on need deficiency scores for approximately three-fourths of the questions; 4) significant differences between perception of teacher attitudes held by principals and the attitudes of secondary teachers themselves; and 5) compatability between collective negotiations and both professionalism and job satisfaction.

The sample of 103 teachers of grades K-6, representing about half of the elementary schools in a large public school system, had attended a summer social studies institute which stressed the use of inquiry strategies for value analysis and clarification. Teachers completed a questionnaire and taped three 15-minute discussions with small groups. A questionnaire and behavior coding scheme were developed to measure attitudes and behavior in relation to training program objectives. Analysis of the results, using multiple regression and canonical correlation, yielded the following conclusions: 1) The best predictor of a single act  behavior is its corresponding behavioral intention. 2) A general attitude measure can predict a multiple act criterion better than a single act criterion. 3) Perceived difficulty of performing a behavior, while consistently negatively correlated with behavior, is not highly related to overt behavior. 4) Level of commitment does not improve behavioral prediction. Prediction of single questioning behaviors by other coded behaviors was also investigated and discussed in the context of the conceptual relationship of coded behaviors to existing taxonomies. An extensive bibliography and appendixes are included. (Author)",

The study included the following activities: 1) the development of initial selection criteria for educational products with impact; 2) the identification and description of  products meeting the initial selection criteria; 3) the identification of 21 of those products for intensive review; 4) systematic case studies of the 21 products tracing the history of each from its origin to its diffusion and adoption; 5) the extraction of generalizations about the products based upon product characteristics, development, evaluation, diffusion, adoption requirements, etc. with the generalizations then related to existing hypotheses regarding the processes of innovation and change in education; 6) an identification of ways whereby information on the impact, or potential impact of educational products may be obtained.

To pinpoint the factors involved, educators must consider (1) the language barrier, (2) how it is formed, (3) at what level is it retarding the pupil, (4) What educational approaches are needed to meet the language needs of the deprived, and (5) how varied must the teaching approaches be, in order to involve the learner. A \"transitional\" type of readiness program is needed to help bridge the initial gap that exists when the disadvantaged child enters school. The term \"disadvantaged\" encompasses the non-English speaking Hispano, the non-standard-English speaking Hispano, the Negro, the poor-white, the Indian, and the Oriental. The point is  not to replace the child's language, but to add other forms. Suggestions of how to motivate a disadvantaged child, and interest him in learning are as follows: (1) Give him problems to solve; (2) Provide manipulative materials to aid him in the solution; (3) Structure lessons simply; (4) Set short range goals that are meaningful and functional; (5) Allow large blocks of working time in physically oriented tasks; (6) Vary the teaching approach by making a game out of a lesson; and (7) Utilize the experiences that the child has developed in his poverty culture by beginning instruction at the time he enters school.

A total of 216 randomly selected subjects were used; they were selected from nine rural Manitoba schools, and they were drawn in equal frequencies from grades one, four and six in each of the nine schools. The criterion measure for ability was Pintner Cunningham Primary Test for grade one, and the Pintner General Ability Test for grades four and six. All the language samples were segmented into minimal terminable units (T-units) single independent predications together with any subordinate clauses that may be grammatically related to it. The  indices adopted for the study were differentiated on a dichotomous scale: positive and negative. Linguistic performance credited to the positive scale was assumed to indicate language maturity. Performance measured on the negative scale indicated deficiency in language development. Findings include: The only sentence-combining transformation categories favoring the grade six subjects were the Infinitive Phrase + Subject and the Coordinate transformations. Only two transformation categories showed any significant relationship to the sex variable; and the ability variable proved significant in all tested categories except Coordinate Structure transformations.

An introductory film deals with principles of movement in string playing. Fifteen additional titles offer guidance to the student and teacher in the various details of basic string instruction. A summary film presents a final report on the performance and progress of children trained in the Project at the end of formal instruction. The central issue of the project under test was the hypothesis that movement training, designed to free the student from excessive tensions, can be introduced within an organized plan of string instruction, and that such a plan, in the long run, will result in faster learning and better playing in all facets of instruction.  The materials were used and tested in an extensive two-year trial, involving 22 teaching centers in Illinois and additional out-of-state testing centers. Products of the study include: a film series in color on &quot;The Teaching of Action in String Playing&quot;; an introductory film and other films; a tune record and three exercise records. Recommendations include: (1) Teacher-training institutions hold the key to the future of string instruction in the schools; and (2) Programmed teaching materials and the use of audio-visual aids point to a new era of efficient instruction of string instruments.

Admissions committees now rely on the ability of a test to predict students' performance at their institution to guide their selection. However, minority group members have criticized such uses of test scores. Three potential sources of bias against minority groups include: irrelevance of the test content, particularly verbal content, to their culture and background; discriminatory administration of the testing program; and discriminatory use of the test results. Research investigating the comparative performance of minority and majority group members, the predictive validity of  tests, and the influence of the testing environment on performance is reviewed. Efforts to isolate culturally biased test items have been unsuccessful. Evidence indicates that minority group members tend to score less well on most tests; however, tests seem to validly predict academic success regardless of the student's background. In addition, the physical and psychological atmosphere in which the test is administered seems to have a significant influence on performance. Suggestions for supplementary research are delineated.

        "description":"This paper describes the development of the Survey of Pupil Opinion, an attitude-assessment instrument adapted to the reading and \"palatability\" levels of high school students in compensatory programs. An initial pool of 100 items assumed to reflect \"attitude toward school\" was reduced to a 30-item instrument. Results revealed that, for each of three factors--social participation, perception of teachers, and self as student--the lowest mean score was obtained by the students who later dropped out of school. A copy of the instrument and tabulations and a graph of the three factor mean scores and the total mean score are included. (Author/DG)",

The working model is a product of the Trent Valley Centre (TVC), a &quot;regional laboratory&quot; type extension center of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. The first objective of the program is to generate the working model for the diffusion of educational innovations, both process and product, and the second objective is to implement the emerging model in a school system that is characterized by the absence of markedly atypical features. The major components of the model include: a climate for change; academic-practitioner interaction; roles for evaluation; program development strategies; interschool cooperation; county wide communication networks; and  teacher responsibility for change. Stages in the model include: agreement to begin; establishment of an organization; selection of problems and goals; study of available solutions; pilot trials; adopt, adapt, reject decisions; and field trial. The major contribution to new knowledge that this model makes has to do with the ways in which the components interact to produce validated educational change. (Author/DB)",

Predictions were made for the 1968-69 school year and then validated with the actual data for that school year. Data were organized into 27 types, which were suggested by a literature review. Results of the study show that teachers with less than four years experience showed the highest amount of turnover, with married women under 30 having the highest rate, unmarried females under 30 being second, married males and unmarried males being third and  fourth, respectively.

The subjects in the experiment were 30 graduate students, 15 of whom were assigned to the Imagery group and 15 to the Verbal group. Ten concrete (high imagery ratings) and 10 abstract (low imagery ratings) sentences were selected for the study (see Appendix for the complete list). The design was 3 x 2 repeated measures design, with repeated measures on the second factor--sentence type (concrete vs. abstract). The first factor was instructional set:  Imagery vs. Verbal vs. Rote. With one exception, it was demonstrated that subjects employing verbal and/or imaginal processing techniques will recall more sentence elements than a group instructed to repeat a sentence over and over. The instructional sets had somewhat different effects upon the recall of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Tables and figures present the results of the experiment. (DB)",

        "description":"There exists an overriding need to rethink our cognitive and perceptual approaches to the problem of inter-group living and the development of an ethnic person identity in terms of human behavior and development. Two conceptual models are needed: Socialization is a matter of learning about man-made structure; and individuation is a matter of understanding processes of human nature. What the individual must learn and will repress in order to live in his society is not identical with what he can learn or wishes to forget. We may speak of the individual way of perceiving and living with ethnicity; It is a way of behaving according to a special sense of \"coming face-to-face and to terms with one's own.\" Then there is the group way within and for the sake of ethnicity. It is a pattern  of living and working, of \"presenting and performing among fellow man\" with historical symbols, special legends, and conventional social pieties or actualities. The structural aspects of ethnicity ways can be understood in terms of readily identifiable processes of becoming a person and learning a distinctive ethnic style of learning. (Author/JM)",

THE COMPOSITIONS SUBMITTED BY THE STUDENT SAMPLE WERE ANALYZED IN TERMS OF PARTS OF SPEECH, SENTENCE TYPE, SENTENCE COMPLEXITY, CLAUSES, AND PHRASES. PHRASES WERE DIVIDED INTO FIVE CATEGORIES (NOUN, VERB, ADJECTIVAL, ADVERBIAL, AND ABSOLUTE). THE INCIDENCE OF USE OF SENTENCE  FRAGMENTS AND RUN-ON SENTENCES AND THE FREQUENCY OF THE USE OF RIGHT OR LEFT HAND IN WRITING WERE TABULATED. STUDY RESULTS SHOWED THAT RESIDENCE CLASSIFICATION, SEX, INCIDENCE OF RIGHT OR LEFT HANDEDNESS, INCIDENCE OF USE OF RUN-ON SENTENCES, AND INCIDENCE OF USE OF SENTENCE FRAGMENTS PRODUCED NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS WITH ANY OTHER VARIABLES.

SIXTEEN UNDERGRADUATE FEMALE VOLUNTEERS WERE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A VERBAL RESPONSE UNDER MANIPULATED LIGHTING CONDITIONS. BASE LINE SCORES WERE OBTAINED FOR EACH SUBJECT UNDER DIMLIGHT CONDITIONS. PUSHBUTTON SCORES WERE OBTAINED TO MEASURE SUBJECT AWARENESS LEVELS RELATED TO NOXIOUS LIGHTING. CESSATION OF PREESTABLISHED LEVELS OF NOXIOUS LIGHT WAS THEN MADE DEPENDENT ON RESPONSE FREQUENCIES. INTENSITY AND INTERVALS OF NOXIOUS LIGHTING WERE VARIED AS REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION, EXTINCTION, AND REACQUISITION OF CONDITIONING. RESULTS INDICATED THAT CONDITIONING WAS PREDICATED ON THE LEVEL OF SUBJECTS' AWARENESS TO THE AVERSIVE STIMULUS. THE LEVEL OF  AWARENESS WAS CONCLUDED TO BE SUBJECT SPECIFIC. METHODS USED HERE ARE HELD TO BE POTENTIALLY USEFUL FOR SCIENTIFIC EXAMINATION OF VERBAL CONDITIONING. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT TECHNIQUES WILL EVOLVE FROM THIS EXPERIMENT WHICH WILL ALLOW PRECISE AND SPECIFIC MANIPULATION OF VERBALIZATION IN THE CLASSROOM. (WN)",

THESE THREE APPROACHES WERE TRIED FOR 140 SCHOOL DAYS (1 YEAR), USING 28 FIRST-GRADE CLASSES. THEY WERE EXAMINED FROM THE STANDPOINTS OF PUPIL ACHIEVEMENT ON THE WHOLE AND ACHIEVEMENT WITHIN CERTAIN GROUPS OF CHILDREN. AMONG THE GROUPS CONSIDERED WERE BOYS VERSUS GIRLS, NEGROES VERSUS WHITES, AND REPEATERS VERSUS NONREPEATERS. ALSO CONSIDERED WERE FACTORS OF GENERAL MATURITY AND LEVEL OF HOME ENVIRONMENT. READINESS TESTS, AN INTELLIGENCE TEST, ACHIEVEMENT TESTS, AND NONTEST DATA WERE USED TO OBTAIN THE PROJECT RESULTS. THESE RESULTS SHOWED THAT  NO ONE OF THESE THREE APPROACHES WAS CONSISTENTLY SUPERIOR TO THE OTHER TWO IN ALL AREAS OF ACHIEVEMENT CONSIDERED. CERTAIN TEST SUBSCORES, HOWEVER, DID INDICATE SUPERIORITY OF THE SENSORY EXPERIENCES APPROACH. WHERE THE DIFFERENCES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT, THE DIFFERENCE WAS STILL IN FAVOR OF THIS APPROACH IN ALL INSTANCES. THE BASAL READER APPROACH WAS SECOND BEST FOR NEGRO SUBJECTS. FOR WHITE SUBJECTS, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BASAL READER AND PHONICS APPROACHES. FOR REASONS OF UNCONTROLLED VARIABLES, COMPARISONS OF TOTAL BOYS VERSUS TOTAL GIRLS COULD NOT BE MADE. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT IF THE STUDY WERE DUPLICATED WITH DIFFERENT CHILDREN AND TEACHERS, HOWEVER, QUITE DIFFERENT RESULTS MIGHT BE OBTAINED. (JH)",

IT WAS SUGGESTED FROM THIS SYSTEMATIC PROCESS THAT ONE COULD  FINALLY DEFINE OBJECTIVES WITH GREAT SPECIFICITY IN ORGANIZING LEARNING PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS. A MAJOR EMPHASIS WAS, HOWEVER, THAT ONE CANNOT LEGITIMATELY DEDUCE EDUCATIONAL ENDS FROM VALUES, OR LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FROM EDUCATIONAL ENDS, SIMPLY ON THE BASIS OF LOGIC OR COMMON SENSE ALONE, BUT RATHER MUST INTRODUCE, IN ORDER TO MAKE SUCH DEDUCTIONS, CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS WHICH ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE OBVIOUS. IT FOLLOWED, THEREFORE, THAT CONSULTATION WITH SPECIALISTS OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER IS NECESSARY IN MAKING EACH OF THE DERIVATIONS INVOLVED, AND IN SOME INSTANCES IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO ASSESS CONVENTIONAL WISDOM (WHAT THE PUBLIC BELIEVES OR WANTS, OR WHAT PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS KNOW BEFORE CURRICULUM PLANNING BEGINS).

IN THE RESEARCH PHASE THE MEAN SCORES ON THE &quot;VOCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT INVENTORY&quot; AND THE &quot;VOCATIONAL INFORMATION ACHIEVEMENT TEST&quot; OF THREE SIXTH-GRADE CLASSES OF PUPILS RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE COMPARED TO THE MEAN SCORES ON THE SAME TESTS OF THREE RANDOMLY SELECTED CONTROL  GROUPS. THE TREATMENT GROUPS PLAYED THE MODIFIED GAME FOR 15 HOURS OVER A PERIOD OF A MONTH. THE CONTROL GROUPS RECEIVED THE REGULAR CURRICULUM WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE ANY SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF CAREER DEVELOPMENT. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATMENT AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE FOUND. IT WAS EVIDENT, HOWEVER, THAT THE GAME EVOKED A HIGH DEGREE OF PUPIL INTEREST. BECAUSE OF THIS FACT, FURTHER CLASSROOM STUDY CONCERNING THE USE OF THE GAME WAS FELT TO BE WARRANTED.

THE LARGE SAMPLE OF PERSONS USED INCLUDED SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS, SUPERINTENDENTS, PRINCIPALS, OTHER SCHOOL STAFF MEMBERS, TEACHERS, AND PARENTS. THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY WAS THAT THE PREDICTABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE EFFECTIVENESS FROM INDIVIDUAL MEASURES IS ENHANCED SIGNIFICANTLY BY CONSIDERATIONS OF THE TYPE OF DISTRICTS IN WHICH AN ADMINISTRATOR WORKS. ACKNOWLEDGING CERTAIN SHORTCOMINGS DISCUSSED IN THE STUDY, THIS HYPOTHESIS WAS STRONGLY CONFIRMED. SUCCESSFUL ADMINISTRATORS SHOWED DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTIC IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISTRICTS OFTEN CONSISTENT WITH STEREOTYPES.

STUDENTS WERE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AN OIL CRAYON DRAWING, RESULTING FROM AN IMAGINARY SENTENCE SPOKEN TO AND SEEN BY ALL PARTICIPANTS. PREDICTIONS OF PERFORMANCE WERE ASKED PRIOR TO AND EVALUATIONS AFTER PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS AND THEIR PEERS. RESPONSES TO A PROFESSIONAL OIL PAINTING WERE ASKED ON EACH OF EIGHT DESCRIPTIVE CRITERIA AND THE OVERALL CRITERIA. A PROFESSIONAL JUDGE-TEAM JUDGED BOTH THE STUDENT'S DRAWING AND THE PROFESSIONAL OIL PAINTING USING THE SAME CRITERIA. THE PEARSON PRODUCT-MOMENT COEFFICIENT, AND ANALYSIS-OF-VARIANCE TECHNIQUES WERE USED IN THE STUDY. THE CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FROM  ANALYSES OF DATA SHOW THAT STUDENTS PREDICT THEIR ART PERFORMANCE IN AGREEMENT WITH JUDGE'S PROJECTIONS OF STUDENT ART ABILITY BASED ON THEIR WORK. THE PREDICTION OF STUDENT ART ABILITY BY THE JUDGES AGREES WITH STUDENT SELF-PREDICTION. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT STUDENT SELF-EVALUATIONS OF ART PERFORMANCE (GENERALIZED &quot;GESTALT&quot; SELF-EVALUATIONS) RELATE TO JUDGE'S ESTIMATES OF STUDENT ART PERFORMANCE ON MEASURES THAT ARE DESCRIPTIVE IN NATURE. THE STUDY ALSO INDICATES THE &quot;GESTALT&quot; MANNER OF JUDGING STUDENT ART PERFORMANCE IS AS RELIABLE AS SEPARATE DESCRIPTIVE CRITERIA. SEPARATE DESCRIPTIVE CRITERIA ARE THE MOST USEFUL WHEN THE INTENTION OF THE EVALUATION IS TO GUIDE STUDENT ART PROGRESS. CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ART JUDGMENT APPEAR PREDICTABLE THROUGH THE USE OF DISCREPANCY TECHNIQUES.  DISCREPANCIES AND ART PERFORMANCE APPEAR LESS RELATED BY THIS STUDY. (GC)",

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF DATA SHOWED THAT THE STATED HYPOTHESIS DID NOT RECEIVE CONFIRMATION IN THIS EXPERIMENT. FOR THE MOST PART, DIFFERENCES ON THE TEST ITEMS WERE NIL. WHEN THEY DID OCCUR, HOWEVER, THE RESPONSES FAVORED PUPILS IDENTIFIED AS NEGRO AND/OR LOW CLASS.

FOR EXAMPLE, LITTLE RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND THE ATTITUDE TOWARD ENGLISH. NO CONSISTENT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION WAS UNCOVERED. MANY ATTITUDES WERE RELATED SIGNIFICANTLY TO SOCIAL MOBILITY. A TOTAL OF 224 TABLES WERE INCLUDED. (JC)",

IN MACON COUNTY, ALABAMA THE SAMPLE SELECTION CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY 650 NEGRO AND 10 WHITE ILLITERATES FROM A SOUTHERN COMMUNITY. DATA WERE GATHERED THROUGH INTERVIEWS, QUESTIONNAIRES, TESTS, AND RATING TECHNIQUES. DATA WERE ANALYZED ON PERSONAL VARIABLES, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, EDUCATIONAL ASPIRATIONS, ECONOMIC STATUS, AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION. APPROXIMATELY 18 PAGES REPORTED CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. SOME OF THE MORE GENERAL FINDINGS WERE--(1) 96 PERCENT OF THE SUBJECTS HAD COMPLETED ONLY THE EIGHTH GRADE OR LESS, (2) REASONS FOR ILLITERACY WERE MANY AND VARIED, AND (3) TWO OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WERE FOUND TO BE THE  INDIFFERENT ATTITUDE OF THE STATE TOWARD ILLITERATE NEGROES AND CAUCASIANS AND A COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN BETWEEN THE RACES. THE TEACHING AND TESTING EXPERIMENTS INDICATED ENTHUSIASTIC PARTICIPATION BY THE SUBJECTS. THE SUBJECT MATTER OFFERED APPEARED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. THE RECOMMENDATIONS SUGGESTED MEANS TO AMELIORATE PROBLEMS AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ILLITERATE PERSONS. (RS)",

THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE RECRUITED, NOMINATED, INTERVIEWED, AND TESTED FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM. AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED, COMPOSED OF SIX GRADUATES OF THE ORIGINAL LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM HELD ONE YEAR EARLIER. A COMMITTEE MEETING WAS THEN HELD, ELICITING SUGGESTIONS FOR STRENGTHENING SUMMER WORKSHOPS, INTERNSHIPS, FIELD EXPERIENCES, AND EVALUATION TECHNIQUES. FOLLOWON ACTIVITIES TO BE  CONDUCTED WERE THUS REPORTED. PLANS WERE INCLUDED FOR--(1) THE PREPARATION AND DIRECTION OF AN 8-WEEK SUMMER WORKSHOP, (2) IMPROVING THE INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCES THROUGH COOPERATIVE EFFORTS BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND A PARTICULAR INTERN'S EMPLOYING SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND (3) REFINING THE EVALUATIVE INSTRUMENTS PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED FOR IMMEDIATE AND FOLLOWUP STUDY OF BOTH INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANTS AND THE OVERALL PROGRAM.

RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE TREATMENT PROCEDURES DID NOT PRODUCE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE VARIOUS TREATMENT GROUPS TO ANSWER OR SUPPORT THE QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES RAISED.

THE MEETINGS WERE STAFFED BY FOUR-MAN TEAMS OF CONSULTANTS IN TRAINING DESIGN, EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH, AND STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION. OBJECTIVES OF THE MEETINGS WERE TO (1) REVIEW THE EVALUATIVE RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF PUBLIC LAW 89-10, (2) REVIEW BASIC CONCEPTS IN EVALUATION RESEARCH AND EXPLORE POSSIBLE POINTS OF INFLUENCE WHEREBY STATE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL COULD UPGRADE THE QUALITY OF EVALUATION RESEARCH, (3) EXAMINE TYPICAL RESEARCH DESIGNS, (4) DEVELOP  EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH, (5) STIMULATE PLANNING FOR LONG-TERM RESEARCH OBJECTIVES, AND (6) PROVIDE A MODEL FOR CONDUCTING CLINICS BY STATE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL FOR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT PERSONNEL. A ROSTER OF THE STAFF AND PARTICIPANTS WHO ATTENDED EACH OF THE FIVE EASTERN REGION MEETINGS AND THE FOUR WESTERN REGION MEETINGS IS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT.

AN EXPERIMENT WAS CARRIED OUT WITH 20 SUBJECTS WHO WERE TRAINED ON SUCCESSIVE DISCRIMINATION INVOLVING 3 FREQUENCY MODULATED SINUSOIDAL TONES THAT DIFFERED IN CENTER FREQUENCY AND/OR THE RATE OF MODULATION. THE PATTERN OF REINFORCEMENT FOR THE EMISSION OF EITHER OF TWO MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE RESPONSES WAS CONTINGENT ON THE PRESENCE OF ONE OR TWO VISUAL CUES. IN THIS WAY, THE STIMULUS PROPERTY ATTENDED WAS BROUGHT UNDER EXPERIMENTAL CONTROL. THE STRUCTURE INDUCED ON THE EXTENDED STIMULUS SET WAS  EXAMINED USING GENERALIZATION TESTING PROCEDURES WITH THE TWO VISUAL CUES PRESENTED SINGLY FOR 10 SUBJECTS, AND WITH CUES PRESENTED IN COMBINATION FOR THE OTHER 10 SUBJECTS. MEASURES OF THE RESPONSE PROBABILITY AND RESPONSE LATENCY WERE OBTAINED. MEASURES OF DISCRIMINATION LATENCY WERE RELATED TO MEASURES OF RESPONSE PROBABILITY. IN THE CHOICE OF A MODE OF EXPRESSION FOR RESPONSE LATENCY, THE MOST REASONABLE CANDIDATES WERE THE RECIPROCAL AND LOGARITHMIC TRANSFORMATIONS. (JC)",

RESULTS SHOWED THAT STUDENTS WHO REVIEWED BY PICTORIALLY PRESENTED MATERIALS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER RETENTION AND TRANSFER OF TRAINING THAN STUDENTS WHO DID NOT REVIEW AT ALL.

A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED IN PART 1 TO AMERICANS LIVING IN FRANCE. THE INSTRUMENT ELICITED RESPONSES SHOWING HOW THESE AMERICANS GENERALLY VIEWED THE FRENCH PEOPLE AND SOME OF THE TROUBLESOME ASPECTS OF THEIR CROSS-CULTURAL RELATIONSHIPS. IN ADDITION, MANY RESPONDENTS WERE INTERVIEWED TO OBTAIN ANSWERS ON ITEMS OF DETAIL. GATHERED DATA WERE COLLATED INTO CATEGORIES--(1) THE ELEMENTS OF FRENCH CULTURE WHICH ARE DIFFICULT FOR AMERICANS TO UNDERSTAND, (2)  PERSONAL INCIDENTS THAT APPEARED TO BE CRUCIAL TO ADJUSTMENT TO FRENCH LIFE, AND (3) PERSONAL PERCEPTIONS OF VARIOUS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FRENCH AND AMERICAN LIFE. DATA WERE ANALYZED, AND FINDINGS INDICATED AREAS OF COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO WAYS OF LIFE. PART 2 OF THE STUDY BROADENED THE SCOPE OF AN EXISTING LANGUAGE-TEACHING RESEARCH BIBLIOGRAPHY (PREVIOUSLY COVERING THE TIME PERIOD 1945-61) TO INCLUDE RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHED UP TO 1964.

SYSTEMATIC ANALYSES WERE EMPLOYED TO COMPARE LONGITUDINAL CHANGES, CROSS-SECTIONAL AGE DIFFERENCES, SEX DIFFERENCES, AND RESIDENT VERSUS DAY SCHOOL DIFFERENCES (APPLICABLE ONLY TO THE DEAF CHILDREN). FINDINGS OF THESE ANALYSES SUGGESTED THAT (1) DEAF SUBJECTS TEND TO SHOW LESS INCREMENTAL LEARNING THAN NORMAL SUBJECTS, (2) DEAF SUBJECTS TEND TO VARY MORE THAN NORMAL SUBJECTS ON THE LEVEL OF THEIR PERFORMANCES AMONG DIFFERENT TESTS, AND (3) THE PERFORMANCES OF DEAF SUBJECTS, AS THEIR AGES INCREASE, TEND MORE TO MATCH AND SOMETIMES SURPASS THE PERFORMANCES OF NORMAL SUBJECTS. FURTHER RESEARCH WAS RECOMMENDED TO STUDY THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WHICH RELATE TO COGNITIVE PERFORMANCES OF THE DEAF. (RS)",

DISCRIMINATION-MODELING WAS AN OUT-OF-CLASSROOM PROCEDURE IN WHICH SUBJECTS, WHILE VIEWING A MOTION PICTURE, WERE ASKED TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN HYPERACTIVE AND TASK-ORIENTED BEHAVIOR. APPROPRIATE IDENTIFICATIONS OF TASK-ORIENTED BEHAVIOR WERE MATERIALLY AND VERBALLY REINFORCED, WHILE IDENTIFICATIONS OF HYPERACTIVE BEHAVIOR WERE MERELY VERBALLY AFFIRMED. OPERANT CONDITIONING WAS REINFORCEMENT IN THE CLASSROOM AFTER  A GIVEN BEHAVIOR HAD OCCURRED. THE SUBJECTS WERE PRETESTED AND RANDOMLY DIVIDED IN FOUR TREATMENT GROUPS--(1) EXPOSURE TO DISCRIMINATION-MODELING SESSIONS, AND OPERANT CONDITIONING WITH TASK-ORIENTED BEHAVIOR, (2) EXPOSURE TO DISCRIMINATION-MODELING SESSIONS, AND OPERANT CONDITIONING WITH NONTASK-ORIENTED BEHAVIOR, (3) EXPOSURE ONLY TO OPERANT CONDITIONING WITH TASK-ORIENTED BEHAVIOR, AND (4) NO EXPOSURE TO TREATMENT PROCEDURES.

RESPONDENTS TOTALED 1,018 (286 FOREIGN STUDENTS, 143 HOST FAMILIES, 376 AMERICAN STUDENTS, AND 213 AMERICAN FACULTY MEMBERS). AT THE SAME TIME, INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATORS, LABOR AND BUSINESS LEADERS, STAFF MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL ON WORLD AFFAIRS, AND OTHERS INVOLVED IN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS. AMONG  THE AREAS COVERED IN THE INTERVIEWS WERE (1) PERCEPTION OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENT PROGRAMS (OBJECTIVES, ROLES TO BE PLAYED BY PARTICIPANTS AND OTHERS), (2) SOCIAL INTERACTION BETWEEN FOREIGN STUDENTS AND AMERICANS (STUDENTS, FACULTY, CITIZENS, AND STAFF PERSONS IN INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS), AND (3) EVALUATION OF SERVICES AND PROGRAMS (BUSINESS, ACADEMIC, PROFESSIONAL, AND VOLUNTEER) IN THE HOST COMMUNITY. REPORTED WERE (1) THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE IN VARIOUS AREAS, (2) FINDINGS FROM STUDIES OF THE FOREIGN STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY ROLE, (3) PERSPECTIVES OF INSTITUTIONAL INTERACTION WITH FOREIGN STUDENTS AND PROGRAMS, (4) FACULTY ATTITUDES TOWARD FOREIGN STUDENTS AND INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION, AND (5) DECISION-MAKING AND PLANNING BY ADMINISTRATIVE  PERSONNEL FOR FOREIGN STUDENT PROGRAMS AND BROADER INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES. TWO OF THE CONCLUSIONS WERE THAT (1) FOREIGN STUDENTS INTERACT TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT WITH AMERICAN FAMILIES, BUT MOST FEEL COMMITTED TO RETURN TO THEIR NATIVE COUNTRIES AND (2) CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION AND EXCHANGE IS EMERGING IN ALL QUARTERS (STUDENTS, FACULTY, ADMINISTRATION, COMMUNITY PEOPLE, AND FOREIGN STUDENTS).
