        "description":"Selected studies that examine social interaction variables which affect the language young children use in social play are reviewed. Interaction variables discussed in major sections of the paper are (1) the nature of social play; (2) egocentrism and its impact on verbal communication; (3) language as a functional behavior; (4) adaptation of language to environmental demands; and (5) social play training for language production. Findings discussed are summarized at the end of each section. Studies selected for review are taken as representative of contemporary research and not as inclusive. It is concluded that the language of social play is a rich, viable and rapidly expanding area for investigation. The theoretical notion of linking social, language, and play behaviors through  their common intersect -- imaging --will result, it is believed, in an increasing amount of research knowledge regarding children's social play and related factors affecting the quality and quantity of communicative interaction in children's environments.

        "description":"Modification of mother-child instructional interaction was examined in relation to specific tasks and the age of the child. Thirty-two mothers taught their 6- or 8-year-old children one of two laboratory classification tasks resembling a home or a school activity. The home task involved putting grocery items on shelves in a mock kitchen, and the school task involved sorting photographs of common objects into a tray divided into brightly colored compartments. It was expected that mothers would compensate for the perceived difficulty of the school task for the younger children by providing greater instructional assistance to this group than to the other three groups (older children in either task and younger children in the home task). The instructional interaction was coded in  terms of number of directives, open-ended questions, and nonverbal instruction provided by the mother; involvement of the child; and the extent to which mothers rehearsed their children in preparation for the learning test which followed the instruction (the children were tested on their learning of the organization of items in the tasks). Multivariate analysis showed that the younger children in the school task received more instruction than either group of older children or the younger children in the home task. Univariate analysis showed this pattern to be significant for almost all of the instructional variables. This modification of instruction was accompanied by a slightly better performance on the learning task by the younger children in the school task than by children in the  other three groups.

        "description":"This paper concerns early social adaptational and family antecedents of teenage delinquent behavior in a population of black first graders who were reassessed 10 years after the initial study. Subjects were 705 teenagers who had participated in the 1966-67 Woodlawn study and whose mothers had given permission for reassessment. At the time of the reassessment, the community of Woodlawn had the highest rates of official juvenile delinquency, as measured by juvenile court data, of the 76 Chicago neighborhoods. Issues of particular interest for this reassessment study were (1) whether first grade ratings of learning problems and/or aggressiveness were related to later delinquency, and (2) whether first grade social adaptational status (SAS) was related to later delinquency in the  same way for males and females. Results showing relationships of first grade teacher ratings of shyness, aggressiveness, learning problems and relationships of family structure, aspects of family atmosphere (i.e., mother's expectations for her child's academic attainment and the mother's own psychological well-being), and family economic resources to teenage delinquency are reported. The information on delinquency in this study came from subjects' responses to items in &quot;What's Happening?&quot; -- a questionnaire that is a modified version of a validated delinquency scale developed by Gold (1970). A Rasch analysis of the items was performed separately for males and females to provide dependent and predictor variables. Then, log-linear models were used to analyze the data. Results are summarized  and discussed. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"An attempt was made to identify variables associated with black mothers in a high risk community who stayed on welfare, who moved off welfare, who moved on and off welfare, and who did not participate in welfare. Three kinds of variables were explored to explain such variations in welfare participation: (1) social origin characteristics, (2) social and personal characteristics, and (3) each woman's family situation. Data from interviews conducted in 1975 with 826 black women who had participated in the 1967 Woodlawn study of mothers or mother surrogates of first grade children are included in the present study. The 1975 interviews focused on the same four broad categories of information that had been studied in 1967, with the additional category of stressful events that might  have occurred to a family member since 1967. This report focuses on the mother's account of her own mental health, her activities, her values, and the family's socioeconomic and occupational circumstances, composition, religion, and activities. A six-item index of welfare status was constructed to provide an indication of the respondent's welfare dependency over time. Welfare status was cross-tabulated with various background, personal, and family characteristics to provide a descriptive analysis of welfare status. The multivariate impact of these characteristics on welfare status was subsequently examined. Results, indicating the importance of family type in influencing welfare status and the contradicting findings of the Moynihan Report (1965), are discussed. (Author/RH)",

The keynote address elaborates the thesis that day care programs should provide therapeutic care, particularly primary health care for ill children and staff, and assistance in obtaining secondary care. In subsequent panel discussions a college level course on health in early childhood education is described, a day care center's policy for providing health care is outlined, the role of the consulting physician is discussed, and ways of utilizing a family or pediatric nurse practitioner are suggested. Small group presentations focused on dramatizing a problematic interaction between day care and health professionals, how to recognize and  respond appropriately to developmental lag, how to use a medical record, and legal implications of health care for children in day care, including parental consent and child neglect and abuse. A report of a small group discussion provides a list of local resources for and barriers to providing health care services in day care centers.

The Child Development Committee of the Maternal and Child Health Section of the American Public Health Association (APHA) was established in October 1976 with the hope of responding to this challenging question. The Committee determined that one ideal index of accomplishment would be community support for quality day care and health services to preschool children and families. As the Committee identified barriers to delivery of these services, a clear priority emerged: the improvement of communication and cooperation between health care professionals and child care professionals. Among suggested strategies for increasing this inter-professional understanding, holding regional  multidisciplinary workshops was chosen as the most appropriate strategy. The first section of this volume describes the process by which the Committee identified and brought together the various existing resource groups to plan, fund, and produce the workshop. The second section presents evaluative comments and findings of follow-up contacts with state-level and local community representatives, with particular reference to workshop-induced changes or potential changes in the health care/day care relationships.

It is suggested that the synthesis may assist (1) needs-assessment for program planning and design, (2) development of information strategies or products for parents, and (3) implementation of parent education programs or program components. Descriptive research projects and intervention projects were included for dissemination because they were current and emphasized child development. Jointly, the 15 projects focus on two major areas of the needs domain (parent interests and problems), two external shaping factors (parent attitudes and values), and two resource elements (channels of information and  sources of informal and formal supports). The five demonstration or intervention projects sponsored by the Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) that were included in the synthesis all attempted to improve the level of parent knowledge. Concluding sections of the synthesis provide a table summarizing developmental tasks, needs, and crises of young parents, and a list of recommendations concerning parent influences on information, content areas for dissemination, appropriate amounts of information, and meeting the special needs of adolescent parents.

The sample consisted of 61 subjects: 20 kindergarteners, 20 third graders, and 21 seventh graders, with an equal number of boys and girls at each grade level except for the seventh grade, where there were 11 girls. Data were gathered in two interview sessions that usually took place in the same week. Measures administered in the first session included, in order, (1) an interview focused on the digestive  system and its functions, (2) the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, and (3) a drawing of the digestive process. Subjects were asked to draw a person at the end of the second session.

        "description":"Chicanos have won many legal battles which have resulted in school desegregation and the establishment of bilingual education programs. Although desegregation and bilingual programs are each expected to equalize educational opportunities, the two approaches differ on how children are grouped and managed. Desegregation aims to integrate groups, whereas bilingual programs often separate students of limited English proficiency for language instruction. Although results are mixed, some studies have found important advantageous effects resulting from both desegregation and bilingual programs. Nevertheless, the courts have tended to hand down desegregation remedies which require the dispersal of national-origin students and which undermine bilingual education programs. This has often  resulted in adverse effects on Chicano students and the community as a whole, and sometimes further polarized Chicano-Black relations. Survey data reveal that Chicanos support both approaches, but they are uncertain about the effectiveness of desegregation. Methods are proposed which can combine desegregation and bilingual education, whether or not a &quot;critical mass&quot; is maintained after Chicano student dispersal. Among these methods are that federal agencies work harder to clarify and enforce their desegregation and bilingual education guidelines and that the practical uses of survey research not be overlooked in the formation of local level educational policy.

        "description":"In 1977, an exploratory survey examined the relative effects of family and offspring cultural maintenance upon offspring psychological characteristics and college achievement, using the responses of 1,573 Chicano college students from Texas to a mailed questionnaire. The hypothesis was that holding family income constant, high family Spanish usage and/or high offspring Spanish fluency would result in higher offspring self-esteem, more ambitious socioeconomic plans, greater assuredness of achieving such plans, greater locus of control, and higher grades in college. A 41-page exploratory multipurpose questionnaire was developed to obtain data on the subjects' family income, Spanish usage in the home, Spanish fluency, self-esteem, educational and income plans, assuredness of  achieving plans, locus of control, and college grade-point average. Respondents ranged from 17 to 62 years of age, with the median age of 22. Path analysis data revealed that high family Spanish usage yielded both negative direct effects and positive indirect effects on the psychological and achievement characteristics of the offspring. The negative effects were partially offset or sometimes reversed when such homes promoted the bilingualism of children. However, it was an offspring's bilingualism which was a more consistent and stronger determiner in the production of positive effects. (NQA)",

        "description":"There is not any one thing or any one group that can solve all the problems involved in staffing rural and small schools. It is quite common to find a bimodel distribution of teaching faculty in rural and small schools--those with less than 3 years and those with more than 10 years of experience. It could be inferred that either recruitment strategies and hiring criteria are inappropriate, or there are factors that cause a sizable group to leave teaching in that district in the early years of their career. While the problems are not unique to rural schools, even one unfilled position in a rural school has a rather dramatic effect on the educational program and young people in that school. There are many intervening factors and little research in the area. These suggestions could  help: a national and state priority for development of qualified teachers for all schools should be established; teacher training institutions should establish identifiable programs for rural teaching; the profession should accept its responsibility for providing services to students regardless of their location; networks of persons in all job categories should be developed to reduce the feeling of professional isolation among rural and small school teachers.

Nonmetro Federal funding per capita reached $1,994 (87% of the metro level). The South received $172 billion in Federal funds, more than any other region and nearly a third of the $483 billion national total. The West received the most dollars on a per capita basis. While nonmetro counties improved their overall position between 1976 and 1979, the most dramatic changes occurred in the most rural counties. The biggest gains occurred in totally rural counties not adjacent to a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. Differences persisted between nonmetro and metro areas in  their reliance on types of programs. Nonmetro counties received a much larger share of their 1979 funds (40%) from income security programs, principally retirement and disability payments, than metro counties. Although nonmetro counties (except the very high counties) received nearly equal per capita funding, lower income nonmetro counties differed greatly in the programs that supported them. Human resources programs--education, health, and employment--accounted for the smallest portion of Federal dollars. Four tables and four figures illustrate the narrative. (BRR)",

Federal per capita funding remains unevenly divided among the regions; however, the advantage of the West and South may be moderating somewhat. The spread of some Federal programs into more rural counties may have helped reduce the nonmetro area funding deficit. Major differences remain in the way specific categories of programs are allocated. Nonmetro areas are behind urban areas in defense funding, but lead in community resources and agricultural programs. Poorer nonmetro counties are especially reliant on income security programs. The report is organized around several major themes: the changing roles of individual Federal  agencies; the types of programs providing Federal assistance; the allocation of dollars among regions of the country; the division of funds according to the income level of nonmetro counties; and the distribution of funds among metro and nonmetro areas.

        "description":"There has been growing recognition of the actual and potential contributions of women to the achievement of national development plans; in fact, national goals will not be met unless women become full participants in the process of social and economic development. Some attention has been focused on the potential of women's groups and indigenous non-governmental organizations working with women as valuable mechanisms for working with women and as resources for general development. Requests from indigenous women's groups to international or national women's groups and non-governmental organizations for assistance have grown, but the aid reaching them has not yet reached a critical mass which could lead to widespread impact. This paper's primary purpose is to explore the  possibilities for strengthening the capacity of women's groups and indigenous non-governmental organizations as a development resource. Part I examines invisible contributions of women to social and economic development and need for incorporating their concerns in development plans and programs (80% of African and 75% of Asian women are rural and poor, and are unreached by development assistance). Part II focuses on institutional rather than programmatic components of a strategy for change. Recommendations cover impact on women (4), policy relevance (6), and channels for assistance (6).

Change depends on the utilization of local learning systems of the society and women are most often the controllers and purveyors in these systems. Local learning systems provide linkage among &quot;what&quot; community development is, &quot;how&quot; it works in rural water supply projects, and &quot;why&quot; women must be included for project success and continuing community controlled growth and development. An operational framework (including technology, maintenance, local learning systems, and community participation) can be used to explain how community  participation works in specific rural water supply projects. The local learning system framework provides a design tool that indicates probabilities of success for different technologies, and an implementation tool that guides the type, amount, and direction of information through community participation techniques. The framework offers women the strength of their traditional power, and offers the community a design and implementation technique that recognizes the inviolability of their inherent control. (BRR)",

Growing documentation indicates that men disproportionately benefit from rural development programs, such as educational and training opportunities, job placement, capital and technology transfers, and land commoditization. Until women participate more extensively in politics at all levels, they will continue to be marginalized in the development process. Utilizing women's organizations is a strategy which offers unique advantages for responding positively to modernization. The document's  three part argument is drawn primarily from the scholarly and development practitioner literature. The first section reviews literature on women's participation in elite and mass politics and emphasizes rural women's organizational participation. The second section analyzes constraints on the organizational participation of women. The final section suggests policy implications in the areas of organizational strategies, employment/institutional strategies, and data collection. A 119-item bibliography concludes the document.

Students were given the Math-Related Decision Instrument, which measured the influential decision factors and the degree of influence of each variable; and the Group Embedded Figures Test, which determined cognitive style. Two-way analyses of variance  were used to determine if sex or ethnicity affected the score obtained on the cognitive style measure or the number of math courses a student planned to take in high school. Findings indicated that cognitive style was significantly related to both planned math participation and grades in mathematics; the more alienated a student felt the fewer math courses were planned; sex was a determining factor in a student's planned mathematics participation while ethnicity was not; and locus of control significantly affected the number of math courses a student planned to take.

Dependent variable was the number of pages submitted. The general prompt consisted of one-page flyers announcing the reward contingency with no reward amount given. Subject-specific prompts involved face-to-face or telephone contact to inform the subjects of the reward amount. The reward amount or the reward contingency was altered to increase the frequency of the target response. Once materials were remitted, checks were disbursed at various  intervals ranging from one to sixty days. Two subjects were also briefly interviewed to verify the effectiveness of the experimental manipulations and to assess the subjects' evaluation of the project. The general prompt was ineffective, but subject-specific prompts elicited a total of 38 pages of work. The importance of the findings is discussed in terms of the relationship of the target behavior to violent behavior, and the possible application of the technique to increase Hispanic utilization of public clinics.

Mental health literature regarding the intervention process involving Mexican American service recipients and treatment models developed for use with Mexican Americans is reviewed. A treatment team service approach that incorporates  clinical professionals and indigenous paraprofessionals in the delivery of a comprehensive range of community mental health services is proposed. The perceptions and attitudes of Texas community mental health center administrators and providers regarding the delivery of mental health services are explored. Underrepresentation of Mexican Americans at professional levels and the limited awareness of cultural treatment factors are discussed as indicators of the community mental health system's currently limited capacity to offer culturally relevant and linguistically appropriate services to Mexican Americans. Implications of offering bilingual/bicultural community mental health services are considered. (Author/NQA)",

Providing background material on patients' rights and advocacy in general, the first section includes a chronological history of major litigation, a discussion of patient advocacy, a discussion of a client's right to refuse treatment, and a legal perspective of patients' rights and advocacy. Focusing on patients' rights and advocacy for Mexican Americans in Texas, the second section includes a statement from the Commissioner of the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation regarding systemic concerns and a discussion of the citizen's or consumer's point of view. A 1981 workshop on Hispanic patients' rights and advocacy is  summarized. Interviews with 15 Hispanic therapists in Texas provide a perspective of the Mexican American service provider regarding the patients' rights movement's impact on Mexican American clients and identify issues arising from the uniqueness of the Mexican American experience in treatment. The concluding article delineates several assumptions predominating in mental health service delivery systems and in the patients' rights and advocacy movement that may be limiting the development of an Hispanic initiative.

        "description":"The past 22 years of research on the underutilization of mental health services by Mexican Americans are critically analyzed from conceptual and technical perspectives. While basic assertions of previous investigators that underutilization exists are correct, research concepts and methods used have been inadequate in relation to the issue's complexity. An overemphasis on numerical equivalence of usage rates across ethnic groups as an evaluative measure ignores the critical impact of differences between groups on factors such as need, accessibility, and the service's compatibility with the client's needs. A conceptual restructuring of the issue of service utilization as an evaluative measure is suggested. Endeavoring to minimize the problems identified in past research, community  mental health centers (CMHC) service use in Texas is examined, using the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation records to obtain data by age, sex, ethnicity, and the major types of service used for the 28 CMHCs operational in 1978. While statistically significant numerical underutilization of services by Mexican Americans is not as widespread as past research might have claimed, substantial evidence exists that Mexican Americans continue to underutilize services in relation to their need, especially children and youth. The underutilization among Mexican American children and youth is explored in relation to their future mental health needs. (Author/NQA)",

Historical analysis gives an overview of how the state has responded in the past and provides insight into the current nature of the state's involvement. Section III draws heavily on the Levittown decision and shows that a concern for problems that exist perhaps uniquely in rural schools is entirely consistent with the holding of the court.  Section IV addresses whether there are costs peculiar to operating schools in rural areas and presents results of early attempts to document existence of these costs. The report concludes with a discussion of policy implications. Definitions for rural schools are proposed as well as a series of policies which might be recommended by the Task Force as a means of more completely fulfilling the state's responsibility to students and taxpayers in rural areas of the state.

Each characteristic is examined in turn and discussion includes a rationale for expecting each characteristic to make a difference either for taxpayers or students. Two distinct types of burdens are addressed: the first type involves hardships that stem from whatever extra costs certain districts are forced to  incur in producing a given level and mix of educational outcomes, and the second type involves instances of the state's inaccurate determination of the school district's ability to pay for educational services. The report concludes with a discussion of policy alternatives considered in response to seven questions, e.g., should the state concern itself with the limited extent to which small districts cooperate for the purpose of providing educational services, and should the state make allowances for the current size of districts when it makes adjustments for declines in pupil enrollment?

        "description":"There are five basic types of rural communities as far as school issues are concerned; rural schools vary not only to the extent that they are small, but also according to the type of community in which they are located. &quot;Stable rural&quot; communities are our classic rural community--prosperous, peaceful, traditional, and mostly white. In &quot;depressed rural&quot; communities economic insecurity abounds, outmigration is high, local economy is often undeveloped, and there is a moderate to high minority population. The &quot;high growth rural&quot; community faces problems inherent in rapid growth: inadequate school facilities, housing, and services coupled with problems which existed before a &quot;boomtown&quot; came into being. &quot;Reborn rural&quot; communities attract a refugee population from the city seeking a  rural lifestyle; they are converts to that lifestyle, and they are zealous defenders of many traditional rural customs and institutions. &quot;Isolated rural&quot; communities have many characteristics of the other types, but isolation leads to separate problems (transportation, commerce, and cultural activities are all affected). Each rural type has its own set of strengths and problems. In order to improve rural schools, equal educational opportunity must be established and a strategy or combination of strategies most appropriate to unique local situations must be found. (AH)",

Freedom from thinking about routine calculations provides freedom for thinking about problem solving is the theme of Section Three. Articles in Section Four include some specific lesson ideas for using calculators in the classroom. Section Five focuses on programmable calculators. Section Six contains articles which consider ways in  which microcomputers can be introduced into schools, addressing physical, economic, and political issues. Section Seven explores implications of the computer on mathematics curricula, considering both new topics and new approaches to old topics (such as computer assisted instruction). Computer literacy is the theme of Section Eight, suggesting that although all students need to know about computers, \"what\" they need to know is debatable. The ability to simulate real-world events (computer simulations) is considered in the final section, suggesting that this ability opens new areas for mathematical exploration. (Author/JN)",

During the first summer (level 1), the students tour California. The next summer (level 2), they investigate colonial and revolutionary America by traveling throughout the eastern coast in a specially equipped van, Probe I. The final summer, (level 3) they use Probe II to scientifically explore a north central state, several mountain states, and parts of the Pacific Northwest. The six  characters have unisex names to emphasize their personal attributes rather than sex roles. Throughout their travels the youngsters encounter people working in a wide variety of careers.

(2) Are there sex differences in the performance of students on the van Hiele test, either at the beginning or end of the year? and (3) Are sex differences exhibited in the writing of geometry proofs? Subjects were 1392 boys and 1307 girls in 99 classes, grades seven through twelve, from 13 schools located in 5 states. Schools were chosen to include a variety of regions and socioeconomic groups, and the population included substantial black, Hispanic, and Oriental minorities. A proof-writing sample consisted of 1520 students in 74 classes which had studied proof and whose  teachers agreed to participate. Results indicated that boys were superior in content knowledge upon entering the geometry courses. Adjusting scores for this entering knowledge led to observation that girls were equally able to learn both geometry content and exhibit higher cognitive reasoning required in writing geometry proofs. Therefore, no sex differences in geometry achievement were found. (MP)",

During the Spring 1981, 8 fourth graders and 9 seventh graders were interviewed. The children were presented with graphs accompanied by six questions reflecting three levels of comprehension: &quot;reading the data,&quot;&quot;reading between the data,&quot; and &quot;reading beyond the data.&quot; The children approached the tasks of comprehension by employing text-/schema-based processing strategies, text-based processing strategies, and schema-based processing strategies. These three types of strategies led to both correct and incorrect responses. Most students were aware of the need for, and also used, a text-based strategy for &quot;reading the data&quot; directly  from the graph. Most seventh-grade and higher achieving fourth-grade students demonstrated the text/schema integration strategy successfully on problems. Seventh graders seemed to know when to rely on schema-based strategies, even when not required by the example, whereas fourth graders failed to note, process, and/or adjust for inconsistent information on a bar graph designed with numbers decreasing from bottom to top on the vertical axis.

Results show, in general, a high level of agreement between responses of high school and university students. High school biology came out as significantly more inquiry-oriented, incorporating more laboratory work and perceived as more helpful than either chemistry or physics in the study of the perspective science in the university.

The best-fitting distribution of fixation durations with a relatively simple theoretical justification consists of a mixture of an exponential distribution and the convolution of two exponential distributions. The eye movements themselves were found to approximate a random walk that fit rather closely in both adult and juvenile subjects; the motion postulated by the normative algorithm ordinarily taught in schools. Certain structural features of addition and subtraction exercises, such as the number of columns, and the presence or absence  of regrouping, are well known to affect their difficulty. In this study, regressions on such structural variables were found to account for only a relatively small part of the variation in eye-fixation durations. (Author/MP)",

In explicating the case, consideration is given to the need for information on classroom practices and the consequence of those practices on teaching and learning. Also considered is the need for research that addresses the problems of practice from the practitioner's perspective. Included is a discussion of the General Mathematics Project's evolution and tentative results. Some of those results are that teachers do teach general-math students differently from algebra students and that most teachers have unusual difficulty teaching general math and often feel only marginally or not at all successful.

        "description":"This research described the classroom implementation of a supplemental activities-based mathematics project designed for low-achieving students. The research describes the development of applied ethnographic methods for observing and describing the way programs are implemented using curriculum specialists, or resource teachers, to help teachers in the regular classroom to improve instructional services for economically disadvantaged minority students. A model for use by school district evaluators in conducting ethnographic evaluation studies was developed. The research consisted of ethnographic observations of mathematics lessons and student learning in nine classrooms in Grades 2 through 5 in eight schools serving low-income attendance areas. Observations were conducted over  approximately a five-week period by four trained ethnographic assistants. Observations were scheduled before, during and following the delivery of classroom services of Mathematics Project Specialists. Themes emerging from the study indicated that the predominance of classroom structure, the conditional nature of classroom teacher-resource teacher collaboration, teacher inservice, and teacher's evaluations of subsequent student achievement growth were key factors in program implementation. Ethnographic descriptions of mathematic classroom activity structures provided a number of insights into the contribution of mathematic games and other manipulative aids to the learning of low-achieving students. The final report is subdivided as follows: (1) Abstract, Executive Summary, Addendum; (2)  Part one, &quot;An Ethnographic Evaluation of Program Implementation&quot;; (3) Part two, &quot;Mathematics Learning of Low Achieving Students through Mathematics Games and Other Manipulative Aids&quot;; and (4) Part three, &quot;Eight Disaggregated Case Studies.&quot; (MP)",

From two sets of data which assessed memory capacity and cognitive processing capacities, six groups of children with different cognitive characteristics were identified. For a sample of 44, children in five classes at Grades 1, 2, and 3 were selected and interviewed as they worked a set of addition and subtraction problems. Each child was interviewed on three occasions. Each interview consisted of six tasks given under four of six conditions. Codes for three or four categories were assigned to each child's response: model used, correctness, strategy, error, and if incorrect.  These data were then summarized in terms of percent correct and general strategy. For both percent correct and strategy used, there were important variations due to problem set (size of number), to specific task, to instruction over time, and to grade. However, what is clear is that children who differ in cognitive processing capacity consistently performed differently regardless of the other important factors. (Author/MP)",

When children are given a simple word problem for which they have not learned the necessary algorithms, they are often able to derive a solution on their own. This report focuses on the child-invented processes pupils use on word problems that would normally be solved through use of an addition or subtraction algorithm. Much of the data comes from a three-year longitudinal study of about 100 first-grade pupils from one public and one parochial school in the Madison, Wisconsin area serving middle to upper-middle class neighborhoods. It was felt that invention was a rearrangement of elements into similar structures. The data suggested that  instruction has a bearing upon changes in invented behavior. Thus, any characterization of children's formal or invented mathematics concepts and procedures needs to consider the role of instruction. (MP)",

Empirical findings and theoretical models of research in physics problem-solving are detailed and summarized, followed by eight empirical studies indicating in general, the importance of differences in the knowledge bases of experts and of novices to their problem-solving success. Specifically, they show that: (1) it is difficult to use protocols of problem-solving episodes to illuminate the differences in the knowledge bases of experts and novices; (2) experts and  novices perceive the problems themselves differently (novices respond to surface features of a problem while experts respond to its deep structure); (3) less successful novices have deficiencies in their declarative knowledge of physics; (4) novices tend to lack knowledge of when to use certain physics knowledge; and (5) deficiencies in knowledge appear to prevent novices at times from making key inferences for solving problems. These results and their implications for theories of intelligence are then discussed. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"Students in grades 1, 4, 7, and 10 were tested in a two-part investigation of simple and complex mental addition (with college students as a reference point). One session involved a normal reaction time task in which children made true/false judgments about a series of addition examples. The other session involved a verbal protocol interview, the results of which are compared to the time-based results for an examination of children's mental addition performance. The hypothesized shift from counting to memory retrieval seemed to occur at about fourth grade, although older students continued to rely on immature processing for certain example types. A subgrouping of the fourth graders by mathematical ability was possible, yielding a strong effect on the reaction time measure.  (Author/MNS)",

The researchers drew upon information from three sources: individual results from a battery of 14 tests, an objective-referenced achievement test measuring a variety of arithmetic skills related to addition and subtraction, and coded strategy data for a set of verbal addition and subtraction problems administered in an interview setting. Eleven children starting third grade in Tasmania, Australia were involved in the study. The data suggested two notions: (1) there is a group of children who have the capacity to reason about quantitative problems, know the basic procedures of addition and subtraction, but see little reason to use those  algorithmic procedures to find answers to verbal problems; (2) there is a second group of children whose capacity to reason about quantitative problems is suspect: they do not know the basic procedures to addition and subtraction and have not acquired other skills like modeling or counting which would help them solve verbal problems. It is suggested that educators need to reexamine the relationships between the algorithm and its application. (MNS)",

Consequently all members affected by the conflict may participate in determining justice.&quot; Students must read a shortened  version of a folktale from the the mountainous African country of Ethiopia which demonstrates this African belief. Following the story is a series of questions which will test their understanding of the story. In another activity, students are presented with 11 personal incidents, all of which take place in West European cultures. Students must decide if each idea is consistent with the idea that Western European cultures place a high value on the individual and on individual achievement. (RM)",

        "author":["Banks, James A."],
        "description":"This paper reviews theories and research studies concerning prejudice and suggests strategies for reducing prejudice in students. The first half of the paper describes theories and research studies. A summary of Arnold M. Rose's critical analysis of the older, simpler theories of prejudice and of the more complex modern psychological explanations is presented. Simpson's and Yinger's comprehensive theory of prejudice is examined. Personality theories of prejudice which consider personality as the most important variable in the formation of bigotry are discussed and flaws are pointed out. Personality studies are described and social structure theories of prejudice are reviewed. The last half of the paper uses research results to suggest strategies for reducing prejudice in the  schools. For example, research indicates that visual materials such as pictures and films greatly enhance the effectiveness of attempts to change racial attitudes. Therefore, the author suggests that for a school intervention program to be successful, teachers must use multiethnic teaching materials that present ethnic minority groups in a favorable and realistic fashion. This is a micro approach to prejudice reduction. But because the school is an interrelated social system, each part of which shapes and influences the racial attitudes and behavior of students, the intervention program must also take a macro approach to reducing prejudice and be institutional and comprehensive in nature. Both the manifest and hidden curricula must be reformed. The paper emphasizes the need for an  interdisciplinary conceptual curriculum and for teaching multi-ethnic perspectives. (RM)",

The grade one treatment group experienced an integrated sociomusic curriculum taught by classroom teachers or instructional aides. The three control groups experienced separate subject instruction in music, social studies, and science taught by subject matter  specialists. All four groups were similar in terms of socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics and all four groups were administered the same achievement instrument.

For example, research strongly suggests that schools should begin emphasizing a global perspective during the elementary school years. Also, recent research asserts that the period from age 7 to 12 is optimal both for  education directed toward attitudinal objectives and for openness about the world. One article answers some commonly asked questions about global education--e.g. How can I tell if what we're doing now is global education?, and Doesn't global education mean increased costs?

Goals for a death education program include the following: to inform children of basic facts concerning the multidimensional aspects of death and dying; to enable individuals to be informed consumers of medical and funeral services; and to improve quality of life by considering personal values and priorities. Death education programs in elementary and secondary schools are not widespread, but they are increasing; college programs proliferated during the 1970's. The content in death education programs ranges from discussion of the death of a pet in kindergarten to study of human death, burial,  and bereavement in the upper grades. Death education, by its very nature, lends itself to a multidisciplinary approach. For example, students in the middle schools examine life cycles in nature; the human life cycle; and the biological, social-cultural, economic, and legal aspects of death. Content in high school and college programs is quite similar, with differences primarily in depth of treatment at the college level. Content at the college level covers such areas as suicide and dealing with dying. Death education programs lack a standardized set of concepts, terminology, and guidelines and have no established place in the curriculum. A number of concerns must be dealt with. For example, what teaching techniques and materials are appropriate for death education? Research in  implementing death education into schools and college programs is needed. (A bibliography is included which lists print materials and audiovisual materials on the topic of death.) (Author/NE)",

        "description":"Children aged 10-14 need to assume responsible and challenging roles as part of their adolescent development. Based on the physical, social, moral and ethical, and emotional developmental characteristics of this age, adolescents need to discover and test new skills; develop a sense of competence; socialize to develop close friendships; take part in the world of adults; test a developing morality and value structure in authentic situations; and know that they can speak and be heard, that they can make a difference. Adolescents can accomplish much more than is usually assumed by participating in actual programs in which they take such roles as community problem solvers, peer tutors, museum guides, and hospital interns. For example, a community service program in a Long Island  middle school is a successful youth participation program in action. For 10 weeks a group of seventh graders spend one morning a week as teachers in a local Head Start program. They have responsibility for designing and conducting the lesson, gathering materials, and evaluating their accomplishments. Although there are issues and barriers as teachers and administrators seek to initiate and manage youth participation programs, the rewards are worth the efforts as the resources of this early adolescent group are tapped.

Perspectives are defined and profiles of the student teacher observed. The study focuses on three questions: What conceptions of social studies did these student teachers hold at the start of their field experience semester? What were their perspectives toward social studies during their student teaching experience? and What factors influenced the development of these perspectives? The four student teachers were chosen from an elementary teacher program at a large midwestern university through recommendations of professors and the use of an inventory designed to determine students' views on teaching issues. Data were  collected over three months from a series of at least four observations in the social studies classroom, six personal interviews, an interview with the cooperating teacher, and results from several instruments. Conclusions drawn from the study showed student teachers' perspectives of social studies teaching cannot be understood separately from their perspectives on teaching and learning in general and the goals they set for themselves and their class. Also, each student teacher defines his or her student teaching situation in a particular way. An implication of the study is that research on teaching should focus on what teachers think and how this interacts with their teaching behavior. (Author/NE)",

The first two sections of the publication contain background papers and reaction statements to them. Topics include theoretical assumptions in  the recent development of Australian education; sociological, political, demographic, and economic perspectives of Australian society in change; and changing educational emphases for the 1980s. The third section contains the papers presented at the conference. Topics discussed include social influences on British education, the future of formal education, the educational consequences of youth unemployment, education for a complete life, and the implications of societal change for educational research and curriculum. A list of conference participants is included. The publication concludes with an index. (RM)",

        "author":["Colman, Rosalie M."],
        "description":"The salad bowl concept is discussed and the increasing importance of teaching English as a second language (ESL) is examined in this paper. When melting pot theory failed to preserve the values of cultural creativity and diversity of America's many immigrant groups, a new and better idea was born--the notion of the salad bowl. This concept implies that each individual from a different cultural background is encouraged to retain his or her own uniqueness while adding special flavors to enhance the whole. The salad is made richer by the number and variety of its ingredients. The ingredients in the vast salad bowl must have the \"dressing.\" All U.S. citizens must be able to communicate in English as well as their mother tongues. English as a second language cannot simply be poured  over the top of the salad. American English is a difficult language and requires time to learn. The dilemma is how to obtain the expertise needed to instruct the many new people who continue to come here and to find the funds needed to support this vital work. Educators have made much progress in two areas: (1) teaching Americans to recognize the value of international understanding based on language fluency, and (2) methods and techniques for teaching ESL. The most effective ESL teachers are the people who have themselves learned a second language. Regarding teaching methods for ESL, eclectic approaches drawn from methods such as the grammar-translation method, the audio-lingual method, and the functional-notional method seem to be the best procedures presently known. ESL teaching has  become so critical that many colleges and universities have begun special programs to prepare ESL educators. (RM)",

In the spring of 1977, 9 men and 12 women between the ages of 20 and 50 from the greater Hartford and Storrs area in Connecticut participated in this case study. The males interviewed included five graduate students, three undergraduates, and one government scientist. Three of the women had professional status, four were housewives with a Korean college education, one was the owner of a private buiness, and four of the women had very little formal education. The main questions were: How do you perceive your life in America? How are you doing with your job? and How do you perceive human and family relationships, marriage, sex role issues, education, and government in America? Results include the  following. Almost all described America as the country where they can remain individuals without any mental pressure from the outside and without having to conform to expected norms and behaviors. All said Americans are kind and friendly toward strangers. Most expressed the feeling that parent-child relationships in America seemed distant, cold, and self-centered. About half said they disapprove of the way in which marriages break up in America. All were pleased with the educational system and voiced positive attitudes toward the American government. Most had difficulty accepting the concept of equality of the sexes and the mingling of sex roles. (RM)",

        "description":"This study examined the antecedents and consequences of stress encountered by junior high school teachers in their roles as organization members, with the school system as the employment setting. Chapter I presents an overview of the study and its four major objectives: (1) to determine organizational precursors of work-role stress among teachers; (2) to determine whether work-role stress produces distancing forces in teachers; (3) to examine the physiological, psychological, and behavioral consequences of work-role stress; and (4) to examine the impact of work-role stress on the effectiveness of teachers' functioning. In Chapter II, forms of role stress are identified as role conflict, role ambiguity, role overload, and role insufficiency. The environmental, organizational,  interpersonal, job-related, and intrapersonal precursors of role stress are examined, and the consequences of role stress are explored. Chapter III offers discussions on sources of stress that operate specifically within a school setting. Stressors in the areas of the school environment, the school organization, and the classroom are considered. The fourth chapter describes the research design and methodology used in the study, including selection of the sample, instrument design, data collection, and analysis specification. In Chapter V, profiles of some teachers under high and low stress are presented, and an analysis is given of the circumstances in their lives and work environments that contribute to the stress they exhibit. Chapter VI offers discussions on methodological and  substantive issues that emerged from the study. Chapter VII presents implications of the study for school administrators, teachers, and teacher educators, and the eighth chapter summarizes the study. References and some materials used in the study are appended. (JD)",

        "description":"An exploratory study was conducted during 1979 and 1980 to determine how Ohio teacher education institutions were responding to the state's newly implemented Standards for Colleges or Universites Preparing Teachers. The study's purpose was to provide an overview of two curricular areas addressed in the standards: human relations and managing behavior problems. Administration and faculty members at Ohio's 48 teacher education institutions were interviewed and completed a questionnaire. Teacher education students were also interviewed as an informal part of the study. The questionnaire focused on: (1) the extent to which each institutions' curriculum included a selected set of human relations and behavior management concepts; and (2) how the institutions modified their teacher  education programs to accommodate the new standards. Most of the institutions complied with the standards by adding new courses, particularly in the area of human relations. There was agreement among teacher educators that human relations concepts such as &quot;understanding self&quot; and &quot;working with others&quot; are important for teachers to study. In the area of behavior management, on the other hand, emphasis was placed on specific skills that prospective teachers need for effective classroom management, rather than on theory and concepts. There was least agreement among faculty on the importance of group problem solving skills. Most teacher education students were satisfied with their training. (FG)",

        "description":"A qualitative study of women elementary school teachers focused on the teachers' values, attitudes towards teaching, and how they negotiated their work interest with sex role and family expectations. Formal and informal interviews with teachers, administrators, and parents were conducted over a seven month period. Three perspectives provided the basis for the research: (1) sociology of occupations, which recognizes the importance of work to self-identity; 2) symbolic interaction, a phenomenological construct that assumes that behavior is significantly affected by its setting; and (3) feminism, which, in the research context, attempts to remove men as a measure of behavior. The teachers perceived a high degree of autonomy in their work, especially as compared with practices in  other schools in their district. They felt that their principal respected and trusted them. However, two limitations caused frustration and anger. Frequently, bureaucratic problems forced teachers to contrast their ideals of service and professionalism with their treatment in the school district system. The second major limitation was the behavior of parents and their image of the teachers' role, both of which, the teachers felt, threatened the teachers' authority. Two important issues in teacher behavior and attitudes that must be considered as a result of these findings are how the structure of schools affect teachers' career patterns and the hostile feelings of women teachers toward mothers of their students.

        "author":["Duryea, Elias J."],
        "description":"This study investigated the efficacy of using inoculation theory in developing students' skills in resisting pressures involved with drinking and driving situations. Inoculation theory stems from psychosocial investigations that have demonstrated that resistance to specific opposing arguments can be increased if subjects are familiar with these arguments. The study sample was comprised of 155 ninth grade students who participated in instructional sessions that included films, question-answer sessions, role-play exercises, and a slide show. Each of these sessions familiarized students with physiological effects of alcohol and persuasive arguments people use to convince others to engage in risky alcohol-related practices (i.e., riding with drinking drivers). Role-play exercises  taught students the content and aim of these persuasive arguments, gave them practice in refuting such arguments, and provided feedback on their refutations. Phase 1 of the inoculation treatment is based on the assumption that, in general, most students demonstrate varying degrees of resistance to different types of persuasive pressures. Phase 2 proposes that, while students are learning about threatening arguments and practicing effective refutations, their level of resistance is high. Although such resistance may still fluctuate, it generally remains strong. Phase 3 illustrates the potential impact of a &quot;sleeper effect&quot; upon subjects following inoculation treatments. It is proposed that, with time, a person who has been inoculated against a threatening argument will come to think of  even more refutations to these arguments. Research results suggest that the inoculation approach is compatible with the goals and objectives of preventive alcohol education. (JD)",

However, it is rarely the subject of research or of materials for preservice teachers, partly because of the delicacy of the subject, as well as the difficulty of the researcher's obtaining highly guarded personal information. A five-year study with 11 beginning secondary school teachers provided an opportunity to examine teachers' positive and negative feelings toward their students. During the study, it was noted that teachers were more likely to express dislike or hostility toward individual students than feelings of affection. In the fifth year of the study, teachers were asked direct questions about their feelings of attraction for certain students and about their experiences and techniques  for dealing with student crushes. Teachers mentioned touching as a natural part of their interaction with students, although men teachers reduced eye contact and touching with female students to avoid suggestions of undue interest. Teachers described their own flirtatious behavior as well as their parental feelings toward students. Research into affectionate relationships between teachers and students, or affectionate research, should be accomplished through longitudinal studies by dedicated, caring researchers. (FG)",

Fifteen teachers participated in the study by taking an inservice course on classroom management and discipline. Two modules of classroom management behaviors were taught. The first module consisted of group alerting behaviors, including questioning techniques, recitation strategy, and alerting non-performers that they may be called upon to recite; the second module demonstrated teacher behaviors that encourage \"withitness\" in the students, including desisting from off-task behavior, describing desirable behavior, suggesting alternate behavior, and praising non-deviant behavior. For each  module, both positive and negative behaviors were introduced to the inservice teachers, and, after completing the overview, the subjects practiced identifying the specific behaviors on transcripts of actual classroom interaction. The group observed a film of a class in which the teacher demonstrated the behaviors in the module. Teachers were asked to identify and label the behaviors as they were used. Following the film, there was a discussion of the behaviors. Teachers were observed in their classrooms immediately following completion of the modules, and two observations were made three and six weeks later. Findings indicated that, while the teachers used newly learned behaviors immediately following the training sessions, long-term changes in behaviors were difficult to determine.  (JD)",

Three aspects of planning were found directly related to this sort of collaboration. First, the teacher reflected upon what she knew about her students, individual and group responsibility objectives, content objectives, and resources. Second, the teacher and pupils planned objectives and activities together. Third, the teacher considered the probability of individual student success. Other key learning community characteristics identified from this study were task and objective monitoring systems, heterogeneous grouping, individual  responsibility, and group responsibility for learning. The teacher was conscious of her belief that the primary function of schooling was personal responsibility (evidenced by academic learning) and social responsibility (evidenced by students helping others to learn). The teacher used information gained during collaborative planning sessions to help determine actual objectives for individual pupils. A description is presented of the teacher's mental assessment and planning prior to the collaborative planning sessions, the teacher and pupil collaborative planning sessions, and a study episode which resulted from the planning. Implications of and suggestions from this study for teacher educations are discussed. (JD)",

Articles were  categorized as: (1) experimental (articles in which the independent variable was manipulated so that change in the dependent variable could be measured); (2) quasi-experimental (articles in which comparisons between groups were made but there was no random assignment of subjects to experimental and comparison groups); (3) nonexperimental (articles which were descriptive or historical in nature but did not compare groups); and (4) philosophical or theoretical (any article which described a procedure, occurrence, or school of thought without statistical verification). Results indicated that the seven journals similarly reported the information evaluated by the instrument. It appeared that the statement and significance of the problem seemed to be understated in the articles analyzed, while  the sampling procedures, population definition, and the adequacy of the measuring instruments used were satisfactorily addressed.

Four areas are indicated in which regular classroom teachers need training for teaching handicapped children: classroom management, participatory decision making, knowledge of legal procedures, and dealing with human relations and attitudes. Policies on responsibilities of regular classroom educators are based on selected sections in the law that define: (1) the handicapped child; (2) special education and related services; (3) least restrictive environment; (4) supplementary aids and services; and (5) existing federal inservice  education policies. Implications for inservice education are noted, and a concluding statement is offered. The development of the policy interpretation is also described. (FG)",

The model consists of seven time-specific phases and four generic activities that apply to each of the phases. The time phases are: (1) preliminary planning; (2) needs assessment; (3) goal and objective setting; (4) task, activity, and resource determination; (5) implementation; (6) outcome evaluation; and (7) recycling. Throughout each phase, coordination, legitimation/support, evaluation/reprogramming, and decision recording activities are continuous. Action steps are delineated for each of the phases, breaking the tasks down as quality indicators for evaluation. Recommendations by the National Inservice Network (NIN), a linkage agency that exchanges information about inservice  programs for regular educators of mainstreamed children, call for dissemination of the inservice model and action steps and urge its use by state and local educational planners.

Female high school students in basketball, tennis, and track and field used a self-peer measurement technique to rate competitiveness and skill. Coaches' ratings of student competitiveness and skill were also obtained. For both criterion variables, coaches' skill rating was found to be the best predictor variable. Self-peer rating was an important predictor of self-peer competitiveness rating but was not a strong predictor of coaches' rating of competitiveness. Of the motive scales, power contributed most significantly to the prediction of both criterion variables. Fear of failure was a good  predictor variable for coaches' ratings of competitiveness but was not a good predictor of self-peer rating. The achievement motive was not a good predictor of either criterion. These results are consistent with a previous study of male university athletes. Discrepancies were found in both studies between athletes' self perceptions and coaches' perceptions of competitiveness and skill. (FG)",

        "author":["Zeichner, Kenneth M."],
        "description":"In an inquiry-oriented teacher education program, prospective teachers are encouraged to examine the origins and consequences of their actions and settings in which they work. Many of the characteristics of the elementary student teaching program at the University of Wisconsin at Madison are similar to this approach. During the students' 15-week field experience program, taken concurrently with a weekly half-day seminar, students conduct field-based inquiries under the direction of supervisors who are graduate students. The primary purpose of the seminar is to broaden students' perspectives and have them engage in reflective analyses of everyday occurrences. Students are encouraged to adopt a critical posture toward both the university and the school components of the field  experience and to examine and debate issues and problems from diverse and multiple perspectives. Once in a work setting, the inquiry-oriented approach can help alleviate teacher stress caused by a sense of loss of control over professional responsibilities. This \"deskilling\" process can be halted by empowering teachers with the ability to reflect upon, confront, and change job-embedded and structural sources of discomfort. At the University of Wisconsin, the inquiry-oriented approach has required that pedagogy and classroom practices exemplify the quality of inquiry that is sought. Consequently, student teachers, cooperating teachers, supervising graduate students, and faculty are playing an increasingly greater role in determining the direction of their program. (FG)",

It was believed that the use of the two-test design would help to establish the validity of past and future tests of this nature. The between-subjects design group consisted of 48 first grade children who were required to make a series of catches using one ball size (6 inch, 8.5 inch, or 10 inch diameter). Each of the children on the within-subjects group received a total of 12 trials, catching all three ball sizes in random order. Since the initial analysis showed a significant trials effect as the subjects adapted to the task, data were modified to reduce this effect. Subsequent analyses showed that the only  significant interactions in the between-subject design situation was between the size of the ball and the gender of the subject. For the within-subjects design group, only the main effect of the ball size was significant. The 10 inch diameter ball resulted in more successful catching than the 6 inch ball. The two design types appeared to be interchangeable in the paradigm. (FG)",

        "description":"A composite model of exemplary inservice education, derived from a selection of comprehensive sources and basic references in the field, is described. In examining best practice statements, differentiation was made between three domains of inservice. The procedural domain includes chiefly political questions of control, support, and delivery of inservice activities. Within the substantive domain, criteria for deciding issues are technical (In what manner and sequence will needed skills be taught?). Philosophical questions lie within the conceptual domain (What are the purposes of inservice education?). Discussion is presented of the areas within each of these domains where researchers and practitioners have reached a consensus of the best practices for designing, developing, and  delivering successful inservice programs. Under the procedural domain, best practices statements prescribe that: (1) Decision-making should be an authentic collaboration of inservice clients, providers, and relevant constituencies; (2) Incentives for participating in inservice programs should emphasize intrinsic professional rewards; (3) Inservice programs should be explicitly supported at the outset by district and building administrators; (4) Outside agencies/consultants may be helpful in support roles; (5) Implementation strategies should include continual professional growth activities and the local development of materials within a framework of collaborative planning; (6) The design of inservice programs should be complex and ambitious; (7) Inservice programs should be planned in  response to assessed needs; (8) Inservice trainers should be competent; (9) The school site should be the locus of inservice activities; and (10) The evaluation of inservice should be a collaborative venture whose primary purpose is to assist with planning and implementing programs. Best practices in the substantive domain stated that: (1) The content of inservice should be derived from assessed needs; (2) Inservice content should be directed toward changing teaching, not student behavior; and (3) The process of inservice education should model good teaching. Conceptual domain best practices included: (1) Inservice education should follow a developmental, not a deficit model; and (2) Inservice should be an integral part of the total school program. (JD)",

        "description":"The purpose of this planning guide is to assist state, local, and university personnel involved in the design, development, and evaluation of staff development or other areas of school improvement. It represents a compilation of the learnings from the National Inservice Network's project work in Colorado, Indiana, and Maine from 1978-1981. Each state designed a statewide planning process or model to assist local administrators and teachers of regular and special education to come together to plan, implement, and exchange staff development activities. Fundamental to the planning process was local ownership, problem solving, ongoing structures, resources, and collaboration. This guide provides information on strategies that may be used in team development, needs assessment, program  development, program evaluation, and implementation. Sections contain information on concerns of users of this guide about: (1) the model; (2) principles that form the basis for the model; (3) goals of the model; (4) users of this model; (5) needs that are addressed in the planning process; (6) other purposes that are served by the planning process; (7) requirements for implementing the model; (8) how local agencies are identified and selected; (9) kind of training needed for a core training team; (10) how participants are identified and selected to be part of the local planning team; (11) instructional topics and strategies used; (12) how instructional sessions are provided; (13) what follows planning; (14) what is needed to implement and maintain the plan; (15) how the model is  evaluated; and (16) how the effort might be funded.

These criteria are organized into two areas, administration and the school nurses' role in the program. Considered under administration are district policies, written goals and objectives, personnel, facilities, responsibilities of principals, staff development activities, and student and family responses to the program. Criteria included for evaluating the school nurses' role are duties of health service  personnel in and out of the school, procedures for evaluating and reviewing student health, providing health counseling to students, teachers, and parents, maintaining a safe school environment, and provisions for annual program evaluation.

The study focuses on how individual student teachers develop perspectives toward teaching and interpret school experiences. Individual case histories are presented, based on interviews with the student teachers and their cooperating and supervising teachers, questionnaires, and classroom observations conducted over a five-month period. Factors other than setting and personality--specific events and people--influenced student teachers' views. Although actions of the three student teachers were similar at times, due to school-designed practices, the student teachers developed divergent perspectives based on their unique  perceptions. Comparisons and analyses are made, and implications for teacher education are discussed. (Author/FG)",

The study investigated differences in: (1) experienced and novice teachers' reports of cue influence during interactive instruction; (2) actions evoked by cues; (3) goals pursued; and (4) associations between categories of cues and actions. Stimulated recall data were collected from three experienced and five novice teachers during small group instruction settings at a university laboratory school. Results showed that, while both experienced and novice teachers attended to the same number of cue categories, experienced  teachers used twice as many kinds of instructional actions and considered a greater variety of goals while exhibiting more complex associations between cue and action categories. Novices were less likely to incorporate spontaneous student input related to lesson content and attended to cues from individual students rather than cues from the group as a whole. The classification scheme for analyzing teacher decision making is presented in the appendix. (Authors/FG)",

Research on the link between teacher behavior and student learning and attitudes is addressed in the first section, followed by a section discussing resulting policy implications for providing basic skills instruction and an effective learning environment. Research topics discussed include: (1) teacher expectations and role definitions (2) importance of student time on task; (3) value of active instruction from a teacher; (4) need for flexible teacher behavior; and (5) feasibility of teacher-student matching. Limitations on applying this reseach are noted, particularly the use of  approaches derived from classical learning theory and its basis in nonclassroom settings. The relevance and potential applications of recent research on student motivation is examined in the next section. Research topics considered are: need theory, reinforcement theory, relevance of education to the needs of students, attribution theory, and building intrinsic and continuing motivation in students. Recommendations which are made for teacher education in the final section would affect entry standards and accountability and preservice and inservice education programs.

The inquiry audit process is composed of the audit trail and the audit procedure. The documentation for a naturalistic audit trail incorporates a reflexive journal and a detail of procedures. The audit procedure consists of several basic steps. These include the decision to do the audit; acquisition of the  inquirer's report and all portions of the audit trail; determination of documentation sufficiency; comparison of procedures to problems addressed; comparison of raw data to written narrative; description of comparison results; noting changes in methods of deployment of personnel and judgments about context and problem; noting whether inferences flow logically from data; and certification of findings in final report.

Replication of results was possible for eight different tests (reading and mathematics, across four grade levels). The Kansas Competency Based Tests in reading and mathematics were administered statewide to students in grades two, four, six, and eight. Performance standards for judging minimal competency were to be set at each grade level for each tested area. Students were rated for competence by their teachers on a four point scale. The judges' classifications of students into different competency categories defined &quot;known groups&quot; which provided the basis for setting performance standards. The Borderline group method and three variations of the Contrasting groups technique focus on  making judgments about individual test takers. The data collected support the inconsistency of available standard setting methods in producing equivalent score standards.

The Multidimensional-Multiattributional Causality Scale was administered to a total of 684 college students from India, Japan, South Africa, Yugoslavia, and the United States. There were significant differences between males and females across all five countries for achievement attributions to task, and for the internal/external dimension. The differences for  attributions to ability, effort, and luck, as well as for the stable/unstable dimension, were not significant. All these differences were generally small, and so may not be meaningful. Gender differences appeared to be stronger in the affiliation than in the achievement domain. (Author/BW)",

A unit capable of measuring and assuring the effectiveness of several programs and projects either operating or proposed was desired. The Department responded to requests to implement program evaluations. Many requests were from program administrators who needed formative and summative evaluations. It was necessary for the superintendent and his cabinet to develop and approve a policy statement relative to program evaluation. Three key points include: program evaluation was separate from program administration; results were reported to the superintendent, his cabinet, and program administrators; and financial support was provided through the program budget. The director of the Program Evaluation  Bureau reported to the associate superintendent of Research and Development. The organizational structure was conducive to the ordered growth of program evaluation as it assumed additional responsibility; supported program evaluation with data and research bases, as well as computing and dissemination power; and provided it with access to the decision makers. The unit was staffed with professionals trained and experienced in program evaluation. It was established in 1980 and seems to have a bright professional, as well as funding, future. (DWH)",

The program addresses four areas of activity: provision of training and technical assistance; research, development, and training for interpretation and use of the Standards; dissemination of information related to the standards; and revision of the Standards as needed. Critiques of the Standards appeared in the May 1981 issue of &quot;Evaluation News.&quot; A content analysis of these critiques yielded both positive and negative comments in four areas: content, rationale,  structure, and use. Further work on the content of the Standards should address the trade-offs among them, the use of needs assessment in evaluation, and audiovisual training materials. Dialogue among various standard-setting groups would further develop the Standards' rationale. The structure of the standard-setting process could be improved by expanding the Committee membership. The use of the Standards in field tests should be encouraged. (BW)",

        "description":"The dimensions of educational evaluation include conceptualization and technology of evaluation. The methods have been drawn from the area of educational and psychological research. The techniques of evaluation need to serve the information needs of clients, address the central value issues, deal with situational realities, meet requirements of probity, and satisfy needs for veracity. Many researchers have developed new methodology. There is a need to alert evaluators to the availability of new techniques. They should be encouraged to try out and report the results of new techniques, as well as developing new methods. The methodology must fit the needs of education. The application of evaluation was identified as a problem area because there is often insufficient staff and  resources to implement systematic evaluation. There is an inability to prevent corruption by political forces. Most of an institution's evaluation efforts tend to be committed to satisfying external requirements for evaluation while ignoring internally based needs. Professional support for evaluators has strengthened and there has been substantial progress in the professionalization of educational evaluators. The analysis of educational evaluation illustrates the need to improve research, training, and financial support for this profession. (DWH)",

The research review is conceptualized as a scientific inquiry involving five stages paralleling those of primary research. Problem formulation is the stage when variables are defined conceptually and operationally. In the data collection stage, an inquirer must decide on the population of elements that will be the referent for the inquiry. Critical judgments about the quality of data points occur during data evaluation. Data collected by the researcher are synthesized into a unified statement during analysis and interpretation. Presentation of the review in a public document is the final stage. One study asked reviewers to integrate  literatures that vary in findings and operational homogeneity of their studies. Some were requested to make formal judgments of research quality. The other study manipulated literature size, findings, and the reviewer's analytic interpretation strategy. The dependent variables in both studies were reviewer perceptions about the tested hypotheses and recommendations for future research. (DWH)",

The process of identification includes referral, assessment, staffing and placement. The number of children identified as PCD by current procedures is large and growing. Variations in the prevalence of PCD among units and across years suggest the existence of local patterns in identification, and reflect the fact that PCD is an ambiguous diagnosis. Colorado's definition of PCD is conceptually similar to the federal definition of specific learning disabilities, characterized by a significant discrepancy between ability and achievement, attribution of the cause of the discrepancy to a processing disorder, and exclusion of other causes for poor  achievement. During assessment, the typical child is given 6.6 tests plus several informal assessments by an average of 7.6 professionals. Of the 18 most frequently used tests, only five are adequate. Between 59 percent and 74 percent of pupils identified as PCD do not match the legal definitions. These identification procedures do satisfy state and federal requirements, but it costs almost as much to identify a child as PCD as it does to treat him or her for a year. (Author/BW)",

The rationale for block grant programs, the advantages and disadvantages, and the basic forms of evaluation and accountability in the law are presented. Within the impact and future directions of evaluation, concern is whether the lack of specificity in block grant legislation is not a deliberate attempt to divest federal funding for education when authorization ends in  1987.

The evaluator should be an impartial observer who considers the program and research context. Guidelines for the evaluation report include form, brevity, technical language, and type of presentation.

The NLS quality control process begins with editing each returned questionnaire to determine if certain key items are answered and if responses are consistent. If the respondent failed to properly answer these key items, the questionnaire fails edit and the respondent is contacted by telephone. The purpose of this study was to determine why so many NLS questionnaires fail edit (over 60 percent of the third follow-up survey). Five general conclusions should be emphasized: (1) though subgroup differences were found, their magnitude is too small for concrete recommendations for survey practice; (2) the majority of edit  failure problems associated with itemized financial questions revolve around the respondents' failure to supply answers to each of the requested line items; (3) items structured as &quot;check all responses that apply&quot; are likely to be failed by a substantial number of respondents; (4) reflexive items have a realizable potential for reducinq respondent burden where repetitive information is required; and (5) overall data entry errors were low except for items requiring itemized financial information.

However, during the transition, many smaller decisions must be made. The first is a determination that the old test is useless. A new test must be selected and money for its purchase secured. All staff concerned should be notified of the change. The curriculum should be reviewed before the new test is selected. Criteria and prerequisites must be updated. Changes in norming dates and test content need to be considered as well as revised forms and  procedures. New reports should be designed for test scores. Staff must be trained in the use of the new instrument. Longitudinal comparisons should be resolved. The processing and scoring system should be redesigned. Old materials should be completely discarded and security measures should be prepared so that the access to tests is limited. Effective planning and a successful transition can occur if these lesser decisions are anticipated. (DWH)",

It is necessary to determine when an inconsistency is an error and when it is an explainable anomaly.

Evaluation is defined as a process for facilitating decision making. A decision making situation occurs when there are options which are impossible to treat equivalently, and there is an impact in the selection of one option that extends beyond the choice-making act. The most important motivating force for evaluations is the impact factor. Values and valuing play a significant role in evaluation. Therefore, they are defined and discussed in detail. Value is context determined. Value is the noun form applied to a class of quality; while the verb form, to value, refers to an internal state or exchange action. The evaluation process would be  better understood if researchers concentrated on the verb sense to value. Value and value systems determine what we value, how we know what to value, and the logic and process for problem solving. (DWH)",

Standard item analysis included the percentage of students passing and correlation coefficients. The second analysis was based on a technique used in designing the New Jersey College Basic Skills Placement Test. Each question was described as a function of the probability of a correct response for students at five ability levels as defined by total test scores. A difficulty curve  for each item resulted which allowed the instructor to see if the question discriminated equally well among students at each ability level or whether the item presents problems only to students in a particular ability range. Test items with identical correlations with total test scores often yielded different difficulty curves. Difficulty curves with several different slope types were analyzed as a function of the syntactic \"frame\" of the question. (Author/DWH)",

        "description":"National Assessment of Educational Progress data in reading, mathematics, and science for Caucasian children were analyzed. Using regression analysis for three age groups, nine, thirteen, and seventeen year olds, a trend analysis was plotted. The changing achievement relationships between these students relative to their classmates and their age of entry into first grade were studied. The data indicated superior performance for classes with an older combined mean age. The age of entry into first grade proved to be a critical factor in achievement levels. The authors suggest changing entrance cutoff dates from December, January, or February to September, October or November. Since achievement varies between boys and girls, separate cutoff dates were proposed. Clinical screening of  students is recommended for critical male and female groups. Teachers' awareness of high risk ages might lead to multi-level instruction. Inadequate readiness is a potentially serious threat to a child's academic career. However, children whose entrance is delayed, although they might have been able to cope, may cause problems as restless high school seniors.

The report analyzes participant selection procedures, describes program participants, and examines program impacts for 1980-81. Achievement levels of Project Concern students, compensatory education students in Hartford Title I validated schools, and students in the general Hartford district are compared. The following findings are presented: 1) the random student selection process initiated in 1966 evolved into a parent volunteer procedure in 1980-81; 2) academic achievement levels of program entrants between  1977 and 1980 appeared high relative to Federal and State compensatory education participant selection guidelines and were higher than the levels of other Hartford Title I students; 3) reading and mathematics achievement gains after Project Concern participation were higher in some grades and lower in other grades as compared to achievement gains of general Hartford school students and of Title I students; and 4) school attitudes of Project Concern participants were positive. It is recommended that changes in the nature, goals, and selection procedures of Project Concern be considered, and that past program budgets be reviewed for consistency with funding source regulations.

        "description":"Psychology students at the University of Minnesota were studied for the effects of different interventions on test anxiety and the academic performance of students with debilitating test anxiety. One group of students received peer tutoring and training in the use of study skills; a second group received training in cue-controlled desensitization (CCD), a method of reducing test anxiety through relaxation techniques; a third group was trained in both CCD and peer tutoring/use of study skills; and a fourth group received no interventions. All groups were measured for self-reported test anxiety, anxiety during actual test taking, and general anxiety. Academic performance was assessed through students' weekly quiz scores, final examination scores, and final grades in their  psychology class. The results were not conclusive on the effects of intervention on course performance, test anxiety, or general anxiety. However, there was evidence that students who received CCD training experienced significantly less anxiety under actual examination conditions at posttest than students not trained in CCD. Furthermore, students trained in CCD showed significant reduction in debilitative test anxiety between pretesting and follow-up testing. It was suggested that programs with both anxiety reduction and study counseling components would be most effective in reducing test anxiety and improving test performance among underprepared students with poor study and test-taking skills.

        "description":"This study sought to identify schools that efficiently teach economically disadvantaged black children and describe these schools as models for quality urban education in the United States. An effective school was defined as one in which at least 40 percent of the student population was black; gains were demonstrated in student achievement; and minority students did not experience negative desegregation effects. A literature review explored the social climate of effective education and identified the factors that make for effective schooling and learning. Detailed observations of effective schools in Richmond, Virginia, in Baltimore, Maryland, and in New York City were conducted and reported on. The study concluded that the school as an organization and the characteristics of  school personnel are more important determinants of achievement than students' family background. Efficient planning, teacher effectiveness, administrators' leadership characteristics, better use of resources, and focus on basic skills were found to be particularly influential in determining school effectiveness. It was suggested that initiation changes within the school would produce better results for poor children than attempts to change family background factors. Furthermore, it was implied that the combined efforts of schools and communities can make effective schools the norm, rather than the exception, for urban schools. (Author/MJL)",

A completed model shows a historical summary of an immigrant group's degree of loss or retention of their original  culture.

Two components of administrative leadership were investigated: a principal's concern for group/person maintenance, as demonstrated in his ability to consider teachers' opinions and needs in decision making; and his emphasis on task, determined by his familiarity with classrooms and clasroom strategies. The types of feedback mechanisms were the degree to which teachers monitored pupils' work and progress, and the school's concern for pupil socialization and development.  It was found that while a task oriented principal might seek to influence educational processes more systematically than a person oriented principal, the latter was more likely to elicit stronger response or commitment. Children with remedial needs were observed to respond to school management practices oriented toward social integration (group maintenance and pupil socialization), while children in the regular curriculum were found to respond better to practices oriented toward academic intensity (task orientation and classwork monitoring). The results suqgest that improving academic achievement requires the use of different methods among different groups of pupils. (MJL)",

        "description":"Since the 1960s, the popular press and academic journals have promulgated the stereotype of Asian American success, maintaining that Asian Americans are well educated, that they are disproportionately and hiqhly represented in professional and technical positions, and that they earn salaries equal to or higher than those of majority Americans. Data and studies indicate that this stereotype of success does not accurately describe members of Asian American groups. In the first place, the idea that all Asian Americans have achieved a high level of economic well-being ignores vast differences in income, education, and occupation among groups within the heterogeneous Asian communities. Secondly, the success stereotype focuses on Asian Americans who are college graduates or who are in  high paying occupations but does not consider the large number of illiterates, those who are in low paying jobs, and the unemployed. Finally, Asian Americans earn incomes that are lower than those of majority Americans with the same education. The widely held stereotype of Asian American success seems to have led to official neglect of Asian American problems. Several incidents demonstrate cases in which Asian Americans were overlooked or omitted from consideration in Federal policies and programs. These examples provide cause for considerable concern.

        "description":"Resegregation is the process by which students are separated into racially or ethnically isolated groups within desegregated schools. Resegregation may result from the traditional practice of sorting students into apparently homogeneous groups through ability grouping and tracking and through student selection for compensatory education, special education, and bilingual education. The degree to which these practices enhance resegregation is determined by: student assignment procedures that overrepresent minority children in lower academic groupings and underrepresent them in higher academic groupings; minority overrepresentation in school enrollment; the practice of pulling children out of the regular classroom; and the extent to which individual children have multiple  eligibility, or qualify for several categorical programs. Discipline practices characterized by the disproportionate suspension of black students also contribute to resegregation. To reduce within-school resegregation, schools must adopt alternatives in current practices. Assessment for student grouping should be based on different kinds of information and should be properly interpreted, instruction should be organized to encourage integration among heterogeneous student groups, and discipline methods should emphasize keeping students in school rather than suspending them. Finally, more research is needed for further progress in reducing resegregation. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"The School District of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was ordered by the Commonwealth Court to begin a voluntary desegregation plan in February, 1979. To support the desegregation process, the school district applied for and received grants from the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA) to develop programs around eight basic models: pairing, enrichment, middle school alternatives, music and art programs, multilingual/multicultural programs, student concerns, child development centers, and curriculum magnets. The desegregation plan showed success on several levels. Despite a declining enrollment and the closing of some schools, the number of desegregated students and schools continued to increase. Students, teachers, and parents had positive impressions of the desegregation programs with  which they were associated. Student interpersonal and intergroup relations improved significantly, and over half of the students who had been in desegregation programs for 2 years maintained or improved their national percentile ranks in reading and mathematics. As more students continue to participate in voluntary desegregation programs, the school district should increase efforts to develop more attractive programs and to create integrated environments within the desegregated schools.

        "description":"Toronto (Ontario, Canada) and Los Angeles (California) are two cities that provide television programs for specific ethnic groups. During a sample week, 13 percent of the total broadcast time of stations serving Greater Toronto was devoted to programs for ethnic groups. In another sample week, minority ethnic broadcasts took up 17 percent of the total broadcast time of stations serving the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The context within which ethnic television has developed in these two cities has affected its nature and purposes. Geography, history, economic factors, public policy, and the sociocultural context have determined the number of types of populations that ethnic television can reach and the number and types of programs that the stations can provide. Toronto and Los  Angeles television personnel see ethnic television as a means for affecting social impact on ethnic communities by lowering cultural barriers, promoting multiculturalism, enhancing community solidarity, and maintaining cultural identity. Current developments indicate that some ethnic programs are being discontinued in favor of programs for larger ethnic group audiences or for subscription television, or for financial reasons. At the same time, future plans indicate expanded opportunities for ethnic television, a prospect which has implications for television's role in promoting cultural awareness and understanding.

The special provisions prescribe added protection of minority voting rights in those jurisdictions where discrimination in voting has been most pervasive. The report explains the Voting Rights Act and discusses its effects in enabling minorities to register/vote and in increasing the number of minority elected officials; examines whether minorities continue to experience problems in registering and in voting; analyzes the difficulties of minority candidates and minority voters in achieving fair representation; discusses the Department of Justice's objections to proposed changes in voting procedures; examines instances of noncompliance with the act  in the jurisdictions that the act covers; analyzes the effectiveness of the minority language provisons (such as the requirement to print voting materials in minority languages) in increasing minority participation in the electoral process; and presents findings and recommendations. The report indicates that while the number of minorities elected to public office and the number of registered minorities have increased, problems in registration, voting, fair representation, and noncompliance continue to exist.

        "description":"This report examines 1982 Federal budget proposals to reduce allocations for civil rights enforcement efforts, to reduce or eliminate several equal rights programs, and to limit categorical grants in favor of block grants that would authorize funding for several activities under one law. The analysis derives its basis from government principles of emancipation and equality reflected in the &quot;Civil War&quot; amendments to the Constitution. The report traces the history of the amendments and of subsequent civil rights legislation, examines the results of civil rights movements and government efforts to eliminate the effects of past discrimination, and analyzes the consequences of the budget proposals for Federal civil rights enforcement efforts. The relationship of social and economic  equal opportunity programs to the Civil War Amendments is also examined and effects of proposed revisions on program budgets are evaluated. The efficacy of the block grants approach from a civil rights perspective is also considered. It is concluded that proposed budget restrictions will hamper Federal efforts against discrimination in education, employment, housing, and services provision and, further, that the conversion of categorical programs to block grants without developing essential enforcement mechanisms will jeopardize guarantees that funds will be targeted exactly as Congress intended.

        "description":"Recent increases in black migration to the suburbs and the continuing existence of discrimination in housing have emphasized the issues of integration and resegregation in suburban municipalities. To prevent resegregation, many integrated municipalities have adopted integration maintenance measures such as efforts to inform people that racial diversity will not lead to community decline; deliberate attempts to influence housing choices in order to promote racial diversity; school desegregation; and development schemes to prevent decline in racially mixed communities. It has been argued that integration maintenance tools are illegal, that they unfairly restrain the realty business, and that they discriminate against black homeowners and renters. Ethical considerations point to the  possibility of integration maintenance policy being exploited to control black influx into a community by allowing entry only to more economically advantaged blacks or limiting blacks' housing choices. Both legal and ethical aspects must be considered in undertaking integration maintenance programs. Population data for Oak Park, Illinois, demonstrate that integration maintenance affected long term demographic trends and prevented resegregation in the community. The study of Oak Park, and similar studies in other areas may be of use in developing programs for fair housing and integration maintenance. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"Interviews with Japanese American women revealed that they developed an Asian American identity by resolving initial identity conflicts, and that the process occurred in five stages. In the first stage, the individuals' interaction with family and friends led to ethnic awareness, or a consciousness of their Japanese descent. In the second stage, contact with white society resulted in a sense of being different from peers, of alienation from self and from other Asian Americans, and of identification with whites. In the third stage, which coincided with the sociopolitical movements of the 1960s and the 1970s, the Asian Americans developed sociopolitical consciousness, a new awareness of themselves and of their rights as minorities, and a feeling of alienation from whites. The  fourth stage involved the redirection of experiences toward Asian American consciousness and the gradual emergence of an Asian American identity. The fifth stage was characterized by the women's ability to relate to different groups of people without losing their identity as Asian Americans. Interaction with the social environment influenced the identity development process: in general, women who grew up in predominantly non-white, racially mixed neighborhoods had less painful experiences with identity conflict than those who grew up in predominantly white neighborhoods.

        "description":"An investigation of events that cause adults to enroll in traditional college or university degree programs studied the general demographic characteristics of adult students, events that trigger adults to enter or reenter a bachelor's degree program, and the relationship between barriers to education and triggering events. In phase 1, 20 students participated in interviews whose results provided the basis for development of a questionnaire. Phase 2 was the pilot test of the instrument. In the full survey phase data from 906 returned surveys were analyzed. Results showed that 72% of the students were between ages 25-34, 61% were married, and 62% had children. Two-thirds were employed. Nearly two-thirds had attended college previously. Barriers to earlier enrollment included job  and family responsibilities, lack of interest, and availability of funds. Adults' primary reason for pursuing a college degree was to improve and expand career opportunities. Triggers to college enrollment were job dissatisfaction, encouragement from others, available funds, children entering school, and realization that a college degree was necessary to achieve a personal goal. There appeared to be a strong relationship between reasons for delaying college entry and triggering events. (The survey is appended.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Federal funds for youth employment programs have increased for two decades, yet program effectiveness could improve if greater coordination between job training agencies and educational institutions were achieved. Initial coordination efforts gave educational agencies a major role in governing and operating the vocational education services needed by local manpower programs. With the enactment of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), state and local manpower agencies were given freedom to develop and operate educational programs. Educators criticized these arrangements, and Congress amended CETA to give them a greater role. Some evidence, such as increased communication and cooperation, suggests that administrative relationships between educational institutions  and manpower agencies have improved. Most educational institutions, however, continue to treat manpower programs as low priorities. Few have matched CETA dollars with their own resources or developed mechanisms for awarding credit for work experience. Most manpower agencies have made little effort to develop training programs with a strong basic educational component. Causes of weak linkages include recency of CETA coordination mandates, defects in the mandates, and characteristics of manpower agencies and schools which probably cannot be changed by coordination alone. (A table of findings of exemplary CETA-local education agency service agreements is appended.) (YLB)",

Three principal means were developed to reach as many of the 80% as possible: regional dialogues, national survey, and letters. NCWW identified four areas of prime concern: low wages and benefits; lack of personal support systems; lack of quality, affordable child care; and inaccessibility of appropriate education and training opportunities. Two specific strategies were created to effectively utilize the information collected. The first was linked with NCWW's on-going public awareness program. Mechanisms established were a slide tape  presentation, news bureau, quarterly publication, Annual Women at Work Broadcast Awards Program, public testimony, and informal speakers bureau. The second strategy was design and testing of action-based model programs, including Research Roundtable on Working Women, Career Counseling for Clerical Workers, state/local dialogues with working women, Conference on Community Solutions for Child Care, education/career advisement of working women, and personal skills training. Major elements of phase 2 will include leadership skills training and development of policy options papers. (YLB)",

        "description":"This paper is intended to assist vocational educators in meeting the career development needs and aspirations of migrant youth. It examines the unique characteristics of migrant youth and develops a general life-cycle model of their vocational development. This comparative analysis provides the vocational educator with a basis for identifying programmatic efforts to enhance the career achievements of this special population. The paper addresses crucial issues that must be resolved through basic and applied research before migrant youth can effectively enter a broader labor market. These issues include the handicapping effects of poverty, geographic mobility, ethnicity, and language barriers as they have an impact upon the vocational development of migrant youth. Other concerns  considered are the educational, psychological, and physical problems unique to migrant youth and their forced entry into agricultural labor. Recommendations are made for breaking the cycle of limited vocational alternatives for migrant youth. For example, it is suggested that vocational education programs be designed as a response to the total context of the life style of migrant youth in order to develop adequate vocational skills. Modifying vocational education programs to meet these needs includes providing strong programs to develop communication skills, to master basic skills, to enhance positive self-concepts, and to provide a futures orientation. Suggestions for further research also are given. (KC)",

In an analysis of progressive PBTE practices various topics are discussed, including implementing an outreach program of professional development for industry trainers using the PBTE/CBSD model and developing learning activity packages.  Also outlined is the further revision of the PBTE module series developed by the National Center for Research in Vocational Education. Following a progress report of the consortium for the development of competency-based materials for vocational administrators, various CBAE programs are described, including the Florida preservice and inservice vocational administrator training program, Program LIFE (Leadership Intern Field Experience), and competency-based vocational administrator programs in Ohio and Illinois. Also included are small group reports on PBTE preservice, inservice, and individual competencies as well as postsecondary CBSD and CBAE. (MN)",

Questionnaires designed to determine the need for such clearinghouses in the region encompassing Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, and the Pacific Basin were completed by the following persons/agencies involved in the field of aging: 117 employers, 49 employees, 18 linking operations, and 25 gerontology programs. When questioned concerning the usefulness of job/job seeker linking operations, a majority of each group surveyed felt that aging clearinghouses would be at least moderately useful. In response to items concerning the nature of effective linking operation, respondents suggested job placement counseling with consideration given to such variables important to  aging field job seekers as salary range and geographic location. Tentative recommendations called for encouraging aging employment clearinghouses, for establishing a full-fledged clearinghouse in the region surveyed, and for incorporating into the operations of that particular clearinghouse those features found successful according to the study and to related literature.

        "description":"Because of various flaws in their design, most research studies that have up to now examined the transition of youth to the work setting have failed to pinpoint ways of improving existing programs. Many of these design flaws (including lack of a uniform set of outcome measures, failure to routinely incorporate control groups, and failure to design for replication) have been overcome in a study that examined the effectiveness of the Youth Career Development (YCD) Program. The study's design involved the use of a Standard Assessment System (SAS) that could serve as a core system with a range of behavioral constructs that would be applicable to program objectives across the variety of Youth Education and Demonstration Projects Act (YEDPA) programs. Included in the SAS were a battery  of measures of vocationally oriented attitudes and knowledge, performance outcome survey instruments, and surveys to collect demographic data. Based on a summative approach, the study focused on determining what works best for whom when assessing particular programs. After analyzing the results of the survey as well as the design of the study itself, researchers found that both the YCD and the measurement system used to evaluate it were extremely effective. Recommendations called for further research to determine why some programs work and others do not. (MN)",

        "description":"A study entitled the Alternative Training Experiment (ATE) evaluated the effectiveness of a method for training census enumerators that involved new processes for developing instructional materials (called job performance aids) and new methods of instruction. During the study three pairs of census decentralized offices were matched on variables related to the difficulty of enumeration. Half the trainees from each office were given the experimental or Job-Performance-Aided (JPA) Training, while the remaining trainees were trained via conventional training methods. Based on enumerator reactions collected immediately after the training and again after two to three days of job experience, researchers found a slight but consistent preference for JPA training. A second study compared  the job performance of the two groups of participants on a variety of performance measures. After analyzing data from end-of-training knowledge tests, self-report measures, and quality control records obtained as part of normal field operations, researchers decided that no conclusions about the effects of training on job performance were possible. However, they did make several recommendations concerning training development and research, including designing training packages with some flex time, and making the design of training and field manuals an integrated effort.

The United States today faces major problems in the areas of energy, productivity, and foreign trade. Solutions to these problems will generate new knowledge and technology that will change skill requirements for many jobs and create many more new ones. Methods that can be used to identify the emerging skills that will be needed include the following: use of advisory committees, creative insight, the DACUM process (&quot;Developing a Curriculum&quot;), the Delphi process, evaluation studies, industrial work experience, labor market surveys, conferences, and task analysis. In order for vocational education to keep pace with  changes in technology, it must become more proactive and involved with the transfer of new technology from research and development laboratories to practical use in business and industry. Vocational education curriculum development processes must become more flexible and assist vocational educators in using a variety of data for making curriculum and instructional decisions.

Gifted and talented students are multitalented. They have many interests and the curiosity and persistence to pursue them. Many are especially interested in technical subjects. Vocational education can offer excellent career options for these students. In order for vocational educators to contribute to the career development of gifted and talented students, they must have information that will enable them to identify these students and to develop strategies for providing them with appropriate programming. Suggestions for preparing more gifted and talented students through vocational education include the following: (1) improve the image of  vocational education through public relations programs; (2) obtain training in relevant new technologies; (3) obtain information about working with gifted and talented students; (4) evaluate programs in light of the needs of gifted and talented students and assess the potential of those programs for both attracting and effectively serving such students; (5) develop differentiated programs and individualized instruction; and (6) establish a communications network to disseminate information on programs for gifted and talented students in vocational education. (Sources through which vocational educators may obtain additional resources on this topic are contained in the paper.) (KC)",

That study revealed a lack of such services and an expressed need for guidelines for establishing such a program. While the original study focused on CETA, this manual is intended for any employment and training program designed to assist disadvantaged clients. Guidelines are provided for  planning a follow-through program to meet local needs, conducting a client needs assessment, delivering services to clients, conducting program evaluation, and staffing a follow-through program.

The data were from the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Labor Market Experience, New Youth Cohort, and high school transcripts of a subsample of the NLS panel. Five patterns of participation were identified: no vocational credits, concentrators, limited concentrators, concentrator/explorers, explorers, and incidental/personals. Low socioeconomic status was associated with higher levels of concentration. Females tended to have significantly higher representation among more intensive patterns of participation. Labor market status was influenced by race, sex, patterns of participation, and  socioeconomic status. Being minority, female, and of a high socioeconomic status were associated with being out of the labor force. Intensive participation was associated with employment. A majority of high school graduates enrolled in postsecondary education. Higher levels of educational aspirations were associated with higher probabilities of postsecondary participation. Additional factors that positively influenced postsecondary participation included class rank and, for whites only, parents' education. Findings suggested that policymakers consider the diversity of participation in vocational education as they make decisions affecting programs' structure, students' assignment, facility use, and service delivery.

This report describes a procedure that state and local education agencies can use to develop a long-range program plan for vocational education, and special emphasis is given to the many ways in which labor market information can contribute both to the development and to the periodic evaluation of such a plan. The report contains three main sections. It begins by listing five research-based reasons for assuming that better ways are needed to incorporate labor market information in the process of vocational education program planning and evaluation. A structure or framework for developing and revising a long-range program plan for  vocational education is described next. The planning and evaluation framework consists of 10 sequential and interrelated planning and evaluation steps or tasks and a set of components for each task. The tasks respond to five general questions that must be addressed in any comprehensive plan. Using these tasks and questions in a matrix format to produce a plan is illustrated by case examples from a booming resort town and a depressed rural area. The last part of the report describes a variety of agencies that can be valuable sources of labor market information for vocational education program planning and details a number of ways in which interagency coordination and collaboration can be implemented to make the best use of labor market information in developing effective vocational  education program plans.

        "description":"An analysis of the extent and severity of teenage unemployment showed that from 1949-80 the unemployment rate of white male teenagers remained about three times higher than that of adult males. Much of the difference in these rates was found to be attributed to teenagers voluntarily leaving jobs and the labor force. The relatively small group of unemployed teenagers was heavily concentrated among poor and black people. The need for teenage employment was also ascertained. It was concluded that estimating need required a detailed analysis of the educational achievement, labor force status, and demographic characteristics of teenagers. It was estimated that approximately 962,000 economically disadvantaged teenagers (aged 16-21) with a high school degree or lower attainment were in  most need of Federal assistance. Identified causes of teenage unemployment and labor force non-participation were family income and living in a house receiving Aid for Families with Dependent Children. Racial differences in unemployment seemed to be tied to discouragement and family background. Teenage unemployment did not appear to have an adverse effect on future labor market opportunities. A teenager's inability to find a job seemed to have an effect on inclination to commit a crime. (YLB)",

Eighty items were developed which tapped three broad domains of problem areas that clients may have in making vocational decisions--problems of information, environmental problems, and problems in making actual decisions. These items were subjected to content validation procedures, using experts in the field. The resulting vocational Decision-Making Interview (DMI) was then field tested with vocationally undecided clients, vocationally decided clients, and a group of vocationally mixed high school students. Reliability studies showed the instrument to be adequate, while concurrent validity  studies with the Career Maturity Inventory-Attitude Scale showed that only one subscale of the DMI failed to correlate significantly with the criterion. Further, data for discriminant validity showed that on DMI total score and two of the three subscales the instrument discriminated significantly between clients who are vocationally decided and vocationally undecided. The newly developed DMI appears to hold promise to the field of vocational rehabilitation as an instrument for determining the vocational decision making problems and deficits of vocational rehabilitation clients.

Part 1 on preparing oneself for a work experience educational program is designed to guide a woman in learning more about herself. Each of the seven sections contains some reading and exercises on these topics: becoming a student again, implications of decision to return to school, experiential learning, self-assessment, career planning, educational planning, and credit for prior learning. Part 2 makes suggestions for finding a job/developing one's own placement. Three sections focus on organizing a job search, employment market, and the hidden job market. Part 3 presents guidelines for taking full advantage  of the work experience. Section 1, on preparing for learning on the job, is designed for completion before the job begins. Sections 2-10 contain exercises designed for use after starting work. Areas covered are determining work values, orientation to the workplace, role in the workflow, career ladders, psychology of the workplace, culture and sociology of the workplace, political dimensions of the workplace, economics, and reflections and conclusions.

Data are from the National Center for Education Statistics, United States Department of Education. Part 2 of the report  focuses on vocational education's responsiveness to and impact on national needs for economic revitalization, defense preparedness, high technology, inner-city and rural initiatives, agriculture, domestic energy and mineral production, and entrepreneurship. Each national need is first discussed, and then vocational education's response, including programs, training, services, and (research) studies, is described.

Attention is given to the roles of age, cultural background, social class, drugs of choice, and differing lifestyles in terms of their effects on women's attitudes and behavior. The first of 11 chapters in this book provides an introduction to intervention strategies for drug dependent women. Chapter Two reviews literature, research data, and findings about women and drugs. Chapter Three outlines the components of a  comprehensive intake and diagnostic process. Chapter Four describes the five roles of counselors who work with chemically dependent women. Chapter Five deals with referrals and developing community linkages. Chapters Six and Seven focus on health and medical issues. Vocational rehabilitation and employment development are described in Chapter Eight, and family therapy approaches are reviewed in Chapter Nine. The final two chapters deal with the chemically dependent woman and her children. Childcare services and parenting education are also discussed. (NRB)",

        "description":"Many educators believe that, regardless of innate abilities and acquired skills, students at different educational levels do not think in the same way. To account for these differences, 119 female students representing four educational levels (high school seniors to graduate students) completed the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal Form A and the Reflective Judgement Interview (RJI). The results supported previous reflective judgement studies in which RJI scores increased with educational level. This finding suggests that the development of reflective judgement is separate from and involves something other than the acquisition of thinking skills, although attainment of critical thinking skills is still necessary for the development of reflective judgement levels.

To investigate the degree to which young children were able to enact expressions of emotion that were recognizable by peers and adults, and to examine the accuracy of recognition as a function of age, and expressions as posed or spontaneous, two samples (N=91 and N=60) of children, aged four and five, and two samples (N=71 and N=32) of adult university undergraduates rated slides of the facial expressions of eight young children for four affective states--happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality. Adults were more accurate than children in recognizing neutral states, less accurate  for happiness and anger, and were not superior in recognizing sadness. The sex and ethnicity of the child appearing on the slides influenced only the adults' recognition of anger. The results indicate that both accuracy and inaccuracy in recognizing emotional expressions are influenced by processes other than recognition. (MCF)",

To investigate sex role stereotypes as the discriminant variable between female students in male programs and in traditionally female programs, female Israeli vocational high school students (N=1,138) completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BRSI), assessments of fear of success, attitudes toward women's roles, orientation toward work, and rated 30 occupations from Holland's six occupation fields. Analyses of results pointed to significant differences between the two groups. Female students in traditionally male programs, in contrast to females in traditional female programs, perceived more occupations as suitable for men and women, presented an androgynous self-concept, exhibited  less fear of success and more liberal attitudes toward women's roles, and were more work-oriented. The findings support the hypothesis that sex role stereotypes are significantly related to women's choice of innovative versus traditional fields of study. (MCF)",

This guide outlines a six-week program of group meetings in a Participant's Guide, contains instructions for the group facilitator in a Leader's Guide, and provides background material on adolescent abuse and the group counseling process. Suggestions are also given for organizing a group and identifying participants.  The activities of each group session are outlined according to objectives, skills, opening discussion notes, and learning steps along with films, discussion questions about problem situations, and additional reading resources. The sessions focus on getting acquainted, learning personal/interpersonal skills, understanding feelings, improving self-esteem, avoiding conflict, and building a support network. In addition, sample outlines describing each activity are included and may be photocopied for distribution to group participants. (JAC)",

        "description":"Title IX mandates that pregnant students, regardless of marital status, have the same rights and responsibilities as other students. Because social pressures on pregnant and parenting students to leave school still exists, schools have been required to develop responses to their needs. To examine these responses and subsequent programs from the viewpoint of educators, community members, and parenting adolescents, field studies were conducted in 11 school districts around the country. The programs were categorized into three types: (1) inclusive curriculum programs which offered general education and a range of special coursework and services; (2) supplementary curriculum programs that provide relevant coursework for credit in addition to regular classes; and (3) noncurricular  programs which did not grant credit but did provide relevant instruction and other services. Site visits to two exemplary, noncurricular programs revealed that the presence of motivated individuals who took the initiative to establish programs for pregnant students was critical for program success. Overall, however, the findings indicate that the generally passive response of schools to student pregnancy and parenthood reflects the widespread view that responsibility lies with the students rather than the school.

A literature review, the research methodology, and several chapters reporting basic descriptive results on demographic and lifestyle variables are presented in terms of: (1) alcohol and drug use  patterns, associated problems, and treatment; (2) mental health and treatment patterns; (3) illegal activity and criminal justice involvement; and (4) employment- and income-related activities. Data on treatment program services and client satisfaction with the services are highlighted along with the effects up to 12 months after treatment on the selected outcome measures of alcohol use, drug use, depression, illegal activity, and employment. The report concludes with a brief summary of major findings and suggestions of tentative implications. (Author/NRB)",

A brief description is provided for each project analyzed in this report as well as highlights of major findings, including that the family remains the primary provider of support to the elderly members in time of illness, emergency, or crisis and the primary caregiver for emotional, psychological, and other dependency needs. Documentation of the extent and scope of care is provided and cultural, racial, and ethnic factors which help to shape the family role are discussed. Results are presented which dispel several myths about the demise of the family support system and  which suggest a close connection between conjugal families, made viable by mutuality of relationships and reciprocity. Findings from two studies are presented that explore the types of assistance families prefer to enable them to provide better care for their elderly.

The lifestyles of 26 elderly men widowed in 1978 were examined, with special emphasis on their living arrangements, heterosexual relationships, and attitudes toward remarriage. In-depth interviews conducted after the men had been widowed an average of two years and nine months revealed that most had stable lifestyles. Over half of the respondents lived alone; most of the others lived with relatives and also had some type of health problem. Most respondents had health problems; only three did not have a chronic illness. Over half expressed feelings of loneliness; health appeared to be the most important factor related to loneliness. Few complained about housework or cooking chores, although  over half had help in one or both of these areas. Only nine widowers had dated since widowhood and most reported negative or ambivalent attitudes about remarriage. Age was the most prevalent reason given for reluctance to remarry. The findings suggest that more empirical information is needed to develop effective interventions to aid males coping with the effects of widowhood. (NRB)",

        "description":"Because older job seekers have been shown to exhibit less job search motivation and competence than other groups, a job club program based on learning and self help principles was developed to empower the older job seeker. Of persons (N=48) who requested assistance from a local area agency on aging, half entered the job club program and half were referred to an older worker specialist at a state employment service, i.e., the control group. Several measures were constructed to assess job club effectiveness in terms of the job club's helpfulness to clients and the client's psychological reactions to the program. Subjects were assessed prior to treatment and again at four, eight, and 12 weeks after treatment. Results revealed that for the older worker, the job club was very  effective; at the 12-week follow-up, 74% of job club subjects were employed compared to 22% of the control subjects. Although the job club did not produce higher quality placements, it was significantly superior to the control condition on the income variable, and trends in job satisfaction favored the job club. The data suggest that job club subjects succeed because they increase job search knowledge and report increased helping networks. (NRB)",

A theoretical model is provided which focuses on the individuation process, i.e., the development of the individual within the family setting, and the way in which comfort with difference, accuracy of interpersonal perception, mutual validation and active discussion of opinions among family members contribute to and are affected by the personal development and functioning of individual family members. These system-level variables are examined as they are revealed in patterns of conversational interaction. Data  collection from families with normal adolescent daughters, families of daughters with anorexia nervosa, and families with a history of child abuse is described and the development of a coding scheme to facilitate the microanalysis of the process of interaction is discussed. Analyses of differences among identifiable subsamples of the normal population are reported, as are comparisons involving the anorexic group and a subsample of the abuse group. The ability of the model to distinguish between strong and weak families within a normal population, as well as between normal and clinical populations, is also examined. (Author/NRB)",

When judgements of the elderly are made without an external reference group, such negative stereotypes are no longer found. Undergraduates (N=107) were presented with a set of 32 pictures, each of which had associated with it a positive or negative behavior. Subjects viewed equal numbers of older and younger male target people; the behaviors associated with each group (half positive and half negative) were equivalent. Results revealed that subjects rated the younger target people more favorably than the older group. A year later,  subjects (N=74) drawn from the same subject pool saw 32 younger or older people exclusively; age was not a salient dimension. Subjects' ratings showed the opposite pattern from that found when age was a salient dimension. The results provide strong support for previous research findings. (Author/NRB)",

Results indicated that working women at mid-life had higher self-esteem and less psychological anxiety than homemakers. Working women also reported better physical health.

To examine the factors that constrain or facilitate such female bonding, 43 low-income urban mothers were interviewed. For these respondents, female bonding was a significant aspect of their lives. The people closest to them, who were primary sources of help with childcare and emotional support, were more often women than men. These women lived near their own families and shared a common interest in childrearing which facilitated bonding and outweighed the constraints of the conjugal relationship, isolation, competition with other women, and lack of common economic interests. Membership in a more female world was related to greater  self-esteem and emotional well-being. The findings suggest that the promotion of female bonding will improve the quality of women's lives.

To improve the identification of potential dropouts and describe the differences between dropouts and persisters, 536 Kentucky high school students and dropouts were studied. An unexpected outcome was that urban and rural differences were observed on many of the family, personal, and subjective variables. Dropouts were more likely to: (1) be from broken homes; (2) have parents with lower educational levels and occupational status; (3) be white males who were retained more often than persisters; (4) have lower IQ scores; (5) be absent from school; and (6) not get along well with teachers.

Numerous studies give little indication that activities that seem crucial to the development of reading changed dramatically with the introduction of television into towns that previously had none. Other studies suggest slight declines in reading and academic achievement among brighter students in such towns. No analysis has argued that television information processing skills are antithetical to those required  for reading, nor are there data indicating that those who consider television less demanding than reading actually prefer it. There is evidence, however, suggesting (1) that leisure time viewing of television can promote the development of vocabulary and other information processing skills, as well as the understanding of plotline and characterization; and (2) that dramatization of books on television can motivate reading activity. It is apparent that when television is used deliberately to develop print literacy it can do so. (HTH)",

The section on teaching as behaving emphasizes the encouraging results of direct instruction (academically focused, teacher-directed classrooms using sequenced, structured materials), but also discusses management concerns and what constitutes effective class management, psychological conditions that create a good learning situation, and the influence of students and other context variables on teacher behavior. The section on teaching as thinking provides discussions of the teacher as a planner and as a decision maker, teacher judgment, and teachers' implicit theories and perspectives.  The summary of these sections notes that teaching is a process of allocating instructional time and assigning academic tasks in such a way that students have opportunities to learn while experiencing a high rate of success and engagement time, and that teaching is a complex process involving more than just a series of discrete, unrelated behaviors.

        "description":"Many consider the use of adjunct questions (mathemagenics) to be a means by which the instructional value of a text can be increased with relatively little difficulty, and this explains the appeal they have generated over the years. Yet this appeal is seldom tempered by a consideration of the ecological validity of the experimental studies on which the theoretical foundation of mathemagenics is based. The issue is whether the research evidence for enhanced learning that is obtained in controlled studies can be extrapolated to practical instructional settings. It is mainly the effects of postquestions that create the most interest, for it is they which enhance both relevant (question-related) learning and incidental (unrelated) learning, as seen on a posttest. In experimental  studies, the students cannot turn back to seek out or check the answer to the question they have just encountered. Their only option is mental review, which is a far different situation than the one encountered in practical settings where students study freely with their textbooks. Experimental constraints also encourage students to process the text in ways that are an exaggeration of their natural techniques. Thus, both mental review and the general stimulatory effect of postquestions are confounded by procedural tactics. The procedural paradigm currently employed in mathemagenic research will not provide useful and practical results. That postquestions do enhance learning in real study settings is generally recognized. However, how they do it and how questions can be best used remains  to be established. (HOD)",

The text analytic system described &quot;ideal reader&quot; interpretations of texts, allowing comparisons with real reader interpretations. Specific analyses described the ideal reader's hypotheses, expectations, and questions about the genre, content, and linguistic aspects of the text. A notation system was developed that provided a map of the changing envisionments that result from interpretations of earlier text segments and take new shapes as the text continues. Intensive interview procedures, including process probes, were used to compare real readers' and ideal readers' behaviors in constructing meaning for a text,  as well as a reader's construction of meaning and performance on passage-related multiple choice questions. Readers of a variety of ages participated in the study, with the major analyses focusing on 26 third grade students responding to one text. The findings permitted identification of certain aspects of test language that can interfere with comprehension, including density of ideas, overreliance on assumptions and hypotheses, and assertions contrary to readers' beliefs. The findings also indicated that caution should be used when interpreting standardized test results. (RL)",

The process is based on the assumption that subjects are aiming for verbatim recall. To test the validity of this assumption, an analysis was conducted of 20 narrative retellings, 10 for each of two stories, presented by a sample of sixth grade students. The analysis supported the theory that a retelling of a story is not an attempt at verbatim recall, but rather an attempt to communicate an understanding of a story by selecting, organizing, and emphasizing certain events from that story while ignoring others. The findings suggest that mapping story recall against the original story may be an inappropriate  analytic strategy for reading researchers. (FL)",

        "description":"In light of conflicting and limited results in the assessment of the effects of text-forming structures, a study investigated the effects of specific microlevel and macrolevel text-forming elements on readers' comprehension of selected passages of scientific technical prose. More specifically, the study examined the individual and combined effects of intersentential cohesive conjunctions, reference, lexical cohesion, and rhetorical predicates on college freshmen's comprehension (free recall and reading rate) of these passages. Subjects for the experiment were 160 students in freshman composition classes. Each subject read one of 16 versions of texts dealing with fairly technical scientific topics. During the 12 data gathering sessions, subjects were asked to read the passages at  their normal reading rates, record their reading times, and write as much as they could recall of the passage. Analyses of the data revealed no systematic effects of intersentential cohesive conjunctions, reference, lexical cohesion, and rhetorical predicates on reading rate and written free recall. These findings appear to support the argument that surface level linking structures are not causes but symptoms or reflections of the underlying coherence of connectivity of text-knowledge and world-knowledge.

        "author":["Leu, Donald J., Jr."],
        "description":"A study investigated whether syntactic differences between oral and written discourse interfere with the comprehension of beginning readers. Subjects were 28 second grade and 28 fifth grade students who read, orally, versions of stories identical in nature except for the structure of their syntactic patterns. One version contained structures more frequently found in written discourse (subordinate and relative clauses, appositive and participial phrases, and passive verbs), while the other used syntactic patterns more typical of oral discourse (coordinated clauses and active verbs). Reading comprehension was assessed with a standardized retelling task, and a measure of student familiarity with the syntactic patterns of written discourse was obtained with an oral storytelling task.  Data analysis indicated that versions of stories with written discourse structures were marginally more difficult for students to comprehend than versions with oral structures, with the interference effect caused by written discourse structures being greater among second grade than among fifth grade students. Additional findings indicated that (1) the interference effect was significantly related to familiarity with these structures at the second but not the fifth grade level, and (2) students' word recognition errors reflected high expectations for syntactic patterns more typically found in oral discourse, especially among second grade students. (Two versions of a story used in the study are appended.) (FL)",

In the classroom, the taxonomy can be used as the basis of a series of questioning strategies designed to foster intellectual skills. In a reading program, for example, teachers could have students read books, stories, or tall tales, and then answer questions based on the taxonomy, with knowledge derived from the reading. The questions could be prepared by the teacher, along with the answers, and placed in a &quot;folderbook,&quot; a learning package that displays each questioning level, a vocabulary page, an attractive cover, and a brief summary of the book. This can serve as a model  for students, who are then asked to prepare their own folderbooks for a favorite book. Students have reported that they have a better understanding of a book after using a folderbook as a study guide. The folderbooks also seem to create a pride in work that assists in promoting academic achievement. (FL)",

        "description":"Merging the instructional implications drawn from theory and research in the interactive reading model, schemata, and metacognition with computer based instruction seems a natural approach for actively involving students' participation in reading and learning from text. Computer based graphic organizers guide students' preview or review of lengthy readings. The grapic preorganizers present visual displays of key terms and concepts arranged diagrammatically to depict the major concepts so that the organizational pattern can be identified in a way that relates the new information to existing schema. Postorganizers encourage students' self-interrogation of their ability to reorganize, consolidate, and review the text content just read. With the use of computer based glossing, the  reader sees no gloss notations until the computer is signalled through a HELP command to present one. At the same time, the reader is constantly involved in metacognitive decision making about which gloss notations might have to be signalled to gain or maintain understanding. Other features of the glossing system are a statistics file that allows for the administration of consistent directions and collection of accurate data, and a text-authoring system that allows noncomputer-oriented teachers to build their own computer based glossing activities to promote comprehension strategies.

A study was conducted to apply the scale to stories from a new sample of children whose overall emergent reading abilities were ascertained by other techniques. The question addressed was whether the scale covers the reading attempts of these children. Subjects for the study were nine kindergarten children who fell into high, moderate, or low emergent reading ability groupings. The children's own dictated and handwritten stories comprised the materials used for reading attempts. Findings showed that the scale could  be applied to repeated reading attempts of kindergarten children. Further analysis indicated that the scale discriminated between groups of children who differed in overall emergent abilities. There was also a trend in the data for children to improve across time. In addition, the scale showed moderate and, in two of three instances, significant ability to rank subjects similarly across dictated and handwritten forms within a given trial. Finally, even though the two measures were devised upon different bases for different purposes, the scale and a traditional readiness test also tended to rank children similarly. (HOD)",

The questions presented to 104 college students quizzed either information high in the organizational structure of the expository prose passage or information low in the structure. The top-down-search explanation predicted that the two question types would not differentially affect incidental recall because both types of questions would induce a top-to-bottom search for the information in the hierarchical passage representation, resulting in increased memory for information activated in the search. The direct-access explanation, however, predicted that the high-question condition would result in more indirect recall than would the  low-question condition. This prediction was based on the assumptions that questions directly access the quizzed information in memory and that fewer associative links would have to be traversed in the spread of activation from high-level units to other related information in the hierarchy. The results supported the top-down search hypothesis. Incidental recall was facilitated equally in the high-question and low-question conditions relative to the no-question control condition.

Two classes of ambiguous words (noun-noun and noun-verb) and two types of context (priming and nonpriming) were investigated using a variable stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) priming paradigm. Noun-noun ambiguities consisted of two semantically unrelated readings that were nouns (e.g., pen, organ); noun-verb ambiguities had both noun and verb readings that were unrelated (e.g., tire, watch). Priming contexts contained words that were highly related semantically or associatively to one meaning of the ambiguous word; nonpriming contexts favored one meaning of the word through other types of information. In nonpriming contexts, the subjects consistently accessed multiple meanings  of words, and selected one reading within 200 msec. Lexical priming differentially affected the processing of subsequent noun-noun and noun-verb ambiguities, yielding selective access of meaning only in the former case. The results suggested that meaning access is an automatic process that is unaffected by knowledge-based (top-down) processing. Whether selective or multiple access of meaning is observed depends largely on the structure of the ambiguous word, not the nature of the context. (Author/RL)",

For example, there are no studies indicating that television is nurturing a generation of dependent, passive watchers. Nevertheless, because children do spend one-sixth of their time between birth and age 18 watching television, direct instruction in critical viewing and thinking skills must be provided in the schools. One critical viewing skill is the identification of stereotypes. Students can analyze sex-role stereotypes by making a list of products advertised by women and those advertised by men, and by discussing the setting of the commercials. Age-role stereotypes can be discussed after watching a program that has an  older character. A basic format helpful in using television to teach critical reading and thinking skills consists of four steps: (1) presenting students with a well-chosen segment from a television program to give them experience with a provocative event, portrayal, or analysis; (2) leading a discussion that elicits critical thinking from the students; (3) introducing reading selections that students will read silently; and (4) focusing a discussion on the content of the reading selection as well as on the application of the previously discussed critical reading and thinking skills.

The themes were subjected to syntactic analysis of 20 elements of written language chosen for their known contributions to syntactic maturity and their possible relationship to reading comprehension. Results of the application of a biserial correlation formula indicated that at least 10 elements of written language were significantly related to the students' reading comprehension scores. Good  readers' writing was characterized by longer T-units expanded through such nonclausal structures as prepositional phrases, intra-T-unit coordinators, and passive verb phrases. Poor readers' writing was characterized by shorter T-units expanded primarily through the addition of subordinate clause structures. The low reading group also used more coordinated main clauses and run-on sentences than did the high reading group. These results support the notion that growth in one area of language is likely reflected to some extent in other areas as well. (Author/RL)",

To determine the relationship between English and French errors, error data would be collected, classified, recorded on code sheets, and interpreted through a specially designed computer program. Findings from the error analysis would then be used to review syntactic and grammatical problem areas with a second class prior to making their writing assignments, with the hope that such errors would decrease for this group  of students. If effective, a similar error analysis design could be used in two other areas of study: English as a second language and business. (AEA)",

Subjects were 166 college students in nine sections of introductory literary courses, who read three poems and three short stories, selected for their diversity in structure, form, and content and then completed a variety of measures designed to determine the status of each with respect to the variables of reading ability, learning style preference, preferred pattern of literary response, and sex. Differences in response were found to be a  function of textual variation. No complex relationships were observed among response, sex, reading ability, and learning style preference.

In fall 1980, a statewide survey was conducted to investigate the current operational structure and activities of these committees. Program coordinators at 106 California community colleges were asked to provide information on their characteristics; the characteristics of advisory committee members; the organizational structure of the committees; present and past emphases in committee activities; and committee problems, effectiveness, and functions. Selected findings, based on responses from 83 colleges, include the following: (1) respondents worked in colleges with an average enrollment of  10,995 students serving an average of 337 handicapped students; (2) while faculty and staff composed the largest group of committee members, other groups were adequately represented; (3) 71.1% of the committees lacked written by-laws; (4) during 1980-81, committee activities focused primarily on improving program operations and curriculum and instruction; and (5) major problems were identified as lack of a clearly defined committee role, member apathy, and lack of attendance. Recommendations, based on these and other findings, called for a clearer definition of committee roles, chairpersons from outside the college staff, greater community representation, more convenient meeting times, training sessions for new and continuing members, and statewide guidelines.

The first section of the essay takes up issues in two broad areas of policy: (1) social efficiency, and (2) opportunity and equity. The first class of issues implies a resource allocation question; the second class of issues addresses the question of private versus social payment for a given service. Costs and benefits related to the provision of early childhood social services (including child benefits and mother's labor force participation benefits) are discussed. The second section reports empirical aspects of issues previously discussed. International comparisons are made of kindergarten or pre-primary  education, day care or creche facilities, levels of expenditure, unit cost structures, and public versus private finance arrangements. The third section further explores the social benefits associated with expenditure on children. In the final section, seven priority areas for further research are identified. (Author/RH)",

Outcomes of training are reported in the concluding chapters. Trainers' perceptions regarding strengths and barriers of the program, plus their satisfaction and session evaluations are indicated, and trainees' perceptions of training, their child care attitudes and knowledge, as well as observations of nine trainees' caregiving behaviors are reported. Unanticipated outcomes are discussed. The final chapter provides a summary of evaluation findings and resulting recommendations.

        "description":"The current policy of consolidating funding for all Title XX programs into block grants presents problems for day care users who increasingly must begin to explore alternatives to federally funded day care services. The block grants are problematic because they (1) are undesignated and can be used as the state wills, (2) have no matching fund requirements, (3) release states from certain planning, auditing and reporting requirements, and (4) raise the possibility that each state receiving block grants could completely cut federal money for day care services. In addition, reduction in funding levels need not be distributed equally across programs offered by the states. Since the need for day care services is continuing to increase while federal funds decrease, alternate approaches  to federally supported day care become much more viable. Public school facilities can be increasingly utilized, the number of \"for profit\" day care systems can be further increased, and non-profit, entrepreneurial forms of day care can be further developed. Families with several children may band together to form small, non-profit corporations for providing care, and corporations may offer on-site day care, hire day care from established centers, or provide a day care voucher system. Given current and anticipated funding conditions, national day care organizations must assume increased responsibility for effectively arguing the case for continued federal support for day care.

The primary purpose of the study was to identify characteristics of children who benefit from the retention process. The secondary purpose was to identify those factors from the retained year that contribute to success during that year. One-hundred-forty-six first grade children, identified by their teachers in the spring of 1979 as candidates for retention, were monitored. Of the total group, 84 children remained in the first grade for the following school year and 62 were promoted to the second grade. All 144 children were individually tested with a variety of instruments designed to measure intellectual functioning, cognitive and  physical development, academic achievement, perceptual-motor ability, and interpersonal relationships. Additionally, in order to establish the relationship of parental and teacher attitudes and classroom organizational strategies to success following the non-promotion or promotion of children, subjects' parents and teachers were interviewed and the teachers' classes were observed in spring 1979 and spring 1980. In general, results indicated that the child's physical size, visual-motor development, family background, early life experience, and teacher philosophy were relatively unimportant determinants of whether or not the child emerged successfully from the repeated year. The best predictors of outcomes were children's initial status in three areas -- academic skills, emotional  development, and social skills.

        "description":"This paper describes three models of brain function, each of which contributes to an integrated understanding of human learning. The first model, the up-and-down model, emphasizes the interconnection between brain structures and functions, and argues that since physiological, emotional, and cognitive responses are inseparable, the learning context is important to learning outcomes. The second model, the side-by-side model, is based on the differences between the two cerebral hemispheres. Central to this model is the idea that the way the two hemispheres work together to produce a unitary understanding of experiences, or the way they fail to cooperate, may account for individual differences in learning. Since balanced instructional practices have a greater potential of reaching a  variety of individuals in any classroom, it is recommended that learning experiences include both visuo-spatial (concrete) and verbal (abstract) components. Finally, the connections model of the brain function suggests that neurochemical connections within the brain encode experiences and that those patterns of connections are responsible for understanding. The process of making such connections is seen as a generative action by which people make decisions regarding their learning and behavior. (Author/MP)",

To that end the first section of the document provides an annotated bibliography of articles focused on factors influencing sex-role stereotyping in the elementary school in general, and relating to the elementary school teacher. The annotated literature is selectively reviewed in a summary of the research findings. It is concluded that the research reveals that the elementary school contributes to sex-role stereotyping of young children and that children come to school with sex-role stereotypes already established to some degree. The suggestion is made that instructional materials depicting women as passive and  restricted mainly to the home environment contribute to the decline of female achievement that begins to be evident at age 13. Research findings also suggest that teachers should examine their views for biases and stereotypes. Five recommendations for providing a non-sexist curriculum and classroom environment are advanced.

        "description":"In the ninth season of the television program, &quot;Sesame Street,&quot; new pre-reading and pre-science segments were introduced to the show. This report evaluates these segments with regard to young children's visual attention and comprehension. The intent of the evaluation was to assess the effectiveness not only of individual segments but also of the production formats designed to meet pre-reading and pre-science curriculum goals. Twenty-one 4- and 5-year-old children of low-income, ethnically mixed families viewed 30 minutes of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; stimulus material. While each child watched the show, the child's eye movement path across the visual presentation was recorded. The children were questioned about the content of the segments before and after viewing the program. The  pre-reading formats which were most effective in attention results were ones that used the segment characters in ways to attract attention to the print and to the process of reading from left to right. The pre-reading formats that were most effective in the comprehension results were ones that clearly linked the sounds with the symbols and the symbols with meaning. The pre-science segments presented appropriate scientific content, but their format designs were not effective in teaching the material. The information was not structured enough in the presentation for the children to comprehend the message. Descriptions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; pre-reading and pre-science segments and researchers' reactions prior to data collection are provided in Appendix A. A copy of the letter sent to subjects'  parents, and pretest and posttest data are included in Appendices B and C respectively. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"A review of the literature and a survey of texts show a remarkable absence of concern and reference to depression and suicidal behavior in young children. The meaning of death, the depressive and suicidal consequences of the agony of aloneness, and the fear of parental hostility, rage and abandonment are elements of early and middle childhood living denied recognition by parents and professionals alike. Only a few researchers, mostly in recent years, have paid attention to these problems. This paper reviews this research with particular reference to findings related to depression and suicide in young children. First, childhood depression is discussed in terms of its symptoms and types, related factors (such as relationships with parents, caregivers, and peers), and treatment.  Second, the nature of suicide in young children, factors which may underlie suicidal behavior in young children (such as family dynamics, rejection by the peer group, and school performance), the child's concept of death, and patterns of discovery and treatment are considered.

The first section describes cases intended to illustrate ways patriarchal social structures limit contemporary mother/daughter relationships, provides a brief historical contrast, and suggests possible explanations of how and why mother/daughter relationships become ambivalent and sometimes negative. In the second section, the contemporary context of mother/daughter relationships is examined. Topics discussed include patriarchal fears and contempt of women, restricted patriarchal models for female identity, and outcomes of maternal guilt and ambivalence, as well as daughters' rage at mothers and the threat of men to the mother/daughter  relationship. Images of women in literature are briefly discussed. Against this background the third section discusses the development of self and identity in the mother/daughter relationship from birth through the preschool years, middle childhood, and adolescence, to identity in young adulthood. Problems of sex role autonomy and identity development in middle childhood, nurturance, identity development in preadolescence and sex differences in parental response to adolescent autonomy are among the topics discussed. The fourth and final section offers suggestions for mothers seeking help with problems in their relationships with their daughters. (Author/RH)",

        "author":["Nicholson, Beryl"],
        "description":"In Norway, there has been a change from net out-migration from rural areas to net in-migration since about 1970; however, this apparent change is a manifestation of changes in occupational patterns and characteristics of certain age groups. The rise in technical and professional occupations has been dramatic, and a particularly high proportion of this occupational group has been in the relatively mobile early career stages and at mobile ages. Net losses and gains to rural or agricultural areas are equal to only about 10% of the respective gross out- and in-movements. In absolute terms, there is an approximate balance between in- and out-movement which suggests that few of these migrants settle in a commune for any length of time. Migrants consist predominantly of those in the  highest and lowest socio-economic strata. The net out-migration of village natives is generally higher than net in-migration of other people. There has been growth in employment opportunities in rural areas in the secondary sector during the 1970's, notably in the public service sector. Although these changes in the occupational structure of rural areas are bringing about conditions considered necessary to stop out-migration, the jobs created are, in principal, open to anyone and not reserved for local inhabitants.

        "description":"The Disadvantaged Country Areas Program in Australia involves a limited number of areas in each State selected according to their relative poverty, special need for improved educational provisions, and lack of opportunities for employment and training for young people. All schools in the declared areas are expected to share the services and facilities provided under the Program and to cooperate in devising plans for improvement. The most common problems of area projects are those related to isolation. Consequently, arrangements for travel feature largely in country programs. Technical means of communication are also used to reduce the effects of isolation. Country communities in the areas are trying to raise educational standards by developing local acceptance of the idea of  education as the business of the whole community. The Program provides tangible resources, personnel, and career information for senior students. The career information involves students visiting career reference centres and taking part in work experience programs in the cities. To ensure effective decision-making at the local level, all States have now established a structure which allows for consultation among all interested groups. A description of projects funded in 1978 and statistical information about the Program follow the narrative section. (CM)",

First, there is an overview of the Schools Commission's views on school-work transition as expressed in its reports. The reports draw attention to the necessity for recurrent education to allow every member of society to have access to publicly provided education throughout life. Each of the reports highlights the school-work transition area as one where innovative projects are needed. Next is a summary of projects, funded through Commission programs, which focus on specific efforts at the secondary level to ease the transition from school to work. A large number of the projects are related to work experience, career education, vocational advisory centres, and school  based activity programs for early school leavers. The last section of the paper discusses some of the constraints and tensions governing progress in school-work transition and makes recommendations for the future. It is argued that the crucial focus for action remains with the schools and the willingness and capacity of school communities to reassess the preparation they are giving students for adult life and to adjust their approaches accordingly.

The use of standardized, norm-referenced, psychological assessment measures has created obstacles to the advancement of minority group individuals in American society. This is especially true since results from such measures are used as indicators of future accomplishments. The need for integration of cultural and linguistic characteristics into psychological assessment instruments is the challenge facing special education today. Although recent theoretical developments appear promising in terms of educational practice, they can only be as effective as those practitioners who apply the knowledge at the individual level. Therefore, the aspect of  training becomes increasingly important, especially with the rapid development of theoretical and empirical knowledge concerning the educational achievement of minority group students, particularly Mexican Americans.

Recent research on principals and efforts concentrating on rural schools are briefly described. The section on instructional/curriculum leadership cites four perspectives on the topic, discusses the status quo and solutions, lists helpful books, and describes material for rural programs for students with special needs (gifted/talented, bilingual/non-English speaking, migrant/racial minority students; early childhood education; special education). Under personnel guidance,  staff consideration (development, inservice training) and student consideration (career materials, discipline) are covered. The school/community relations chapter considers political skills, problems and dilemmas, community ownership of schools, and rapid growth. An evaluation section describes literature on evaluating student progress and effectiveness of programs. Under administrative responsibilities (primarily coordination) general handbooks for principals and some works on topics of importance to rural principals (rapid growth, declining enrollments, time/resource management, service agencies) are evaluated. The professional improvement section covers organizations, journals, inservice education, and other materials of interest. A major conclusion is that material specifically  intended for rural principals is very scarce. (MH)",

Tabular data indicate that: (1) metro and nonmetro areas experienced similar employment growth rates between 1973 and 1979, but nonmetro residents continued to have lower labor force participation rates; (2) nonmetro employment growth was concentrated in nonteaching, white-collar professional and technical occupations, white-collar clerical jobs, blue-collar craft jobs, and service occupations; (3) the proportion of women who worked increased dramatically, raising their share of  total employment to almost 42%, but nonmetro women did not share equally in this change; (4) in both metro and nonmetro areas, black and other minority populations showed little improvement in their labor force status, with their unemployment rate remaining about double that for whites; (5) nonmetro teens increased their labor force participation rate, with white women accounting for four-fifths of nonmetro teen employment growth; and (6) older nonmetro residents had low unemployment rates and maintained a higher labor force participation rate than their metro counterparts.

Implementation of the system begins with an assessment of the child's language proficiency and language dominance and entails flexible grouping of children based on language dominance and proficiency, mathematics and reading readiness skills, and particular skill needs in any area of the curriculum. Whole class activities include instructional activities in music, art, library, recess, role playing, film viewing, field trips, story telling, and cultural awareness. These activities are teacher and student directed. The system  also includes individual instruction through both structured and unstructured activities. Unstructured activities provide for personal child interests, creativity, and cognitive stimulation. Structured activities are carried out through individual student contracting. The system requires both cumulative and summative student evaluation; reflects the needs and interests of children; meets the needs of and reflects the educational philosophy of the teacher; and is in compliance with state, local, and federal regulations for bilingual education. The ultimate goal is self-actualization for both teacher and child. (CM)",

Additional chapters consider how political, social, and technological forces interact and why reforms will be needed in all three areas if problems confronting a global society are to be resolved. Chapter titles include: (1) technology in a new area (end of cheap oil, new demands and new values); (2) knowledge and power (energy, research/development, scientific priorities); (3) innovation, productivity, and  jobs (innovation recession, technological change and business cycle, microelectronics); (4) technology and development (technological world order, meeting basic needs); and (5) technical change and society (technology and sustainability/democracy).

The studies attempt to answer questions regarding mathematics anxiety: (1) what is it, (2) who has it, (3) why do people have it, and (4) what can be done to prevent or cure this anxiety? Anxiety was measured by a standardized rating scale and information on related variables was determined by a standardized test and an investigator-developed questionnaire. Findings are presented separately for each study. Among the conclusions are: (1) group membership has little impact on a person's anxiety unless the group membership  reflects actual mathematics performance or an attitude towards mathematics; (2) persons with high anxiety perceive their mathematics skills as less than their other academic skills and generally will not like mathematics or enjoy teaching it; (3) motivation and successful experiences have high degrees of association with mathematics anxiety and great impact on successful completion of mathematics tasks; and (4) performance of a task and teaching of a skill are not necessarily equivalent in creating anxiety for a particular individual. A model of a mathematics anxiety reduction seminar is included. (MP)",

These pupils were assessed on mastery of: Number and Operation, Geometry, Measurement, Algebraic Topics, and Computer Literacy. Pupil attitudes were also surveyed. Overall achievement was considered encouraging, with Measurement a concern as it consistently had the lowest rating. Two teacher questionnaires were  developed for the assessment, and teachers were randomly selected from grades 1 through 12 to respond.

This network, which is based on a skills hierarchy, is used to classify seven levels of student competency. The determination of student competency depends upon the careful construction of error-diagnostic tests. Several examples of student response patterns are used to illustrate a procedure to construct a few selected items for such a test so that it will have both content and construct validity. Similar examples of student misconceptions and incomplete knowledge are included to illustrate the difficulty/futility in using test scores to assess student performance. The report includes several lists of projected errors which are either predicted  from the nodes of the procedural network or are based on classroom observations of junior high school students. These errors have been classified by the node best representing the misconception or incomplete information. Complete tests which were used to assess student knowledge have been included in the report. (Author)",

The program emphasizes citizen input and employs the nominal group process to build consensus. Small group discussions are used to generate solutions to local problems which arise from increasing energy costs and resource scarcities. A computer model is used to educate participants about the consequences of continuing historic energy use patterns and to analyze the potential impacts of policy choices on community lifestyle. Policy analysis is performed by a cross-impact procedure and results are graphically displayed for instantaneous feed-back to participants. The program was used with  success in six counties of northwest Ohio where it led to the development of community energy action plans, citizen energy task forces, and improved energy awareness. Developers of the program believe that it is beneficial and effective because it can lead to the development of policies and actions which are both supported and promoted by local citizens and it can be used to elicit citizen acceptance of and participation in an already-enacted community energy plan.

Specific materials (springboards) for classroom use are found in the student manual. In this document, Episode  II, the history topic is European colonization of the New World. This unit has four segments. Twelve springboards and one transparency are given that help the student (1) scrutinize the life-style and settlement patterns of the American Indian before the arrival of the European and their later displacement because of colonist settlement patterns, (2) examine the ecological characteristics of where the colonists chose to settle, (3) compare and identify the characteristics of people in England between 1650-1700 with those who migrated to the New World, and (4) examine the relationship of certain background factors of the settlers to the geographic distribution within the colony.

Existing global realities--the growing interdependence of nations and peoples, the depletion of nonrenewable resources, and the ominous world food problem--make it imperative that schools teach global studies. The first course focuses on world history and explores the chronological development of man and civilization from his primitive beginnings to his present complex world, with emphasis on global interdependence and its many facets. The second course deals with U.S. history, showing the merger of many diverse people and cultures and the resultant change from a traditional society to a modern society. Also, it compares this growth to show our  dependence/interdependence politically, economically, and socially from/to traditional and modern societies in other parts of the world. The third course examines specific global issues of the teacher's choosing. Each of the three outlines contains a brief description of the course, general objectives, and suggested materials. Unit outlines indicating specific objectives, and sample activities are then provided for each course. The many and varied activities involve students in reading and discussing literature, making outlines, conducting research, listening to guest speakers, taking field trips, constructing maps, writing papers, viewing audiovisuals, and presenting dramas.

One component of a two-part publication, the guide demonstrates how the conceptual structure of the economics discipline presented in the first publication (ED 148 648) can be used to help students at the junior high school level make more effective economic decisions. By selecting lessons to supplement existing courses or texts, teachers will be able to upgrade the quantity and quality of economics instruction. The concepts taught are: economic wants, scarcity, opportunity cost, productive resources, division of labor, interdependence, efficiency, exchange or trade, money, supply and demand, market price, price mechanisms, consumer price index, price level change, index  numbers, inflation, and gross national product. The first part of the guide contains ten classroom tested lessons. Each lesson includes a description of the concepts to be taught, objectives, rationale, student materials, teaching procedures to be used, and evaluation methods. Most of the activities include group interaction and discussion and involving students in games and role playing. The second part of the guide contains a comprehensive unit based on a case study of the U.S. shoe industry. The unit consists of eight lessons that take a total of about two weeks to present. However, teachers can adapt it or shorten it according to their own requirements.

The intended audience includes school administrators, curriculum developers, and classroom teachers. Many practitioners have found that consumer education is an excellent area for developing the skills of economic analysis. Students find relevance in applying economic concepts to consumer situations since they have already assumed the role of consumers. Consumer education provides many opportunities to show how the public and private sectors allocate resources which are consumed by student and other individuals in the society. There are three major sections to the publication. The first section presents a rationale for including consumer economics in the  curriculum. Discussed are the role of economics in consumer education, the multi-grade and multi-disciplinary thrust of consumer education, and the need for focusing on concepts. The second major section presents a methodology to help establish an appropriate sequence for the introduction of specific economic concepts. The third section contains a procedure by which consumer economics can be newly emphasized in the existing curriculum. Examined are the planning procedures for curriculum change, determining the implementation method, and the process of curriculum development and change. The appendices contain a glossary of concepts and a ranking procedure used to develop the hierarchy. (Author/RM)",

The infancy stage, Level I, is the study of consumer behavior referred to as the scientific study of psychological structure and process dynamics of individuals consuming an economic good exchanged by a business organization while satisfying consumers at maximal profit. Level II is directed to both business and consumers for the purpose of satisfying consumers at a maximal profit and protecting and educating consumers in the market place. Level III extends consumer behavior to the nonprofit sector through which a nonprofit organization satisfies consumers at minimal cost. Level IV takes consumer behavior into the noneconomic  goods' sector. These profit or nonprofit organizations may attempt to elicit a social response from its publics. Level V generalizes the study of consumer behavior across different social entities. Level VI extends the study to the physical and biological areas. (Author/BM)",

Approximately half of the report, part one, deals with projections for the future in the areas of population, gross national product, climate, technology, food, fisheries, forestry, water, energy, fuel minerals, nonfuel minerals, and environment. Part two analyzes these same projection areas of the government's model in relatively nontechnical terms. The third part examines five global models--Worlds 2 and 3, Mesarovic-Pestel World Model, Model of International Relations in Agriculture (MOIRA), the Latin American World Model, and  the United Nation's World Model. Finally, in the fourth part the structure and results of these same global models are compared with the government's global model. Although the report presents no policy recommendations, the chapters presenting the projections unavoidingly imply ways in which the future might be improved. Results of a review of previous work that had similar goals, excerpts from criticism of the projections, embassy reports on forestry and agricultural trends, and metric conversion facts are presented in four appendices.

The goal of the course is to bring together students from across the university with a strong interest in energy problems to pursue areas of individual concern subject to peer review. The group review process fosters communication among the class, helps to improve student writing skills, and permits students to draw upon their own areas of expertise in evaluating a proposal or paper written by a student from another discipline. The first month of the course involves students in a fair amount of reading to familiarize them with energy problems, technologies, and issues. The second half of the course is structured around the development of the research papers or  projects. Students, working individually or on a joint project, are required to submit a research proposal/prospectus or a preliminary paper. The class is then divided into groups of five students each. Each of the students in a group is given copies of the group members' research proposals or papers to read, review, and critique. This should take about one week. At the end of that time students come back together, go into their respective groups, and evaluate each paper in turn. After each student's proposal or paper is evaluated, the student collects written comments from each student and uses these as a guide in revising the work. Students also have periodic meetings with the instructor who provides additional input into the development of the research project. (Author/RM)",

The achievement and attitudes of approximately 7,500 9-year-olds, 11,000 13-year-olds, and 13,500 17-year-olds were surveyed. The report consists of an introduction to the studies and six chapters. Major findings are discussed and survey information about the amount and kind of art experiences young Americans are having in and out of school is presented. The extent to which and the ways in which students value art are examined along with knowledge about art history and styles. How young people perceive, describe, analyze, and judge art is also investigated in detail. Results of a series of exercises  requiring design and drawing skills are presented in a final chapter. Encouraging findings include the following. Nine-year olds' performance on the second assessment stayed much the same as it was in the first assessment. Museum visitation has increased for 9- and 13-year olds. Nineteen percent of the 17-year-olds and 15% of the 13-year-olds succeeded in putting expressive content into their drawings of angry people. There were also findings which were troublesome. Some examples include the following. Thirteen-year-olds declined 2.2 percentage points between assessments. Seventeen-year-olds declined 1.9 points between assessments. In general, tolerance for nonconventional art decreased considerably between 1974 and 1979. Appendix material includes art objectives and scoring guides for  the drawing exercises. Primary type of information provided by report: Results (Selective) (Change). (Author/RM)",

Two hundred and eighty seven Asian American women of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Philippino descent in both traditional and nontraditional occupations were interviewed in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. In the interviews various instruments were utilized to determine the participants' ethnic identity, sexual identity, interracial identity, and verbal and non-verbal communication patterns. Results included the following. Nontraditional occupation holders displayed (1) a combination of Asian and American value orientations, (2) more masculine tendencies or the perceived ability associated with masculine-related orientations such as being  more decisive and ambitious, (3) a rejection of stereotypes attributed to them by white members of society, (4) more situation-person specific assertive verbal behavior, and (5) a trend toward more nonverbal assertive behavior. The pattern of multicultural adjustment of the Asian American women in nontraditional occupations consisted of their being more highly educated and older than their counterparts in traditional occupations, and in their displaying an additional set of communication behavioral skills to deal with a variety of individuals of different sexes and cultures.

        "description":"This is the final report and critique which investigated the law school admissions process, and especially the role of the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) within that process, for possible bias against minority applicants. The study involved the reanalysis of existing data. Results show that current admission policies unfairly limit the enrollment of minority applicants. The report begins by reviewing the Bakke decision. It then examines each of the components of the Admissions Index which is a weighted combination of the undergraduate grade point average (UGPA) and the LSAT score. Overall, the UGPA is less biased against minorities than is the LSAT. The report presents evidence that shows the differential effect of adding LSAT scores to UGPA's for minorities vs. whites. The  author examines items from the &quot;Law School Admission Bulletin and LSAT Preparation Material&quot; which is commonly used for practice by potential test takers. Factors inherent in the LSAT which might be contributing to low test performance for minorities are explained. Finally the Thorndike and Cole models for admissions decisions are evaluated. The report's recommendations include: adjusting the LSAT scores of minority applicants in recognition of possible cultural bias in the test; evaluating LSAT scores on an individual basis through extensive review of applicant files; separating evaluations for minority applicants; and disregarding LSAT scores. Without exception, reviewers, who critiqued the study agreed with the author's concern for the rethinking of current admissions policies.  However, many reviewers pointed out problems with the methodology used, with the validity of the report's conclusions, and with the final set of recommendations. (Author/RM)",

Section I provides an overview of seven scenarios which might be applicable to local projects planning to adopt or adapt other projects. The descriptions were drawn from an analysis of Teacher Corps proposals, literature, and conversations with researchers and practitioners. In Section II, five of the scenarios are expanded into experience-based essays that can be used by staff in a variety of programs to clarify implementation and institutionalization goals. The five scenarios involve: (1) district-wide adaptation/adoption  strategies; (2) using a &quot;shadow school&quot; approach in field testing; (3) utilizing existing linkage systems; (4) collaboration with the state education agencies; and (5) federal dissemination mechanisms for products and practices. Worksheets are included for developing a scenario that is site-specific to project staff. The four chapters in Section III provide guidelines to achieve the goals of the Fourth Outcome at local project sites. The techniques discussed are assessing the project, targeting audiences, using audience interaction in decision making, and evaluating Fourth Outcome results.

This document presents major theories about educating troubled youth, theoretically-based programs, and research and evaluation on their effectiveness. Theories are grouped under two broad perspectives: (1) the individual in interaction with social institutions; and (2) the individual's behavior. This dual focus is maintained throughout the volume as each perspective, its definition, application, and relevant research are identified. In examining the interaction between individuals and social institutions, four phenomena are considered which contribute to troubled behavior: negative labeling, norm  diversity among subcultures, blocked opportunity, and lack of affiliation with conventional institutions. The theories about these phenomena are the basis for intervention efforts for those who try to alter characteristics of institutions where the phenomena are operating. Discussions are given of individual characteristics of youth to determine their relationship to troubled behavior. The origin of these characteristics may be attributed to physiology, personality, learning disabilities, cultural membership, peer influence, family relationships, or contact with substance abuse (alcohol or drugs). The intervention, prevention, or treatment is centered in the belief that remediation of these individual characteristics will have long-term effects on reducing troubled behavior.  (JD)",

        "description":"University supervisors' evaluations of student teachers were assessed to determine if the cognitive attainment of pupils taught by the student teachers was a rating factor. The sample consisted of 82 secondary level student teachers participating in a competency based teacher education program. Data collected for the study included a summary evaluation instrument, developed by the student teachers, to ascertain their pupils' academic achievement levels. The student teacher supervisors recorded their ratings of student teachers' instructional effectiveness on an evaluation profile scale consisting of 20 instructional skills and eight personal competencies. Final ratings were obtained from a three-way conference among the student teacher, the university supervisor, and the  cooperating teacher. Only four of the 28 ratings areas were found to relate significantly to learner achievement: (1) developing lesson plans; (2) using different levels of classroom questions; (3) performance while student teaching two-week units; and (4) personal energy level. These findings have implications for student teacher evaluation procedures, since they refute the assumption that high student teacher ratings by their supervisors is related to high learner achievement.

Eight biases were tested: (1) Education courses tend to be easier than most other college courses; (2) Education courses tend to have little or no relevance to the needs of a teacher; (3) Teacher education students wish they had chosen some other career program; (4) Education professors teach less effectively than other college professors; (5) Education professors appear less knowledgeable than other college professors; (6) Students in the teacher education program are academically inferior to other college students; (7) Most students in teacher education  are not planning a career in teaching; and (8) Teacher education students have a low regard for the teaching profession. The data were analyzed by student's program, curriculum, college level, transfer/non-transfer status, and career plans and were compared to the results of surveys taken in 1969 and 1974. Agreement with the biases ranged from a low of 4.1 percent for Bias 5 to a high of 30.3 percent for Bias 1.

Recent studies have shown that teachers have not been adequately trained to use such educational technology. However, several training models can be used by colleges of education to meet this need. A course in computer literacy, such as \"Introduction to Computers\" can be added to the curriculum. Many colleges of education have restructured an audiovisual training course or added an educational technology course. Another method is to integrate the educational uses of technology throughout the courses in the curriculum. A state inservice or certification requirement may be the impetus for needs-based courses in minimum technology  competencies. An integrated followup approach could begin in preservice training and continue through a university-collaborated inservice program. In planning to use these models, three factors must be considered: the future needs of the users; the applications of computers to educational settings; and the impact of technology on school settings.

Locus of control is defined as representing the extent of dependence upon inner or outer forces, the extent one is willing to invest in shaping the environment, and the perception of reinforcement as dependent upon those efforts, or upon random events. The specific questions were: (1) Does locus of control explain the variance in student teachers' perceptions in simulated educational situations? and (2) Do student teachers attribute success or failure in actual teaching situations in view of their locus of control? Two hundred randomly selected student teachers participated. They responded to the Rotter IE Scale for the study of locus of control, and to two questionnaires, one of which investigated background  variables. In the other, subjects were asked to react to eight simulated situations posing various educational problems, each followed by several possible solutions representing a characteristic perception and attribution of either external or internal orientation. Subjects were required to choose the one solution that represented how they would behave. The selected factors of locus of control considered relevant to teaching were: (1) inner vs. outer sources of authority; and (2) attribution of success or failure to inner or outer forces. The findings revealed that locus of control does influence student teachers' perceptions and attributions.

A validated questionnaire was sent to teachers in 35 school districts, and 241 teachers responded. The survey sought information on the experiences of teachers with handicapped students. Also investigated were teachers' abilities, attitudes toward handicapped learners, interest in professional self-development, expressed needs, and what they considered to be the limits of handicapped learners. Responses revealed that 41 percent of the teachers had no experience with handicapped students. Thirty-seven percent of the teachers had little or no background in adapted physical education, and seven percent  had experience in developing individualized education programs (IEP's). Numerous misperceptions of Public Law 94-142 were revealed, resulting in misunderstandings about the responsibilities of physical education teachers. In general, the respondents had a positive attitude toward teaching handicapped students, but the majority felt that the nature of the student's handicap, the functional ability of the student, and the activity chosen would be limiting factors in participation in physical education. When asked about opportunities to expand their knowledge of physical education for handicapped students, the majority of teachers preferred conferences, workshops, and other inservice offerings. It is concluded that there is a need to clarify and identify the contribution of physical  education in the IEP's of handicapped students.

The essay in the first chapter explores the idea that, to function or survive in a complex society, individuals must work to unify the mind and body. The second chapter emphasizes that physical education provides people with basic but unique behavioral and developmental experiences and outlines how a humanistic physical education program addresses the need for self concept, self esteem, and self actualization. The third chapter focuses on the importance of play, through which students learn to adjust to others, compete, win, and handle failure. The fourth chapter provides information on motivating students to participate in motor activities and on the new  emphasis in physical education on holistic physical fitness and cardiovascular conditioning. In the fifth chapter, curriculum design for all education levels, through which desirable behavior changes can be attained, are identified. The sixth chapter discusses critical variables that must be isolated and then integrated as a way of controlling the knowledge explosion in motor skill acquisition. A discussion is presented in the seventh chapter of research on the transcendental experience in sport. The eighth chapter explores the role differences between physical education students and athletes, and between physical education teachers and coaches that are destructive to the educational experience. How physical education can provide coping techniques for students with differing abilities is  the topic of the ninth chapter. Chapter ten discusses sexism in sports. The final chapter looks at physical education from a historical perspective and as it should exist in the decade of the 1980s. (JD)",

The choice of ideal and practical strategies must be considered in terms of student needs and effectiveness of class presentation. Using media specialists to help in the selection of appropriate materials to carry out the lesson is the next step. Such evaluated materials can include films, filmstrips, tape recordings, slides, and games, as well as print resources. Selected materials are then tested with a small group of students from the classroom. If  necessary, the strategy is modified and then put into practice. The six steps in using a successful instructional package are: (1) prepare yourself (the classroom teacher); (2) prepare the environment; (3) prepare the students; (4) use the medium; (5) review; and (6) test. This system of revising and selecting new materials and equipment is particularly appropriate to the use of films in the classroom. (FG)",

Until recently, most research has focused on long-term outcomes, such as achievement gains over one year. Short-term outcomes--students' immediate responses to instruction--are also important. Four categories of short-term student outcomes that may be observed by teachers are attention, initiative, success, and understanding of how and why to do classroom work. For each category, research has suggested ways to encourage and sustain immediate student responses that support learning. Two principles underlie the suggestions. First, teachers must remain aware of student responses by creating work contacts with all the students frequently and on a regular basis. The second  principle reflected in many of the suggestions is that teachers can help students learn how to respond to instruction by arranging the classroom environment to make attention and initiative more likely and by teaching students how and when to attend, seek help, and apply certain strategies for understanding instruction and performing work.

The findings on the 57 schools that responded were organized into two categories: (1) background information on all respondents; and (2) information on research activities based on responses of the 39 schools identified as involved with the conduct of research. The schools served a range of students between nursery school and twelfth grade and had a mean enrollment of 329 students. Funding sources were colleges or universities, public schools, and tuition. Information on the schools' research activities was given in the areas of funding, researchers, types of projects, computer availability, research dissemination, and incentives. Other matters investigated  included the option of parents to exclude their children from participating in research projects and the strength of research in the schools' operations. Conclusions drawn from the survey are that the number of laboratory schools is diminishing, the schools are seeking to expand their roles, and that research is becoming increasingly important.

        "description":"This handbook is designed to accompany seven instructional modules which were developed to help physical educators reduce sex bias in secondary physical education classes. Module topics are: (1) introduction to stereotyping and discrimination; (2) sex-role stereotyping and its effects; (3) biological sex differences; (4) Title IX; (5) curriculum development; (6) teacher behavior; and (7) student performance evaluation. Although the modules are intended for self-instruction, they may be used in teacher workshops and in a variety of classroom settings, including methods courses and student teaching seminars. For each of the modules, activities are presented that include readings and films considered fundamental to the understanding of the topics presented. A reading on each module  topic is also provided along with suggested group activities. Supplementary resources are listed, including print materials--books, articles, resource lists, journals, and magazines; non-print materials--16mm films, filmstrips, audio cassettes, and multimedia kits; and resource centers--organizations, publishers, and projects which are concerned with nonsexist education and women's issues. Each entry in the list is briefly annotated, and suggestions for use are provided. Alternative schedules for studying the modules are suggested, including four- or eight-hour workshops, seven- to eight-hour self-instruction, and selecting certain modules or activities on one topic.

A discussion is presented on the biological differences between girls and boys and the faulty assumptions that are made as the result of stereotyping. Structural, physiological, and performance differences between girls and  boys are summarized. Errors arising from generalizations about differences between the sexes are pointed out. Restrictive attitudes toward physical activities for girls are considered in the light of myths about the physical attributes of females.

Suggestions are also made for methods of initiating enforcement procedures required when violations of Title IX are detected. In this module, five Title IX provisions that have an impact on physical education programs are cited: comparable facilities; access to course offerings; ability groups; grouping for body-contact activities; and  evaluation of students. Interpretation exercises are offered covering each of these five provisions. Examples are also presented of five situations in physical education programs that may or may not be in compliance with the law. A discussion is presented on each case, and ways in which the situation may be rectified if it is not in compliance are pointed out. A summary is offered of basic principles interpolated from Title IX regulations that can be applied to physical education programs.

Plans to issue a supplemental report providing test results of districtwide testing for secondary school students (grades 8 and 11) are noted in the report. The test data provided by the two testing programs were intended to measure achievement in the &quot;basic skills.&quot; They complement each other and provide an assessment of elementary and secondary  schools' programs and student achievement, San Diego City Schools students continue to score above the average California pupil in statewide achievement tests as measured by CAP. Districtwide testing of grade 5 pupils using CTBS found average district fifth graders generally at or above the national average.

        "description":"The standard error of measurement (SEM) is a measure of the inconsistency in the scores of a particular group of test-takers. It is largest for test-takers with scores ranging in the 50 percent correct bracket; with nearly perfect scores, it is smaller. On tests used to make pass/fail decisions, the test-takers' scores tend to cluster in the range of 80-90 percent correct, with the passing score in the range of 60-70 correct. In this case, the SEM for the full group of test-takers will be much smaller than the SEM for those with scores near the passing score. But, the test-takers with scores near the passing score are the ones for whom the reliability of the test is the most important. For them, measurement errors can make the difference between passing and failing. For this  reason, the important SEM is not the SEM for the full group of test-takers, rather, the SEM at the passing score, which will often be substantially larger. A formula for this, and its derivation, are provided. (Author/CE)",

The first is titled &quot;Empirical Studies of Multilevel Approaches to Test Development and Interpretation: Measuring Between-Group Differences in Instruction.&quot; Because of a belief that schooling does affect student achievement, researchers have questioned the empirical and measurement techniques used to evaluate the effects of schooling on student achievement. One possible shortcoming of the major standardized norm-referenced achievement tests is their failure to take into account the nesting of units in the educational system. This study uses item data at the class level to construct tests. It was found that selecting items from an index of discrimination between groups did lead to scales more sensitive to instructional differences. From  the analysis of patterns of item response, it was found that not only did patterns of correct and incorrect item response vary as a function of class membership, but that the patterns of response reflect substantively meaningful differences in instruction. The second study, &quot;State of the Art Methodology for the Design and Analysis of Future Large Scale Evaluations: A Selective Examination,&quot; reviews how recent methodological advances might be incorporated in future large-scale evaluations. Specifically, structural equation modeling and selection modeling and related issues in analysis of quasi-experimental data are examined. (Author/BW)",

Four major events are associated with the implementation of the plan of operation for the Needs Assessment (NA) Project: (1) conducting state conferences to identify educational needs; (2) determining the validity of the lists of educational needs; (3) developing state R&amp;D service agendas through meetings with State Education Agency personnel and (4) developing AEL's long-term programmatic R&amp;D agenda. The document offers a variety of appendices showing legislative results on  education-related legislation. Also shown are tables analyzing newspaper coverage of issues the schools deal with. The content analysis of newspaper articles indicated that school finance/funding and fiscal concerns related to higher education (i.e., tuition increases) were the &quot;hot&quot; topics. Political action, busing, and desegregation topics were also frequently presented. House and Senate bills are listed as vetoed or initiated into law. (Author/CE)",

This document provides detailed results of the individual state analyses, showing that variables no. 2 and no. 5 occurred most frequently. The  analysis of the marker variables served to substantiate the AEL decision to direct staff effort and fiscal support in two R&amp;D areas (Career Development/Lifelong Learning and School/Family Relations).

Questions are raised about training as a means for educational improvement; needs specific to the achievement testing area are discussed; and a specific list of questions to be considered in planning training efforts is presented. It is concluded that using a thematic orientation, perhaps of communication, instruction and testing practices might be reworked so that what happens to students in classrooms occurs as a natural process rather than a series of abrupt and disjoint enterprises. Similarly, it is recommended that training audiences be integrated, so that all participants can understand the roles of one another and can formulate reasonable expectations for team performance. Such integrating of  practices would mitigate against isolated \"workshop\" type experiences for insular audiences. The challenge is to develop or to share already existing successful training tactics, and to fuse them into a sensible and continuing program for improving the effectiveness of schools.

On the basis of reading aloud performance, 91 elementary students were assigned seven instructional placement scores within each basal series. Students also were measured on standardized reading achievement tests. Generally, correlations between instructional scores within each series and performance on standardized tests were high and similar, providing evidence that the curriculum-based reading measures are valid with respect to technically adequate standardized tests; however, validity was dependent on the placement criteria employed. Additional analysis revealed other important edumetric effects of using different placement criteria. The technical adequacy of  curriculum-based reading measurement is discussed along with recommendations for developing instructionally useful measurement procedures. (Author)",

Further, the reliability coefficients for total words, words spelled correctly, and letters in sequence were consistently superior, demonstrating significant precision in measurement. Two implications are drawn from the research: (1) high reliability estimates of the measures of written expression provide a necessary basis for the determination of their validity; and (2) the  research assures teachers and educational professionals using formative evaluation measures that such procedures are accurate and stable.

The approach developed argues that variation in evaluation unit directors' role conflict and ambiguity is a function of both school district and evaluation unit characteristics, since both sets of organizational features influence the political/economic context within which the director must function. It is also argued that the social resource characteristics of the school district, that is, the external context within which evaluation units function, and the organization of the unit itself, are key sources of information about them, and particularly about the amount of conflict and ambiguity confronted by the  directors.

Ambiguous, and emphasizing isolated information, they are also the most difficult objective tests to construct. Over-interpretation is a danger of multiple choice examinations with students picking subtle answers the test makers consider incorrect. Yet, the multiple choice test is a tool offering versatility in measuring educational objectives. It measurers the student's discriminatory thinking, comprehension, application, synthesis, and evaluation. Guessing is minimized and the greater number of items on the exam, the more representative are the sample questions. Perceived ambiguity could allow the scorer to see that the student understood the concept being tested by explaining particular  qualifications they perceive and their individual resolutions of the ambiguity. The multiple choice-essay exam (MCE) was developed incorporating a wide right-hand margin so the student could explain alternate answers. This document deals with its development and implementation.

Comparisons were made among conventionally administered tests and adaptive tests using adaptive intra-subtest item selection with and without inter-subtest branching. The addition of inter-subtest branching resulted in levels of mean test battery information more similar to those of the full test battery, even with mean test battery reductions of 50 percent in number of items administered.

        "description":"The data collected from the in-school and three follow-up surveys of the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 have been merged and processed. Results are being presented in a series of reports designed to highlight selected findings in educational, career, and occupational development. This report focuses on students who were in the top quarter of their graduating class in academic ability but who had not entered college four and one-half years after high school graduation. In particular, the report presents information about the potential reasons for nonattendance and the current activity states of these highly able students. For comparison purposes, results are also presented for those of other ability levels. Study findings indicate that the effects on  and of college attendance are basically similar for all ability levels. Where differences exist, they are quantitative rather than qualitative, suggesting that similar factors affect and are affected by college attendance but that they operate and are operated upon to a different extent for the highly able student.

        "description":"In remarks before the Delaware Bar Association, United States Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds discusses the Reagan Administration's policies on civil rights. He first reviews past court decisions, which first continued to support racial discrimination and then sought to abolish it, and summarizes the eventual development of a consensus that such discrimination was intolerable. He then examines cases to demonstrate the Reagan Administration's enforcement record in the civil rights area. However, he points out two forms of relief that the Administration finds objectionable: (1) mandatory busing; and (2) racial quotas. Citing court precedent and research results, he suggests that busing has generated public protest and has not had positive effects on academic  achievement or on attempted integration. Similarly, he notes that racial quotas and affirmative action in employment has had disappointing and negative results. He asserts that the Administration is not against desegregation, but will not deprive students of the benefits of attending schools in their own neighborhoods by insisting on a remedy that has proven ineffective; the Administration is not against affirmative action; however, it will not tolerate preferential selections that favor less qualified employees on the basis of their racial affiliation.

Instructional leadership, instructional emphasis, school climate, and teacher expectation are identified as factors which contribute to major differences in achievement levels among schools. Discussed are various reform initiatives and the formation of a promotional policy for the New York City Public School System. Implications for school reform are said to be based upon the following premises: (1) that all children are educable; (2) that the child's achievement potential derives from the nature of the school rather than the family background or neighborhood; and (3) children who experience little success initially in school  become progressively less successful at each succeeding level of schooling.

The report explains the first phase, which consisted of the researching of assessment needs in nine schools categorized as improving, maintaining, or declining schools. The involvement of parents, teachers, and administrators in cooperative planning; the development of curriculum materials; the eventual implementation of new educational strategies; and the provision of information  to the School Improvement Project Committee are cited as the reasons for the assessment.

The second phase is described as a redirection of attention to the learners, not the institutions of learning, which entailed working closely with community organizations engaged in research. The results suggested that community research  training should be conducted through community organizations without the requirement of affiliation with a university program.

Two of the study's major purposes were to identify district wide attitudes and experiences pertaining to sex equity, and to provide a context for identifying strategies and selecting materials for use during the plan's implementation. Students, teachers, community representatives, administrators, support staff, and recent graduates were surveyed to assess attitudes toward existing sex equity programs, counseling services and extracurricular activities, as well as awareness of sex equity legislation. Also explored were student employment experiences, knowledge of the work force, peer  interactions, student staff interactions, and teacher inservice training experiences. Results indicated general agreement as to the need for: (1) more information about sex equity laws and issues; (2) more specific information about non-sexist teaching strategies; (3) more career information for the students; and (4) more encouragement for students to take nontraditional elective courses. In addition to discussion and extensive data of the results of the study, this report includes a summary of district wide implications of the findings, survey questions indexed by topic and audience, and copies of the questionnaires used in the needs assessment.

This report examines the results of the program through a posttest questionnaire designed to assess teacher reactions to the curriculum materials, teacher attitudes about the effect of the program, and the extent to which implementation took place. Although only 22 percent of the participants responded to the posttest questionnaire, the majority of respondents noted positive behavioral changes in the food habits of students. The data also suggested that the program helped to improve teachers' attitudes toward teaching nutrition and to increase parent involvement in nutrition education.  However, results also showed only a small percentage of teachers reporting that school wide nutrition activity took place as a result of the program. (JCD)",

Discussion topics included parent-child relations, family conflict resolution, psychosexual development, parents as educators, family size, and children with special needs. At the end of the program, data were collected through an attitude questionnaire administered at each workshop and used to recommend program improvements. Responses to the questionnaire indicated that seminars should consist of parent-child workshops and curriculum orientation sessions for parents, teachers, and administrators, and that at least one workshop should feature a guest lecturer.

The evaluation of the program was based upon a telephone survey of company executives, job site supervisors, youth workers who participated in the program, companies who made summer job commitments and later cancelled them, and participants in the 1980 program who chose not to participate in 1981. The survey found that young workers were the most cooperative respondents, whereas employers who cancelled job orders were the most reluctant respondents. The majority of youth workers rated each of nine areas of the job experience as excellent or good. The large majority of company executives and job site supervisors  reacted positively to the program. The majority of company executives and workers said they would participate in a similar program the following year.

The program was comprised of seven discrete components for the remediation of reading and writing skills, five after-school models, and two components for the remediation of math skills in a variety of school settings (integrated public schools, special public schools for handicapped students, and non-public schools). Individual components were distinguished by: (1) the type of school served; (2) the size of Title I eligible handicapped population in these schools; (3) the characteristics of the target students; (4) instructional approach; and (5) the instruments used to evaluate pupil achievement and program  implementation. Evaluation of the program is based upon quantitative data on pupil achievement and qualitative data on program implementation. Chapters two through six present the findings of the five components that served students in integrated public schools. Chapters seven and eight present the findings for the Special Schools Model and the Non-Public Schools Model respectively. Chapter nine presents the findings for the Prescriptive Math Model, which operated in integrated public schools, and chapter ten presents the findings for the five after-school components. Conclusions and recommendations are stated in the final chapter, and student achievement scores within each content area of the program components are reported in data tables. (Author/JCD)",

Students from ten New York City area colleges were selected to participate in a summer inservice training program. The effectiveness of the program was determined according to the following criteria: (1) the program's success in developing competent teachers; (2) the development of a profile of students; (3) the screening procedures and admission criteria used by colleges; and (4) the quality of college level instruction. The primary data sources of the evaluation included a survey of participating college administrators, a randomly selected survey of supervisors  and teachers, and a survey mailed to 600 participating teachers as well as anecdotal records of informal interviews with teacher and administrative personnel. Results of the evaluation indicated inadequacies in the screening and training of participating college students as well as a lack of centralized record keeping, monitoring, and ongoing communication with college administrators. Moreover, it was reported that students did not fulfill their commitment to teach in return for free training and credits. The assignment of the least experienced teachers to the most difficult students without sufficient support, materials, or back-up was cited as a major flaw of the program. (JCD)",

An evaluation was conducted to assess the program's success in each of the following categories: (1) student enrollment and attendance; (2) student learning and skill development; and (3) the production and distribution of consumer  information materials. Because of cuts in funding, the program was not able to meet all of its objectives. Data collection problems also prevented the assessment of student achievement. Nonetheless, CCN staff concurred that the program was successful, as indicated by the development of good peer relations among student participants, positive community attitudes toward bilingual students, increased proficiency in English and writing skills among Spanish speaking students, increased awareness of consumer rights and responsibilities, and positive impact of the program on other areas of the curriculum.

Also examined are the assets  and weaknesses of sociometric measures, attitude scales, and self-reports of behavior in measures of racial contact, racial tension, and racial attitudes.

Also included is a review of the consensus literature which summarizes the perspectives of desegregation experts, an outline of strategies for promoting community involvement and techniques for improving home-school cooperation, and a summary of interview  findings based on local and national surveys. The literature suggests that most opinions call for magnet schools in combination with mandatory assignment metropolitan plans, and plans that include the early elementary grades. Also reported are generally positive attitudes toward pre-implementation, inservice training programs and post-implementation community involvement, with the greatest expressed concern being white flight in the absence of a metropolitan plan, and resegregation within schools.

A conceptual model of the judicial review of desegregation plans is given in diagram form with accompanying text. Reviews of each community are included under two major categories: (1) those concerned with pupil or staff desegregation; and (2) those which focus on non-reassignment or ancillary measures to achieve desegregation and remediation of past discrimination. Under each category, a number of specific strategies are identified, defined, and analyzed according to their legal adequacy and effectiveness in the selected  communities. A summary of an in-depth analysis of two communities (Boston, Massachusetts, and Denver, Colorado), which is said to provide understanding of the logic used by the courts and to illustrate the interaction among educational benefits, demographic factors, and equity considerations, is provided in the appendix.

In the first section, the units and functions of the computer are defined, and the administrative, research, and instructional applications of educational computing are examined. The concepts and processes of management information systems are discussed in the second section, which includes a comparative analysis of data file and data base systems. Also examined are the definition, design, development, and operation phases of systems implementation. The final section examines the nature and role of data control, data confidentiality, and data administration; the responsibilites of the data base  administrator are looked at in the light of existing laws which deal with both privacy and access to information. It is suggested that the effectiveness of an information system cannot be determined in isolation from the functional activities that it was designed to serve, and a process-oriented system with a high degree of flexibility will, in the long run, be more cost-efficient and effective than a static, product-oriented system.

Past and present developments in language policy and various rationales in support of bilingual education programs are reviewed. The author draws from Fishman's &quot;Language and Nationalism&quot; and Woodward and Inglehart's &quot;Language Conflicts and Political Community&quot; to support his arguments that (1) language difference does not promote nationalistic conflict in and of itself; and (2) while language is not a necessary component of nationalism, it does provide a link to ethnic and cultural authenticity. It is suggested that bilingual programs have been viewed as reconciling rising nationalism in the Marianas, concern over the loss of Chamorro  ethnic and cultural identity, and pressures to learn English and assimilate into a dominant English speaking culture. The report concludes with the observation that in developed Pacific areas such as Guam, the use of language in schools is evaluated far less for its educational value than for its use in defining the essence of a society that is struggling for cultural survival.

The second paper focuses on self-employed women and female entrepreneurship development. It provides a statistical perspective on nonmetropolitan women in the labor market and detailed information on women-owned firms in New England. The third paper describes the different roles that farmwomen play in farming operations. Present employment of rural women who have left the farm is also  considered. The fourth paper draws on interviews in rural Vermont and New Hampshire schools to discuss factors affecting women's enrollment in nontraditional programs and their job opportunities. The fifth paper outlines several major pieces of federal legislation that could be used to increase vocational education opportunities for rural women and girls. Specific goals or objectives to increase women's opportunities are then identified, and federal legislative and policy options for reaching these goals effectively are suggested. (YLB)",

        "description":"Before World War II, more than one million people took part in literacy education programs in Thailand. Because of the chaos caused by the war, however, and the subsequent disruptions of the country's life, fewer adults were taking part in literacy efforts. During the late 1960s and the 1970s, an increased emphasis was placed on literacy education for adults. A case study of the efforts of this program in Educational Region 8 in northern Thailand showed the activities and achievements of the program. (Region 8 was chosen for study because of its relatively high percentage of adult illiterates.) The Region 8 program concentrated on increasing literacy education in rural areas by establishing provincial lifelong education centers using mobile units, walking teachers, radio  correspondence, and village level interest groups and reading centers. It also attempted to expand functional literacy offerings for non-native speakers, to stress the functional nature of literacy education, and especially to stress short-term vocational courses intertwined with literacy efforts. To this end, a practical curriculum was developed focusing on nutrition, family planning, village cooperation, and economic self-sufficiency. Functional literacy texts were created and revised periodically. Although several evaluation studies of the functional literacy program in Region 8 showed conflicting results, there did seem to be some improvement in participants' reading and mathematics skills, especially among those people whose villages had reading centers.

        "description":"Examination of literature related to attitude theory, attitude development and change, attitudes and school achievement, and attitudes and their relationship to behavior reveals the following: (1) attitudes are learned predispositions to respond toward attitude objects; (2) because they are learned, attitudes are subject to change; and (3) even though the relationship between attitude and behavior may not be causative, it may be facilitative. Further review of literature pertaining to disadvantaged youth and attitudes toward vocational education reveals that disadvantaged youth, by nature of their disadvantagement, may have attitudes which do not allow them to consider vocational education as a viable alternative to other high school programs. Knowing the magnitude and direction  of the attitudes of disadvantaged youth can be the first step in nurturing positive attitudes toward vocational education. However, the limited research concerning attitudes of disadvantaged youth toward vocational education is not conclusive enough to determine if it is their attitudes that are preventing them from enrolling in vocational education programs.

Focus was on formal creation of a cooperative center. A walk-through inspection was conducted of secondary vocational education classrooms and facilities in the three school districts. New directions in vocational education were also considered, because due to rapidly expanding technology and the need to maintain facilities and equipment current with technology the three districts would perhaps benefit from cooperation in vocational education. An estimate of student demand for programs that might be offered through a cooperative center was prepared by use of a student survey at the Hermantown  and Proctor School Districts, enrollment projections, and demand calculations based on experience of the Duluth School District. Optional methods for calculating a local district share of the cost of operating a cooperative center were also devised. Other issues regarding creating and operating a cooperative center were considered, including staff options, ownership of facilities, efficient use of teacher and student time, and restriction to secondary vocational education or inclusion of other courses.

The need for women in NTOs is first addressed. Rewards are considered, and a checklist is provided to test for readiness to choose an NTO. These myths regarding women in NTOs are described: certain jobs are only for men or women, women lack strength for &quot;men's work,&quot; women lack temperament for &quot;men's work,&quot; women cause disruptive sexual relationships on worksite, and women cause employers additional expense. Real barriers to success in an NTO are outlined--both internal (sex stereotyping, lack of self-confidence, age, concern for femininity) and external (finances; child care;  vocational/academic preparation; social attitudes; harassment, isolation, and discrimination). Some general areas of the traditionally male occupations are overviewed, including engineering and science technology, industrial production, mechanics and repairer occupations, and construction trades. Sketches of sample jobs in each area cover job duties, job environment, required interests and abilities, training needed for entry-level position, occupational outlook, benefits and advancement opportunities, average national starting salaries, and some similar jobs. Suggestions are offered for finding training and succeeding in training or on the job. (YLB)",

These are (1) clarifying who has responsibility for what, (2) determining reasons for continuing decline in basic skills of students, (3) stopping vocational education's treatment as a stepchild, (4) ending vocational parochialism at high school and community college levels, (5) leaving vocational education in hands of the education community, (6) designing vocational education for the gifted, (7) revealing need for a national policy, and (8) examining all state plans.  NIE studies should assess the advisory role of State Advisory Councils on Vocational Education in planning, effectiveness of interagency cooperation, and state plans and programs to help American students compete internationally. Other areas that should be included in the NIE study are state plans as planning or &quot;compliance&quot; documents, postsecondary vocational education, use of the 15 career clusters used for curriculum development and program planning, successful use of curriculum developed by the Office of Education, effectiveness of using existing programs for greater interagency cooperation, and feasibility of moving the United States Employment Service to the Bureau of Occupational and Adult Education.

The paper is organized into three sections. The first describes factors that have led to the current interest in consolidation including inconsistency among federal programs, inadequate coordination in delivery of federally assisted services, and federal intervention into local educational decision-making and operations. In the second section key provisions of the VEA are compared with provisions in other federal educational programs, namely the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title I, Education for All Handicapped  Children Act, and ESEA Title VII. Six categories of provisions are considered: procedures for allocation of federal funds, assignment of responsibilities for program administration, target group, services provided with federal funds, services provided with state and local funds, and safeguards ensuring compliance with program requirements and nondiscrimination standards. The third section discusses possible approaches to consolidating the VEA with other elementary and secondary programs and proposes six objectives for designing specific proposals for program change. Discussion is organized on the basis of the program components considered in section 2. (YLB)",

        "description":"Information relative to what constitutes quality vocational programs is necessary as a basis for program evaluation. Moss (1968) has defined program evaluation as the process of attributing differences between actual and comparative outcomes to program characteristics under different conditions of student characteristics and intervening influences, and judging the value of program characteristics. The definition has two important qualities--evaluation must be comparative and differences must be attributable to program characteristics or interaction of programs and student characteristics. Few reports have directly addressed the concept of &quot;quality&quot; or what constitutes quality in vocational education. Quality, however, must be assured as quantity of vocational education has  increased. Three factors are suggested as determining quality: scope, management by objective, and bench marks. Common criteria used in judging quality of the vocational education process are a stated set of objectives, quality of student commitment and motivation, quality of faculty, facilities and equipment, quality of program or curriculum, and feedback mechanisms for evaluation. Process or product criteria must be chosen for program evaluation. A viable measure would be the degree the program increases graduate employability, produces measurable benefits of achievement, and improves retention rates. Outcomes other than employment should be included as nontraditional criteria for program evaluation. (YLB)",

Introductory materials discuss use of the guide and provide introductions to the three core components into which each level is divided: practical life competencies, structures, and communicative skills. Content is then provided for each of the six levels in the program--Pre-Level I (Beginning Conversation) and Levels I-V. Topics are listed that should be covered within each of the three core components for that level. Appendixes include a needs assessment for determining topics students wish to discuss in class (Levels III-V); list of suggested teaching methods,  techniques, and strategies; list of common American gestures (non-verbal communication); Triton College ESL textbook options; and Triton resources, both materials in the Adult Basic Education library and handouts for dissemination.

Each project sheet contains three elements: (1) identification of information, training conditions, training plan, and training goal; (2) review of basic mathematics principles; and (3) shop problems. The project sheets are included in the overall  training outline, called the Student Training Record, for each of the occupations listed above. Each Record lists the milestones (major training subjects) and projects (learning activities) the student is to accomplish. Along with teaching the mathematics skills needed for the four occupations, the guide is also intended to reduce the students' mathematics anxiety. Input for the project was obtained from metal trades employers, instructors, and students throughout Northern Utah. (Author/KC)",

Areas of instructional information for skills of an introductory nature were divided into 13 units of instruction. These units were divided into areas of difficulty/modules: introduction (units 1-6), basic (7-9), and intermediate (10-13). Each unit was independent of any other within the same module. Units did not need to be done in sequence, but modules were to be completed in order. Each unit consisted of a carousel of slides, cassette tape, and worksheets. The final examination was an instrument used for employment evaluation by industry of entry level skills for drafting applicants. It had been used  as the final examination for all first level drafting students the previous year. No significant difference in student performance or retention was found between control and experimental groups. Other significant observations were improved student attitude, flexible laboratory time for students' convenience, and students' receiving individual attention as needed. Hardware and software were kept in house for the students' convenience. The Drafting Room Manual was produced as a text for the mediated program. (A description of the format is provided.) (YLB)",

An annotated bibliography of pre-literate materials is  provided. The second section addresses teacher concerns regarding testing and includes an annotated bibliography of various ESL tests. Criteria for hiring ESL teachers are suggested in section 3. Professional competencies and personal qualities are discussed. A three-step interview process is recommended, and some questions for an oral interview are suggested. Designed to aid in training ESL teachers, section 4 presents teaching techniques for three areas: literacy skills, conversation skills, and grammar skills. (Bibliographies follow sections 3 and 4.)

        "description":"A study was conducted to identify psychosocial needs of Adult Basic Education (ABE)/Adult Secondary Education (ASE) students by using the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ). A second purpose was to test effectiveness of Achievement Motivation Training (AMT) as a technique to counterbalance the negative impact of these students' former experiences on their psychosocial development. It was hypothesized that AMT conducted by professional psychologists does not change significantly the psychosocial self-perceptions of ABE/ASE students. A pretest/posttest experimental group of 15 ABE/ASE students who received AMT from three professional psychologists were tested using the SDQ which determines the extent to which adults positively or negatively resolved the eight ego-stages of  Erikson's model of ego-stage development. Results indicated that significant changes in the psychosocial self-perceptions of the sample were achieved for the first four ego-stages in Erikson's model. The study concluded that when conducted by well-trained persons, AMT could be a useful technique to significantly improve the psychosocial self-perceptions of ABE/ASE students. Implications from the study included provision for testing AMT or a similar technique in ABE/ASE programs and equipping teachers with skills to detect and help students with psychosocial deficiencies.

Other study objectives were to formulate the basic design of a CCT system to solve these problems and identify course completion factors and trends in systems operations. Seventeen CCT organizations were surveyed, including eight in the Navy or Marine Corps and nine in the other military services, Department of Defense, other governmental agencies, and the civilian sector. The survey instruments were a questionnaire and structured interview. The most important findings were that course completion rates ranged from the first to fourth quartile and that noncompletion was the most critical problem. Twenty-four factors affecting course  completion rates were identified, and current trends in CCT system operations were noted. Relevant literature was reviewed to verify the common conception that the overwhelming problem of CCT is course noncompletion. It was concluded that the primary cause of attrition in CCT is the students' inability to organize effectively and conduct the information processing necessary to complete the course. Recommendations were inclusion of the course completion factors in CCT and refinement, augmentation, and validation of these factors. (YLB)",

        "description":"Problems facing vocational education and child nutrition programs if proposed funding cuts take effect were detailed by vocational educators and nutrition specialists at a regional hearing of the United States House of Representatives Subcommittee on Elementary, Secondary and Vocational Education in Ashland, Kentucky, March 13, and Lexington, Kentucky, March 14, 1981. The many vocational educators who testified at the hearings contended that the proposed 25 percent cut in fundings in the reauthorization of the Vocational Education Act of 1963 would undermine programs already seriously jeopardized by state and local funds cutbacks. The vocational educators stressed that vocational education programs are training persons for employment and preventing them from going on welfare, and  that most programs already had long waiting lists and overused facilities. Nutritionists and school lunch program directors from Kentucky and surrounding states explained that the school lunch program was set up in 1946 to insure the adequate nutrition of all children, not just the poor. They pointed out that ending subsidies for poorer children would mean raising the prices of school lunches to children from higher-income families to a point that most of these children could no longer afford to buy lunch; since paying students had helped carry the program's costs, their decline in participation could mean the end of nutritious lunches in many school districts. Prepared statements, studies, and other supplementary materials are included in the hearing transcript. (KC)",

        "description":"The traditional systems used to produce goods and services in this country are being challenged by evolving alternatives. The focus of these new alternatives is on the human element in the work force. Studies in adult work attitudes indicate that a more humanistic system is needed to promote productivity. Inherent in the human condition is the need for some degree of control over the activities in which one engages. To meet this need, the new system of sociotechnical management allows workers to share in the control of their work activities and, in part, the destiny of their employing organization. This system was introduced in the Volvo plant in Sweden, where 15-20-member crews replaced the traditonal assembly line which had become outmoded as workers became more and more  educated. Another example of humanizing formerly bureaucratic and autocratic management systems is seen in the Norwegian Merchant Marine, where very highly educated crews are needed to control the sophisticated equipment used on oil tankers. In the Merchant Marine, officers' special privileges have been lessened and more participation in management is being accepted by the crew. In recent months, General Motors has committed billions of dollars to redesign plants and involve employees in quality circles in an effort to increase productivity and reduce shoddy work. It is hoped that the industry of the future will become both more productive and more human through sociotechnical methods. (KC)",

        "description":"While the rationalistic approach traditionally employed in research and development efforts in the social sciences may be the best method of inquiry to use in the physical sciences, social scientists, and, more particularly, vocational education researchers, would do better to adopt a naturalistic method of research. The naturalist approach to inquiry is better suited for educational research because it recognizes the multiple nature of reality, the necessary interaction between researcher and respondent, and the impossibility of making generalizations among similar situational contexts. Despite the fact that practitioners of the naturalistic approach do not emphasize rigor over relevance as do practitioners of the rationalistic mode of research, their research is not necessarily  sloppy. On the contrary, naturalists have their own way of dealing with the issues of credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability of data. Adoption of the naturalistic approach would have enormous implications for research and development in the area of vocational education. Among these implications are the following: the notion of the possibility of generalizable research would be abandoned, grounding would be required in every inquiry, human beings would become preferred instruments, and reports would assume the form of case studies or other qualitative portrayals.

Bilingual vocational and vocational English as a second language (VESL) courses were developed and conducted in the areas of machine tools and secretarial science. A total of five one-semester vocational Machine Tool courses were offered, with 60 LEP students enrolled; and two one-semester vocational Secretarial Science courses were offered, enrolling 22 students. Related VESL courses were offered along with both subjects. In order to conduct the courses, instructional materials were developed by rewriting and adapting regular course materials, in the Machine Tool course; and finding texts and materials at  the appropriate levels for the Secretarial Science course. Materials were field tested in two semesters of the courses and revised as needed. Translated materials for the bilingual model were developed as necessary from the revised English models. In addition, the project provided information and referral services and support services to the LEP students and provided inservice training for Waubonsee Community College staff. The project was found to be successful after its first fiscal year. Recommendations for implementating such a project were made. A plan for conducting both the developed bilingual instructional model and a core English language model in 1982 and comparing the effectiveness of the two models was presented. (KC)",

In addition, three followup studies focused on the work experiences, education and training, military service, family status, life experiences, and opinions of these respondents as of 1973, 1974, and 1976. After analyzing those data from the survey pertaining to vocational education, researchers arrived at a number of conclusions. Included among these were the following: (1) race, sex, and academic performance are key factors for selection of vocational education programs, with minority students, poor achievers, and females being the most frequent enrollees in vocational  education; (2) because vocational education funds are allocated by local enrollment and program costs rather than by program enrollment, vocational education resources and services are diffused far beyond those enrolled in vocational education; (3) those in vocational programs work 40 percent more than do those in non-vocational programs; (4) far fewer vocational-track students receive postsecondary schooling than do academic-track students; and (5) high school coursework and work hours related strongly post-secondary work hours and wage rates.

Objectives were to develop a model consumer education program and test the efficacy of community-based organizations as agents in delivering consumer education. Seven community-based organizations were selected to participate in implementing the program, and course content and materials for the program's leader-training and participant-workshop components were developed. Workshop materials--worksheets, factsheets, leader's guides/syllabus, and recruitment and evaluation materials--were developed around four major content areas: Attitudes Toward Money, Money Management, and  Math; Constructing a Personal Money Management Plan; Choosing Checking and Savings Plans; and Managing Credit. During the project, staff members upgraded their career skills and acquired confidence in directing special projects. Workshop participants indicated a positive difference in their lives. Recommendations were made for workshop staffing, role of workshop leader, math segment, participant materials, program length, and topics. Appendixes, amounting to over one-half of the report, include workshop session outline, interest/needs questionnaire and responses, syllabus, and participant materials. (YLB)",

        "description":"Twelve black and 11 white women attending two state universities in the South were interviewed about their choice of majors and careers. The sample was selected through advertising on the campuses and was more heavily weighted with women who had chosen mathematics or scientific careers. It was found that there are common themes in the career pathways of the women, but blacks and whites choose somewhat different symbols to describe their career interests. In the first place, both groups report preferences for careers which are not emulations of occupations typically associated with women they have known. Secondly, the theme of independence means a career outside the home and opportunity to do what one likes. Third, college experiences are seen by both groups as a crucial phase of  the career pathway, but for different reasons. Black women see college mainly as a time to obtain a credential that allows them to obtain a desirable job upon graduation, while for the white women, college is a time to explore various career possibilities in order to find the one most personally suitable. The black women most often justify their selection of a college major in terms of the financial rewards to be gained later on; the white women ground their choices in the potential for interest, challenge, and service to others in the future. Finally, neither group explicitly associates college career choice with gender role. It was concluded that the women lacked information about careers and what they really entail, leaving themselves open for the operation of subtle mechanisms, such  as feedback, which can indirectly limit women's participation or interest in male-dominated careers.

The other five guides, a companion teacher's guide, and pre- and post-tests are available separately (see note). The entire project centers around the Peabody Kits P, Level P, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and the Articulation Kit. Level IV is basically vocabulary-oriented with sentence structure in three simple tenses and simple sentence patterns. Aimed at a trade and technical, adult-based learning experience, the 40 lessons are structured for the adult learner and adult-learner interest with emphasis on Guam and island living. Each lesson lists materials (coded to the Peabody kits), objective, and method and has three parts. Drill A reviews  the previous lesson materials, Drill E develops and expands new vocabulary and presents stated objectives, and Drill C continues B or adds additional exercises. After the first 20 lessons, the lessons reach back 20 lessons to develop the more important items from that lesson. Written with an absent or remote student in mind, the lessons are intended to be taped by the professor with pauses for student responses. (YLB)",

The Program Enrollment and Termination Report is also discussed, and conducting the system is considered. Most of the manual is devoted to step-by-step instructions for a suggested sequence of activities for manually completing the Program Enrollment and Termination Report. Instructions are divided into three major sections: (1) students involved in one  vocational training program, (2) students involved in two or more vocational training programs, and (3) leavers and transfers from all vocational training programs. Appendices, amounting to approximately one-half of the manual, include the Vocational Education Program/Course Inventory Explanation and Instructional Manual, Student/Course Inventory Explanation and Instructional Manual, Summary Reports, Documentation for Computerization, and master Program/Course Inventory, Student/Course Inventory, and Summary Report forms.

The process is intended for use by secondary and postsecondary schools for designing new programs and courses and maintaining or modifying existing programs and courses. Introductory information lists benefits, grouped by user population, that are derived from TAP implementation and discusses personnel and their responsibilities and required resources. Step-by-step instructions follow that are meant for use as a suggested sequence of activities for completing the TAP. The TAP is composed of three major sections, each  containing a corresponding worksheet to be completed by the Task Analyst(s). Worksheet 1 allows for identification of the vocational education program and its associated occupational outcomes. Each of these associated occupations is then broken down into its component tasks using Worksheet 2. These component tasks and other occupation-related skills and knowledges are grouped into courses on Worksheets 3A and 3B in the third section. An introduction, sample, instructions, and examples are provided for each worksheet. Appendexes include course outline and lesson plan development, Program Course Inventory, and worksheets. (YLB)",

Presented next are texts of papers from the conference, dealing with such issues as women-headed households, jobs in rural industry and services, women in forestry, women in international migration, programing for women and health, women's employment in developing nations, and formal and nonformal education for women. Outlined next are AID projects/activities in the following areas: the AID central bureau, Africa, Latin America/the Caribbean,  Asia, and the Near East. A series of conclusions and recommendations are made concerning the development of strategies to increase women's participation in the social, economic, and political spheres of life in developing nations. Included among these are calls for reducing burdens on women of tasks traditionally performed by them in the home, counteracting factors that keep females out of schools and training centers, creating new employment and occupational mobility opportunities for women, and ensurinq women's participation in and access to primary health care.

        "description":"A study investigated the influence of users' attitudes and sources of information on their adoption of a training research project. A two-part questionnaire was administered to 111 Army participants attending TRADOC/FORSCOM Training and Evaluation Workshops to gather attitudinal and usage information relating to the adoption of the Training Extension Course (TEC) program by unit training managers. Sources of TEC-related information were matched with the awareness, acceptance, and utilization stages of the adoption process to gain an understanding of the dissemination activity within training technology transfer. Two major findings emerged. The acceptance (persuade stage) of the TEC program was influenced primarily by internal sources of information, while the initial awareness  (inform stage) and later utilization of TEC were influenced by internal and external sources. Prior familiarity with TEC predicted TEC usage better than did attitudinal measures (for this particular sample). However, familiarity alone did not insure extensive TEC usage, since about half of those previously familiar with TEC did not use it. Findings suggested that periodic scheduled TEC assessments might increase TEC use and that job performance data should continue to be collected for evaluating TEC utilization.

        "description":"An experiment was conducted at the University of Maryland at Baltimore to determine if performances would differ for registered nurses enrolled in a baccalaureate program in nursing depending on whether they participated in a flexible clinical scheduling (FLEX) program or in the traditional (non-FLEX) program. Fifty-four students took part in the study, with 18 students enrolled in the FLEX program and the remainder in the traditional program. The clinical course format consisted of the following activities in which all 54 students participated: large group lectures, clinical conferences, and student-teacher conferences. Students in both programs spent 13 hours in the clinical work setting each week providing nursing care to selected clients. At the end of each week, the students  submitted nursing process records on each client to the instructor responsible for the evaluation of their clinical achievement. Records were checked by instructors and returned to students to guide their performance. The crucial variable distinguishing students in the FLEX program from those in the non-FLEX program was the absence of an instructor in the clinical setting. Students were evaluated at the end of the 12-week clinical experience using the Clinical Evaluation Tool. A regression factorial analysis of variance was performed on the data gathered by these evaluations. Results showed no significant difference between the clinical achievement scores of FLEX and non-FLEX students. Although these results replicated those of an earlier similar study, caution is urged and further study  with a wider sample recommended before implementation of such a program on a wider scale.

        "description":"Sex differences in the career plans of 601 men and women completing graduate training in the male-dominated professions of business, law, and medicine and the female-dominated professions of education, nursing, and social work were studied. Content analysis was performed to determine the continuity, specificity, ambition, and accommodation of family responsibilities reflected in plans for 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-year points. Chi square analyses showed clear patterns of sex differences in the feminine professions. For example, most women in education and social work expressed less ambitious plans for management careers and career success than their male colleagues. Except for child care, the plans of women in male-dominated groups were not significantly different from those of male  colleagues. (Many women projected combining child care and careers at the five- and ten-year points, but no males mentioned this possibility.) It was suggested that more role models should be made visible to both men and women, rather than the stereotypically narrow choices now available. (Author/KC)",

One of the tasks undertaken by a subgroup of this committee was a survey of the university community to identify actual experiences of and the attitudes of student and staff toward sexual harassment. From 927 responses, 172 individuals cited cases of sexual harassment which had happened to someone they knew. Of the 55 reported cases of personal sexual assaults, 95% were experienced by women, mostly undergraduates. Men were more tolerant than women of sexual harassment. In general, younger persons were more accepting than older persons. Many persons believed such behavior was &quot;a part of life.&quot; (The appendices contain the  survey instrument and the transcript of an act relating to rape and seduction developed by the state of Rhode Island General Assembly.)

The relationship between anticipated interaction and interpersonal attraction was examined with female high school seniors (N=109) who read a description of a fictitious student and rated that student as someone they would like or dislike. Subjects were told that: (1) they would participate in a dyad to work on problem-solving tasks (work condition) or to discuss various topics (social condition); (2) the student they rated would or would not be their dyad partner; and (3) that student had a history of success or failure at the dyad task. Results showed significant main effects of anticipated interaction and of partners' ability. Subjects responded more  favorably to partners with whom they anticipated interaction than to those with whom they did not anticipate interaction. Subjects also responded more favorably to partners with high ability than to partners with low ability. No main effect for type of task (work or social) was found. The findings tend to provide support for Heider's balance theory. (NRB)",

The use of modeling, demonstration, and monitoring techniques by trainers is recommended to aid parents in implementing procedures. Examples of specific situations in which  behavior modification techniques can be used by parents to change their children's behavior are provided. Research is described which attempted to evaluate the influence of parent-applied treatment effects on other behaviors and across environments.

The extent of correspondence between counselors' pretreatment plans for using each of 14 intervention strategies and their subsequent use in treatment was examined for a group of 6 counselors and 41 clients. Counselors completed a treatment plan for each of their clients, indicating the client's problems and the extent to which the counselor planned to use each of the 14 interventions for each problem in each of three phases of treatment. These ratings were then compared to counselors' post-treatment ratings of the extent of actual use. Results indicated that the  extent of correspondence was moderated by the phase of treatment and by problem area. High correspondence was found for the initial and last phases of treatment, and for working on personal and situational client problems, as distinct from interpersonal and marital problems. Of the 14 intervention strategies whose extent of use was rated by counselors before and after treatment, half evidenced high correspondence. The findings suggest that neither the substantive nature of the strategy nor the extent of its overall use in treatment seem related to correspondence. (Author/NRB)",

Gender differences in beginning psychotherapists' behaviors and client interactions were investigated to determine the effect of sex-role stereotyping on therapeutic interactions and interventions. Verbatim transcripts of therapy sessions conducted by 28 graduate students in counseling psychology were rated for the therapist activity style. The ratings were done independently by a male and a female experienced therapist along 13 7-point rating scales, mostly taken from the original list of semantic-differential. The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) was completed by subjects to assess sex-role stereotyping. Significant correlations were found between  femininity and androgyny scores on the BSRI and low ratings of therapist activity level. Masculinity scores on the BSRI were not strongly related to the activity level of the therapist. The findings suggest that, compared to beginning male therapists, beginning female therapists are less likely to be confident, directive and interpretive in therapeutic interactions, and more likely to behave in an unsure, weak, passive manner with their clients.

In one experiment, female undergraduates who expected to meet attractive desirable men portrayed themselves as more feminine and performed less intelligently on a bogus IQ test when they thought the man held conventional views of women. A follow-up study of this phenomenon indicated that female undergraduates applying for a Research Assistant position presented themselves in a more traditionally feminine manner when they believed that the male interviewer held traditional views of women. In a second follow-up study, male subjects watched a videotaped female job applicant present herself either in a stereotypically feminine or less  traditional manner. Results indicated that, for traditionally female occupations, the feminine self-presentation was judged more positively; however, for traditionally male occupations, the less traditional presentation was judged more positively.

Although the majority of research in community psychology has used an individualistic paradigm that conceptualizes problems at an ecological level, a paradigm shift is presented that emphasizes an ecological approach intervening at the natural social systems level. An evaluation of a community child care program incorporating the model is provided as well as the conceptual framework, technology, methodology, and beginning stages of an empirical base describing cost benefit and cost effectiveness equations generated from the ecological model.

Themes related to minority group perspectives and their existence in the writings of psychotherapists are reviewed. A section on cultural diversity discusses the family, religion, and value orientation as important factors in the counseling process. Theoretical orientations regarding love and choice as sources of power in human beings are described and the client's and counselor's humanness are emphasized, with implications for the counselor's behavior. Because counseling is perceived as an unfamiliar activity resembling a \"forced friendship,\" the interview and techniques are considered within this  context. The initial interview is discussed and issues such as seating arrangements, structuring, and names and titles of address are included. Suggestions for counseling improvement and guidelines for counselor behaviors are offered. (Author/NRB)",

This update reflects changes in societal attitudes toward combined work and family roles for women and toward women entering nontraditional occupations. After reviewing the current employment situation for women, five hypotheses are offered as to why women may be underrepresented in some career areas and suggestions of specific strategies counselors might use to help women resolve each of the five problem situations are made. The strategies presented concentrate on: (1) skill development; (2) career awareness; (3) self-awareness; (4) job-seeking skills; and (5) coping skills. An extensive resources section is provided to help counselors implement the strategies,  including background information on the socialization of women, women in the labor force, and minority women and work. One section contains materials, generally theoretically- or research-oriented, about counseling women, while another section on career programs describes programs for implementing strategies to assist women. Career information materials include books, films, posters, and other resources for use in counseling, along with a list of several resource organizations that can help counselors keep abreast of new materials.

New patterns of interdependence brought new responses, e.g., workers formed unions, and management turned to the human relations movement to secure voluntary employee cooperation. When voluntary compliance proved inadequate, collective bargaining and arbitration emerged. In the 1970's, low productivity spurred the quality of work movement, an effort to move from coercion of employees to employee cooperation. Parallel changes in patterns of interdependence evolved between business and society. Similar to labor-management relations, new patterns of business-society interdependence demonstrated the limits of voluntary cooperation and the necessity of coercion. Although government  maintained a third-party role in labor-management disputes, it sought an advocacy role on behalf of society in business-society disputes. Federal regulations proliferated, and private sector political involvement designed to protect business interests grew accordingly. Now government must maintain a third-party status in business-society relations if it is to provide the framework for accommodation. Private institutions, applying the principles of collective bargaining, could be created to manage business-society relations. Both business and society must learn to exercise self-discipline and \"privatize\" coercion when forming acceptable norms of association without government interference. (NRB)",

        "description":"Although recognition of problems posed by critical client statements and recommendations for counselors' understanding, empathy, and confrontation abound, interventions to aid counselors in coping with critical client statements are rare. Graduate-level counselor trainees (N=40) were assigned to one of four methods of supervision: interpersonal process recall, modeling, stress inoculation, or a control condition. Each subject received two individual 15-minute supervisory sessions of the same type of supervision. Subjects then responded to videotapes of clients displaying critical client behaviors such as anger, defensiveness, manipulation or neutral statements. Subjects' oral responses to client behaviors were rated on four dimensions: reflection of feelings, reflection of  content, delivery, and appropriateness. Data analysis revealed significant main effects for both method of supervision and type of critical client statement. Results suggest that counselor trainees' responses to critical client statements can be affected by brief exposure to supervision. Modeling tends to emerge as the most effective method of supervision in increasing reflection of feelings and appropriateness; defensiveness tends to emerge as the most difficult type of critical client statement.

For example, the construct of heterosocial skill has not been successfully defined in operational terms. A linear modeling technique was used to identify valid behavioral referents of heterosocial skill ratings for both men and women. Videotapes of heterosocial interactions of male (N=30) and female (N=30) university students representing a wide range of scores on the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale were rated by untrained peers (N=67), who then supplied lists of the behavioral cues they considered most useful in discriminating skill levels. The rate of occurrence of the most widely endorsed cues were scored for the videotaped subjects and used to  construct linear models of the heterosocial skill ratings. Valid behavioral referents of molar heterosocial skill ratings were identified for both men and women. Men rated by female peers as high in heterosocial skill gazed upward, asked questions, and used appropriate hand gestures during conversations. Women rated by male peers as high in heterosocial skill also gazed upward, made eye contact, and avoided speaking too quietly. The findings suggest that the experimental method employed is able to identify behavioral referents of reliable peer ratings of molar heterosocial skills. (NRB)",

Two methods for investigating preventive potential are outcome studies and process analysis. To assess the presence of helping processes in self-help group meetings, a process analysis was developed to document the preventive potential of such groups and allow comparison by independent judges of various groups. The verbal interactions of three self-help groups (two similar groups and a criterion group) were recorded during three periods and subjected to content analysis. Results revealed that 14 of the initial categories were retained on the basis of their inter-judges' agreement and frequency. The findings suggest that this process  analysis system can differentiate between the criterion groups and allow for analysis of subtle variations in groups of the same organizations. (Author/JAC)",

Couples with very high adjustment emitted a greater proportion of approve/caring behaviors and a lesser proportion of aversive behaviors when compared to couples with moderate adjustment.

The greatest amount of disengagement was found among the institutionalized elderly respondents, who also selected lower perspective-taking alternatives. The findings suggest that these individuals may perceive their social interactions as less significant. In addition, the results indicate that reasoning among older adults does not tend to regress, but reflects an  adaptation to the constraints of the environment.

Age was correlated with alcohol use at parties, in cars, at a friends' home, and in streets or parks. Age and alcohol use were associated with schoolmates, best friends, and nonschool friends, as well as with weekends and holidays or special occasions. Age and smoking were correlated with use at school, parties, or in cars. Cigarette use was associated with school friends, during school,  and on holidays. Age and marihuana use were correlated with use at parties, in cars, at school, at friends' homes, and in streets or parks, as well as with school friends, nonschool friends, siblings, and best friends. Results showed strong relationship between age, substance use, and contextual factors.

To examine the nature and extent of vocational- and employment-related services in NIDA-funded drug treatment programs, 164 clinics responded to an open-ended questionnaire designed to ascertain the degree to which five employment-related services were provided to clients: vocational assessment, skill training, job counseling, job placement, and job development. The relationship of the availability of vocational services to the employment rates of clients was also examined. The results revealed that about one-third of the clinics did not report that employment counseling was  available for clients. In over half the clinics, no budget was identified for vocational services. Less than 20% of the clinics had vocational rehabilitation specialists, job counselors, or job developers as staff members. Staff from community employment-related agencies were seldom used by the clinics. The existence of job counseling, job placement, and job development services in clinics was positively correlated with the difference between admission and discharge employment rates of clients. The findings suggest a general lack of well-defined vocational services in drug treatment programs, although many clinics attempt to develop services or provide some type of vocational assistance to clients.

As school psychologists expand their roles to include home-school consultation in the treatment of students' educational and psychological problems, they must understand the legislation related to various policy issues in public schools. School psychologists must be familiar with procedural protection legislation concerning notices to parents, parental consent for a child's assessment or placement, required meetings and formal hearings on the placement of handicapped children, and the rights of parents and school personnel to appeal the outcome of hearings. Legal mandates and ethical standards require unbiased and nondiscriminatory psychological evaluation procedures; therefore, school  psychologists should examine their attitudes and behaviors in terms of racial, ethnic, religious, and sex or other biases. Because restrictions for confidentiality and data privacy vary from state to state, and additional legal references aimed at school records and student data may be contradictory, psychologists must learn the correct procedures for disclosing information about their student-clients. School psychologists have an opportunity to broaden their practices, but political acumen is necessary to assure that psychological services are not compromised as legal mandates change. (NRB)",

        "description":"The frequency of divorce in America has resulted in an estimated 11,000,000 minor children living in single-parent homes, usually with mothers as heads of households. Psychological disruption observed in children of recently divorced parents may be, in part, related to the quality of the custodial mother's adjustment to her changed life circumstances. Loss of attachment bonds, changes in daily living patterns, excessive role strain, and the amount of continuing interpersonal conflict all contribute to the degree of post-divorce stress. These factors are compounded for the custodial mother with a traditional sex-role orientation; traditional female role structures contribute to post-divorce stress. Economic dependence on a male results in financial insufficiency following divorce.  Subordination to male power results in post-divorce powerlessness and feelings of external control. Reliance on the husband for social identity and support systems results in social isolation and over-investment in the super-wife/super-mom role results in post-divorce role strain. Maternal stress may foster negative and coercive childrearing practices which are reflected in the disrupted behavioral and developmental progress of the children. Intervention approaches to mediate the negative image of single parents must include resocialization, remediation, and research. (NRB)",

The combination of leader presentations and sharing by group members at each session is described. Publicity problems are reviewed, along with recruitment methods. The high attrition rate is noted along with the  experiences of the one leader and three participants who continued.

The simultaneous influence of different sources of social comparison referents and the level of relative performance on subjects' (N=60) allocation of rewards and satisfaction was examined. Male undergraduates, working in pairs, predicted their scores on a speech about solutions to current problems, made the speeches, and then received predetermined feedback on their own score, their partner's score (live referent) and a mean score of all subjects (symbolic referent). Subjects indicated their satisfaction with their scores and allocated rewards to themselves and their partners. Controlling for feedback, results on allocation indicated significant  main effects for performance relative to the live referent and relative to the symbolic norm. Subjects gave themselves more points when they performed better than their partner than when they performed worse than their partner, suggesting a straightforward self-evaluation effect. Subjects allocated more points to themselves when they performed worse than the norm than when they performed better than the norm, suggesting a self-enhancement effect. Although the social comparison process was operative, satisfaction was influenced principally by subjects' absolute performance scores. The findings suggest that different sources of social comparison and self-regulatory mechanisms play an influential role in individuals' lives. (NRB)",

A model was developed to test a set of propositions concerning the relationship between the three kinds of factors, and included attributions, expectancies, general emotional responses to prior performances, task satisfaction, prior task performance, subsequent effort, and final performance. Data were collected from business students (N=93) participating in a business decision-making game. Path analysis results provided considerable support for the model, including that: (1) attributions for outcome at midpoint of the game were influenced by quality of the outcome; (2) higher expectations were associated with internal  attributions; and (3) affective responses were a function of prior performance, internal attributions, and high expectancies. The findings demonstrate the interplay of a variety of causal factors that contribute to performance outcome. (Author/JAC)",

However, thoughtful planning is needed if these programs are to make the most of family involvement. Consideration of who, what, when, where, and how provides a structure to guide the information gathering process necessary for decision making in program planning. In thinking of who can be reached, it is helpful to consider who, other than the parent, has concern for the child. It is also wise to consider who, in addition to a school agency, can contact advocates, conduct meetings, distribute literature, and perform other tasks associated with a particular project. Another factor that is essential  to the success of an outreach program is identifying its objectives. The following questions should be helpful in determining what the program should accomplish: (1) Is the goal to increase the child's interaction with a more mature speaker or reader? (2) Should the program provide skill instruction for adults? (3) Should the program teach advocates how to facilitate acquisition of reading skills by children? and (4) Should the program promote family support for education and facilitate information exchange? Once the goals of a program have been established, some of the specific means of accomplishing these goals can be addressed. Final consideration should be given to when and where the program will occur. (HOD)",

The language samples were subjected to various speech act, grammatical, pronominal, propositional, and cohesion analyses. Preliminary findings suggested ways in which oral language competence related to the development of reading. To summarize, the interrelationships between the structural and conversational variables measured suggest that the more sophisticated maintenance of a topic and the tendency to initiate a remote or abstract topic may be related to (1) the  child's facility with the more complex structures of language, namely subordination and coordination, and (2) the occurrence of a range of psychological verbs, such as the linguistic verbs &quot;say&quot; and &quot;talk,&quot; the affective verbs &quot;love&quot; and &quot;hate,&quot; the cognitive verbs &quot;think&quot; and &quot;mean,&quot; and the perceptual verbs &quot;see&quot; and &quot;listen.&quot; In general, one side of oral competence, that which relates to the complexity of linguistic structure, appeared to be related to the acquisition of reading skills, while a second aspect of oral competence, pertaining to the initiation and maintenance of discourse topics in conversations, was not related to reading skill.

        "author":["Merrion, Margaret Dee"],
        "description":"The process of aesthetic education is not limited to the fine arts. Parallels may be identified in the language arts and particularly in the art of creative reading. As in a musical experience, a creative reader will apprehend the content of the literature and couple personal feelings with the events of the reading experience. Parallel brain processes between music and reading have also been identified in research. Musical experiences are functional in nurturing such abilities as listening skills, sequential thinking, and recognizing spatial and perceptual relationships, plus linear thinking, which are all germaine to the reading task. The relationship between music and reading can be analyzed in a parallel manner. Music has timbre and tonal nuances, while literature has  vocabulary, usage, and innuendo of the language. In music there is rhythm, and in literature there is style, including flow, pace, and transitions. Both the listener and the reader bring past experiences to the musical and reading event, and both experience a play of imagery as the music or story unfolds. Furthermore, both listening and reading entail a pleasurable mood and involve the intellectual activity of following the unfolding musical structure or literary plot, themes, and characters. Once these parallels are better understood, they may be effectively used within instructional programs to collaborate in bringing about a truly integrated education. (HTH)",

The purpose of the experiments was to test the compensation hypothesis within the interactive theory of reading, which assumes that reading involves many complementary levels of analysis and states that when one source of knowledge about the meaning of a text element is inoperative, other sources of knowledge may provide alternative ways of determining meaning. In the first experiment, 75 sixth grade students read texts that varied in cohesion (the linguistic features contributing to the unity of a text). The analyses of free recall, summarization, and sentence verification (recognition) measures  revealed no interactions between cohesion and vocabulary difficulty, although difficulty of vocabulary significantly affected students' performances on the recall tasks. In the second experiment, 82 sixth grade students read passages in which topic familiarity was varied to manipulate the availability of appropriate schemata. Familiarity with the topic and vocabulary difficulty significantly affected performance on the recall tasks, but the two factors did not interact. Thus, the results from these experiments did not support the compensation hypothesis. (RL)",

The central tenet of the tested model was its hierarchical notion of children's progress in learning to read, leading to the assumption that instruction must first be compatible with the learner's conceptual understanding of the topic before providing more complex instruction. Fifteen three- to six-year-old children participated in ten prereading lessons as members of either story-oriented groups (lower level of reading understanding) or print-oriented training groups. The story-oriented lessons emphasized activities matched to the children's level of reading  understanding, while the print-oriented lessons utilized activities both at the children's level and at the next level of reading understanding. Posttest data confirmed that the prereading lessons fostered children's interest and improved their knowledge about how to read. Analyses of teacher-student interactions indicated that the activities matched to the children's level of reading development were more effective than those that were not. (RL)",

        "description":"A prevalent theory about the cognitive aspect of humor is that most humorous stimuli are characterized by incongruity that is first perceived and then resolved. However, the combination of incongruity and resolution is not sufficient for constituting a joke--resolution should be inadequate as well. In other words, resolution is brought about by the receiver's disregard of an essential piece of information that is not explicitly stated but is typically assumed or inferred and that actually makes the initial information unambiguous. Thus, the incongruity only appears to be resolved because the resolution conflicts with valid reasoning made previously. The resolution is seemingly appropriate but virtually inappropriate. A joke is understood when the listener realizes not only the  incongruity or its possible resolution, but also the predication of the resolution on overlooked knowledge that seems essential for proper interpretation. In contrast with the concept of a joke, which is a category of stimuli, funniness is a continuum, not a category. Many factors, none of which is either a necessary or a sufficient condition in itself, may contribute to the amount of funniness, independently or interactively. (HOD)",

A MANOVA revealed the effect of topic on cohesive patterning but showed no effect of familiarity on cohesion. When the essays were ranked according to their level of coherence and compared to the ordering of texts according to the cohesive analysis, no relation appeared between coherence ranking and cohesive patterning.  Additional analyses of types of cohesive ties showed no significant relation between specific types of cohesive patterning and coherence.

The children and their parents were also interviewed to obtain an estimate of the children's reading background and current reading ability. Results showed that disabled readers differed significantly from normal readers in the number of syntactic structures comprehended and the number of subjects at each of the five linguistic stages.

To test this hypothesis, two second grade teachers, each categorized as a proponent of direct instruction, were studied using descriptive techniques. The first teacher, a regular classroom teacher, had taught for 7 years, was a leader of a second-grade teaching team, was completing a masters degree, welcomed professional growth opportunities, and aspired to be a leader in staff development. The second teacher was a professor and researcher of reading instruction who had previously taught in elementary schools. Each teacher was observed daily for 7 days, interviewed twice, and maintained a daily  journal about his or her teaching. These data were used to compile case studies of the two teachers. Analysis of the data revealed that, while both teachers were superficially similar in terms of professional concern, management, grouping, and treatment of high and low reading groups, they were quite different in their conception of instructional role, response to mandates, and use of commercial materials. The findings support the hypothesis that the term direct instruction can mean many things. (Appendixes contain the case studies of the two teachers.) (FL)",

The social identity and cultural norms of the young are registered in their use of language, and if literacy, as defined by others, calls the norms and identity into question, the gap between them and standard English will not be bridged. Teachers must understand that the contexts in which students revert to nonstandard English signal a disbelief in the value of literacy that interferes with the writing process. To generate a culture of literacy in the classroom that would stimulate a belief in the value of literacy, teachers should introduce materials that become the only context or experience from  which the students write. Writing tasks could result from fragmenting or isolating a single literary work. Value placed on a piece of literature and its language creates a miniature culture of literacy. (HOD)",

A teaching method that can prevent students' anxiety and dislike for sustained writing is to treat writing assignments metaphorically as a journey, in which the teacher draws a map from start to destination and participates with the students in the journey and all of its uncertainties. A book report of four coherent paragraphs is an ideal journey. A map is drawn containing sections marked introduction, main characters, the best  scene, and conclusion. Students write a paragraph for each section, in sequence, receiving whatever assistance they need while they write. After the first paragraph, students will have direction for the second paragraph, and most will be able to put ideas on paper with surprising ease. In four or five class periods they will be able to write a fairly well-organized composition. Anxiety will be reduced, confidence instilled, and a lesson will be taught that unites form and content with language development across a spectrum of vocabulary, diction, and sentence structure.

Serious curriculum change requires an explicit dependence upon improved applications of relevant theories. If teachers cannot learn to apply new theories deliberately, no change at all is likely to happen in the classroom. For example, rather than teach vocabulary directly, the crucial pedagogical implication of current theory is that words are learned indirectly in the context of a rich environment of active language use when they are needed for some other purpose; the challenge is to find teaching activities that indirectly  promote vocabulary development. Or, to teach literature using current theory, the teacher should help students enrich and extend their capacities to make meaning out of texts, recognizing the personal validity of the meaning that each student has derived from the text. Theories of language have emphasized that structure is used to express meaning, that meaning-making is the driving force for mastering structures, and that the most significant occasions for language development are those where language is a means rather than the end of learning. These theories suggest very limited possibilities for the direct as opposed to the indirect method of teaching language skills. (HOD)",

The revised rules were evaluated by 53 experienced boaters and 52 inexperienced boaters, who were given either the old rules or the new ones and then tested for their comprehension of the rules. Each question on the test required the subject to find the appropriate rule and apply its provisions. The subjects also noted the time it took them to complete each question and rated the overall difficulty they had in using the rules. Results showed that subjects using the revised rules were significantly better at identifying the proper rules, took less time  to answer questions about the rules, and rated them as easier to use than did subjects using the old rules.

        "description":"Complex conditional instructions (&quot;if X, then do Y&quot;) are prevalent in public documents, where they typically appear in prose form. Results of two previous studies have shown that conditional instructions become very difficult to process as the structure becomes more complex. A study was designed to investigate whether this difficulty can be alleviated by presenting conditional instructions in formats other than prose. It was hypothesized that the major sources of difficulty--disjunction, negation, hierarchical structure, and ambiguous punctuation--would be eliminated by the use of algorithms. Subjects were presented with a sample of complex conditional instructions in three formats--prose and two forms of algorithms, lists and flow charts. Results showed that conditional  instructions were easier to follow when presented as algorithms than as prose when subjects were prepared to follow algorithms by practice with feedback. In general, the algorithm helped performance when the condition in the instruction was logically complex. The overall superiority of algorithms was qualified, however, by three complications: (1) the difference between flowcharts and lists changed the speed relationships between prose and algorithms, (2) the effect of partial processing changed the speech relationships, and (3) the difficulty with the first exposure to the instruction drastically reversed the algorithm advantage in both speed and accuracy.

Writing samples consisted of randomly selected freshman placement examinations. Each of the 300 samples was analyzed for a frequency count of selected dysfunctions and for a transformational description of all dysfunctional sentences in order to determine if there were any frequently occurring anomalous structures that were unique to basic writing. Results indicated that particular structural errors did occur with greater frequency in developmental writing. The most significant finding with regard to the data  resulting from the frequency count was that each group largely exhibited its own pattern of errors. With regard to the use of combining transformations in dysfunctional sentences, however, no significant differences among the groups were evident.

The collected data indicated that nearly half of the respondent schools published newspapers at no cost and in cooperation with a community newspaper. Sixty school papers had subsidies from the school of $500 or less; the majority of these did not accept advertising, and neither subscriptions nor individual sales of newspapers made up the revenues. Responses in other categories indicated that school newspaper personnel were attempting to economize, in that many schools had typesetting equipment and 80% of the schools did their own paste-up and darkroom work. Other responses indicated a healthy  physical situation for newspapers in that over half published twice or more per month. A cross-tabulation of the total budget with the printing method showed that as budget size increased, the schools tended to publish independently. As circulation increased to about 1,900 schools tended to accept advertising, but only a fraction of those with a circulation of 2,000 or more accepted advertising. Those with a per issue cost tended to have offset printing and typesetting. Based on this study, the economic stability of school newspapers appears sound. (HTH)",

The first section of the document contains five essays dealing with race, sex, age, socioeconomic status, and language; orchestrating the literacy event; reading and writing as context-specific literacy events; stages to strategies in literacy development; and a methodology for studying written language growth and development. The major portion of the document contains an analysis of the first three of seven simple tasks the subjects of the study were asked to perform: reading print common to their environment, writing their names and anything else they wished to write, and drawing a picture of themselves and signing their  names. A detailed description of the procedures followed in the administration of these tasks is included in an appendix, as is a copy of the taxonomy derived from the data for purposes of data reduction and analysis. (A forthcoming volume will report on the remaining four tasks.) (HOD)",

The report outlines results from a series of experiments that specified several functions of pronouns in prose and that tested hypotheses concerning the development of anaphora in good and poor elementary and junior high school writers. Section one of the report discusses a series of experiments that study the functions of pronouns and repeated noun phrases in text comprehension. Section two describes studies on the development of these pronominal functions in children's narrative writing. Section three reports on several experiments examining children's skill in revising ambiguous pronouns and repeated  noun phrases. Section four discusses methodological issues concerning sample selection and the effects of various stimulus materials on children's output.

        "description":"Four recently developed computer programs can help students with the composition process. The first, a prewriting program, helps students prepare to write by asking them a series of questions, similar to those an instructor would ask, intended to help them think more deeply about their subject. The second writing program also contains prewriting questions, but attempts to show subsequently how information gathered during the questioning can be structured during the actual writing stage by creating a model rough draft of the essay. The third program, developed as a text editing system for journalism assignments, relies on a matching routine that takes a series of predetermined key words and searches for them in the student's news story. The program acknowledges pertinent  information and points out errors with an explanation when the pertinent information is missing. In the fourth program, also a text editing program, the computer &quot;reads&quot; the entered essays, then prints out statistics on sentence length, use of prepositions, and use of &quot;to be&quot; verbs and nouns ending in &quot;tion.&quot; The statistics are followed by an appropriate warning about convoluted sentences or the excess of the &quot;tion&quot; nouns or &quot;to be&quot; verbs. These programs do not actually understand the essay, and better programs will be developed as more people contribute to the task; but they do successfully take students through their assigned phases in the writing process, freeing the instructor for more individualized instruction.

        "description":"Teachers read student papers with both eager and anxious expectancy about discourse they have caused but not written. Whatever the teachers may have said about what they will look for as they read, they still measure each paper against their ideas about appropriate performances in each of the categories of textual analysis. They are not reacting to the texts as would a reader who had not instigated them. This reading process is also a physical act, insofar as the teacher both marks and writes on the text at hand while continuing to read. During this many-faceted experience, teachers who are reading are taken by many moods. Reading student writing more closely resembles the careful reading of criticism than it does reading for most other purposes. The essential difference,  however, is the teacher's supratextual relation to student texts. Teachers should recognize their dualism, seeing that an internal divorce between their roles as composition teachers and literature teachers is perhaps caused by double visions they have about the proper status of a text. Such a recognition--that teachers individually experience tension and frustration when they read student writing because they hold conflicting but unarticulated values that would have them both construct and deconstruct any text--can liberate them from those very tensions.

The investigation proceeds by discussing myth from the perspectives of both traditional and contemporary disciplines, then considers the universality of myth, its religious impulse, and its functions. Using examples from television news coverage (the Iranian crisis) and popular culture (other television programing, such as soap operas and situation comedies like &quot;All in the Family,&quot; and the John Wayne myth), the paper delineates several functions of myth: (1) to interpret and fit unfamiliar situations into old symbolic molds; (2) to create exemplary models for a whole society by translating a single life-history into an archetype; (3) to construct a &quot;language of  argument,&quot; whereby conflict is presented and mediated, such as the resolution of contemporary social problems in the science fiction series &quot;Star Trek&quot;; and (4) to organize reality, history, and experience into recognizable patterns. The paper also examines the ways in which culture, myth, ritual, and ideology are entwined, and postulates the effects of challenging myths, creating myths, and destroying myths (demythologizing). In this last respect, and noting that myths must be unrecognized as being such to be potent, the paper questions the role of the communication scholar in exposing myths to public scrutiny. (RL)",

The first assumption is that speech can influence the beliefs and behavior of those to whom it is addressed; but this country's increasingly centralized wealth and political power create self-interest groups capable of opposing the messages of others' free speech. The second assumption is that those who have a stake in decision making (all citizens) will have the motivation and communication competence to express themselves; but rampant illiteracy and inadequate education leave a vast number of Americans at a disadvantage. The third assumption  is the &quot;de facto&quot; freedom to express oneself; but often citizens prefer silence to censure from family, employers, and neighbors, or to harrassment from vigilante groups. The final condition for free speech is access to channels through which it can reach its intended audience; but this access remains contingent upon media &quot;gatekeepers&quot; and is reserved for the wealthy. Creation of publicly owned competing channels in radio, television, and newsprint is one possible solution. However, the legal right of expression must be woven into the psychological and economic fabric of American society to make the First Amendment more of a right than an empty promise. (HTH)",

        "description":"For nearly half a century, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been exercising its authority to grant and deny applications for broadcast licenses. In the process of comparison used by the FCC to assess qualified new applicants, two considerations weigh heavily: (1) the best practicable service to the public, and (2) maximum diffusion of control of the mass communications media. Sometimes comparative hearings play a vital role in the Commission's efforts to consider such substantive criteria as ownership and ownership diversity. However, since the comparative hearings have proven to be neither an effective nor an efficient administrative procedure for choosing among qualified applicants, the United States Congress has authorized the FCC to use a lottery approach, a  system of random selection. For the system to include underrepresented owners, the Commission could assign a particular, though arbitrary, preference to those applicants or the Commission could choose to assess the degree of each minority applicant's lack of representation and assign a preference factor to each minority applicant. The latter approach would accommodate differences among minority applicants. Nevertheless, as efficient as a lottery may be for allocating a license or permit, its effectiveness at securing the best practicable service or promoting ownership diversification--the two standard comparative issues--is suspect. Any system of random selection limits the Commission's discretion and inevitably leaves important decisions and choices to chance. (HOD)",

Subjects were 46 third grade students, 47 seventh grade students, and 54 undergraduate college students. These grade levels were chosen to represent individuals in the concrete operational stages, in transition from concrete to formal operational stages, and in the formal operational stages as identified by Piaget. The subjects were asked to judge velocity and distance in three conditions in which  images photographed by lenses of different focal lengths were compared. In addition, the subjects completed tests to measure their experience with television. The results suggest that the focal length of a television camera lens influences how a large percentage of viewers perceive velocity and distance in televised events. The results also confirm a progression in cognitive development from concrete operational thought to formal operational thought as discussed by Piaget. (FL)",

The authors used a questionnaire and telephone interviews to gather data on the models' operations and effects. Model one, in New England, is an individual membership organization made up of six state units; model two is an internship program in North Carolina operated by a university women's center; model three provides training of  individuals selected from state offices in the Southwest by a regional educational laboratory; and model four is an information exchange and linkage system operated by a monitoring organization in the South. The authors point out that the assessment data are too preliminary for a summative evaluation. However, they feel that there are indicators of success for each model.

        "description":"After first glancing at previous research suggesting that schools (and principals) had little effect on students, this research review focuses on six research studies that suggest the opposite: schools (and their principals) can make an important difference in student achievement. The review highlights Michael Rutter's three-year study of British ten-year olds, which concluded that the &quot;ethos&quot; or norms of a school exert more influence on students than any other factor. Also discussed is Wilbur Brookover's study of Michigan elementary schools that reached a similar conclusion: a successful school has a climate that furthers success. These findings are seen to support those of Gilbert Austin, who found in addition that unusually successful schools all had a principal or other  leader who was exceptional. Ronald Edmonds, who reviewed studies of effective schools, is also cited as finding that strong administrative leadership is the most important factor in school effectiveness. Finally, two other studies are briefly mentioned that emphasize the importance of leadership to school effectiveness. The review concludes that schools do positively affect the achievement of students by creating norms that support achievement and that the person who has the most influence on these is the principal.

        "description":"The movement toward school consolidation was triggered by James Bryant Conant's contention that larger schools are more efficient and offer more comprehensive programs. Many studies seem to support the claim that larger schools are cheaper to operate. Yet problems with these studies include wide variation in the minimum, optimum, and maximum sizes favored by writers and difficulties in comparing cost figures. Furthermore, there is great disagreement in the research about whether larger schools in fact offer higher quality education. Some studies suggest that schools can be both too small and too large to be effective, with 1,600 to 1,700 suggested as the optimum size for high schools. The most reliable studies show that size makes no difference in academic achievement. Regardless  of research findings, parents favor smaller schools. Research suggests that this predilection may result from the presence of innovative and involved teachers, supportive atmosphere, and closer connections between principal and staff in small schools. Perhaps educators should look for ways to overcome shortcomings of small schools and accentuate their advantages. (Author/JM)",

The papers concentrate on three types of learning time: \"time on task,\" which is the amount of time students are actually engaged in learning; \"allocated time,\" the time a teacher schedules for a learning activity; and \"academic learning time,\" the time a student spends successfully learning. Several papers relate time on task to contextual, instructional, and pupil variables and to the match between a particular student and the difficulty of a task. Other papers suggest a model of the relationship of time to learning and note the significance of time in the mastery  learning and direct instruction techniques of teaching. A workshop on how to increase academic learning time in the classroom is described in one article, while the final paper examines the relationship of another kind of time, teachers' lesson preparation time, to academic achievement and students' prior achievement levels.

Part 1 provides a brief historic sketch of supervision in the United States and then moves directly to the issue of evaluating and understanding teaching. The three faces of supervision, the scientific, artistic, and clinical views, are discussed in Part 2. The theory of supervisory practice proposed here seeks to integrate the three views around the theme of helping teachers to be more effective. Part 3 is concerned with the human factor in supervision. Part 4 examines the impact of the curriculum and bureaucratic structure on the process of supervision. Included is an analysis of political and  social forces that affect educational policy. Part 5 assesses the possibilities for and new directions in developing the field of supervision and evaluation. A state of the art summary is provided, followed by possibilities for promoting supervisors' development. (Author/MLF)",

Researchers used correlation coefficients and measures of central tendency and dispersion to analyze data on educational revenues, school district wealth, tax effort, district expenditures per pupil, ethnicity, family income, and urban location. This volume of the report presents the background to California's finance reform efforts (including the 1971 Serrano v. Priest decision), describes the disparities in California's public school finances, and analyzes the changes occurring after the 1972 reform law in fiscal neutrality, distribution of revenues among ethnic and income groups, and spending disparities  among districts with different ethnic and income compositions. Among the authors' conclusions are that different ethnic groups are geographically concentrated in different ways and that the 1972 law caused (1) a mildly positive reform in school finances, (2) no significant decrease in wealth discrimination, (3) a small decrease in spending disparities, and (4) a small increase in state aid to urban districts.

The author summarizes Douglas Mitchell and Charles Kerchner's concept of the \"generations\" of bargaining--from meeting and conferring to good-faith bargaining to negotiated policy--and then discusses current issues being studied by other researchers. Among these issues are conflict over the scope of bargaining, perceived lack of administrative power, uniformity of contract enforcement, allocation of teacher time and other resources, and services to the handicapped. The research studies covered uniformly indicate that collective bargaining has had and is  having a significant effect on public schools, often in unintended ways. Both administrators and teachers (management and unions) can benefit from the research, this paper maintains, as they seek to make more effective use of collective bargaining to improve public education.

        "description":"The question examined in this paper is whether variability in the quantity of schooling students receive in different curricular areas is a contributor to observed differences in achievement not only among students attending different high schools, but among students in the same high school. A conceptual framework enumerates the determinants of achievement, including school and community characteristics, student background, and quantity of schooling in the specific curricular areas of mathematics, English, foreign language, fine arts, social studies, and science. The sample used was 9,195 high school seniors in 725 schools taken from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, a nationally representative probability sample of high school seniors. The results  suggest that quantity of schooling has a positive effect on academic achievement. The more the achievement is school-related, the larger is the resulting effect of the quantity of schooling. This was especially true for mathematics. Quantity of schooling also had positive effects on achievement in science and English; less clear results were found in the areas of vocabulary and reading comprehension, although quantity of schooling did continue to have a positive effect on achievement.

Cross-tabulation of the data indicates, among other things, that preference for smaller public sector accounts for only some of the favorable vote on Proposition 2 1/2;  that &quot;yes&quot; voters both preferred tax reform and expected Proposition 2 1/2 to accomplish it; and that expectations of reduced governmental waste, inefficiency, and corruption, especially at the local government level, explain a large proportion of the vote favoring the proposition.

The planning issues include the democratization of educational opportunity, the quality of instruction and learning, the impact of education through technology on rural areas, and the participation of people in their own education. Each of these issues is discussed in light of evidence from four case studies and from other sources. Much of the text is devoted to four relatively successful applications of communication media for education and development. Three case studies involve the use of radio: extended learning in the Dominican Republic, qualitative improvement of mathematics teaching in Nicaragua, and community action in Tanzania. The fourth  study looks at the experimental use of satellite television broadcasting in India. The authors show how cost estimates depend on the level of technology adopted and on the context of its use. Conclusions and recommendations for planners close the report. (Author/MLF)",

The three principal objectives of the study were to explore (1) the potential for designing knowledge networks to achieve better utilization of existing knowledge, (2) the application of cost-effectiveness to educational planning efforts, and (3) improved sensitivity of knowledge networks to the distinctive needs of primary groups,  particularly among the rural poor. Although not recommending a single optimal strategy for improving the utilization of educational planning knowledge, the report draws on a range of past planning experiences to illustrate some of the options and tactics available.

        "description":"Resulting from a 1980 workshop and a survey of 12 selected distance learning systems (or correspondence study programs), this paper had four aims: (1) to provide a framework to describe distance learning systems using audiovisual media and to locate the 12 surveyed institutions within that framework, (2) to identify common problem areas in the planning and management of audiovisual media, (3) to discover principles of planning and management to use in training, and (4) to identify how training and research might improve planning and management in this area and the methods by which this training and research can best be accomplished. Topics covered by the 11 chapters of the report include the analysis of the use of audiovisual media in the 12 institutions, the educational  functions of audiovisual media, transmission and distribution, the production of broadcast materials, nonbroadcast audiovisual media (such as tape players and telephones), costs, feedback from users, institutional research, program evaluation, and training and research needs. The paper concludes that television and radio are of less significance in such teaching systems than was expected. Print is still the primary means of instruction, although the use of nonbroadcast media is increasing. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In lesser developed countries, interest has been growing in the role evaluation plays in the improvement of media-based education programs. Such programs include the use of television or radio to communicate a useful message to students, the general populace, or a particular group (such as mothers or small farmers). The message to be communicated may concern general academic skills (such as reading or math) or specific information (such as the advantages of breast feeding or of a particular farming technique). In lesser developed countries, such programs are usually initiated by political leaders or other high-level decision-makers as a way of attacking social problems. In October 1980 a workshop was held on methods of evaluating and monitoring media-based education programs.  This document, prepared as the basic discussion paper for the workshop, reviews the role of evaluation and research in various stages of the policy-making and implementation process and stresses the need to relate evaluation to system planning as a whole, rather than confining it to summative research or to the formative development of materials. This paper has been revised to incorporate the major themes of the workshop discussions, including the participants' criticisms and recommendations. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"To what extent can school principals provide effective educational leadership? Research shows that, contrary to textbook images, principals react to their circumstances instead of controlling them and that they spend most of their time on administrative, not instructional, matters. Further entrenching principals in their administrative role is the fact that the principalship is legitimized more by its position in a bureaucratic hierarchy than by any instructional expertise on the part of the principal. However, principals could base their legitimacy on instructional expertise. To do so they must take a more active role in instruction; recent research, for instance, shows that effective schools' principals are more active in instructional supervision, evaluation, and leadership. A  redefinition of the principal's role will mean that principals must acquire new skills and practice closer overseeing and improvement of instruction. This instructional supervision must be based on three points: the classroom should be the focus of activity, teachers' and pupils' concerns must take priority, and principals should give teachers objective feedback on their classroom work.

        "description":"Educational change is viewed in Australia as a series of events involving four components: the decision to change, the announcement of the change, inservice activities oriented to the change, and informal support activities. Research in the U.S., however, indicates that change is a highly personal process undergone first by individuals and only secondly by institutions and that it entails educators' development of personal feelings and skills related to the innovation. Using the model of the seven Stages of Concern About the Innovation, the researchers found that individuals experience different types of concerns, of varying intensity, at any one time in the change process; that concerns change from one stage to another, although not quickly; and that different institutions have  different profiles of concern. Among the implications of these findings are that change implementation approaches concerned only with methods and procedures will probably be irrelevant to educators' personal concerns; that educators' concerns about themselves are normal and legitimate; and that inservice and other support activities should be patterned after each institution's profile of concern and should be planned for several years' duration.

        "description":"Educational administrators' concern with planning and time management results from the fragmentation of their daily activities, which research has documented, and their consequent search for order and control. Time is important because its scarcity affects productivity and its use has social-psychological effects on staffs' perceptions of administrators' priorities. Time management can increase administrative effectiveness through increased control of time and through the wiser use of time that is achieved by setting priorities. Administrators should begin managing their time by keeping a log of their daily activities and then analyzing what priorities can be inferred from the log, how results relate to time spent on activities, what activities were delegated, and to what extent  others were involved in particular activities. The log will reveal administrators as doers of tasks rather than managers or leaders. Administrators need to become leaders, which may involve doing less. To do this they should determine priorities, on which in turn they should base written plans that include objectives, strategies, and time guidelines. In setting priorities, administrators should distinguish between the few vital activities and the many trivial ones. (Author/RW)",

The author contends that the Research, Development, and Dissemination model of educational change, with its implicit view of change being caused from the outside, has impeded the implementation of research findings in classrooms. Furthermore, teachers are not avid readers of research literature, which is fragmented, difficult to locate, hard to interpret in operational terms, impersonal, and characterized by conflicting findings. A more effective way to assure that research is used is for researchers, teachers, and principals to work collaboratively in  classrooms, isolating questions worth exploring, collecting objective data that accurately reflects classroom occurrences, and analyzing that data with a view to reaching informed decisions on whether or not to change.

        "description":"Educational research suggests several ways that principals can affect teachers' curriculum choices. Although some researchers maintain that the use of extrinsic rewards (such as praise or allocation of resources) has some effect on teachers, others have found that teachers are much more apt to be influenced by intrinsic rewards such as student achievement. Principals can foster teachers' pursuit of intrinsic rewards by helping them with classroom management, by arranging testimonials from teachers who have successfully improved their teaching, and by publicly praising student achievement. Research findings also suggest that because of their central role in determining the norm structure of the school, principals can significantly influence teachers by acting as role models for  professional conduct and by displaying enthusiasm for innovations. Some organizational theory and research suggests that allowing teachers increased participation in decision-making will increase administrator influence. Finally, although there is no conclusive research on the topic, there is considerable anecdotal evidence that the social behavior of principals affects teacher receptiveness to principal intervention in curriculum matters. In sum, research shows that curriculum leadership is possible for highly motivated principals. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"IMPACT II is a teacher-to-teacher networking program designed to improve teaching in New York City schools. Teachers who have been working on new ideas that need more refinement are eligible for $300 grants offered to program developers. Teachers who would like to adopt ideas previously developed by the program may receive $200 as replicator grantees. Since 1979, about 500 teachers have received grants. To facilitate exchanges among teachers, IMPACT II supports a wide range of networking activities, including newsletters, product catalogues, receptions, and teacher assistance. The autonomy of teachers is emphasized. Program outcomes were evaluated with questionnaires from 136 grantees plus a control group of 44 grant applicants. Findings indicate, among other things, that 85  percent more of IMPACT II participants improved their teaching than did the control group. Overall findings suggest that teacher participation and control increases willingness to try new ideas and that teacher networking provides the vehicle for peer learning and support. In the fall of 1980, Community School District One began a District Incentive Grants Program roughly modeled on IMPACT II. Although successful in many ways, variance from the original model caused it to have fewer long-term effects than IMPACT II. (Author/JM)",

The combination of attentional and inhibitory control strategies was most effective in enhancing Ss' cognitive performance. Results were interpreted to support the hypothesis that impulse and attention control problems occur concurrently in hyperactive Ss, although remediation in attentional deploying strategies is necessary for enhancing their cognitive performance. Findings further suggest that training solely in inhibitory control is not  sufficient for enhancing cognitive performance among hyperactive children. (Author)",

To facilitate maintenance, all Ss received isolated, followed by simultaneous, presentation of situations and those Ss who met certain criteria received reinforcement fading and alteration from external to self reinforcement. To increase likelihood of generalization to an actual fire, Ss were taught in their own home and were presented with simulated cues. Generalization to a second room was trained to Ss meeting criteria.  Results indicated that the procedure was effective in both training and maintaining emergency exiting skills in the simulated setting.

The first two sections focus on the principal's role in family impact analysis and characteristics of families with handicapped children as they relate to the school. The next section gives principles of policy development (such as using a team approach and respecting confidentiality), and suggests a multiactivity project to identify policy needs through talking with parents and teachers, reviewing and analyzing existing written policies, and gathering information about the special education family population. Half of the guide consists of five checklists to use in developing school policy. These include a principal  checklist (a list of general guidelines concerning the principal's role); school policy checklist (questions grouped in categories); teacher checklist (list of questions to ask teachers about their concerns and practices); family checklist (possible discussion questions for parents regarding their relationship with the school); and family data questionnaire (to obtain information on types of families in the special education program).

Ss were given free and serial recall tasks and interviewed about their understanding of memory processes. Deficits in the recall of the learning disabled children were found, as expected. Examination of interview responses and study behaviors during recall led to the proposal that learning disabled children, although they have knowledge of strategy use and task demands in free and serial recall equivalent to that of average readers, lack general awareness of memory and variables affecting memory, and are less likely to monitor their own state of knowledge by using appropriate self testing strategies during study.

Analysis of 6 months of observation in the two programs resulted in the following conclusions: (1) administration of early intervention programs is accomplished largely through the controlled distribution of special knowledge about the program to the staff, participating families, local political structures, and the general public; (2) the more centralized a program administration is, the less the program will be responsive to traditional or changing community needs, and the absorption of the program into the existing network of community services will be reduced; (3)  federal early intervention policies will be adapted by local political structures to meet local needs for control over program operation and evaluation and for community support; (4) early intervention programs will not necessarily serve those children and families for whom the programs were intended; (5) regardless of intended goals, centrally funded/locally administered programs are conducted so that program design is determined by perceived program needs rather than perceived family needs; (6) the local allocation of early intervention resources is determined by political and economic factors in those communities eligible for the resources rather than by an assessed need for such services; and (7) there is no difference in degree of program-community integration between programs under  public school sponsorship and those under private nonprofit sponsorship.

The following public information efforts were conducted: news releases and newspaper articles, newsletters, brochures, radio and television announcements, and presentations to parents and professionals. One to one assistance and training were implemented through information and strategies shared by telephone; information, written materials mailed to parents, professionals, and others; and individual assistance, called parent cases. Training sessions were held in the St. Joseph  County area to provide parents with the opportunity to directly ask questions, receive materials on parents' rights and responsibilities, learn the local educational services available, and share information and concerns with other parents. Training sessions in St. Joseph County and other areas of the state were evaluated as beneficial by both parents and professionals. Through the use of handbooks, training units, and copies of federal and state regulations, the IPTP and Task Force staff attempted to expand parents' knowledge and skills for effectively working with school personnel. Three different evaluations were used for the 2 day regional parent resources (RPR) training. Among findings were that RPRs needed specific suggestions or strategies outlining how to make contacts with  schools and agencies, and that the RPR conducted trainings attended by IPTP staff were, overall, very well organized. Followup training was conducted to discuss RPR activities, local issues, and federal special education policies. IPTP staff maintained contact with organizations at the local, state, and national level. Materials were disseminated to parents, professionals, and regional parent representatives during each level of project activity. (SB)",

The Vocational Education Administrator Training Materials Development project developed an inservice training module which uses simulation and role playing to orient vocational education administrators to the major issues in the delivery of services to disabled students. The Professional Fitness Among Special Needs Personnel--Burnout Prevention and Rehabilitation project led to the development of a preservice model to assist  prospective educators who will be working with special needs students, to remain vibrant, enthusiastic, and proactive in their teaching. Two projects, titled &quot;A Communication Model for Special Education and Counseling Programs&quot; and &quot;Interdisciplinary Collaboration at Cornell--Teacher Preparation in Home Economics and Agriculture,&quot; developed annotated bibliographies of materials and resources available for assisting college faculty in meeting their special education needs. Two additional projects, &quot;Interdisciplinary Workshop--Educational and Health Professions&quot; and &quot;Mainstreaming--The Integration of Handicapped Individuals into Regular Education Settings,&quot; illustrated appropriate workshop formats to promote cross training of professionals involved in the education of individuals with  handicapping conditions.

Among nine findings of the report are the following: the service delivery system is driven by the needs of larger and better organized groups of developmentally disabled advocates; there is no accepted theory of etiology, diagnosis, or treatment modality; parents must negotiate the maze of available services without guidance; services vary depending upon location; and there is a critical need for developing day programs for the autistic from preschool  through adult age. Eight recommendations are made, only three of which would require new funding. Among the cost free recommendations are establishing the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities as the lead agency serving the autistic with primary responsibility and accountability for meeting their needs; to establish a State Autism Task Force as to identify, formally assess the needs of, and plan a course of service development for the autistic; and to involve parents in planning treatment and programing when possible. New funds would be required to conduct a survey to identify all service providers in the State serving and/or willing to serve the autistic; identify all individuals in the state with autism; and expand services by 100 new community residential beds for  autistic individuals. Appended are addresses of five autism advocacy agencies in New York and responses of various state agencies to the Commission's report. (DB)",

Results indicated the eight roles stressed in the preparation program were rated by the directors as present in successful first year supervisors of special education; directors agreed that the 40 competencies were demonstrable by the successful supervisors; and the roles and competencies rated highest reflect the view that the supervisor serves primarily as a resource consultant to teachers of exceptional children rather than as an administrator. The three competencies  rated highest by the directors were monitoring implementation of individualized education programs, planning staff improvement, and serving as resource to staff. (Author/DB)",

This description of processes and strategies is based on the learner's viewpoint. Strategies are considered as a subclass of plans and are defined by means of two criteria: problem orientedness and consciousness. The criterion of problem orientedness implies that the learner is having a problem in reaching a particular learning or communicative goal. The criterion of consciousness implies that the learner is consciously aware of such a problem. Strategies are defined as potentially conscious plans for solving what presents itself  as a problem in reaching a particular goal. Learners may attempt to solve problems in second language learning by means of psycholinguistic strategies (adopted if the problem is in hypothesis formation) or behavioral learning strategies (if the problem is in hypothesis testing or in increasing automatization). Communication strategies are used to solve problems in the planning or the realization of speech production. They may be subclassified into formal reduction, functional reduction, and achievement strategies. Pedagogical issues relating to learning/communication processes and strategies are discussed.

The adoption of language resources in the home  and community involves both language skills and culture. Learning culture gives content to language lessons and provides insight into the lives of non-English speakers that is so essential to attitudinal change. For younger students, use of make-believe or role playing and show-and-tell in Spanish aids vocabulary and syntax building and the development of oral fluency. For older students, these activities can be modified to help the student focus on lexicon, phrasing, intonation, expressions, and career experiences or plans. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"The fact that some people learn a second language more easily than others has prompted numerous studies designed to link one factor or another with successful language learning. This work examines a large number of these studies to assess the importance of various factors involved in language learning. The influencing factors suggested are grouped into three categories: personal, situational, and linguistic factors. Considered first is the particular set of personal characteristics each individual brings to the task of learning a second language. These include general intelligence, language aptitude, attitude and motivation, psychological traits, age, socioeconomic status, and sex. The variety of learning situations is then discussed. Situational factors include the setting in  which the language is learned and the amount and distribution of time devoted to it. In addition, if the language is learned formally, the method used and the characteristics of the teacher must be considered. Finally, linguistic factors are examined. These include both the differences between the first and second languages and the characteristics of the second language itself. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"The Swedish policy that work experience can be used as a substitute for formal academic entrance requirements for higher education is assessed. The social and economic background of introducing work experience in higher education policy is described, and the significance of work experience to enrollment patterns and for the form and content of higher education is addressed. The general characteristics of the Swedish admissions system and the effects on recruitment and admissions are outlined. Additionally, the effects of work experience on the educational process are considered from a theoretical viewpoint. Distinctions are made between three different functions of work experience as a ground for admission: work experience as a substitute for upper secondary school education  (alternative route) for adults; additional credit in selection for all students; and formal requirement for admission to some study programs. Work experience also is classified as a basis for academic studies according to its content (relevant professional experience, work experience, in general, and life experience). The admissions schemes in Sweden and Denmark are compared, and those found in a few other countries are briefly noted. Some Swedish findings regarding different ways of valuing work experience as an admission criterion are summarized. It is suggested that institutions that are mainly oriented toward traditional groups do not have the same possibilities of using experience as do institutions with an educational design oriented toward nontraditional students. A bibliography is  appended. (SW)",

The officers of 481 public colleges and 864 private colleges were mailed questionnaires, and 544 responses representing 266 public and 336 private colleges were received. Of the respondents, 477 were males and 66 were females, and the following titles were identified: presidents, chancellors, deans, vice-presidents, and provosts. In regard to academic preparation, social science fields were the major emphases at the bachelor's, master's, and terminal degree levels for those respondents who supplied this information. Seventeen different types of experiences in four categories (teaching, public service, professional practice, and administration) were identified as professional experience before becoming college  and university presidents. Presidents of both public and private institutions perceived governing board relations, planning and administering the budget, and program development and improvements to be significantly more important to their overall functioning than their handling of student affairs. They also rated planning and administering the budget as being significantly more important than personnel tasks. Tasks that were rated as consuming the most time along with tasks perceived as important are analyzed separately for representatives from public and private colleges. Both groups also rated the stress potential of tasks and challenging current and future issues that confront higher education. Among the issues that were identified are: fiscal responsibility, tapping traditional and  nontraditional funding sources, and responding to enrollment declines. Implications regarding training leaders in the field of higher education are addressed. (SW)",

The information is based primarily on the 1979 Survey of Doctorate Recipients but also is derived from the annual Surveys of Earned Doctorates. Demographic and employment statistics for the total population of Ph.D.s in science, engineering, and the humanities are presented, and U.S.-born and foreign-born doctorate recipients are treated separately. Other tables describe the pattern of academic employment among the racial/ethnic groups, including such variables as academic rank and tenure; the pattern of nonacademic employment of Ph.D.s in these fields; and the pattern of remuneration of science, engineering, and humanities Ph.D.s by racial/ethnic group, in both  academic and nonacademic employment. Findings include the following: of the 395,000 science, engineering, and humanities Ph.D.s in the United States in 1979, 2.4 percent were U.S.-born minorities and 5.7 percent were foreign-born minorities; of these minority Ph.D.s, 88.6 percent were in science/engineering fields and 11.4 percent were in humanities fields; Asian/Pacific Islanders accounted for 69.3 percent of all science/engineering minority Ph.D.s; the biological and behavioral sciences (psychology and social sciences) accounted for about 60 percent of the science/engineering Ph.D. degrees earned by U.S.-born minorities, and only 48 percent of those held by U.S.-born whites; and 37 percent of all minority Ph.D.s in the humanities had earned their degrees in modern languages and  literature.

        "description":"The impact of early retirement plans and career change on the professional and personal lives of professors and on the manpower and fiscal structures of the universities they serve is examined. The book is based on more than 50 accounts of academics who took early retirement options and a comprehensive review of incentive programs for early retirement, along with mid-career change programs. Chapter 1 explains why colleges and universities are interested in mid-career change and early retirement programs, and outlines the various options now available. Career options in industry, government, and academia are analyzed in chapter 2. Chapter 3 offers an analysis of the experiences of 70 of the first 100 or so persons who were induced to retire early, covering such topics as  motivation, satisfaction with the decision, and ways that early retirement affected their well-being. Chapter 4 discusses the fiscal considerations involved in early retirement plans. Chapter 5 examines the manpower questions, including such questions as how incentive early-retirement plans will affect the age distribution of university and college faculties and whether early-retirement and mid-career change will modify age and talent distribution. Chapter 6 contains a discussion of the funding requirements and tax implications of increased-benefit retirement programs and an analysis of the legal aspects of age discrimination. The final chapter sketches the policy implications of mid-career change and early retirement, presents summary evaluation of the early-retirement schemes, and  outlines a number of considerations for colleges, universities, and faculty members contemplating these options. In the final chapter several policy considerations are discussed, including: developing a mechanism for faculty review and evaluation; providing retirement and financial counseling; dissemination information about the options; and recognizing potential contributions from Emerkiti. Appendices include a guide to administrator interviews and a guide to early retiree interviews. (Author/LC)",

        "description":"The publication record of women in the &quot;Journal of Educational Psychology&quot; (JEP) over the past decade was examined. The relationship between the proportion of women belonging to Division 15 (Educational Psychology) of the American Psychological Association and the proportion of women publishing in JEP during 1969, 1974, and 1979 was assessed. The number, sex, and ordinal position of authors of all articles, except editorials, published in JEP in these years were recorded. In 1969, women constituted approximately 20.6 percent of the membership in Division 15 and were authors in JEP 23 percent of the time. In 1979, women constituted 25.2 percent of Division 15 membership and represented 27 percent of the authors in JEP. A significantly higher proportion of men than women published  alone in 1969; this relationship was not found for 1974 and 1979. A significantly higher percentage of women than men published with the opposite sex during all three years. However, the percentage of women first authors relative to men has been steadily increasing from 24 percent in 1969 to 33 percent in 1974 to 42 percent in 1979. It is concluded that women educational psychologists have consistently published in proportion to their membership in Division 15 for the past decade. Since there are far fewer women than men in educational psychology, it is not surprising to find that women published more often with men. (SW)",

According to the Executive Committee's assessment, the project increased quantity and quality of continuing education programming, which included refresher courses and teleconferences, and it established a strong network to coordinate continuing education. All registered and licensed practical nurses in the state were sent a questionnaire to evaluate the project, and 1,670 responded (27 percent). Of the respondents, 81 percent were registered nurses, and 19 percent were licensed practical nurses. Fifty-one percent of the registered nurse respondents  indicated that their continuing education needs were being met, while only 41 percent of licensed practical nurses felt their needs were being met. Among the reasons for needs not being met are the following: inconvenient location of programs, cost of workshops, and inability to obtain release time from the employer to attend. In addition to nurses, employers of nurses were surveyed to obtain their perceptions of the extent to which the project was meeting the continuing education needs of nurses. The quality of continuing education activities and their impact on health care in the state also were assessed. During the three years, 42 educational offerings were offered to 948 registered and 339 licensed practical nurses. (SW)",

After a review of the foreign exchange picture in the United States and around the world, the population at UCLA is profiled. It was found that the GSE foreign student population is about 8 percent of that of the entire university, which in 1979-80 was the seventh highest in the United States. The pattern of country of origin is similar to that of the United States in general. Less than half are exempted from  English language course requirements. More foreign student applicants have been accepted recently (two out of three). Although some services are now provided, five recommendations are made for improvement of services: (1) a short orientation for GSE foreign students, following the general foreign student orientation and before the general GSE orientation; (2) a support network, including mentors; (3) extending invitations to foreign students to join in foreign student activities and use the services; (4) a recruitment strategy to increase the size and quality of the foreign student applicant pool; and (5) a survey of problems and needs for further action.

The reporting system is based on the program established in 1965 by the Committee on Academic Science and Engineering of the Federal Council on Science and Technology. Part I, &quot;Universities and Colleges,&quot; shows that: federal obligations to universities and colleges for all purposes declined between 1978 and 1979 by a record 17 percent to a level of $6.2 billion; the 17 percent decline in federal obligations contrasted sharply with the continued growth in both total expenditures by institutions of higher education and federal purchases of goods and services; nearly all the declines occurred in funds  from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; universities in California received the most federal funds; institutions that grant science/engineering doctorates or equivalent degrees received 86 percent of all federal obligations; the majority of federal obligations at publicly-controlled universities and colleges were for R &amp; D programs; the top 100 universities and colleges received 71 percent of all federal support; and federal support for all science activities other than R &amp; D increased for the third consecutive year. Part II, &quot;University-Administered FFRDC's,&quot; presents the following findings: 15 of the federally funded R &amp; D centers (FFRDC's) have been in existence throughout the 1963-79 period covered by the survey; the four agencies that sponsored university-administered  FFRDC'S in 1979 have accounted for at least 97 percent of all science support of these organizations since 1963; and the leading 10 organizations accounted for 94 percent of all funds in 1979, the same proportion as 1978. In Part III, &quot;Independent Nonprofit Institutions and Nonprofit-Administered FFRDC's,&quot; it is concluded that federal support to the 530 independent nonprofit organizations totaled $869 million for research and the six FFRDC's administered by nonprofit institutions received a record total of $416 million in 1979.

        "description":"The traditional sellers' market in higher education has become a buyers' market, with both the nature of the student body and the services offered being changed. Marketing, as a comprehensive tool for planning and delivery of educational services, offers an integrated method for meeting the disparate demands growing from the shift to a longer learning cycle. New baseline data will be needed to supplement and even supplant current research on the traditional college population. To date, no unified approach such as the business world has taken exists in higher education. This is reflected in the literature of postsecondary marketing. However, the need to understand how the exchange of services occurs in the higher education marketplace is imperative, and is not, as some believe, a  perversion of academic ideals. M. S. Knowles' theories of adult education are particularly applicable to the demographic shift in postsecondary education because his contrasting of the force-feeding of young adults in college (pedagogy) with the experience-based approach to adult learning (andragogy) is analogous to necessary change in marketing approaches. The move toward andragogy can be an important element in developing the identity of the school, which is in turn an important element in marketing strategy. The issue of identity is one of projecting a clear, uncompromised image, directly linked to its programming and objectives. The disjointed marketing done today can only increase feelings of separation, disunity, and impersonality among faculty, students, and staff; directed and  unified marketing would aid school image, the institution itself, and its broadening constituencies.

        "description":"The effects of the financial aid reform introduced in Sweden in the mid-1960s were assessed, with emphasis placed on possible effects on young people from lower socioeconomic strata. The study group is a nationally representative sample of persons born in 1948, who were also studied in 1961 in relation to background, interests, aptitudes, and school grades at the age of 13. Nearly 2,000 out of the 12,000 subjects have entered universities or colleges. It was found that social background strongly influences participation in higher education. For individuals from homes in which one of the parents has a university degree, the likelihood of beginning a postsecondary education is seven times greater than for individuals from working-class homes, and the likelihood of completing a  university degree is as much as 10 times higher. However, the national financial aid system has been influential: 40 percent of those from farms and working-class homes indicated that they would not have entered postsecondary studies without the financial aid. The corresponding percentage for the higher socioeconomic strata is 12 percent. The national financial aid system is also important to completion of a degree program. In addition, women have benefited from the national financial aid system more often than men, and they have also been able to finance their studies to a larger extent through this system. The aid system has been particularly important in recruiting women to professional programs of long duration. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"Results of the 1981-82 recruiting trends survey conducted by Placement Services at Michigan State University are summarized. A cross-section of 428 businesses, industries, government agencies, and educational institutions were surveyed to determine trends in hiring new college graduates, expected starting salaries, campus recruiting activities, and other job market trends. It was found that graduates in certain fields, particularly engineering and computer science, will be in high demand, while the demand has leveled off or in some cases fallen off in some nontechnical fields. For example, in education, there is great demand for science and math teachers, while many elementary teachers cannot find jobs. Overall, the demand for graduates is expected to be about the same as last  year, when 87 percent of the graduates found work within three months of graduation. Salary offers to new graduates are expected to be about 5.2 percent more than offers to June 1981 graduates. The highest starting salaries will be paid to chemical, electrical, and mechanical engineers, who will earn an average of more than $22,000 per year. The lowest starting salary offers are expected for graduates from the social sciences, human ecology, education, hotel and restaurant, and communications fields (about $14,000 to $15,500, depending on the field). Master's degree graduates are expected to receive about $23,200 as a starting salary and doctoral degree graduates are expected to be paid about $27,300. Recruitment of minorities and geographical differences in overall findings are covered.  Survey questions are included. (SW)",

        "description":"The circumstances in France surrounding the reform of the third and fourth years of university study (the second cycle) are considered. It is suggested that if the original problem stemmed from the expansion of university enrollments and the shortage of graduate jobs, the proposed solution called for vocationally oriented diversification; the issue very quickly became a power struggle between the Secretariat for Higher Education and Research and elements within the universities. To provide a context for these events, some basic information about French higher education is considered. Problem areas that have important ramifications for the university include: the saturation of traditional graduate labor markets, particularly in the public sector; the competitive disadvantage of  university graduates in the private industry labor market compared to graduates of &quot;grandes ecoles,&quot; where recruitment is by competitive examination; and the finding that jobs that university graduates accept are either provisional, part-time, or below the graduate's level of training and expectation. The underlying objective of the second-cycle reform is to better adapt higher education to the employment opportunities in the economy. Opposition to the reform by the universities centered on reduced access to university programs and student selection criteria; the government's proposed curtailment in the length of study for the license; the challenge to the traditional curriculum; and the increased power over programs provided to the Secretary of Higher Education. One of the consequences  of the developments has been devaluation of the university. (SW)",

Additionally, suggestions for future research directions are offered. Three important communication issues pertaining to the administration of higher education that have been identified in previous research are: information flow, information quality, and the communication process itself. In higher education, it has often been assumed that everyone needs to be informed about everything, and information has been disseminated as widely as possible. The net effect of this approach is to increase costs of distribution, since a large amount of material is discarded without study.  Administrators need to assess the information needs of subordinates and the methods of diffusion, including formal and informal networks. Organizational climates in academic departments have been observed to influence factors such as turnover, performance goals, and communication satisfaction. The information issues have a special impact on decision-making in colleges and universities. It is suggested that research is needed to describe: information required by those who occupy key roles in the institution, the organizational communication climate and the quality of life in colleges and universities, and approaches to minimizing win-lose orientations in faculty committees and other groups representing a wide variety of interests.

Reports from Minnesota and Indiana task forces of the  Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities are presented on ways that the Catholic identity of a college is reflected in its campus environment.

In fall 1976, tuition was imposed for the first time and new admissions criteria were set. In comparison to fall 1976 enrollments, the number of first-time freshmen enrollment at CUNY in fall 1979 increased 12 percent overall, 20 percent at the senior colleges and seven percent at the community colleges. At the senior colleges, freshman enrollment is still 37 percent below the fall 1975 pretuition and preadmission criteria level, but at the community colleges, freshman enrollment is at the 1975 level. Information is provided for the specific colleges. At the senior colleges, 79 percent of the regular freshmen meet the  admission criteria, while the community colleges have no high school grade point average cutoff level required for admission. Information is provided on freshman enrollment in two programs--SEEK and College Discovery (CD)--which are designed to help economically, educationally, and socially disadvantaged students. At CUNY, 99 percent of the SEEK/CD freshmen, 91 percent of the regular senior college freshmen, and 82 percent of the regular community college freshmen are full-time students. The average full-time freshman is enrolled for 14-15 credits and/or equated credits. The average part-time freshman is enrolled for seven credits and/or equated credits, including one compensatory/remedial hour at senior colleges and three compensatory/remedial hours at community colleges.

Attention is directed to major problems likely to confront California's colleges and universities over the next five years including economic factors (such as state funding), demographic influences (such as the  decline in the college-age population) or sociopolitical concerns. External environmental forces affecting postsecondary education in the state include: an aging population, a majority of minorities, and increasing energy costs. Internal environmental factors include enrollment-derived funding formulas, tenure, and collective bargaining. Nine priorities for 1982-86 are as follows: improved planning and program review, improving student preparation and skills, protecting the integrity of degrees and other credentials, improving access for underrepresented groups, controlling financial barriers to access and choice, conserving the resources of independent education, ethical recruitment and student choice, financial support and management practices, and selective review of master plan  provisions.

Financial issues, including the most current information available on sources of funds for California colleges and universities, the role of the state in financing postsecondary education, and issues regarding this role that pose problems for the future, are addressed. A discussion of students summarizes trends in student needs and characteristics and raises questions about institutional obligations and policies toward  students in light of these trends.

        "description":"The high attrition rate of Alaska Native students at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, was evaluated as an example of the broader issue of the responsiveness of a large bureaucratic institution to an environmental population that is different from it in world view. It was found that the phrasing of the problem as a problem of retention was in itself a major means by which the institution limited its capacity to understand the issue. It was learned that the fundamental conflict was between what is called &quot;the institution's knowledge&quot; and &quot;human knowledge.&quot; The institution's knowledge characterizes the relationships between individual members or clients that are governed by institutional considerations. Human knowledge characterizes the relationships between members or clients  that are governed by human interpersonal considerations. By framing the problem as a problem of retention, the institution was incapable of perceiving the issue from the point of view of the Alaska Native students. As a further approach to indicate the difference between the two areas of knowledge, attention was directed to what students and faculty offered as explanations of behavior. It was found that Alaska Native students were skeptical regarding the use of analytical categories as explanations of behavior. It is suggested that this is a sophisticated view of a dimension of human behavior not attended to in Western behavioral and social sciences. Attention was also directed to conventions of expression and interpretation of the spoken and written word. Preliminary findings of a  classroom experiment designed to increase the amount of human knowledge given to students about the teacher by himself are reported. Additional analysis and a bibliography are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Administrative salaries in 1981-82 in 132 state-supported universities in 45 states and 31 university systems in 24 states were surveyed. Only full-time administrators were included but their responsibilities and functions range from the director of a single office to the university president. To provide anonymity, the universities are not identified with their salaries; however, an asterisk indicates that a salary is from a university that is a member of the National Association of State University and Land-Grant Colleges. The first section provides the ranking of salaries paid among all participating universities. The second section is a series of tables showing the salaries paid among the 132 participants arranged into the nine regions defined by the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (the New York and Boston regions are combined). The responding universities in each region are enumerated at the beginning of the section. The third section is a table of salaries paid to university system officers. For purposes of the survey, a university system is defined as one which has a separate administrative structure for a system of multiple general academic institutions, at least one of which has offerings at the doctorate-granting level. The 1981-82 survey resulted in adding two positions to the system officers categories: Associate Vice President of Development and Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs. Additionally, three dean positions have been added to the overall list: Dean of Dentistry, Dean of Health Professions, and Dean of Public  Affairs. Information is also provided to indicate a salary that is being paid for a position with a dual function. Salary rank ordering facilitates comparisons among universities. (SW)",

        "description":"Indices and manifestations of quality in undergraduate education are considered and a four-part framework is developed. Context indices represent institutional characteristics that remain relatively stable over time (e.g., expenditures per student and size of student body), while input indices reflect characteristics of entering students (e.g., ability and aspirations). Manifestations of quality are evidenced by involvement and outcome indices; the former characterize interactions between and among students and faculty, such as satisfaction and frequency of contact, and the latter reflect intended products or unintended effects associated with college attendance, such as persistence, academic achievement, and alumni attainments. Commonly used context indicators of quality include  size (number of undergraduate students), clarity and consistency of institutional purpose, student living environments, salaries, and decision-making strategies. The following input indices have been used to indicate quality: student ability, biographical characteristics of students, and nonintellective characteristics. Commonly used involvement indices have been instructional activities and informal student teacher interaction. The most often used outcome indices as manifestations of quality have included persistence, student achievement, intellectual and social/emotional development of students, and alumni achievements. Both quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches to quality assessment and societal trends influencing the need for quality indicators are briefly reviewed.  These trends include declining enrollments and financial constraints. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

Pupils aged between 14 and 15 years of mixed reading ability took part in six separate studies, each of which partially replicated and partially expanded the previous studies. Preliminary results suggest that headings aid both the recall and retrieval of information from the text. The position of the headings (marginal or embedded) had no effect on the results, but the headings (questions or statements) might have differential effects with learners of different ability (headings enhanced the recall of low-ability subjects). It also  appears that headings in the form of questions might be more effective than headings in the form of statements for less able readers. Further experiments in this area are planned.

David Messer's paper addressed the concept of effectance motivation in children who have limited use of productive language. Susan McQuiston and Mary McCarthy discussed the relationship between mastery motivation and cognitive development. They measured cognitive competence with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Anita Glicken and Robert Harmon discussed the  advantages and disadvantages of using at-risk populations to help understand the concept of mastery motivation. Kay Jennings discussed the possibility of independent measurement of compliance and imitation. A discussion by the participants and the audience is summarized. &quot;Task-directed behaviors&quot; was suggested as a more descriptive label than mastery motivation. The question of causality pleasure as an indicator of mastery/effectance motivation was raised. The research presented by the participants is summarized by George Morgan in his concluding comments.

Several assumptions which are mistakenly considered fact by researchers include: (1) the left hemisphere is for rational functions, while the right is for intuitive functions; (2) the hemispheres do not interact as well with each other as they should; (3) the use of one hemisphere tends to depress the use of the other until one can become dominant; and (4) hemispheric dominance is probably a cultural phenomenon. Evidence has shown that measures used for assessing dominance and the assumptions they fostered, are suspect. The two-brain theory is of little importance in educational planning. Much concern for educating both sides of the brain is based on the supposition that one hemisphere could  languish in ignorance while the other was enlightened. This is a naive supposition; lateralization is part of a complex interweaving of processes. Neurological research may have a profound effect on education in the future. (DWH)",

Evaluation data indicate: that students in the Title I basic programs are making significant achievement gains in reading and mathematics; that the migrant education programs have helped younger migrant children to improve their basic skills and provided  subject area instruction and vocational training for older students; that handicapped students in the program are provided with diverse instructional activities and services; and that supplementary instruction for delinquent and neglected children in State facilities has resulted in student gains in reading and mathematics. Some reasons for the success of Title I in Ohio are outlined, and recommendations for effective provision of future services are presented.

        "author":["Diner, Steven J."],
        "description":"The decline of public confidence in Washington, D.C. public schools emerged between 1954 and 1967 from political and social developments that affected the nation's capital. Past research and educational reports, newspaper articles, and politicians' statements indicate that before 1954, public confidence in the schools was relatively high. Educational problems became a public issue only after World War II and were perceived as critical only after desegregation in 1954. By the middle 1960s, much of the attention focused on public schools arose from increasing concern with academic achievement as an indicator of quality, along with such developments as the worsening of actual school conditions, widespread racial prejudice, accelerated public expectations of the schools because of  the civil rights movement, and desegregation. Test scores were used to support arguments of segregationists, integrationists, and various activist groups. The public schools' poor image was worsened by incorrect press reports of a trend toward private schools among the middle class, and by the general unpopularity of the Board of Education. After 1975, with the advent of competency-based curriculum under superintendent Vincent Reed, scores did begin to rise, and Reed became the first superintendent in years to remain popular with the press and public. In the 1980s it is important to realize that improvement in student achievement alone will not improve the public school image. Efforts must be made to change public attitudes, to develop measures other than test scores alone as measures of  student achievement, and to maintain a new awareness of public schools' vulnerability to negative publicity.

        "description":"This report on the governance of public education in Washington, D.C. describes issues and conflicts that have arisen since the 19th century among the agencies which have exercised various forms and degrees of authority and responsibility for education in the District: The Board of School Trustees or Board of Education; the central city government; the Superintendent of Schools after 1869; and the Federal government, especially Congress. The report discusses the issues in the context of social and political developments and changes in the structure of public education through the years. The sources of conflict have included budgetary considerations, the power to appoint officials, the issue of divided authority, and in recent years, the civil rights revolution, school  desegregation, and the struggle for home rule. The study suggests that 1) school governance conflicts arise mainly from the system of divided authority; 2) the periods of greatest turmoil in the schools have been those in which the schools have had to confront social changes in the city; 3) school governance struggles have often had harmful effects on the children; and 4) attempts to eliminate current problems by altering the school governance structure should be based on knowledge of the city's historical experience.

The issues are discussed in the context of historical, social, and political developments (the change from Federal control over the school district to home rule) and include: 1) the equitable distribution of school funding, particularly in relation to black schools versus white schools; 2) the haphazard nature of educational finance due to constitutional stipulations concerning Federal control over the District; 3) inadequate school funding; 4) funds for school construction; 5) school finance as an object of governance conflicts; 6) alternative supplementary sources of school  funds; 7) the problem of tuition for nonresidents; 8) teacher salaries; and 9) the budgeting process. A brief report on a study of public interest in education finance within the District indicates that while public interest in the schools rose and fell dramatically around the period of social change in the 1960's, interest in school finance has risen steadily and is now at a peak. The paper concludes with some policy implications that touch on the issues discussed.

        "description":"This report provides a historical overview of curriculum development in the public schools of Washington, D.C. Investigation of the pre-emancipation period (1804-1864) shows that curriculum focused on the development of basic skills, moral values, and employment skills. During the period of the dual school system (1864-1954), when public education was provided separately for blacks and whites, developments in curriculum included an increase in the number and variety of subjects and courses at elementary and secondary levels; the rise of junior high schools, vocational education, and special education; and shifts in responsibility for curriculum development from the Board of Education to teachers and administrators. In the post-desegregation period (1954-1982), racial integration  and the increase in the number of black students led to the development of the track system and a curriculum for a predominantly urban and black student body. After 1954, curriculum aimed primarily to educate students of low socioeconomic backgrounds and several curriculum plans to improve academic achievement were implemented. The report identifies historical, sociopolitical, educational, and other factors to explain curriculum changes at given periods, suggests that employment has been the fundamental purpose of the school system over the years, and discusses elements that should be considered in proposing curriculum reforms.

Cases discussed in reference to Title IX concern discrimination in athletic programs, sex bias in the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, and the provision of child care by a college for the children of female students. Cases discussed in reference to Title VI concern counseling for limited English speaking students, possible discrimination in counseling leading to disproportionate minority representation in vocational education programs, and college or university quotas for foreign students. Finally, cases discussed in  reference to Section 504 concern evidence for discrimination, obligations of school districts to institutionalized handicapped children, physical accessibility requirements, overlapping legislation requiring provision of interpreters or auxiliary aids for the hearing impaired, postsecondary institution housing for the disabled, and participation in a university food service program by handicapped students with special dietary needs.

        "description":"This is a report on a study of racial interrelationships among students in desegregated schools. Sociometric measures of third graders' willingness to play and work with their classmates (indicating cross-race acceptance) showed evidence of racial bias; however, the amount of bias appeared small compared to the findings of earlier studies which used measures of friendship rather than acceptance as indicators of interracial relationships. Significantly, children tended to demonstrate sex bias more than racial bias in interpersonal relationships. Observation of children's classroom interactions corroborated these findings. Follow-up studies of the same group of third graders when they were in the sixth grade and in the tenth grade indicated increasing own-race preference and  decreasing own-sex preference over time; comparisons of acceptance and friendship measures suggested similar changes in race and sex preferences with advancing grade levels. Among the reasons given for increasing own-race preference with increases in age were school organizational features which might influence the degree of interracial contact, and the personal identities that each group projects and interprets. It was emphasized that the findings of more positive cross-race relations when the criterion is acceptance rather than friendship provide cause for optimism about integrated education. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"This paper presents guidelines on the role that Parent Advisory Councils (PACs) can play in implementing projects under Chapter I of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, which replaces Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as of July, 1982. Under Chapter I, school districts are no longer required to establish PACs that were mandated under Title I; instead, local school officials are only required to consult with parents and teachers of children in Chapter I funded projects. The paper suggests that in light of these changes, PACs should work in 1981-82 to assure that parents and other citizens have access to the planning and implementation of Chapter I projects in schools and school districts during 1982-83. Among the activities that the paper  identifies for PACs are: 1) determining the nature and extent of the &quot;consultation&quot; requirement in Chapter I; 2) determining the likely effect of Federal budget/policy initiatives on local Chapter I programs for 1982-83; 3) developing contingency positions for school programs should Federal budget reductions be required; 4) ensuring that the flexibility provided by Chapter I legislation is used to improve education for disadvantaged children; and 5) studying how Federal block grants to States provided for by Chapter II of the Act may be used to benefit educationally disadvantaged children.

        "description":"This report provides information on the impact of crime and the criminal justice system on minorities in the United States. The report is presented in two parts. Part one focuses on the historical perspective of crime and minority experience concerning crime, law enforcement, and the criminal justice system, with specific reference to blacks, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and Asian Americans. Part two examines the inequality of justice as practiced in such institutions as the police forces, courts, and correctional facilities, and briefly discusses education, research, and community anti-crime efforts that affect minority groups. The report suggests that: 1) race is an important factor in the operation of the criminal justice system which seems to discriminate against  minority racial/ethnic groups; 2) incarceration is applied primarily to the poor and minorities, while diversion, restitution, and other alternative programs are considered more appropriate for whites; 3) although minorities are more often victims of crime than whites, their involvement in the criminal justice system is disproportional to their numbers in population, and they have been virtually excluded from participation in policy-making activities against crime. Recommendations to correct the current situation and provide equal treatment for minorities within the criminal justice system are presented. (Author/MJL)",

Results showed that: 1) the total number of regular high school leavers in 1979-80 equaled approximately 5 percent of the 1979 senior high school population; 2) students tended to leave school more frequently during the second semester of the school year; 3) more males than females left school; 4) the proportions of black or Hispanic school leavers tended to be greater than their respective  proportions in the total high school student population; 5) the most frequent reason given for leaving was &quot;overage&quot; among eleventh and twelfth graders; 6) a large number of tenth graders were dropped from attendance rolls and classified as &quot;whereabouts unknown&quot; students; and 7) institutionalization/incarceration was given as a reason for leaving more frequently among tenth graders than among eleventh or twelfth graders.

        "description":"This report presents the results of classroom interaction research to determine if elementary and secondary school teachers in a North Carolina school district treated males and females differently, and to find out if an intervention strategy would foster more equitable treatment. An experimental group of teachers participated in workshops that provided information on sexism in communication and helped teachers to identify differential treatment of male and female students. The experimental group was compared with a control group on the nature of their interactions with students based on observer ratings on two kinds of instruments: 1) the PIT model, which quantified verbal and nonverbal behaviors in personal events (those related to emotions), institutional events (those  concerned with classroom management and school operations), and task events (those concerned with teaching and learning subject matter); and 2) the IDER model, which categorized teachers' verbal behavior as direct or indirect, and nonverbal behavior as encouraging or restricting. The results did not conclusively support other research findings of differences in teachers' interactions with male and female students. Neither was it possible to conclude that the workshops resulted in differences in teacher behaviors, although the findings did suggest that the intervention might prompt teachers to become more encouraging and direct. The inconclusive results were partly attributed to inappropriate instruments and weak subject selection methods. (Author/MJL)",

This trend has been particularly characteristic of Southern blacks. To examine this development, data on a sample of blacks in the 1970 United States census were analyzed by comparing individual and socioeconomic characteristics of southern black nonmigrants (persons who resided in the South during 1965-70), return migrants (those who migrated North and lived there in 1965 but returned South and became residents as of 1970), and nonreturn migrants (those who migrated North and remained residents through 1970). The study found that among Southern blacks: 1) return migrants were generally younger than nonmigrants and nonreturn migrants;  2)migrants had higher educational levels than nonmigrants; 3) return migrants had lower employment levels than nonmigrants; and 4) nonreturn migrants had the highest average income, while return migrants had lower incomes than nonmigrants. The unexpectedly lower socioeconomic levels of return migrants compared to nonmigrants (considering educational attainments) did not support the prevailing assumption that investments in education and migration are expected to raise earnings and suggested that return migrants do not behave according to the &quot;rational model&quot; postulated by economists.

Evaluation results indicate that: 1) both Hispanic and Haitian students achieved good rates of mastery of the objectives in a test of English syntax; 2) some gains were made  in English reading; 3) bilingual students generally achieved passing rates in the content areas that exceeded the passing rates of mainstream students in comparable classes; 4) passing rates in native language courses and business/vocational courses were generally high; 5) students who took city-wide social studies and reading tests achieved overall passing rates of over 85 percent; and 6) participants' attendance rates were higher than the overall rate for mainstream students. The report concludes with recommendations for program improvement. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"Project VIBES at South Shore High School in New York City is described in this report. The project is a transitional bilingual education program that emphasizes acculturation and the acquisition of English language skills while maintaining the native language and appreciation of the students' cultural heritage. As implemented in 1980-81, the program served several Haitians and some Chinese, Hebrew, and Spanish dominant students with limited English proficiency. The instructional component included English as a Second Language, native language classes, mathematics, science, social studies, and elective courses. The non-instructional component included program administration, curriculum development, counseling services, and provision for parent involvement. Evaluation indicated  that: 1) student performance on a test of English syntax was short of the program's objectives, although some gains were demonstrated; 2) gains were reported in mathematics, science, and social studies; 3) achievement in native language courses was generally high; 4) most students demonstrated knowledge of their cultural heritage; and 5) program participants' attendance rates exceeded the average school rate.

The program, which served 254 students in grades 9 through 11 in 1980-81, emphasizes the attainment of minimum competency in basic skills. Participants receive instruction in Spanish language and culture; bilingual instruction in science, social studies, and math; and English as a second language and English reading classes. The bilingual program participants also take mainstream classes in art, music, physical education, and, as their proficiency allows, industrial arts and business. The noninstructional aspect of the program includes components on curriculum development, supportive services,  staff development, parental and community involvement, and administration and supervision. For the 1980-81 school year, program participants' attendance, performance, and achievement either equalled or surpassed those of the general school population, a finding which is said to relate to high staff competence and morale and good program design.

Chapter 1 reviews the literature on vocational rehabilitation for people with mental and physical disabilities and points out the lack of research on nonwhite, lower class populations. In Chapter 2, the nature of support systems are defined, and ways that vocational professionals can serve as resources in utilizing community support systems and improving services to inner city nonwhite clients are suggested. The third chapter of the report discusses problems in the delivery of services to the severely disabled in urban areas, including bureaucratic factors and cultural differences between counselors and  clients. Chapter 4 examines regulatory and programmatic requirements within Federal and State programs that serve as disincentives to the successful rehabilitation of disabled clients. The fifth and final chapter focuses on the lack of public understanding of vocational rehabilitation programs and discusses what might be done to improve public awareness. Appended to the report are the text of a cooperative agreement between one community center and a vocational rehabilitation program and a guide to planning and evaluation for identifying and recruiting priority clients.

In addition to instructional services, C.H.S.B.P. included a non-instructional component,  focusing on curriculum and materials development, supportive services, staff development, parent and community involvement, and affecitve domain. Data presented in this report reveal that program implementation and thus student achievement varied considerably among the five participating schools.

Following an introduction that provides a summary of findings detailed in the paper, the monograph is divided into five chapters. Chapter 2 provides a historical summary of legislation concerning unemployment benefits duration. It stresses the expanding federal role in such policies and points out assumptions believed to have prompted this expansion. Chapter 3 briefly describes characteristics and labor market experiences of individuals who collected benefits under FSB. Chapter 4 discusses the general allocational effects of extended benefits programs and examines specific effects  of the FSB program. Chapter 5 considers the distributional impact of FSB by examining how well it compensated workers for recession-induced unemployment and whether it prevented poverty among lowest income FSB recipients. FSB's relationship to welfare programs is also considered. Chapter 6 provides an overall assessment of FSB by addressing seven basic questions policy makers will have to answer in future recessions. A brief discussion of alternative policies during recessions is included. (YLB)",

A second chapter views the management decision in a series of economic contexts: international, national, and local. Next, the immediate and intermediate responses of management, the union or unions, and the community are considered, together with some related material about recent state and federal legislative initiatives and a brief outline of how European countries respond to economic dislocation. The second half of the volume (chapters 4-6) is  concerned with the experiences of the displaced workers, their job search behaviors and subsequent labor market experiences, their participation in programs designed to facilitate reemployment and the outcomes of those programs, and the effects of job loss on mental health. A concluding section reflects upon the aims and objectives set out earlier and proposes concrete research projects as well as a general research agenda.

During the conference, 19 participants (including directors, supervisors, teachers, university faculty members, a counselor, and state agency staff) prioritized their desired goals for Texas ABE in the 1980s. These goals included the following: clarifying and promoting the role, scope, and function of ABE; developing and expanding cooperative linkages; initiating additional legislative action for promoting and supporting ABE; establishing permanent funding sources for adult education; and establishing guidelines for the efficient and  equitable allocation and distribution of funds. Following an analysis of the barriers to and bridges for accomplishing these goals, conference participants formulated strategies for implementing the goals. Included among these strategies were the following: developing an image statement for ABE, actively involving educators in the lobbying process, placing legislative requests on a personal basis, developing diverse strategies for linking with various groups and considering the ramifications of each linkage on the entire adult education system, and developing goals that are mutually acceptable to target group learners and adult educators.

Interviewee comments were treated as incidents and coded according to properties indicated. Properties precipitated categories representing conceptual elements. Relationships between categories suggested potential hypotheses, including (1) willingness to share skills or knowledge will be perceived as having no direct correlation to formal education training and teaching experience; (2) the more extensive a person's reported history of community participation, the more likely she/he will be to  teach; (3) a decision to teach based on altruism and peer orientation will be perceived as a reason to teach more often by older adults with less education and teaching experience; (4) transmission of knowledge will be seen as a reason to teach more often by older adults with formal education training and teaching experience; (5) fellowship and self-actualization will be perceived as benefits by more teachers in an age-segregated rather than age-integrated setting; and (6) teachers in age-segregated settings will view their educating roles as helper or friend more often.

The instrument for the research consisted of two parts--a Program Participants Survey to collect social and demographic information and Boshier's Education Participation Scale. Subjects were 482 older adult learners in two continuing education programs. The learners were, typically, married white women, 62-70 years old, who live in single family homes in urban areas and have fairly high educational and income levels. Results indicated age-integrated, university-based programs attracted lifelong learners who were well-educated, relatively affluent, and relatively young. Age-segregated, community-based programs attracted learners of  diverse educational backgrounds and of more advanced age (over age 80) who were not frequent educational participants. Different learning environments attracted older adult learners whose motivational orientations exhibited some differences. While learners in all populations had the highest mean factor scores on Cognitive Interest, reasons related to Social Contact had more influence for age-segregated than for age-integrated learners. The latter group indicated that Social Welfare reasons influenced their participation in continuing education more. (YLB)",

Evaluation of this project conducted in Dane County, Wisconsin, from 1978-81 is discussed in three sections focusing on the process of developing learning centers, a performance evaluation of the impact of the centers, and the efficiency of the program model. The evaluation of the process looks at these problems with program development: low initial enrollment, requiring too few resources from the community and sponsors  involved, and amount of time spent in planning. The section on performance evaluation considers these program activities: development of alternative models for implementation of community-based learning centers, involvement of local sponsors and learning center coordinators, development of educational program, enrollment, recruitment of older adults as teachers, information dissemination, and development of plan for learning center continuation. The efficiency evaluation looks at sponsor and participant costs. (YLB)",

        "description":"The decline of American industry and its loss of competitive strength in the world economy has led to a need for stimulation of the economy through reindustrialization. Reindustrialization is a part of, or a tool for, economic growth. As such this term is directly linked to productivity and job creation. Several critical elements and procedures are necessary for reindustrialization to occur. These are collaborative policy development, increased investments in plants and equipment, technological innovation, special attention to small business, and investment in human resources. Japan and West European countries have comprehensive approaches to reindustrialization, while reindustrialization policy in the United States is in an embryonic stage. The concept of reindustrialization has  major implications for vocational education. Vocational education can have an impact on the process through delivery of education and training that provides general work skill development and occupational skill development. An immediate need exists for retraining and upgrading of adult workers. A well-planned cooperative and coordinated effort must also be conducted by industry and vocational education. Vocational education should conduct assessments to identify training it can provide and then develop and deliver multi-faceted flexible education and training. (YLB)",

In the first section a study of worker productivity analyzes trends and then measures and analyzes the determinants of productivity. The three main inputs--physical capital, natural resources, and labor--are briefly discussed. Other factors that influence the mix of inputs are also considered. The second section identifies a number of strategies for improving the quantity and quality of worker productivity. These include self-motivation and management tools for making labor more productive such as motivation techniques, management by objectives, job enlargement and  enrichment, flexible working hours, and quality control circles. The role of vocational education in increasing worker productivity is discussed in terms of (1) planning programs based on emerging patterns related to the way in which workers change jobs and occupations, (2) enriching the quality of human capital, and (3) providing entry-level skills for new or emerging occupations through expanded and relevant program content.

Several models have been developed for providing vocational education to prison populations. Institutionally-based programs are of three types: correctional administrators and staff with sole control of program design, implementation, and evaluation; involvement of community members in curriculum design and instruction; and use of inmates for institutional maintenance or prison industries. In  community-based programs inmates are released for training in a community facility. (Recent innovations are described.) Other innovations in corrections are the recently developed programs for female, juvenile, and mentally handicapped offenders. Rigorously designed research of program effectiveness is conspicuously absent. Before vocational education can successfully demonstrate its rehabilitative potential, its status must be improved, barriers to employment must be removed, and funding must be increased. National initiatives to improve vocational education's funding and status are standards and accreditation, Corrections Program in the Department of Education, and legislative initiatives. (YLB)",

        "description":"Critical issues pertaining to career/vocational assessment were identified by the Regional Resource Center West (RRCW) through a review of the literature and interviews conducted with practitioners. Critical issues identified were the goal of the career/vocational assessment; assessment instruments and procedures; examiner expertise; and coordination of services. Promising practices that addressed the critical issues were verified through site visits and staff interviews. The interviews were supplemented by tours, program observations and review of materials, products, and administrative procedures. Site nominations were provided by state education personnel as well as personnel from the nominated sites. Promising practices were selected through the criteria of identified  critical issues, uniqueness, feasibility of replication, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Eight promising practices were identified in California and Florida, and are described in this report. For each practice, the following information is given: site, contacts, sphere, critical issue, program descriptions, background of problem, description of practice, implementation/maintenance, outcomes, resources required (staff, equipment, training, funds), learnings, person to contact for further information, and person who verified practice.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine the relative contribution of the leadership styles of cooperative education directors and organization structural characteristics of the program and institution to cooperative education program outcomes in colleges and universities in the United States. The target population was all cooperative education directors at colleges in the United States--obtained from a mailing list of 397 two-year and 505 four-year institutions that have cooperative education programs. A sample consisting of 15 directors for two-year and 15 for four-year colleges, for each of six geographic regions of the United States was selected and mailed questionnaires; 139 usable questionnaires were returned. Results of the study showed cooperative education directors  having a low mean leadership style of consideration score and an average initiating structure score, suggesting that factors outside the study may have resulted in these persons having a perceived leadership style of consideration lower than norms for educational supervisors. There were no linear relationships found significant among leadership style variables and organizational structural variables. Moreover, there were no statistically significant linear relationships among the leadership styles, organization structure, and cooperative education program outcome variables as measured in this study. It was recommended that research be conducted to determine what other variables might account for program outcomes in cooperative education. (KC)",

The NEPDIS was designed to be a fully computerized information assembly and analysis system that would eventually support manpower, personnel, and training management. This report provides an overview of the NEPDIS. It describes NEPDIS subsystems, summarizes the current status of the system and ongoing developments, and treats a projected application of the NEPDIS concept to a model for Navy enlisted career planning. The NEPDIS system includes an occupational data base and a computer-assisted method to perform the job/task/skill analysis. It is composed of five major subsystems which include seven files. These  subsystems and files include the Training Development Subsystem (Training Development and Management File, Task Inventory File); the Instructional Subsystem (Instructional Program File, Training Materials and Literature File); the Training Record and Evaluation Subsystem (Training and Education File, Training Evaluation File); the Career Development Subsystem (Career Ladder File); and the Audit Subsystem. Of these subsystems and files, only the Task Inventory File is fully operational, while the remaining subsystems are at various stages of conceptual or computer software development. (Author/KC)",

During the year-long project, five major activities were conducted. First, dissemination activities were planned for two products (&quot;A Word Processing Guide&quot; developed in West Virginia, and &quot;Job Creation&quot; curriculum materials developed in Illinois), thus testing the components of the dissemination system developed for program improvement. Second, inservice education activities were conducted for persons/networks/agencies which  facilitate access to a product in order to enhance awareness, understanding, and participation in the dissemination process. This activity included a conference which is summarized in the report. For the third activity, collaboration efforts were made with the Illinois Department of Adult, Vocational, and Technical Education in articulation of vocational education dissemination efforts within the state. Fourth, communication was continued with dissemination specialists nationwide to glean helpful information, insights, and ideas from others' ongoing efforts to aid development of the Illinois dissemination system. Fianlly, 400 copies of a &quot;dissemination manual&quot; focusing on the components of the dissemination system were developed, printed, and disseminated to enhance coordination and  collaboration for effective dissemination. Recommendations for implementing the dissemination system were made. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Provided in this report are a number of empirical and conceptual papers dealing with barriers to youth employment. The first paper, \"Barriers to Youth Employment: A Review,\" contains a summary of more than 100 reports on causes of youth employability problems and poses several alternative strategies for formulation of youth labor market policy. The second paper, \"Ethnographic Methods for Exploring the Education/Work Nexus,\" describes methods in applied anthropology that could be useful in studying youth employability problems. Then three empirical papers follow: \"Chances of Previous Work Experience among Unemployed Youth,\"\"Chances of Job Loss among Teenagers and Young Adults: Implications for Part Time Work,\" and \"Characteristics of Unemployed Youths.\" These papers, using data  from the 1979 Current Population Survey, found that age and school enrollment status are among the strongest correlates of desire for part-time versus full-time work, of previous work experience, and of chances of job loss among 16- through 24-year-olds in the civilian, non-institutional population of the United States during March, 1979. The papers are intended for planners and policy makers in vocational education as well as for students of the youth labor market. (Author/KC)",

Using a multi-agency team with members representing vocational education, special education, rehabilitation, guidance, and other agencies at the state level, each state developed a state interagency linkage model. The Maryland model for establishing and improving interagency linkages is based on a manual entitled &quot;Cooperative Planning for the Handicapped; Resource Manual.&quot; In addition, the Maryland model includes a series of 13 learning modules that provide vocational teachers with training about the educational needs of handicapped students. Designed to provide a framework for local agency representatives to use when  establishing and implementing cooperative agreements, the New Jersey model places major emphasis at the county-local level. The following six major areas were addressed by developers of the New Jersey model: vocational education, health, skill development, transportation, job placement, and support services. The Virginia model involves formal written agreements developed between the Department of Education and the Department of Rehabilitative Services in the following areas: vocational education, special education, and rehabilitative services.

To examine various approaches to teaching one of the initiative skills, i.e., confrontation, 22 prepracticum counselors were assigned to one of three groups: a cognitive self-instructional modeling group, a Carkhuff discrimination/communication group, and a placebo control group. Results indicated that the two groups receiving confrontation rating training outperformed the control group, which merely received a labeling preparation. There were no differences between the self-instructional and  communication/discrimination groups on any of the confrontational measures related to the role-played interview. The findings support the use of a behavioral teaching approach in the development of the advanced skill of confrontation. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"Some research has theorized that the student role is a central part of adolescence, and that failure in this role threatens adolescents' self-esteem. Derogative self-esteem may provoke delinquency as a defensive response. To test this theory a longitudinal study was designed to compare the effectiveness of three alternative school programs that attempted to provide students with experiences of success in an atmosphere of social support. Although these schools were not found to be reliably more effective than conventional schools, the theory that implicated poor scholastic experiences as a provocation to delinquency received substantial support. As students' assessments of their schools and themselves became more positive, their scholastic performance and behavior improved.  However, respondents' behavior improved without the mediation of elevated self-esteem. The findings suggest that positive scholastic experiences make a difference in the behavior of only those students whose delinquency seems effective in defending against negative affect. (JAC)",

To investigate the efficacy of cognitive behavior modification in the treatment of mathematics anxiety, 44 subjects were recruited from a high school and 2 colleges. The students were divided into two groups, a cognitive behavior modification treatment group and a waiting control group. As expected, the treatment group showed a significant decrease in mathematics anxiety. Their monitoring of negative self-statements and relaxation apparently was successful, although adolescent boys had difficulty relating to the relaxation and imagery process. The results also suggested a profile of the typical math-anxious person, i.e., a female with less parental encouragement to study  mathematics and a less-educated mother. The findings indicate that programs designed to deal with the problem of mathematics anxiety, however, need to be addressed to both sexes. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"While schools are not called upon to meet all human needs, they have a responsibility to strive toward an institutional life of high quality. Although there are no systematic studies of human alienation, reports on secondary education indicate that much of the secondary program breeds alienation. Theory in sociology and social psychology of organizations suggests that public comprehensive high schools could help reduce student alienation by: (1) allowing more student-parent choice in the school attended; (2) setting clear, limited, and consistent goals for schools; (3) maintaining a size of about 500-1200 students; (4) structuring the school with a low level of hierarchy and high level of student input; (5) providing more sustained contact between students and individual  teachers, more cooperative activity among students, and more opportunity for students to contribute to school functioning; and (6) designing student work to encourage continuous development of \"products,\" and to include both primal and modern activity. Analyses of 14 innovative efforts, e.g., specialized schools, flexible scheduling, career education and four main reform perspectives, i.e., the conventional role, the developmental role, structural emancipation, and the professional/technological, suggest that most reforms are not likely to reduce student alienation in a comprehensive way.

To determine the effects of compliance outcome and basis of power on the powerholder-target relationship, 108 undergraduates read six scenarios in which a powerholder influenced a target. An expected interaction between type of outcome and power base was not found, although main effects were found for each. Subjects perceived more possibility for future use of power, less surveillance necessary, more attraction to the powerholder by target, and more private acceptance of the target following positive rather than negative outcomes. Since the means for outcome were more highly differentiated than those for the power bases, it appears that outcome  is a stronger determinant of the powerholder-target relationship than power bases.

An attempt was made to develop a more meaningful typology of relapse-promoting situations using a sample of 183 exsmokers who called a telephone hotline seeking help to stay away from cigarettes. Two higher order clusters emerged from the cluster analysis of their responses: a positive affect situation in which self-indulgence was prominent, and a negative affect situation characterized by high levels of stress and feeling of anxiety and depression. The most homogeneous subtype of exsmoker occurred when the individual was faced with smoking-related stimuli in social drinking situations. The typology of smoking motivations suggests that the  enhancements of positive affects and dimunition affects are major motivators for smoking. (Author/JAC)",

Both comprehending and composing are basic, complex, interactive processes with students varying in their ability to focus on getting or producing &quot;straight&quot; messages and predicting what messages or responses ought to be. In addition, both composition and comprehension involve prototypical knowledge of the subject matter and the structure or format of texts, the content schemata. Also involved is prototypical knowledge about processing factors--the procedures for composing and comprehending an extended definition or  summary, for instance, which are called process schemata. Content and process schemata change in response to the demands of a situation and become more elaborate and specific with experience. A cognitive approach stresses the role of the teacher in helping students develop these structures, through direct instruction, experiences with reading and writing, and exposure to a variety of reading and writing tasks. With a cognitive approach to writing and reading relationships, it seems that composition and comprehension are very much alike: both use schemata for subject matter, micro and macro structure, and procedures. The sooner students become expert writers and readers, the sooner they can role play and become even more expert, with writers becoming reader-based and readers becoming  writer-based. (HOD)",

The first year of the project focused on conceptualizing the scope of the project and developing the variety of measures that would identify teachers' conceptions of reading. Years 2 and 3 involved field studies in which 23 teachers were observed and interviewed to determine their conceptions and practice of reading instruction. In the fourth year, three teachers who were experiencing some contextual change were observed to  determine effects of the change on conceptions and practice. The collected data suggest that a teacher's conception of reading is not a static set of beliefs regarding what reading is and how it should be presented but is, rather, a &quot;free-floating&quot; element that has little meaning until it is filtered through the teacher's conceptions about the classroom as a social unit and applied to a specific teaching context.

The first three categories describe the rhetorical distinctions that are often made about instruction, providing a background to the analysis of the instruction found in current research. The distinctions in these categories result in four possible modes of instruction: (1) textbook-bound/designed, (2) textbook-bound/responsive, (3) textbook-free/designed, and (4) textbook-free/responsive. However, only the textbook-bound/designed mode of instruction is reflected in the reported research. Categories 4 and 5 describe the global ingredients that are descriptive of the instructional mode. They show that textbook-bound and designed modes of instruction always  focus on student response to directed practice and call for organizational behaviors, social management behaviors, and verbal-pedagogical behaviors by teachers. Categories 6 through 8 describe the specific pedagogical behaviors being studied in the reading instructional research. They reveal two approaches that seem to dominate the research: one--spontaneous generation--is based on the belief that the key to learning is implicit in the act of completing the task and that teachers can be most helpful by exposing students to the task in various ways; the second--teacher explanation--assumes that some students will not be sensitive to such implicit cues and that teachers must make explicit for them the processing that undergirds the task.

Working on the assumption that teachers at all levels need to be made aware of testwiseness strategies and be able to train their students in acquiring these skills, a study examined whether some training of undergraduate student teachers to teach testwiseness strategies would result in a significant degree of  difference between the criterion referenced content area test scores of elementary school children taught these strategies and the test scores of children not taught the strategies. Eight student teachers and 174 elementary school students participated in the study. Each day for 3 weeks students in the experimental groups received testwiseness activities while the students in the control groups worked on other activities such as art or library work. Results indicated that although there was not a significant difference between the experimental and control treatment groups for any of the units taught and for any of the grades or ability groups, there was a slightly higher observed score for six of the nine experimental groups. This does not indicate that the student teachers were able to  transfer the testwiseness strategies instruction they received to the students they taught. (HOD)",

Subjects included seventh grade students who were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Prior to the day of the experiment, students completed a scale to identify their attitudes toward computers and CAI. The treatment consisted of a textual selection programed for use on the TRS-80 color computer. All students read the identical selection as presented by the microcomputer. However, one program utilized computer graphics, whereas the other simply  presented the text on the screen for the student to read. After the treatment, students were given a paper and pencil comprehension test on the reading selection and a postinstructional attitude scale. Results indicated that students using a CAI reading program with graphics did not show a greater increase in reading comprehension. Small negative correlations between the scores on the comprehension test together with treatment and with time suggest that the graphics had a slightly negative effect on the students' comprehension of the reading selection. However, the students who used the reading program with graphics showed a more favorable attitude toward CAI. (Author/HOD)",

Eight good readers and eight poor readers from the fifth grade participated in the study. A computer based laboratory system was used for displaying the texts to be read and for monitoring and recording the eye movement patterns of the subjects engaged in reading. Results indicated that both groups acquired letter information from a region of text extending from two letters to the left of the center of fixation to about six  letters to the right. The average reading rate of the poor readers was about 70% of that for the good readers, while durations of fixations made by poor readers in the control condition were approximately 30% longer than the fixation durations of the good readers. Finally, the average lengths of saccades of the poor readers was about 25% shorter than those made by the good readers.

        "description":"Theory and research in reading comprehension have confirmed the important role of text structure in learning from written materials. The previous work with story grammars provided the basis of this attempt to define frames for explanations in history that would be likely to aid learning. A suggested goal frame includes the goals, plan, action, and outcome that are assumed to constitute the &quot;main ideas&quot; associated with the explanation of a historical event. The goal frame can be used for most interpretations or philosophies of history, since historical events must ultimately be explained in psychological terms, with human beings as the agents of change. The goal is the desired state sought by the main character, the plan is the cognitive strategy for attaining the goal, the action  is overt behavior in response to the plan, and the outcome is the consequence of the action, which may either satisfy or fail to satisfy the goal. A variation of the goal frame gives rise to a new frame, the problem/solution frame. The problem is an event, a condition, or a series of events or conditions resulting in a state that is an obstacle to the attainment of the goal. The problem prompts a solution that takes the form of the plan, action, and outcome of the goal frame. The outcome of the solution either solves or fails to solve the problem. Suggestions are made for using the frames as tools in evaluating historical explanations in textbooks, writing historical explanations, and teaching historical explanations. (HOD)",

Furthermore, for every word a child learned, it was estimated that there were an average of one to three additional related words that should also be understandable to the child, the exact number depending on how well the child is able to utilize context and morphology to induce meanings. Based on this analysis, a reconciliation of estimates of children's vocabulary size was undertaken. It showed that much of the extreme divergence in estimates was due to  the definition of \"word\" adopted. The findings indicate that even the most ruthlessly systematic direct vocabulary instruction could neither account for a significant proportion of all the words children actually learn, nor cover more than a modest proportion of the words they will encounter in school reading materials.

Undergraduate students were presented paired items in randomized order on a computer screen. After all the experiment items were presented, the subjects were asked to fill out a questionnaire about how they approached the task and what they felt about the items (interesting or not, natural sounding or nonnatural). The target sentences had two forms, related by transformations (passive, adverb preposing,  there insertion, raising to subject, raising to object). These rules changed word order or grammatical relations. Results showed the transformed version, with a less perspicuous structure, was harder to process than the untransformed, in a neutral context. Reaction time decreased if the context mentioned the subject and the topic of the sentence. A mismatch between context and target subject/topic increased reaction time somewhat. The results have implications for the definition of sentence topic as subject rather than initial element and for grammatical complexity, which is not absolute. (Author/HOD)",

        "description":"A conceptual framework of attention can be organized around three functions of attention: determining how much capacity is to be deployed (attention allocation), for how long (attention maintenance), and to which potential information sources (attention direction). Within this framework, several critical distinctions can be made between processes that have previously been treated as unitary. For example, attention maintenance can be distinguished from attention allocation since attention maintenance is not a passive continuation of an initial allocation of attention to task, but rather it is an active sustained processing that keeps capacity deployed. Additional distinctions can be made between sustained processing and avoidance of distraction and within the area of distraction.  This leads to the concept of age-appropriate distractibility, which encompasses a description of avoidance of distraction performance in terms of interaction between task variables, such as type of distractor, and child characteristics, such as developmental level. A review of the literature on children's attention within this framework can identify several areas where needed information is not available. In particular, little is known about children's task analysis and monitoring abilities in all areas of attention capacity development. The investigation of component processes of attention in special children should enable the diagnosis of attention problems by functional categories, such as sustained processing or avoidance of distraction deficits, rather than the current, less analytic  diagnostic categories, such as hyperactivity and learning disability.

        "description":"For many years dyslexia has been incorrectly applied to those who have demonstrated difficulty in learning to read. Given the proper guidance and opportunities for becoming sensitive to demonstrations of the workings of language and engaging their minds in learning, many students will overcome their so-called learning disabilities. However, there are some language disorders that have a neurophysiological basis. One study suggests a lack of cerebral asymmetry may lead to dyslexia. Computerized axial tomography (CAT scan) has given support to the hypotheses that to the extent that learning to read involves gestalt perception and right hemispheric processing, abnormal specialization of the right hemisphere may also be an instrumental factor in developmental dyslexia. Other  researchers have combined psycholinguistic methods with neurolinguistic methods to suggest that learning to use a graphic code comes only after knowing the correspondences between acoustics and the graphic code, the grapheme-phoneme correspondence rules. When these rules break down because of a neural coding problem, alexia and agraphia may occur. Other studies show that word-blindness (alexia without agraphia) may be caused by a variety of brain insults. A knowledge of the brain functions of language acquisition and development in out-of-school life will lead to a development of improved language arts pedagogies. (HOD)",

Although many English teachers regard the English component in global education as alien to their concerns, this should not be so. The school of Global Education at Stevenson High School in Lavonia, Michigan, offers an interdisciplinary program with a strong English component. Three multidisciplinary sequences cover the deep past, the large present, and the future. A 2-hour block of English and social studies serves as the nucleus of the program, supplemented by satellite courses taught from a global perspective. All teachers are part of the global team and receive inservice training either  individually or in groups. Cooperatively developed and taught global issues seminars on topics such as hunger, terrorism, and stereotyping are also offered. For those who want to plan a similar program, a variety of resource materials are available from the National Council of Teachers of English and other organizations and journals. Presented at various international conferences, the global approach concept has had a mixed reception, but the reality of the world demands such a perspective. (JL)",

        "description":"The influence of the German picture magazines and their editors and photographers on publisher Henry Luce and his staff during the early years of &quot;Life&quot; magazine has been overlooked. However, there is strong evidence in the Time, Incorporated, archive files indicating that the year Kurt Korff spent as a consultant to the company's newly reorganized experimental department (1935-36) was extremely beneficial in the development of America's first picture magazine. Korff, a German Jewish immigrant, was just one of the Europeans whose photography training and experience on the German picture magazines provided Time, Incorporated, with a model proposed picture magazine, which encouraged Luce to hire him as a consultant to the prepublication staff, and whose contents were prophetic of  the content found in later issues of &quot;Life.&quot; Many of the suggestions Korff made concerning which photographers should be hired for &quot;Life,&quot; how the photographs should be obtained and laid out, and for what audience the magazine should target its material were followed by the publisher. Korff was a likeable man, according to all reports, but he was unable to give up the style of the German magazines, which &quot;Life&quot; planners had no desire to duplicate. Apparently upset that there were no plans to make him a permanent editor on the new magazine's staff, Korff resigned in July, 1936, to work for the Hearst publishing organization. (HTH)",

        "description":"For more than 25 years, the &quot;four theories&quot; paradigm has been dominant in the study of the relationships among the press, society, and the state. Asserting that the major approaches to such study are the libertarian, social responsibility, authoritarian, and Soviet/communist theories, this paradigm fails to account for economic and social pressures that have led to a decline in newspaper plurality and opinions available in Western democratic societies. A new theory has recently emerged to fill this gap. The theory, which arose from democratic socialist ideology, holds that state intervention in the structure and operation of the press should be encouraged to counteract effects of private control and to support the role of the press in the democratic process by promoting  democratic control, as well as unit, communicator, and message plurality in the press. The theory proposes alternative ownership and management forms that would make the press public utilities to be used as tools by people to disseminate their aspirations, ideas, and opinions. The theory is based on the belief that freedom of the press is a right accorded citizens in a democracy and not a privilege reserved only to those who own or control the media. The theory holds that economic and social pressures on the press must be eased if press freedom is to be preserved. (FL)",

        "description":"The Accrediting Council on Education for Journalism and Mass Communication (ACEJMC) is the only agency that accredits college and university advertising programs. Its accrediting committee consists of 10 educators and seven professionals who base the accrediting process largely on how well an advertising unit or sequence meets the objectives and philosophies it has established for itself. A journalism unit or sequence initiates the accreditation process by requesting evaluation by the accrediting council. It then prepares a previsit report in which it assesses its objectives, strengths, and weaknesses. A visiting team appointed by the accrediting committee then visits the campus for about two days, observing classes and interviewing administrators, faculty, and students. Before  leaving the campus, the team prepares its report and presents it to the unit head and the college's highest academic officer, but its recommendation is not revealed at this time. The accrediting committee considers all reports at its annual meeting. The advertising programs are evaluated primarily in terms of their own objectives and philosophies, but the committee has established some basic standards of administration, teaching, facilities, and goals. The Association for Education in Journalism could seek some changes in the current accreditation process, but in any case it must continue to examine and define its own position on accreditation.

Of 456 subjects (half social and behavioral scientists and half biological scientists) chosen randomly from the \"American Men and Women of Science\" reference books, 287 responded to the seven-page, two-part questionnaire. Part one contained 34 attitude statements, and part two elicited information about the extent to which the scientists worked with public information personnel and about their academic and professional backgrounds. The results indicated that large numbers of scientists work at institutions that have public information offices and that their attitudes toward public information personnel are generally positive. Also, the scientists thought it was important to  communicate research results to nonscientists and to learn how to do so effectively. On the negative side, scientists did not use public information personnel often, and sometimes perceived them as a hindrance. Public information personnel might overcome some of these problems by developing formal programs to help scientists to improve their communication skills, by convincing researchers of the importance of working with journalists, by developing formal mechanisms whereby scientists are sought out for story ideas, and by convincing others in the institution not to interfere with scientists' freedom to discuss their research results.

Editors from the 100 largest daily newspapers in the United States were asked to rate 11 political groups on four scales thought to measure political deviance. Fifty-seven responded. Media treatment was determined through content analysis of 604 articles in 7 major newspapers over a 1-year period. The vast majority of the articles were from the \"New York Times.\" Content was analyzed based on two dimension: prominence and character. Prominence included the length of the article, its position in the newspaper, and the position of the group in the article. Character was based on four  legitimacy criteria: evaluation, validity, viability, and stability. Results indicated some support for the theory that the media act as agents of social stability; however, a direct causal relationship between a journalist's perception of a group's deviance and the kind of article he or she will write about the group cannot be assumed.

        "description":"Most of the research on motivations and media use has assumed that there is some general motivation that directs habitual media behavior. Recent work on motivations, however, suggests that it may be valuable to distinguish between general needs and more specific needs, both of which may direct media behavior. For example, regular media use might well be the result of a general motivation to keep informed. On the other hand, use of specific campaign media materials, such as advertisements or political debates, might be directed by a specific need on the part of voters for information to help make election decisions. This set of expectations was tested using data from a telephone survey of registered voters in Ohio during the 1980 United States presidential campaign. It was  postulated that home owners (as opposed to renters), the married, those high in formal education, the older, white, and males would be higher in general need for information. As expected, the results indicated general information need was related to general media use habits. Those persons reporting high levels of need for information read news magazines, watched the national television news, and read a daily newspaper. There was no support at all for the belief that voter uncertainty was related to the need for election information. Specifically, the data indicated that a general need for information was viewed as a product of the respondent's background and social situation, while the need for information for a specific election decision was the product of general media use habits and  possibly uncertainty about the election decision to be made.

Assumptions that negatively influence rhetorical effectiveness can similarly be detected through error analysis. On a smaller scale, error analysis can also reveal assumptions affecting rhetorical choice. Snags in the students' actual composing activity can also be spotted through error analysis. Grammatical correctness or rhetorical effectiveness cannot be evaluated without considering the activity that presented the grammatical or rhetorical form as a possible solution to the problem of making a meaningful statement. The primary reason the cognitive activity must be considered is that remediation of incorrect or ineffective structures depends upon  changing that activity and upon altering the assumptions producing the miscues. Since error analysis can evaluate miscues involving literal, textual, and contextual meaning and offer suggestions concerning how to improve a writer's individual composing procedure, it should be considered as a process-oriented method of evaluating both the composing process and its products.

Two groups of subjects each heard two radio spot announcements, one humorous and one serious. Two different products were advertised, so that the first group of subjects, 117 college advertising students, were exposed to a serious commercial for one product and a humorous spot for the other, while the second group, 132 students, heard the opposite. The humorous and serious versions of each advertisement were identical in situation, product information, basic sales appeal, and number of times the product name and slogan were mentioned. Subjects then filled out a questionnaire that solicited information on their perception of the  commercials' credibility, authoritativeness, and character, as well as their retention of the message. The results indicated that there was a significant difference between the two groups for each ad on the perceived humor of the message, however, no difference in the subjects' ability to recall copy points was found between the humorous and serious messages. Subjects rated the serious versions more credible than the humorous versions. The results suggest that the use of humor will have little effect on recall, and that a serious message is likely to be judged more credible and to have more authority than a humorous ad. (HTH)",

Six students from a photojournalism class conducted interviews with 103 liberal arts students and showed them 1 photograph from each of 8 areas--patriotism, povery, racism, urban life, highways, crowds, interiors of public places, and affected women--in 3 steps: (1) 5-second exposure; (2) indefinite exposure for as long as it held the subject's  interest; and (3) story construction in which the subject constructed a story from all the photographs. In the second phase, the subjects Q-sorted the opinion statements from phase 1 according to three conditions: to represent what they believed the photographs communicate about American life, to imagine they had a set of photographs that depicted American life as they saw it, and to imagine they had a set of photographs that depicted American life in an ideal sense. Results indicated that the subjects rejected Frank's photographs not because they were unrepresentative of American life but because they evoked feelings of alienation. (JL)",

        "description":"There are three dominant conceptions of functional sentence perspective (FSP): (1) a sentence should be analyzed into several segments, each having a different degree of what is called communicative dynamism; (2) a sentence should be analyzed into two segments, the theme and the rheme; and (3) a sentence should be analyzed into two segments, the topic and the comment. More recently, scholars such as Peter Fries have used some notions derivable from FSP to talk about the perceived structure of texts. One important claim is that the information contained within the themes of all the sentences of a paragraph creates the method of development of that paragraph. Other lines of research that are closely related to work in FSP and that have some promising practical sides show paragraphs  to be consistent with the third view of FSP. For example, a sentence will be easy to comprehend if its given information is easy to recognize, matches a direct antecedent in memory, and occurs before the new information. Composition instructors should teach their students the principles of the third view of FSP and should show them how to adjust English syntax to make their sentences conform to these principles. Doing this should help students produce more readable and memorable essays, should make them more sensitive to the informational needs of their particular readers, should provide them with guidelines for revision, should help them develop greater syntactical facility, and should help them write sentences moving from shorter subjects to longer predicates rather than from longer  subjects to shorter predicates.

        "description":"A survey was conducted to determine the extent and content of newspaper coverage of foreign policy issues in the 1980 United States presidential campaign. Fifty daily newspapers from every region of the country were selected randomly based on circulation. A list of 757 news events was divided into party and nonparty events, and the party events were then divided into campaign events and issue events. Issue events were in turn divided into economic, domestic, and foreign categories. After the campaign itself, foreign affairs subjects constituted about 15% of total events covered. Four issues generated more news than any others: (1) Iran-hostages (27 events); (2) the Stealth airplane (18 events); (3) Salt II negotiations (13 events); and (4) war and peace (10 events). The data  indicates that both candidates initiated foreign affairs issues in hope of political advantage; that newspapers covered these issues more intensely than those that had more direct bearing on the campaign; that editors were more interested in the war and peace issue (while favoring the Iranian crisis on the front page); that they were least interested in the Stealth issue, perhaps because it was too complicated; and that neither they nor the politicians were willing to explore the Salt II issue in spite of clear differences between the candidates. As a whole, foreign affairs coverage was more political than substantive. (JL)",

        "description":"Collaborative learning, in which students form small groups to analyze their own writing, can cause students who recognize good writing and know the &quot;rules&quot; to reexamine their own writing and writing processes and then produce an acceptable product. Given eight sample paragraphs from their own writing, 20 freshman students working in 5 groups provided insightful criticisms that were then used to generate a provocative 4-part paragraph heuristic. The four &quot;rules&quot; they came up with covered levels of generalization, use of evidence, the need for pausing to explore implications of ideas, and the importance of cohesiveness and comprehensive coverage at each level of the paragraph. The next set of papers handed in showed the distinct improvement produced when the students used these  rules for self-checking paragraphs. Not just a fine pedagogical tool, this student-generated heuristic is just one example of the breakthroughs possible when collaborative learning is used on the college level. This format helps the teacher as well as the student to go beyond the often unproductive rules of traditional approaches to teaching. (An appendix charts sample paragraphs in terms of the heuristic.)

Telephone interviews were conducted with 226 mothers who had children between the ages of 2 and 12. The respondents answered questions that addressed their attitudes toward television and its use by children, the amount of television they believed their children watched each day, their policies governing the use of television by their children, their reasons for using television as a babysitter, and the frequency of such use. Results showed that the mothers used television as a babysitter primarily so that they could take care of household chores. While confirming that this practice also  gave them time to relax, the mothers denied using television so that they could socialize. Nearly half of the respondents reported using television as a babysitter for at least 1 hour each day. Mothers of younger children and those with less formal education tended to use the practice more frequently than did those with older children and more formal education. These mothers also generally approved of television viewing for children and watched a great deal of television themselves. Television as a babysitter was not used appreciably more often by single mothers or by those who also worked outside the home. (FL)",

Data from observations of child behavior during the writing process together with data from observations of teacher practices led to seven hypotheses: (1)  behaviors of writers are ideosyncratic and highly variable; (2) clusters of behaviors should be observed before making decisions about writers; (3) scope and sequence curricula have little relevance in helping writers develop; (4) the scaffolding-conference approach is the best response to the variable writer; (5) let students write daily, sustain selections longer, and write at predictable times; (6) let children choose most of their topics because it assists them with voice, heightens semantic domain, skill of narrowing topic, and basic decision making; and (7) skills are best taught within the context of the child's own writing.

The third article examines the cry for basics in the teaching of writing and offers four neglected &quot;touchstones&quot; that could improve writing instruction, while the fourth article considers reasons why writing is so difficult for some and offers recommendations  for instruction that are useful to both teachers and curriculum designers. The fifth article reviews two of the attempts to return to educational basics since the 1950s, &quot;reexcavating&quot; foundations that reveal the education of the literary imagination as an essential basic to morality and understanding, growth and awareness.

In the opening section the physics of light and vision, optic neuroanatomy, and cortical responses to visual stimuli are explained. Next, theories of vision and data mapping are examined and their implications for composition theory and pedagogy are discussed. The remainder of the paper focuses on the role of vision in the composing process, considering: (1) the relationships between writing and other kinds of language, (2) writing dysfunction, and (3) visual defects causing visual language mode deficits. Vision pathologies that contribute to writing deficiencies are then explained. These include: right homonymous hemianopia, aphasia,  dyslexia, simultanagnosia, a specific lesion near the angular gyrus, delayed maturation in the parieto-occipital regions, and other neurological disorders. Composition teachers often encounter but do not recognize students whose writing impairments are caused by congenital brain malformation. Therefore, it is suggested that medical histories of all basic writing students might help distinguish which students are deficient in writing skills for educational reasons and which are neurologically impaired.

        "description":"A study identified the homophones most commonly used in children's writing and showed how the relative use of specific homophones changes as writing skill develops. Homophones appearing in Rinsland's &quot;A Basic Vocabulary of Elementary School Children,&quot; a vocabulary list compiled from a national sample of children's writing in grades 2 through 8, were identified by cross-matching with two extensive homophone lists. This procedure resulted in 217 homophone units consisting of 451 words. A tabulation of the grade-level frequency of each homophone was made, resulting in 49 &quot;common&quot; homophones--those occurring 10 or more times at 5 different grade levels. The remaining homophones were then placed in rank order. Since students in the higher grade levels provided more running words for  the Rinsland study than did those in lower grades, the resulting composite was somewhat biased in the direction of older writers, but indicated that certain homophones were dominant at every grade level. Two homophone units--&quot;there/their&quot; and &quot;to/two/too&quot;--exhibit the greatest utility at every grade level. An important implication of these findings is that many homophone units generally considered the province of primary grade instruction should be reviewed and practiced throughout elementary school spelling instruction.

        "description":"A study examined whether advertising appeals based on product affiliation, achievement, and attributes would account for differences in male readership of liquor advertisements. The investigation focused on the relationship between the content of alcholic beverage advertisements and attention engagement, the first state in consumer information processing. The sample consisted of 48 Starch scored ads taken from 3 weekly magazines. The ads were evaluated by three trained coders who were instructed to carefully study each ad and, based on an &quot;overall impression&quot; decision rule, identify them as employing a product affiliation, achievement, or attribute appeal. ANOVA was used to test for readership differences between liquor ads employing the three different appeals. Included in the  analysis were the three major levels of Starch scores: (1) &quot;noted&quot; (percentage of readers who saw the ad); (2) &quot;seen/associated&quot; (percentage of readers who read any part of the ad); and (3) &quot;read most&quot; (percentage of readers who read more than half of the ad's copy). The liquor ads employing appeals to achievement significantly outscored the ads employing appeals to affiliation and product-attributes in readership. There were no statistically significant differences in the readership scores between the liquor ads employing appeals to affiliation and those employing appeals to attributes. (HTH)",

Subjects were 47 college students who wrote preliminary and final drafts of persuasive letters. Results of both experiments revealed that the students' verbal SAT scores were positively correlated with their preliminary draft argument production. In addition, the students' writing apprehension scores were negatively correlated with their verbal SAT scores and with their preliminary draft argument production, but not significantly so. In general, the findings provide some support for those educators who believe that students' verbal SAT scores should be taken into consideration when predictions  are made about their actual writing ability and when decisions are made about placing them in advanced writing courses.

        "description":"A technique sometimes known as patterned prose or case book exposition is an effective way to improve student writing while also holding their interest. It may also help solve a problem pointed to by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP): students' inability to think about what they read. The technique is simple. The teacher chooses the question, provides the information, and specifies the forms of the students' persuasive essays. First students are given an information sheet with a question and a series of quotations from authorities, some positive and some negative. Next they are presented with a model essay whose various parts--title, thesis, evidence, transitions, and conclusion--are outlined in the left margin. Students then write essays based on this model,  refining the process as they progress. This kind of activity is as old as the western university: \"quaestiones disputatae\" have worked for 700 years, which is a good reason to try them again. The \"Congressional Digest\" and \"The Reference Shelf\" are good information resources for this technique. (JL)",

        "description":"Neither the introductory survey of research course nor the audit course adequately prepares the organizational communication specialist for a career in a nonacademic organization. Therefore it is important for the organizational communication graduate student to receive some experiential or quasiexperiential learning along with his or her training in auditing techniques. Case analysis study can provide this experience based learning. There are, however, some instructional design problems that must be overcome before case analysis study can be implemented. Organizational communication must first develop its own collection of case studies emphasizing communication oriented issues. Even after this collection is developed, the question remains as to how much practical benefit the  students will receive from the use of these studies. Actual practice with a client in the capacity of \"a professional in training\" might provide a student near the end of a graduate program with the skills needed to be a genuine professional. Organizations would probably be receptive to the idea of receiving communication consultants without charge in exchange for their providing the sites for training. (JL)",

        "description":"Among the characteristics of communicative apprehensive individuals are fearful reactions to communication situations, perceptions of low personal competency, an inability to identify appropriate social behaviors, and an anticipation of negative outcomes to interaction. One proposed model for communication apprehension assumes that a state of apprehension arises as a result of an inability to identify communication behaviors expected to lead to a realization of the interaction goal (perceived outcome). The chance of arriving at an expectation of goal accomplishment is increased as the number of alternatives under consideration is increased. These expectations arise as a result of a cognitive evaluation process that may involve both personality and situational factors. The model  assumes that the task of the individual is to identify some behavior or behavioral strategy which, when enacted in the presence of one's co-interactant, will result in the accomplishment of some end. An initial test of the model to determine its use to predict the occurrence of a state of communication apprehension showed that expected success in accomplishing an interaction goal and expected self-image maintenance were both significant predictors of anxiety.

        "description":"After organizations decide upon innovations these innovations must be implemented. The likelihood and the ease of getting an adoption unit (the segment of the organization responsible for translating decisions into action) to implement an innovation desired by a decision unit depend upon a number of factors: (1) the adoption unit's perception of the risk involved, (2) the complexity of the innovation, and (3) the power and communication costs required to overcome the adoption unit's resistance. The decision unit has three types of power available to it--sanction, authority, and influence--and each of these types has associated costs and demands a different level of involvement. The interaction of these various factors can be charted and the costs of various combinations assessed.  Organizations must be alert to situations that might overload their communication channels and thereby prevent successful innovation implementation. (JL)",

        "author":["Streeter, Thomas"],
        "description":"In the public eye, three major investigations by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) into the dominance of the broadcast networks have appeared as battles between opposing forces with lively conflicts as the FCC combats monopolistic power in the name of public interest. In spite of the past investigations and the resulting regulations, however, broadcasting is still overwhelmingly dominated by a handful of large corporations whose policies are the most important determinants of broadcast structure and content. FCC policy has done little to alter this situation and in many cases has helped further it. Hence, the image projected by the investigations serves only to mask a cooperative relationship between the broadcast networks and the FCC. A survey of the history of the  investigations shows that this process is made possible by the mythology of the marketplace, which presupposes competition in broadcasting without allowing for exploration of the possibility that marketplace economics are an inadequate framework for understanding broadcast structure. In this light, the deregulatory bent of the investigation completed in 1980, appears not as a departure from the approach of its predecessors, but a continuation of it. (Author)",

        "description":"The communication responsibility of corporate executives within their organizations entails two dimensions: the information dimension involving the content or meaning of what is communicated, and the interpersonal dimension involving the relationship between the people communicating. To successfully manage a corporation, executives must have an efficient system for dealing with uncertainty. To reduce uncertainty, they need information that is descriptive, concerns value judgments, and pertains to policy. They must ask themselves evaluative questions pertaining to five areas of uncertainty, such as, What are the company's goals? Does it meet them? and Is the company encouraging the development of individual potential? The manager who has this information must also understand how  to handle it effectively to avoid information overload. Information should be processed selectively, sequentially, and continually. Most of the information managers receive is from interpersonal communication, which they then interpret, store, use, or disseminate. Institutions can exist only when there are people interacting with one another, and such interaction structures firms by making coordination, control, and growth possible, and by enhancing the value of information. The basic role of the manager or executive is to maintain interpersonal communication to the benefit of the organization. (HTH)",

Questionnaires were completed by 884 5th and 10th grade students, half of whom were Hispanic and half Anglo. The questionnaire measured several variables, including exposure to several media, content preferences, perceived media credibility, perceptions of cultural portrayals in the media, and demographics. Respondents chose from 12 cultural labels the one they felt applied best to them. Fourteen percent of the respondents chose Chicano, 13% chose Spanish-American, and 24% Mexican-American. Fifty-one percent reported speaking English and no Spanish in the home, and 9% spoke  mostly Spanish. Self-designated Chicanos and Mexican-Americans had similar media preferences: they were interested in ethnic-oriented music and not interested in recreation magazines or classical and country and western music. Mexicans expressed a distinct preference for Spanish content in all media. Spanish-Americans were uninterested in local and Latin news, while Anglos expressed lower preference for Spanish and local news, Saturday television, entertainment magazines, and black-oriented music. Anglos were more likely than Hispanics to speak and read English, read few comic books, listen to few records and tapes, watch less television, assign low believability to television, perceive television minorities as unreal, and perceive media Mexican-American portrayals as positive.

Subjects were 238 male and 209 female undergraduate students enrolled in the required basic communication course at the University of Bridgeport (Connecticut). A Likert-type instrument was used to assess levels of communication apprehension over the four contexts. Results indicated no difference in male and female students relative to either group or interpersonal communication apprehension; however, significant differences were found between male and female in the meeting and public communication contexts, with the females displaying higher levels of apprehension. There  was actually less frequency of high communication apprehension in basic students than in regular college students, though the differences between the two populations was not found to be significant. A possible explanation for the results is that certain high school subpopulations utilize communication skills to make up for academic deficiencies. Identifying further subcategories in the underprepared student population could lead to new classroom strategies in the teaching of these groups. (JL)",

        "description":"A sample of 472 superintendents in New York State participated in this study, which examined the presence of sex discrimination in the selection of secondary school principals. The superintendents were asked to rate a hypothetical applicant resume that included credentials and a photograph. A hypothetical job description of a secondary school principal and a questionnaire were also included in the packet. The results of the study indicated no difference based on gender in the ratings of applicants with identical qualifications. In a follow-up investigation, 59 superintendents (from the original sample) who had hired one or more secondary principals during the 1980-81 school year were interviewed concerning their hiring experiences. The majority of these superintendents stated  that few female applicants were qualified for the job, an assertion the researchers were unable to confirm or refute. The study reaches no conclusions about the presence or absence of sex discrimination in hiring practices, but suggests that the small number of women hired as secondary school principals in New York State may be due to an insufficient number of women applying for the position and to continued sex discrimination.

Given particular attention are field-based training programs and administrative internships, particulary the National Association of Secondary School Principals' Internship Project. Also described are the McCleary model for competency-based training for school administrators, Indiana State University's Experimental Preparation Program, and Project ICES (Internships, Certification, Equity-Leadership and Support). The author lists eight obstacles to field-based training and offers eight recommendations for increasing the effectiveness of field-based training experiences. The final section of  the monograph discusses future trends in principal training programs, based on the results of a national survey conducted in 1981 of principals, department of education personnel in all states, and college professors. Increasing, static, and decreasing trends are identified. Additionally, the Contingency Framework for Administrator Development is presented as a flexible model for administrator training.

The first three chapters stress the teacher's role. Chapter 1 describes the planning, implementation, and maintenance of strategies for preventing behavior problems; chapter 2 discusses differences between managing groups and handling individual problems; and chapter 3 surveys the range of information an adequate classroom management training program must include. Chapter 4 deals with meeting the special needs of students, touching specifically on assessment and referral and on special programs and services. The fifth chapter examines the important  relationship between teachers' intentions and the results of their actions, and presents methods for improving student-teacher communication. The last three chapters explore the educational environment's effect on behavior. Chapter 6 analyzes the different management styles required by different student groupings; chapter 7 probes the ways schools can be organized to encourage development of good behavior habits in students; and the last chapter describes relationships between schools' organizational characteristics and their behavioral objectives.

        "description":"Both empirical and theoretical considerations suggest that countries that have adopted federal systems of government have a tendency toward certain types of problems which may constrain the success of educational planning at every level in the educational system. Specific operational examples of such problems are lack of role clarification, and lack of coordination of policies and programs within and between various levels of government. This paper urges greater attention to the study of these problems, their effects on educational planning, and of the various mechanisms being used in an attempt to resolve the problems. Attempts to draw generalizations across a broad range of federal states are encouraged, since such a process would help to enhance understanding of problems  related to educational planning in both federal and unitary states.

This review of the literature discusses common factors affecting student behavior; underlines the need for identifying behavior problems early and communicating with students and parents; and suggests 15 positive responses to behavior problems that are suitable to different circumstances. Five teacher behaviors that can influence student behaviors are discussed: modeling good behavior, designing suitable learning spaces, interacting with students, responding to student attempts to improve, and assessing student learning for  purposes of promoting development. The possible impact of non-classroom staff, the curriculum, and the community on both the development of and the solutions to behavior problems is also explored. The document concludes with a listing of the 70 references concerning student behavior and discipline cited in the literature review, and two dozen additional references on the topic. (Author/PGD)",

        "description":"Mesa Verde High School was constructed in 1974 and is the last high school built in the San Juan (California) Unified District. It serves students in grades 9 through 12 and has an open enrollment policy. Mesa Verde operates on a year-round schedule with students divided into three tracks. Basically, each track is in session for 9 weeks and then is off for 3 weeks. Students are assigned to a track according to their achievement level and academic goals. Academically, 9th and 11th grade students at Mesa Verde scored slightly below average on a nationally normed test administered in the spring of 1981. On minimum competency tests over the last 3 years, the percent passing has risen from 43 percent on the Communication Skills test in 1979 to 67 percent in 1981, and has increased  from 64 percent on the Computational Skills test in 1979 to 78 percent in 1981. Attitudes of students, parents, and staff were surveyed during the spring of 1981. Seventy-nine percent of the parents, 80 percent of the students and 92 percent of the staff indicated having a positive or very positive attitude toward Mesa Verde. Attitudes were similarly strong toward the year-round schedule and academic tracking. (Author/PGD)",

        "description":"Taking the view that job sharing is a positive alternative for workers and employers, this article defines job sharing in broad terms and describes its evolution from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to the present. The advantages, such as increased productivity, are felt to be impressive, but disadvantages also exist, including significant cost increases to employers and lack of support from management, unions, and the federal government. However, federal and state interest is increasing, especially because of the high unemployment problem and current recession. California's Work Sharing Unemployment Insurance program, which allows payment of partial benefits to work sharers, has resulted in more people working and less money being expended for unemployment compensation.  Other experimental programs have been successfully implemented in the public and private sectors. As employers become the initiating force behind job sharing, it will become firmly established in both male and female occupations. Problems to be worked out before that occurs include consideration of salary advancement and career promotion, greater attention given to accurate job descriptions and performance evaluation, and identification of the kinds of jobs that can be shared.

The document's first section examines the different assumptions and implications of technological, political, and cultural perspectives on educational innovation. Section 2 looks at the dynamics of educational change. It first notes the common characteristics of schools and then discusses the school dilemma of choosing among four pairs of alternatives--coordination versus flexibility, external expertise-seeking versus self-reliance, centralized  versus shared influence, and change versus stability. This section next considers the costs and rewards of educational change and suggests ways to move away from the technological mindset. The role of outsiders and insiders in school change is analyzed in the final section, which examines the characteristics and strategies of external change agents before discussing the roles of teachers, principals, superintendents, and district resource staff. The authors suggest that a team approach could bring insiders and outsiders together. (Author/RW)",

Called the &quot;AB 65 Elementary Consortium,&quot; the interdistrict collaboration was started in response to California Assembly Bill (AB) 65, which mandates tests of elementary students' basic skills proficiencies. The proficiency testing consortium was &quot;freestanding&quot; in that member organizations contributed all the resources required. Established in 1977, the consortium began developing guidelines for proficiency tests, had a setback in early 1979 when its first tests (prepared by consultants) proved to be of poor quality, but retrenched and succeeded in publishing its own testing  products in 1980-81. The tests chiefly measured math, reading, and writing competencies in grades 4, 6, and 8. Consortium membership grew from 12 districts and agencies in 1978 to 33 in 1980 and fell back to 25 in mid-1981. Important in the consortium's development were its sources and uses of services and information, the role of the Santa Clara County Superintendent of Schools, and the districts' local control over their own participation.

Data were collected from interviews, directories, and documents. Five IOA characteristics were studied: their history, environmental context, structure, operations, and outputs. The survey identified 103 IOAs in the Bay Area and revealed that 67 percent of the 409 educational agencies in the region, including all 231 school districts, were involved in one or more IOAs. The researchers developed a classification system based on two dimensions: the IOA's legal status (whether mandated by outside agencies, enabled or  sponsored by outside agencies, or &quot;freestanding,&quot; meaning supported chiefly by member organizations), and the school improvement's legal status (mandated, enabled, or freestanding). Analysis based on this classification system showed, among other things, that most IOAs relied on external requirements or resources and that IOA characteristics include both tight and loose coupling. The findings bear a number of implications for research and policy on educational collaboration and school improvement. An appendix provides extensive descriptions of the characteristics of types of IOAs. (Author/RW)",

The author first reviews information from a national survey investigating industry-education-labor collaboration.

A brief profile of the Industry-Education Council of California, a statewide network of IECs, is followed by a lengthy description of the Industry-Education Council of Santa Clara County  (California). The author notes local educational needs, discusses the Santa Clara County IEC's origins, goals, staff, and activities, and reviews two of its projects, one on computer literacy and the other involving high school student employment resumes. The document concludes that successful industry-education collaboration is characterized by feelings of mutual ownership and commitment among participants, evidence of accomplishment, and involvement of non-members in some activities.

Each article summarizes literature relevant to one type of educational agency, discusses interrelationships among the research findings, and assesses the implications for federal policy and further research. In the first article, Michael Fullan synthesizes recent findings on local educational agencies' use of external resources to improve schools and suggests four types of needed research. David Clark analyzes reports on the role played in school improvement by schools, colleges, and departments of education within institutions of higher education, and calls for further descriptive and  evaluative data. In the third article, Carolyn Moran and Larry Hutchins examine educational service agencies (including &quot;intermediate&quot; and &quot;regional&quot; service centers) and ponder the implications of federal funding cutbacks. Regional education laboratories and university centers are covered by Leslie Salmon-Cox, who recommends continued support for these research and development agencies. Finally, Henry M.

        "description":"Formed by the Connecticut legislature to monitor the state's educational aid plan, the Educational Equity Study Committee in this report joins with the state Board of Education in recommending amendments to Connecticut's 1979 school finance reform law, involving changes in the state's Minimum Expenditure Requirement (MER) plan and Guaranteed Tax Base (GTB) equalization formula. The first section briefly discusses the background to the report, including the adoption of the current system of state aid and the establishment of the Study Committee. The second section addresses the use of the GTB formula, nonformula impacts on state aid, needed updates in data used in the formula, the impact of the 1979 reforms, and the reasons for the recommended changes in the GTB formula. The  state's MER plan is examined in the third section, which analyzes how MER is calculated, its impact, methods of ensuring compliance with MER, and reasons for recommending MER changes. The two final sections present the Study Committee's future goals and summarize relevant events in the 1981 state legislature. Four appendices provide a glossary, a summary of a 1980 Study Committee public meeting, minority reports from committee members, and data on 1979-82 GTB grants. (RW)",

The book is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 offers background on federal-state relations and explains the research methods used, the grants-in-aid system, and the conceptual framework guiding the study. Chapter 2 describes the four states in the sample and identifies those political and organizational characteristics that shape policy implementation. Chapter 3 presents a comparative analysis of the data and discusses the conditions under which state political factors are most likely to enhance the state education  agency's role and capacity. Chapters 4 and 5 examine Title I, PL 94-142, and state programs serving similar student groups. The final chapter addresses policy questions, especially those related to state capacity and its implications for changing federal and state roles in public education. (Author/WD)",

The authors find that the emphasis in effective schools on academic content, a tightly coupled curriculum, and teacher-directed, individualized, and carefully monitored instruction is echoed in the requirements for individualized education programs in special education. On a schoolwide basis, common goals, high standards, clear rules of conduct, and an emphasis on basic skills are also reflected in the underlying philosophy of  P.L. 94-142. The authors conclude that procedural and technical problems accompanying passage of the law have resulted in a general confusion of good content with bad implementation. A checklist for effective teaching behaviors is appended. (Author/WD)",

A study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) found that by 1981 the requirements of the law had yet to be met. According to the GAO, the Secretary of Education should reactivate the Federal Education Data Acquisition Council; ensure that only under very unusual circumstances will information collection requests not publicly announced prior to February 15 before the school year be imposed on respondents; implement all the paperwork amendments' requirements; work with the federal Office of Management and Budget to develop efficient coordinating procedures and compatible automated systems for identifying information collection redundancies;  and conduct feasibility and cost analyses of automated indexing system alternatives before undertaking further system development. This document discusses the factors considered by the GAO in developing these recommendations, describes the recommendations in greater detail, and presents the Department of Education's responses to the recommendations.

        "description":"The results of a study of five midwestern school districts suggest that the abandonment of program innovations or revisions may be related to a lack of understanding of how schools work as social systems and how political processes influence change efforts, as well as a failure to appreciate the many dilemmas facing those who attempt to facilitate school improvement. The study revealed that, in each case, innovative programs were adopted because of political pressures; the assistance and training provided sites by National Diffusion Network facilitators and developers were almost exclusively technical and failed to consider local circumstances; and decisions to discontinue programs were made informally by teachers asserting their autonomy in the classroom. This information about  the actors in the implementation process supports the theory that an informal covenant exists concerning the principal's prerogatives and the teacher's role and authority. The researchers conclude that successful implementation efforts must account for several factors: the organizational culture of both the schools and the change agencies involved; the type of training desired by the teachers; the importance of the principal to program adoption and of the teachers to implementation; and the need for adapting programs to local circumstances.

        "description":"The Administrative Stress Index, a 35-item questionnaire, was designed, validated, and sent to members of the Confederation of Oregon School Administrators to identify perceived job stress, to establish stress categories, and to discover how administrators cope with stress. Usable responses were received from 1,156 elementary and secondary principals, superintendents, and central office administrators. The typical subject was male, 42 years old, had 9 years of administrative experience, and worked 55 hours per week. Varimax rotation of the data revealed four interpretable dimensions of stress: role-based stress, task-based stress, boundary-spanning stress (arising from relating the school to the external environment), and conflict-mediating stress. Relationships were found  between these dimensions and such personal characteristics as age, tenure, and health. Contrary to previous research findings, some stress factors were observed to increase with age and tenure. The data also suggested that despite similarities between their jobs, principals and superintendents experienced widely different degrees of stress. Coping activities fell into three categories: physical activity, mental control, and management skill development. The research indicated previous studies have not been comprehensive enough and that further study is needed. (Author/PGD)",

Researchers isolated 35 stressors, or stress-inducing situations, that could be grouped into 5 categories of 7 stressors each: administrative constraints, administrative responsibilities, interpersonal relations, intrapersonal conflict, and role expectations. Of the ten stressors perceived as most bothersome, five were from the administrative constraints category. Rank-order analysis revealed that administrators at all levels share many common stressors, though the specific values assigned the stressors by those at  different levels may be quite divergent. Higher levels of stress were also consistently associated with reports of poor health, regardless of the stressor involved. The most important elements common to major stressors were identified as the management of time in time-consuming activities, the need to comply with rules and policies, and the maintenance of interpersonal relations.

        "description":"Both proponents and opponents of public support for private education argue that their own proposals for funding education offer the only means for achieving diversity, efficiency, and equity in education. Proponents of public support for private schools claim that diversity of educational options can only be guaranteed through government support of those options, that efficiency will be improved through assurance of competition for government funds, and that only with government support can private education be made available to all. Opponents state that government regulation of private education would destroy diversity, that public support of schools furthering the views of special interest groups would be inefficient in that it would undercut the public mission of developing  democratic ideals, and that increased public support would only enable the economically strong to escape from public schools even more easily, destroying any equity that now exists. The author of this paper describes enrollment and funding trends affecting a parochial school in New Mexico, discusses the arguments for and against public support of private education, and presents a framework for analyzing any proposals for funding nonpublic education according to their effects on diversity, efficiency, and equity, and according to their relative impacts on public and private schools.

        "description":"From a preliminary study of two secondary schools, the author of this report hypothesizes that four essential types of networks determine the character of the educational process. The most important of these is the individual teacher's personal field, the egocentric network of relationships growing out of the teacher's own personal interests. The second field, equally egocentric, consists of the relations between a teacher and his or her students. The third, also egocentric, consists of those relations the teacher builds with other staff members to protect his or her teaching style or enrich his or her personal life. The fourth network comprises all the aspects of the entire staff's various field networks that interrelate within the context of the school. The author suggests that  the school's true curriculum develops in the egocentric fields where the individual teacher has greatest autonomy, and that effective control of the fourth network is severely limited by the sheer complexity of the interrelationships among the various fields. This concept accounts for the notion of &quot;loose coupling&quot; and suggests further that school effectiveness depends on how students fit into the fields individual teachers develop.

The data for the Coleman report and the present reanalysis are drawn from the &quot;High School and Beyond&quot; study, a 1980 national survey of 30 sophomores in each of 1,002 high schools. The researchers find that using regression equations on aggregate school-level data instead of individual-level data reduces the error in individual-level equations (caused by error in variable measurement) and controls for the contextual effects of student-body socioeconomic status. The reanalysis indicates that the apparent superiority of private schools in academic achievement is much smaller when computed  at the school level rather than at the individual level. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"Intended to provide a comprehensive view of parental involvement in school districts receiving federal education funds, this study collected data on four federal programs in 57 projects across the country. Titles I and VII of the Elementary Secondary Education Act, the Emergency School Aid Act, and Follow Through were examined. The entire study is presented in seven volumes. This report comprises volume 1 and discusses three objectives of the study--describing the nature and types of parental involvement, analyzing the factors that facilitate or inhibit parental involvement, and identifying the consequences of parental involvement. The researchers stipulate five ways in which parents can participate in local projects, including governance, instruction, parent education, school  support, and community-school relations. Facilitating and inhibiting factors are delineated for each type of participation. Consequences of parental involvement are also presented according to the type of participation and demonstrate the effects of such participation on institutional arrangements as well as on the attitudes and behaviors of administrators, teachers, parents, and students. Two final sections of the report give answers to frequently asked questions about parental involvement and place the study's findings within the context of a changing federal role in education.

Field researchers collected data for this report during the spring of 1980. They lived in the communities studied, 57 in all, and spent 4 months interviewing parents and project staff, observing classrooms and events, and analyzing project documents. The resultant information relates to five avenues for parental involvement in federal education programs: governance, instruction, parent education, school support, and school-community relations. Within each of these five areas, this report presents the findings for the four federal programs individually. Overall, the  study revealed a wide range in the level of parental involvement. The researchers conclude that active parent participation produced real benefits for schools, parents, and children. The involvement did not occur by chance, however, but had to be deliberately stimulated. (Author/WD)",

Site studies of ESAA projects yielded data on the five ways parents could participate in the programs--through governance, instruction, parent education, school support, and community-school relations. The researchers found that all 12 sites in the sample had established district-wide advisory committees, but that these committees were not decision-making bodies. Their lack of participation in policy making was largely attributed to the project directors' failure to encourage parent leadership. Few sites  involved parents in the instructional process--as paraprofessionals, volunteers, or as tutors at home. However, the data did indicate that parental participation in instruction could bring changes in teachers' instructional approaches, improve student performance, and increase parents' interest in their children's educational experiences. Few consequences of parental involvement were reported in school support, parent education, or community-school relations activities. Where evident, parental participation appeared to encourage student interest in school and to enhance the opportunity for parents to be hired as paid aides. For each area of involvement studied, policies and activities are suggested for improving parent participation. (Author/WD)",

Site studies of Title VII projects yielded data on the five ways parents could participate in the programs--through governance, instruction, parent education, school support, and community-school relations. The researchers found that all 13 sites had a mandated community advisory committee made up of a majority of parents with limited-English-proficient students in the project. Most of these committees were not involved in governance because both parents and school  staff tended to feel that education should be left to the professionals. Parents participated very little in the instructional process, but wherever staff created a specific place for parental involvement, the parents responded. Most of the sites offered some form of parent education. Coordination of activities was one of the most salient factors contributing to success in this area as well as in school support and community-school relations. Suggestions are offered for improving parent participation in Title VII projects. Where parent involvement did occur, it was deemed worthwhile. (Author/WD)",

The researchers found that all 16 sites had policy advisory committees, though they were structured differently than those described in the Follow Through regulations. Most of the committees made decisions about parent activities, but few participated significantly in project decisions about student  services, budget, or personnel. Parents were widely used as classroom aides and most sites worked to involve parents in teaching their children at home. Few sites had active programs to recruit parents as volunteers, but those that did provided a substantial role for the volunteers. Parent enrichment programs were well developed, offering parents a major role in determining the content of parent education activities. The sites also involved parents in active school support and community relations programs. The report concludes that parents materially affected the quality of education provided to students in Follow Through projects. (Author/WD)",

In order to accomplish the study's objectives, two types of substudies were implemented--a federal programs survey and the individual site studies. The federal programs survey data were collected from four independent samples of districts (and schools within those districts) to provide a national representation of participants within each of the four target programs--the Emergency School Aid Act, Titles I and VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and Follow Through. Separate questionnaires were prepared for the school and district levels and for the Follow Through projects. The site studies provided information not  supplied by the questionnaires, such as the contributory factors and consequences of parent participation. Field researchers conducted interviews, observations, and document analyses over an extended period of time. The sample for site studies represented schools and districts with both greater and smaller degrees of parental involvement, as determined from the federal programs survey. Data were collected on parent involvement through five types of activities--governance, instruction, parent education, school support, and school-community relations. The methodologies employed were judged to be efficient, thorough, and valid. (Author/WD)",

The findings will have bearing on the usefulness of the Research, Development, and Diffusion (RD &amp; D) Model, which has been criticized on the grounds that it does not take into account the modification or &quot;reinvention&quot; of programs that occurs when they are replicated at other sites. In the current study, eight programs are being examined--four in education and four in the criminal justice field. Fidelity of replication is to be determined using Hall and Loucks's methods of measuring the number and importance of program  components implemented. Data have already been collected by telephone interview with program developers and implementers and will also be gathered during site visitations. The relationship between fidelity and program outcomes will be analyzed using a multiple regression approach. Although the research is at an early stage of data collection, it can already be concluded that specificity in detailing program components is critical in conducting both evaluation and implementation research.

        "description":"The document reports several policy options that address the issue of educating autistic children in rural and sparsely populated areas. A description of autistic children relates numerous problems, confusions, and disagreements about the nature and course of the handicap including lack of agreement about definition and treatment. The most effective treatment purported by the authors is an eclectic educational program combining elements of behavior modification programs and psychoeducational procedures. Policy options for classifying and counting autistic children and for provision of service are described next, with advantages and disadvantages indicated. The federal classification of autistic children with &quot;other health impaired&quot; is seen to allow much flexibility in programing  according to the individual child's behavior and therefore, has advantages not offered by any narrowly focused label. Categorical and generic programs of service are analyzed with specific attention to five issues: availability of service, quality of service, cost effectiveness, personnel preparation, and parent participation. The generic option is supported as the most advantageous in four of the five issue areas. The categorical program option appears to be better suited to parent participation. A list of references to selected professional literature completes the report. (Author/SB)",

At week 12, students' oral reading rate was measured on third grade passages from basal texts. Analyses of  variance revealed no treatment effect on any dependent measure.

Teacher preferences for therapeutic and experimental strategies, as well as for two measurement procedures (mastery and performance measurement) were examined also.

Examination of the students' weekly performance on the functional measures revealed both significant and practical differences in performance on the measures of reading and spelling; no differences were found in rates of learning on these measures. Interpretation of findings on writing were inconclusive due to low reliabilities of the measure. In general, the results were in support of  the hypothesis that teachers' referral decisions are based on what they observe students doing in the classroom, and that eligibility decisions following a referral may reflect a confirmatory/superstitious process.

Decision theory is considered in terms of characteristics of the psychometric models of fair selection. Justice as fairness is contrasted with utilitarian values: a utilitarian framework equates maximizing utility in the aggregate with achieving equity. Justice as fairness theory does not equate the two, but emphasizes the effects of placement decisions on such basic liberties as self respect. (CL)",

Ss were administered the Learning Style Inventory, Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale, California Achievement Test, and California Short Form of Academic Aptitude. The investigation suggested that more common variance in achievement can be accounted for by a combination of learning style variables with self concept alone; and that controlling for cognitive aptitude, in addition to self concept, does not significantly enhance the relationship. Sixty percent (N=36) of Ss preferred not to study in late morning; none of these 36 Ss preferred to study in the morning; 12 preferred the afternoon; and  the remainder were indifferent to the time of day for studying.

Ethical and practical reasons for overcoming these barriers are considered, such as the importance of arming parents and advocacy groups with information to back up their attempts to get programs for handicapped children.

No statistically significant correlations were found between burnout and teaching position, grade level taught, type of child taught, level of education, student load, size of district, and marital status. Increasing age was significantly correlated with more frequent feelings of personal accomplishment and negatively correlated with both frequency and intensity dimensions of the emotional exhaustion subscale, and stronger feelings of  depersonalization. Males had significantly fewer feelings of personal accomplishment than females and scored higher on both dimensions of the depersonalization scale.

        "description":"Effects of children's diagnosis, setting of intervention, and involvement in parent education groups on families of 85 parents of handicapped children were investigated. Significant results were found regarding reported parent-child interaction, early intervention program suggestions, family stress, and both formal and informal family support systems. Parents of children with conditions associated with mental retardation were significantly more likely to report that they did nothing differently with the child as a result of his/her special needs, compared with parents of children with orthopedic impairments who reported doing significantly more physical therapy activities. However, mothers related more typically to their orthopedically impaired children than did mothers of  retarded children. Families as a whole and fathers individually reported seeking child care advice from various sources significantly more. The degree of severity of the child's handicap affected daily family life and the family's interaction with their child's treatment program. The age of the child also was associated with significant changes in parent-child interaction patterns. (CL)",

Studies involved 101 graduate students in a university resource teacher training program and 371 resource teachers in the public schools. Findings confirmed previous conclusions that resource teachers are devoting minimal amounts of time to the indirect service roles of consultation and inservice with regular teachers. No significant differences existed in the consultation activity undertaken by Ss at various degree levels. Demonstration teaching time was the only variable that correlated somewhat with amount of time devoted to consultation. Findings emphasized the desparity between the literature models and actual  practice. Implications for higher education include the selection of appropriate persons to enter resource teacher training, while implications for public schools include the need to operationalize a philosophy that stresses the consultative function of resource teachers and the provision of administrative support for such a role.

        "description":"The way that children construct the representation they use to solve transitive inference problems was examined. Forty-eight children 4.5 to 5 years old and 48 children 6 to 7 years old were asked to learn either a three-item series or a four-item nonseries. They were asked to learn the relationships between different colors of faces that were all the same size; on each trial, they were asked which face was bigger or which face was smaller. During the testing phase, two visual feedback conditions were included to provide a test of whether children use absolute size information to answer the inference question. In the linguistic feedback condition, the child was told which face was bigger or smaller. It was found that the linguistic condition was harder than the visual absolute  condition. Overall, the findings suggest that children do not remember absolute size information. Older children appeared more successful than younger children in learning the premise pairs in the series condition. Younger children were more successful in learning the premise pairs in the nonseries condition than in the series condition. The nonseries was easily learned by both groups since it did not have a common middle term and did not require seriation skills. The main conclusion is that there are developmental changes in children's abilities to order a series. It appears that children can use trial-and-error processes to learn a series and that they can use a linear order to make inferences. Implications of the findings to views proposed by Piaget and by Trabasso are also addressed.  (SW)",

        "description":"Recent forms of the new three-section Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) were administered to 88 native speakers of English just prior to graduation from a college-preparatory high school program. Total test score distributions were highly negatively skewed, reinforcing findings of earlier studies that the TOEFL is not psychometrically appropriate for discriminating among native speakers of English with respect to English language competence. Although the native English examinees achieved high total test scores and performed excellently on the listening comprehension section, a number of items in the other two sections (structure and written expression; reading comprehension and vocabulary) were answered incorrectly by over 20 percent of the examinee group. Included in  these sections were a number of questions considered by the TOEFL test development staff as dealing with basic grammar points or straightforward reading passages of a type that college-level students should be expected to handle without difficulty. From these results, it is concluded that although response data from native English speaking examinees may be of some use in designating particular test questions for closer examination, errors made by college-bound native speakers should not automatically be considered indicative of item inappropriateness for the TOEFL population.

Evidence was found that three major factors underlie performance on the TOEFL and that these factors are relatively unambiguous in their interpretation. A factor underlying the listening comprehension section was noted for each language group; however, there were differences among the language groups in the interpretation of two of the factors. The African, Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese groups were generally similar on a factor underlying performance on structure, written expression, and reading  comprehension items; and on another separate factor underlying vocabulary items. The Spanish and Germanic groups were also similar on each of two other factors, which correspond to the TOEFL subscores (structure/written expression, and reading comprehension/vocabulary). The vocabulary factor exhibited positive correlations with age and degree-intentions in nearly every language group, suggesting that vocabulary is the most likely of any of the abilities to develop with training or experience. Implications for the interpretation of TOEFL subscores are discussed. (SW)",

The second part of the report deals with factors affecting syllabus construction, with emphasis on how the curriculum should be constructed, who should construct it, for what audience, and the status it should have. The remainder of the report treats recent developments. The history of syllabus development during the past two decades is traced. The major development in the 1960s was the extension of language  instruction to the primary grades. The discussion of the 1970s centers on higher education, the upper secondary school syllabus for nongraded teaching, the common core syllabus for comprehensive secondary schools, a course-based upper secondary school syllabus, and revision of the common core syllabus. The last part of the report deals with the need for models of the teaching system and with general policy for the development of language teaching. (AMH)",

In the context of the theoretical framework of the study, a schema theory of reading, a diffuse discourse structure may legitimately activate more than one way of conceptualizing an answer to a test question. The methods used to explore this issue were the collection of a set of clinical interviews with children in grades 3, 5, and 8 in the Montgomery County (Maryland) Public Schools who had taken a standardized achievement test; and the administration of an experimental test. The interview data indicated a strong probability that test performance could be influenced by the structural organization of passage information. Analysis  indicated that low-achieving students lacked metacomprehension and test-taking skills, not comprehension ability. An experimental test was designed to reduce ambiguities, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in the passages and questions in order to assess more accurately students' comprehension ability. An important result was that the main difference between good and poor readers involves a reluctance or inability on the part of poor readers to process information hierarchically. (AMH)",

Use-related validation data for the TSE were obtained as a predictor of the communicative effectiveness in English of non-native English-speaking teaching assistants in U.S. colleges and universities. TSE and FSI tests were administered to 134 foreign teaching assistants at nine participating institutions. The TSE subscores were somewhat more reliable than those of the FSI, and exhibited a greater degree of discriminant validity. In the use-validation phase of the study, FSI and TSE scores of 60 non-native English-speaking teaching assistants were entered as predictor  variables in multiple regression analyses, using as criterion variables student ratings of the instructor's spoken language. Both TSE and FSI scores were very effective predictors of student ratings of the instructor's speaking proficiency. Somewhat lower but properly directed weightings were found for the prediction of more global aspects of the teaching performance (e.g., overall effectiveness of the instructor). It is concluded that both the TSE and FSI can predict the probable communicative facility in spoken English of non-native teaching assistants in instructional settings. (Author/SW)",

While most programs treat the rudimentary aspects of listening skills with rather mechanical drills, exercises to develop this skill in more advanced stages are usually not included. However, with the trend toward the development of communicative competence as a major aim of second language programs, the need for more sophisticated listening activities than have previously been used becomes obvious. Analysis of how listening comprehension takes place reveals that the learner/listener goes through an active cognitive process decoding messages. Exercises and activities can be designed to help learners grasp specific information from messages; other  activities lead learners to a point where they are capable of understanding globally what they have heard. This paper stresses the practical elements that teachers can use to aid their students in developing aural comprehension. A series of exercises and activities is included which can be undertaken in classroom situations to develop both specific and global listening comprehension. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"This guide is designed to help trainees plan, conduct, and evaluate workshops to assist others in providing cultural orientation (CO) programs for refugees. CO is seen as a continuous learning process, involving a two-way exchange of information and skills. Awareness is developed of: (1) differences and similarities in behavior, attitudes, and values; (2) knowledge of the reasons that underlie these similarities and differences; and (3) skills in acting effectively with people of different cultures. The first step in structuring orientation is seen as the identification of clear training objectives. Since cross-cultural orientation is needed by all people who will come into contact with refugees, objectives for cultural orientation will vary. Typical objectives of cultural  orientation are identified under the headings of awareness, knowledge, and skills. Attention is also directed to the following areas: conducting a needs assessment for providers of cultural orientation, setting workshop objectives, selecting training methods, developing the workshop content and agenda, and evaluating the workshop. Materials include references, examples of workshop agendas, a matrix of training models, a summary of the refugee resettlement process, a description of a simulation game, a list of regional and state refugee coordinators, a list of national voluntary agencies, and a list of selected organizations active in cross-cultural training.

        "description":"A fact sheet is presented for hearing impaired students and those who work with them in schools and colleges. Attention is directed to: definitions of relevant terms; postsecondary education options for students; suggestions for students, faculty, and services providers; and reading and resource materials. It is suggested that hearing loss is a complex disability. Hearing impaired describes people with all types of hearing disabilities, ranging from a very slight loss to profound deafness. Those who have a defect in their hearing but are functional for ordinary life purposes, usually with the help of a hearing aid, are referred to as &quot;hard of hearing,&quot; while deafness is a condition in which perceivable sounds have no meaning for ordinary life purposes, even with the help of a  hearing aid. Age of onset of hearing loss refers to the time at which the hearing loss occurred, which often determines the type of support services the individual student will need in order to succeed. Attention is directed to persons who are pre-lingually deafened, post-lingually deafened, and pre-vocationally deafened. Communication methods include the oral approach, the manual approach, and total communication. Postsecondary education options are as follows: federally-supported Gallaudet College in Washington, DC; and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY; a separate program for hearing impaired students on the campus of a hearing college; or a mainstreamed program in a setting with mostly hearing students. Special support  services include: interpreter services, notetaker/tutor, remedial programs, and aids and devices. The faculty and administration are responsible for making postsecondary programs accessible to hearing impaired students. (SW)",

        "description":"A process to assess a college's external environment and audit its internal environment in order to pursue options available to postsecondary education is described. Essentially the concept is one of matching opportunities in the external environment with institutional strengths as determined by an internal audit. Strategic planning must consider a critical analysis of forces, trends, and their effects, and must be firmly based on demographic, social, political, and economic data sets. Data are the foundation upon which to build the multi-year institution or system plan. Institutions pass through various stages of development and have different characteristics of organizational functioning. Stages of organizational development are identified as: emergence, growth, development,  regeneration, and decline. Types of organizational functioning can be listed as hierarchical, Theory X; collegial, Theory Y; and political, collective bargaining. In addition, tools of strategic planning can be labeled as needs assessment, trend analysis, environmental scanning, and market analysis. The challenge to postsecondary institutions is to diagnose where they are with regard to the first two dimensions and develop elements of strategic planning appropriate for their context. The purpose of the external environment assessment is to formulate assumptions that guide the institutional decision-making process, particularly in the areas of goal setting and human resource development, and to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the external environment. It is  recommended that management information systems include the integration of data on the external environment and internal operations of institutions, such as registration, scheduling, and student aid.

The data indicate that 1976-1977 was the turning point for black graduate participation in that actual enrollment and proportional representation has receded from those heights in subsequent years. Enrollment trends include the following: black graduate enrollment fell to 60,059 in fall 1980, an 8 percent drop from the peak of 1976-1977, while total graduate enrollment rebounded from a slight 1978 drop and surpassed 1,100,000; the decline in total black graduate enrollment in fall 1980 was precipitated by losses in part-time, rather than full-time students; in 1976-1977 black students made up 6.0 percent of total graduate enrollment, 5.1 percent of full-time  graduate enrollment, and 6.6 percent of part-time graduate enrollment, while in fall 1980, these proportions were 5.5 percent, 5.0 percent, and 5.8 percent, respectively; in 1978 there was a 5 percent decline in first-year graduate enrollment and about a 10 percent drop in black first-year graduate students from 1976; one possible cause for the drop in first-year graduate enrollment is evident in a corresponding increase in professional enrollment; despite numerical growth, black first-professional students comprised only 4.6 percent of the 1980 total, compared to 4.5 percent both in 1976 and 1978; black graduate and professional students still rely disproportionately on historically black college (HBC) programs for access to advanced educational opportunity; almost 18 percent of HBC  graduate enrollment was white and over 11 percent was international students; fall 1980 data reveal that black graduate students are still minimally represented in sciences and engineering.

The survey findings provide information about changes in the pattern of graduate school enrollment and allow comparisons between public and private institutions, between institutions offering the master's or Ph.D. as the highest degree, and among six major discipline areas. Overall graduate school enrollment increased in the social sciences, physical sciences, and engineering between the 1980-1981 and 1981-1982 academic years, while slight decreases occurred in humanities and biological sciences, with education reporting the largest decrease. A similar trend is noted in first-time  enrollments. Enrollment of women at graduate schools showed little change, while the enrollment of Hispanic, American Indian, and Asian American students increased, and the enrollment of blacks significantly decreased. Enrollment of foreign students continued to increase at graduate schools. Fellowships decreased in all disciplines except humanities, teaching assistants increased in all disciplines, and research assistants decreased in all disciplines except engineering. Master's degrees awarded increased in the social sciences, physical sciences, and engineering, while doctoral degrees awarded increased in education, engineering, and biological sciences. The total number of Doctor of Arts degrees showed an overall decrease, although the number of post-doctoral students increased at both  public and private Ph.D.-granting institutions. Additionally, the proportion of first-time, graduate enrollment classified as part-time decreased slightly. (SW)",

The course was offered for early admissions students in reaction to President Reagan's announcement that students would not be eligible for social security benefits unless they were enroll full-time at a college or university by May 1, 1982. The course covered time management, self-assessment/university orientation, listening skills, notetaking, textbook reading, preparing for exams, library orientation, decision making/goal setting, mid-term, alcohol awareness,  student organizations, career planning, human sexuality, and financial aid/registration. Students were asked to write a brief autobiography about themselves and were required to research an occupation of interest and to document qualifications and other pertinent information. A term project and group meetings and projects were also components of the course. Six sophomore undergraduates served as group facilitators. It was found that 40 of the 48 students had a cumulative average of 2.0 or above and 16 had a cumulative average of 3.0 or above. Information is presented on student opinions regarding: course scheduling, majors, sources of academic information, money, housing, social activities, extracurricular programs, and miscellaneous concerns such as health care.

It is an attempt to assist faculty and staff to understand the future and the formulation and revision of professional goals in relation to an image of the future. A conceptual framework about the changing nature of human society is presented, and attention is directed to the way that futurism is incorporated into the institution's strategic planning model at North Central Technical College. It is suggested that a shift is occurring from physical productivity of material goods to information productivity, which will bring about fundamental changes in human values and political and economic structures. In fall 1977, North Central Technical College decided to  undertake comprehensive institutional planning and identified categories for assumptions for the future, as well as goals and objectives. Assumptions at the institutional and departmental levels about future conditions lead to an institutional commitment relative to selected strategic goal areas. The strategic goal areas are refined to targets of commitment which can be translated into specific objectives. For instance, if an institution establishes computer literacy as a strategic goal, each department can identify specific goals and objectives. The relationship between assumptions and goals and objectives is illustrated in relation to equal educational opportunity. Sources of information on trends and assumptions about the future are identified. The purpose of gathering demographic,  social, economic and other planning data is to develop specific alternative scenarios for the institution. Lists of assumptions, goals, and highest priorities for institutional functions at North Central Technical College are appended. (SW)",

The environment in which clinical instruction takes place was examined, after which hypotheses were proposed and tested in a quasi-experimental design. The first phase of the study, an ethnographic analysis of the teaching and learning environment, revealed that different disciplines (medicine, pediatrics, and surgery) provided quite different environments for the students. Different types of learning (factual knowledge, problem-solving, technical skill, interpersonal skill, and attitude toward health care) were emphasized in each discipline; students were involved in varying activities for varying amounts of time; and the roles of the individuals  involved in the teaching process (residents, interns, attending staff) differed among the rotations. Both of the following hypotheses were partially confirmed: (1) the different disciplines in the clerkship program would facilitate different types of learning, and (2) there would be no significant transfer of learning among the disciplines. Factual knowledge and problem-solving were facilitated by different disciplines. These two types of learning were also the ones that appeared to transfer from one discipline to the other. The remaining types (interpersonal skill, technical skill, and attitude toward health care) showed no evidence of being transferred. These results indicate that the clinical teaching and learning process is complex, and it is suggested that educators consider the  variety of tasks that students undertake, the situations encountered, and the types of abilities required.

The Non-Cognitive Questionnaire (NCQ) consists to two nominal items relating to educational expectations, 18 Likert-type items relating to expectations about college and self-assessment, and three open-ended questions relating to present goals, past accomplishments, and offices held/groups belonged to. The sample of 1,644 freshmen entering in 1979 and 478 freshmen entering in 1980 were administered the NCQ during summer orientation. The properties of the instrument were examined to determine if the responses  vary across the races and whether the items are content valid in their ability to tap the seven non-cognitive dimensions: positive self-concept, realistic self-appraisal, understanding of and ability to deal with racism, preference for long-range goals over short-term or immediate needs, availability of a strong support person, successful leadership experience, and demonstrated community service. The results showed reliability and construct validity for the instrument. For whites, the non-cognitive dimensions of self-confidence, preference for long-range goals over short-term or immediate needs, and realistic self-appraisal were most strongly related to grade point average. For blacks, the only non-cognitive variables that were related to grade point average were positive self-concept and  realistic self-appraisal. For whites the NCQ significantly adds to the prediction of grades, while for blacks it is related to both grades and enrollment status. (SW)",

        "description":"The current status of women and minority faculty is briefly reviewed, and alternative explanations for patterns of differences that exist are identified. Although female faculty have gained in their proportionate representation during the 1970s, they still lag behind their strength of a half century ago. In addition, female scholars tend to be segregated by discipline, and are disproportionately represented at the lower ranks, reflecting the recent infusion of new hires during the 1970s. Compensation for female scholars has been at a rate averaging 20 percent below their male colleagues. The current status of black faculty is characterized by the following: blacks as a group have made considerably less progress than women in infiltrating the academic profession, although they  began in the 1970s to infiltrate predominately white institutions on a larger scale than before; black faculty are concentrated chiefly in education and several areas of the social sciences; they have tended to be concentrated in the lower ranks and isolated from a major role in institutional administration and governance; and in the area of compensation, black faculty, especially females and the most prolific publishers, began to do well by the early 1970s. Three principle sources of evidence are available to test the thesis that overdiscrimination is responsible for the differential status of women and black professors in comparison to that of white males: studies on hiring decisions, studies of discriminatory attitudes on the part of majority males, and studies of inequity in the  distribution of salary. A second thesis to account for status differences based on differential levels of performance and productivity is examined. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Women's opportunities for becoming senior-level administrators at 4-year, coeducational, state-supported colleges were assessed in 1979 in relation to age-related and other factors. Attention was also directed to whether there was a consistent career pattern for women attaining senior-level administrative positions. Biographical data and data regarding the women administrator's current lives were gathered through interviews with 44 subjects serving as president, provost, chancellor, vice president, vice provost, or vice chancellor. Most women in senior-level administrative positions had experience in middle-level administrative positions (e.g., vice presidents). Thirty-five of the administrators held terminal degrees; all presidents and vice presidents for academic affairs had  doctorates. Over one-half of the vice presidents were invited to accept their positions by presidents. Senior-level women administrators went through transitions at age-related intervals throughout the adult life cycle. Careers, personal time commitment, current marriages, relationships with children, parental relationships, and personal values were examined at each transition. Thirty-five of the women worked from 50 to 85 hours per week, and most of the women worked for personal satisfaction. Nineteen of the women were currently married and 12 had never married. Among the conclusions are the following: women's opportunities for becoming senior-level administrators are enhanced if they hold the Ph.D., attain some type of midlevel administrative position in higher education, and increase  their visibility among presidents; and women determine early in their adult life their preferred life style. Recommendations and a bibliography are included. (SW)",

Attention is directed to differences in purpose and internal organization; decisions and conflict resolution; environmental relations and internal affairs; and recruitment, selection, and development of personnel. Given a difference in purposes and a resulting difference in organizational structure of colleges and business/government, it follows that the processes adopted or developed for making decisions and resolving conflict differ. All of these differences ensure different kinds of relations with the public served by colleges and universities, and different norms, values, and incentives that govern many of their  internal affairs. The different professional identities and allegiances of college faculties dictate different modes and styles of recruitment, selection, promotion, assignment, transfer, and monetary reward. Two reports that were influential in the reorganization of undergraduate and professional curricula in business management recommended that general concepts and principles of management were to be balanced with general or liberal education at the undergraduate level. In the early 1970s, the application of systems analysis to academic administration initially provided a general framework for the study and development of planning models but later was advocated for the efficiency it would enforce upon mis-managed colleges and universities. Attention is also directed to management by  objectives and the differentiated functions of administration and governance at colleges. (SW)",

The next phase includes designing the plan, data collection, and data analysis. The third phase of a facilities audit is the presentation of findings. Attention is directed to: how audit findings should be summarized, priorities for repair and renovation projects, planning of the final presentation, and gaining  support for the recommendations. Additional considerations are as follows: using outside consultants, rating the facilities, a comprehensive versus a condensed audit, and cost analyses or proposed projects. The proposed procedures outlined in the workbook: can be used in the field without extensive training, can be used without consultant assistance, can be used by any institution, and is based on a manual tabulation of data that can readily be adapted to automated data processing. The proposed system provides a functional analysis of facilities and data that can be used for setting and justifying priorities.

According to Argyris (1980) an organization updates its goals (1) as a consequence of detecting and solving routine problems, and (2) through periodical reexamination of the governing policies and values of the organization. A survey of higher education professional organizations (Boulding and Van Patten, 1980) indicates that six of the top seven faculty concerns dealt with a lack of humaneness and justice within the organization. Ways to improve administrator/staff relationships include encouraging bona fide, responsible dissent and allowing faculty representation in governance. The  effectiveness of collective negotiations depends on the good will and overall consensus of all groups involved in campus governance. The following types of individual stress are addressed: burnout, role conflict, peer cohesiveness, and general morale. Signs of psychological burnout are a signal that the organization is causing problems. Faculty members are not always able to cope effectively with organizational politics. Research identifies role conflict and role ambiguity as principal sources of organizational stress (Parasuraman and Allutto, 1981). Latham and Kinne (1974) found that individuals in a healthy organization find satisfaction in working together to accomplish shared goals. Four important leadership skills to facilitate peer cohesiveness are identified, including mediating  conflict and building networks. Approaches that have been used to maintain and improve morale include human potential seminars and the holistic health movement. Organizational types identified by Likert (1961) and research on the measurement of organizational health are noted. (SW)",

        "description":"Responses of college administrators in schools facing conditions of fiscal stress, and alternative strategies found to be effective in private sector firms are examined. It is suggested that many college administrators are responding to conditions of decline by being conservative and efficiency oriented. A number of factors within and outside the institution that create pressure to respond in this way are identified. Research on colleges and universities and on private sector firms are reported which suggest that these responses are detrimental to long-term organizational viability. A study of 40 colleges in the northeast United States (Cameron, 1981) provided responses from 600 faculty members and 694 administrators from public, private, and church-related institutions. Results  suggest that administrators in declining institutions focus on internal resource allocation problems (budgeting and finance), rely on past policies and practices (standardization), and do not value organizational goals in the critical academic domain that lies at the center of college and university output. Administrator behavior in these declining organizations may actually perpetuate the decline by eliminating the possibility of expanding resource bases through proactive environmental contacting (e.g., public relations work), by relying on standardized procedures that were successful in past circumstances, and by driving out self-designing characteristics. A study by Miles and Cameron (1982) is described that illustrates how a private sector organization managed decline differently (the  U.S. tobacco industry from 1950 to 1979). Suggested solutions to decline are outlined that involve domain defense, offense, and creation strategies and that focus on effectiveness, innovation, and the external environment. (SW)",

        "description":"Forty private colleges that experienced rapid revenue decline from 1973 to 1976 were assessed in relation to factors accounting for recovery from financial decline. One subset of the 40 colleges showed dramatic recovery in total revenues during 1976 to 1979; the other continued to decline. These groups are compared, using data from the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS). Attention is directed to financial characteristics, variables that are less subject to management (such as age, size, location, and selectivity), and those that are more subject to management (such as programs offered, revenue configurations, and expenditure pattern). Typically, colleges that made a dramatic recovery were small, young, nonselective liberal arts colleges that added a few two-year  programs, catered to part-time students, emphasized instruction, and had relatively few revenue sources. Those that continued to decline were large at first, fairly selective, liberal arts and comprehensive colleges in rural areas. They did not add degree levels, but did tend to offer levels other than the baccalaureate. They also added masters programs, enrolled almost entirely full-time students, and spent a decreasing proportion of their budgets for instructional purposes. If common ideas about vulnerability to decline are accurate, these results suggest that a less vulnerable institution that finally succumbs to decline is exceptionally resistant to recovery, or different factors contribute to experiencing rapid decline than to recovering from it. Directions for further study are  suggested. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"Preliminary findings from a study of black student retention and progression in higher education are reported. The findings are based on the responses of eight public and private universities to an Institutional Data Questionnaire (IDQ). Analysis of the IDQ shows that, overall, white students perform better than black students in terms of their college attrition rates, their tendency to follow the prescribed progression pattern, and the length of time they take to graduate. However, these relationships change significantly when the racial composition of the colleges the students attend is taken into account. At predominantly white colleges, white students perform better than black students in terms of both attrition and progression patterns. At predominantly black universities,  on the other hand, black students show a greater tendency to persist and follow the prescribed progression pattern than whites. At the same time, however, both black and white students tend to perform better at predominantly white institutions than at predominantly black institutions. Differences between black and white students' attrition and progression patterns are discussed. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The strengths and weaknesses of various methodologies in conducting salary equity studies are examined. Particular attention is paid to the problems of identifying appropriate matches in the paired-comparison approach and to the sample, predictor and decision-rule problems associated with the regression analysis approach. In addition, highlights of university case studies and court cases are presented, along with current and future trends in salary equity studies. To illustrate the issues, the situation of female faculty members claiming sex discrimination in salaries is assessed with regard to law suits. Three main federal statutes or regulations barring sex discrimination in faculty salaries are the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Executive  Order 11246 as amended by Executive Order 11375. The most common and costly type of law suit is the class action suit. Most salary discrimination cases have involved disparate treatment claims, since the requirement of proving a prima facie case is considerably more relaxed than the for a disparate impact claim. The plaintiffs bear the initial responsibility of proving a prima facie case of sex discrimination. In the early discrimination cases before the courts, plaintiffs relied almost exclusively upon the descriptive method for establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. The second method for determining possible sex discrimination in faculty salaries is the paired-comparison approach, also referred to as matching, counterparting, or the counter-factual approach. It is suggested  that the multiple regression technique is the most effective method for analyzing sex discrimination in faculty salaries. (SW)",

        "author":["Weidman, John C."],
        "description":"A conceptual model of undergraduate socialization is presented. The framework incorporates several elements of the models developed by Feldman (1972) and Hochbaum (1968), but combines these models in a different way and incorporates the more recent work of Astin (1978). Of particular concern is an examination of the complex covariation among (1) individual, group, and organizational sources of socializing influences; (2) interpersonal mechanisms transmitting those influences; and (3) resultant socialization outcomes in various college settings. The three-dimensional model of undergraduate socialization is diagrammed. The vertical dimension (object of influence) shows three types of personal orientations, both cognitive and affective, that may be subject to modification as a  result of participation in an organizational setting. The first two aspects are knowledge and values, and values are viewed as predispositions toward, or preferences for, various personal ends or life goals. One of the most important life decisions influenced by college attendance is occupational choice. The horizontal dimensions (source of influence) contains three aspects of college environments that have the potential for modifying students' orientations (i.e., people, normative contexts, and curriculum). Reference group theory is useful for identifying potential sources of socializing influences. Mechanisms of socialization that constitute the third dimension of the model include impersonal exposure (i.e., the reading list) and primary social relationships. To illustrate the use of  the conceptual framework, an example from earlier research (Weidman, 1974) is discussed. The study examined the effects of norms and primary social relationships among faculty and students in academic departments on changes in undergraduates' occupational values. (SW)",

        "description":"The roles of organizational slack, flexibility, and variety are considered with respect to the incidence of growth, stability, and decline in college and university enrollments and revenues from 1975 to 1979. Slack refers to the resources possessed by an organization beyond those needed for the most efficient possible level of operation. Flexibility focuses on the ability of an organization to redirect the use of resources in the short-run, and variety refers to the degree of institutional diversity in programs and revenue sources. Using data from the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) for 2,713 schools, the schools were classified according to whether their enrollments and revenues had grown, remained stable, or declined from 1975 to 1979. Differences among  these groups on nine variables representing levels of slack, flexibility, and variety in 1975-1976 were examined using multivariate analysis of variance. Public and private institutions were examined separately. Stable institutions exhibited higher levels of variety in programs and revenue sources than did growing or declining institutions. Institutions with declining enrollments had lower levels of slack resources than did growing or stable institutions, while institutions with declining revenues had higher education of slack resources than did growing or stable institutions. For private schools the level of slack resources decreased as the severity of enrollment and revenue decline encountered in later years increased. Similarly, the level of programmatic and revenue source variety  decreased as the severity of enrollment and revenue decline encountered increased. The results are examined within the context of the population ecology and innovation literature from the organization sciences. (Author/SW)",

The course is an introductory course for graduate students in the higher and adult education doctoral program, but it also attracts students from throughout the university and nearby institutions. A new approach was used for the fall 1981 semester: students learned about higher education by designing a course. The weekly classroom activities were not markedly different from other semesters, but the main goal of the course directed students to come up with a coherent and comprehensive course on Higher Education in the United States. Classroom activities included oral presentations by students, which other students  evaluated. Students assigned a grade individually and the average was the grade for the presentation. While one exam was prepared and graded by the instructor, the second was individually designed and taken by the students. The instructor graded both the content of the second exam and the questions posed. The final variation from the usual course conduct was the ultimate product: an outline of a course entitled, &quot;Higher Education in the U.S.&quot; In addition, five evaluations of the course were provided by the students: on the first day of class; after the first exam; half way through the course; an instructor-designed evaluation at the end of the course; and a computerized school-wide evaluation. Copies of the evaluation forms and actual responses are appended, along with a course outline  that specifies course objectives, requirements, tests, and reading assignments. (SW)",

Findings are then presented for the following areas: the frequency of SPIN use, the utility of SPIN, problems and needed  improvements in SPIN, frequency of use and utility of SPIF, and user awareness of SPIF. General conclusions and discussion of overall results close the report. Five data tables accompany the text and the survey questionnaire is appended. (Author/JL)",

After an overview of the program approval and program review processes, the next five sections of the report outline specific procedures. The first of these sections discusses approval of units of instruction by the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB), covering topics such as action on new majors, withdrawal of a unit of instruction, cooperative instructional programs, statewide and regional instructional planning, contracting with other schools for instruction, and approval of extension programs. The next section focuses  on approval of courses, considers the documentation required by the ICCB for new or revised courses, changes in course data, course classification, credit criteria, accelerated courses, and independent study. The final sections outline procedures for the approval of units of public service; for the approval of funds under the Disadvantaged Student Grant Program; and for the approval of units of research. Appendices include a list of the 32 occupations for which programs of instruction must meet state licensing requirements and a sample of ICCB forms for program approval with accompanying instructions.

        "description":"At Los Medanos College (LMC), a project was undertaken in 1978 to develop an inter- and intradisciplinary general education program that would: (1) develop among students an awareness of major social issues of the late 20th Century; (2) help them analyze social problems and inquire into the options for resolving them; (3) broaden their world view and encourage intellectual autonomy; and (4) bring a more humanistic emphasis to the general education program. The resulting model consists of three tiers. Its base consists of six required intradisciplinary courses in the fields of social science, behavioral science, physical science, biological science, language arts, and humanistic studies. Serving as capstones to these courses are two tiers of interdisciplinary courses: one deals in  breadth with four or five social issues, such as energy and its implications, the limits of growth, and equality and justice; the other involves an in-depth study of one societal issue, such as racial justice or crime and violence. This descriptive report reviews the extensive planning, discussion seminars, and evaluation efforts that have been involved in the development of the model. The bulk of the report consists of appendices which include an outline of the general education model, a detailed review of the goals of the curriculum, a schedule of activities, program evaluation forms, course outlines, and program funding information.

        "description":"A review of research on student attrition suggests eight factors influencing students' decisions to remain in a course or in college that may respond to college, counselor, and teacher interventions. First, as low grades are consistently revealed as contributing to attrition, appropriate course placement, basic skills instruction, criterion-based testing and grading, and other techniques that promote student success may foster persistence. Second, poor study habits and skills are also related to attrition, and college staff should disseminate information on effective study methods and memorization skills. Third, the higher the level of students' educational plans, the more likely they are to persist; thus instructors and counselors should help students develop and maintain  specific and realistic educational goals. Fourth, student commitment to program completion affects retention, and college staff can help students develop and maintain commitment and motivation. Fifth, sensing that instructors care about their progress fosters students' persistence. Sixth, by contacting students in academic difficulty, teachers and counselors may be able to prevent their dropping out. Seventh, the use of individualized instruction tends to enhance persistence, and finally, an organized program of student support can promote the retention of even high risk students. This paper links retention strategies to key research findings and offers cautions about the strategies' limitations. (KL)",

An attempt is made to synthesize commonalities from these frameworks into a more comprehensive definition. Subsequently, research on facilitating the development of caring individuals in the family, in day care centers, and in preschools is examined. Three main questions are addressed: Are there common characteristics, backgrounds, or personality traits of  caring individuals? What are some of the conditions which are likely to facilitate caring in the mother/child relationship? and, What are some of the conditions that are likely to facilitate caring in day care centers and preschools?

Initially, an overview of child neglect is provided. The following two chapters (1) describe the relationships between stress associated with the structure and function of the military, and the incidence of child abuse and neglect within military families; and (2) discuss jurisdictional issues related to the families, and (2) discuss jurisdictional issues related to the coordination of military units and civil governments, agencies, and individuals. Military child  advocacy programs in the Air Force, Army, and Navy, as well as a model approach to military civilian cooperation are described in the fourth and fifth chapters. Concluding discussions focus on child advocacy in the military overseas and dependents schools. Numerous charts and diagrams indicating primary and secondary responsibilities, organizational interfaces, and other similar content are included in the manual. (RH)",

        "description":"It has traditionally been assumed that children's ability to label individuals as older precedes their tendency to associate particular behavioral competencies with individuals who vary in age. To systematically test this assumption, 64 preschool children were presented with 9 pairs of stimulus faces reflecting different ages. The children were asked to make relative age-level and trait judgments in response to a story narrated by the experimenter involving a child's attempt to retrieve a kite caught in a tree. Children were asked to identify which individual in each stimulus pair they felt was (1) smart enough to figure out a way to get the kite down, (2) too weak to climb the tree and retrieve the kite, (3) too mean to help get the kite, and (4) the &quot;boss&quot; who had said not to  fly the kite near the tree. Results indicated that the ability to label individuals as older improved with age but was not a necessary prerequisite for associating particular behavioral characteristics with individuals of varying ages. Findings were discussed in terms of the influence of linguistic abilities on labelling ability, children's abilities to use certain physiognomic cues as sources of age-level information, and the potential for certain age-related facial characteristics to elicit particular impressions of behavioral capacities.

Although the services have expressed a commitment to provide quality care and have taken action to upgrade some facilities and develop program regulations, the GAO finds that many child care centers currently in use are neither safe nor suitable. The majority of centers in the Army and Navy, and 20 percent of those in the Air Force, need upgrading. Minimum day care standards for all units within the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense have not been  formulated, but are needed to control important program elements, including total group size, caregiver/child ratios, educational activities, staff training, and food services. The GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense take several specific actions to insure that the services provide quality child care programs. (RH)",

Twenty-nine primiparous couples were recruited from a local hospital where they had been participating in various childbirth and child-care education programs. Sixteen were parents of boys, and 13 were parents of girls. First when their children were 5 to 9 months old and again when they were 12 to 17 months old, all parents completed questionnaires consisting of 20 bipolar word pairs arranged on 7-point scales. Parents were asked to circle the point on the scale which most closely represented their perception of their child. Results indicated that both parents' perceptions of daughters differed rather consistently and often significantly from perceptions of sons. On both questionnaire  administrations, boys were seen as more aggressive, firmer, bigger, calmer, rougher, more stubborn, and less easily scared than girls. For the second administration only, boys were regarded as significantly noisier and less cuddly than girls. It was concluded that, at both ages, parents do stereotype their infants according to sex.

The third and largest section of the paper reviews a selection of arts studies concerning aesthetic development and education. The studies reviewed are organized into three clusters of research activity: (1) developmental studies emphasizing age-related trends in aesthetic response, (2) studies concerned  primarily with individual and group differences in aesthetic response (excepting age), and (3) deliberate attempts to influence the course of aesthetic growth and development. Developmental studies reviewed include investigations of children's aesthetic response to stimulus complexity as well as their aesthetic discrimination and judgement. The discussion of intervention research focuses on aesthetic response training studies in addition to broader programmatic interventions. It is noted that all three streams of research activity are predominately oriented toward the visual arts. However, research focusing on music, literature, and related art forms is also discussed.

The sample included urban, suburban, and rural counties scattered across the nation. In each county, data were collected from the local child protective services agency and from other community institutions for a 12-month period beginning May, 1979, and ending April, 1980. A unique characteristic of this national study was the fact that common definitions of child abuse and child neglect were used for data collection. These definitions required that a child suffer &quot;demonstrable&quot; physical or emotional harm in order to be counted as abused or neglected. Information was  gathered on 21 individual forms of child maltreatment. For purposes of analysis these were grouped into six major forms assessing physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, educational neglect, and emotional neglect. In addition to forms of maltreatment, data were gathered concerning the incidence and severity of maltreatment, age and sex of victims, demographic variables, and case recognition and reporting. It is concluded that child abuse and neglect in the United States is an underreported problem of major proportions and that no category of children is &quot;immune&quot; to maltreatment. (RH)",

        "description":"A sample of 176 Tennessee children and their mothers were studied in 1969 when the children were fifth or sixth graders and again in 1975 when they were eleventh or twelfth graders to determine changes in occupational and educational aspirations and expectations along with possible causes for such changes. Comparison of occupational aspirations and expectations showed that the percentage of students who aspired to professional-technical employment in 1969 had dropped to half that number in 1975. The percentage of those who expected such employment was even less. Educational goals also decreased, but to a lesser extent. Of those who aspired to post high school work in 1969, 62% were males and 60% females; in 1975, those percentages were 50% and 59%. Those who expected post high  school work decreased to 27% and 30% respectively. Expectations for college work were 12% for males and 6% for females. Mothers' goals for their children showed similar patterns of decrease although mothers tended to have higher aspirations than their children, particularly for sons. By 1975, 28% of the boys and 43% of the girls had left school. Reasons given most often were dislike of school and lack of academic motivation. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"Music, education, and community and the interactions among these three factors in Kansas during the 19th century offer an opportunity to study the role and function of music education in a sociocultural context. From 1824-1899, 16 Catholic missions were opened in Kansas for American Indians. These schools used music as an adjunct to academic instruction, religious indoctrination, and acculturation. Before statehood in 1855, most white settlers' children went to subscription schools. After statehood, white immigrants flooded into Kansas, pushing most American Indians off their land, eliminating all but two missions. The two missions which remained did so by opening their doors to white students and by becoming institutions of higher education. With statehood also came the  establishment of public schools, guidelines for district boards in the hiring of teachers, and standardized curricula which emphasized Americanization. In addition to legislation in 1870 urging music education in the schools, communities were affected by rail transportation, which brought musicians into the state. Country schools were maintained by the community and utilized by the community for celebrations of everything from federal holidays to trivial local events. Singing was a big part of community activities, which were often highlighted by the local band or orchestra presentations. (AH)",

        "description":"An overview of early country school music and music education in the Mountain Plains region of America provides impresssions gained from texts, journals, official records, and personal interviews. Music is portrayed as a socializer to engender community spirit, an enhancement of patriotism, a means to enculturate to the &quot;American way of life,&quot; a symbol of validation, and an accompaniment for rhythmic activities. Covered are: school community activities; scholastic aspects of music in country schools; teacher and student roles in the instructional process; instrumental music; technology (grammophone, victrola, radio); and music texts and song literature employed in schools during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. An examination of music functions, via an analysis of verbal  and music content of 55 songs, shows that song texts can be categorized according to &quot;six key word factors&quot; (joy, kindness/love, nature, religion, school, and work/diligence). Analytical statements concerning each song are concluded with the initial letters of the key word factors which applied. Conclusions show songs were consistently employed for inculcating and enculturating students with the dominant society; song values centered on factors identified; song materials were the equivalents of McGuffey's readers; and musical qualities reinforced basic simple values.

Symbolicity is defined as the state, condition, and tendency of people to organize their perceptions and experience into symbols and symbol systems, while nativistic movement refers to the process and efforts by which an ethnic group returns to a more glorious time in their prior history and retrieves a symbol for contemporary use. Illustrations of negative trends examined are: (1) shallow symbolism (selection and use of symbols which have lost their realistic sustaining power, such as the Sun Dance); (2) externally imposed stereotypes (overculture has simply stereotyped all  tribes); (3) exclusionary use of symbols (use of symbolism to validate claims that &quot;I'm more Indian than you are&quot;); and (4) shifts in meaning of certain symbols (i.e. the warrior image). Illustrations of positive trends provided are: (1) increased awareness of tribal and Indian identity; (2) improved sense of community among Indian people; (3) diminution of either-or syndrome for Indian people (dilemma of choosing Indianness or assimilation into the overculture); and (4) spread of Native American values to the overculture.

A survey instrument, developed to determine level of involvement in professional activities, contained questions pertaining to: membership in, and attendance of, national, state, and local organizations; number of sessions of North Dakota Education Association sessions attended (October 1975); number of workshops or seminars attended; hours earned since last degree; professional books and journals read; offices held and presentations made; and self-ranking. The Purdue Teacher Opinionaire, used to indicate level of morale, questioned: rapport with principal and other  teachers; satisfaction with teaching; status and salary; teacher load; curriculum; school facilities and services; community support; and community pressure. Findings indicated a tendency toward a positive relationship between degree of professional involvement and level of morale. The level of rapport with the principal and satisfaction with teaching, as individual factors of morale, appeared to have high correlations with professional involvement activities. Appended are a personal data page for professional activities, definitions for the morale factors, and references. (AH)",

Intricate connections between living standards, agricultural production, market and credit structures, land tenure, the political system, the social structure, education, health, values, and culture make it fruitless to attempt an artificial isolation of one particular problem for the application of outside technical expertise. The primary step for the introduction of change in the Veraguases of the world is essentially a political one. The problems of development can be characterized by two general inadequacies: lack of motivation and insufficient organization. Since education is largely a function of motiviation or  ideology, a vision of change and hope is required before the acquisition of knowledge and skills seem important and necessary. A successful change agent must have the characteristics of authority, communication and access to power, competence and the ability to impart it, and protection. The most relevant outside presence to assist the campesinos (people from the fields) is not the expert who tends to adapt indigenous problems to his expertise, but the trained and sensitive generalist who adapts his limited skills to the campesino's entire problem circle.

Such professionals are involved in creating conditions to improve the teaching-learning process and have, within themselves, the sign of constant change. Curriculum development is a process of planned change; it is necessary for the organization of continuous activities for training professionals working within the curriculum development and planning realm. This paper presents some ideas about the nature of curriculum, characteristics of professional  educators working in curricular matters, recommended traits for needed in-service training, and basic issues that are suitable to keep in mind when training professionals in curriculum. Well-known definitions of curriculum and basic elements of a curriculum development are discussed. The interaction of curriculum and other educational fields is examined. In terms of in-service training for professionals in curriculum, the major traits of such educators and the relevant methodologies for training such educators are discussed. (Author/NQA)",

Within the educational realm, some postulates have earned universal and general acceptance because of the amount of previous experience and theoretical considerations (i.e., relationship between education and social structure, lifelong learning, universal acceptance of some type of &quot;formal education&quot;). Some problems affecting educational development in developing countries are large numbers of persons still lacking basic education, many children dropping-out before completing elementary school, and increasingly scarce resources. Within this reality, teacher training can be defined as a conscious deliberated, participative and continuous process implemented by an educational system to improve academic  performance and the outcome of educational programs, encourage complete self-development and continuous effort for professional renewal among teachers, and reinforce the teachers'&quot;spirit of commitment&quot; to society and the community. By knowing what teachers must do to perform their teaching duties well and to improve their performance and what teaching quality students need and the community demands, training needs can be determined and relevant training programs can be designed. This article suggests an approach to teacher training that considers the improvement of teaching quality, student achievement, and community and family participation in the teaching-learning process for determining teacher training effectiveness.

        "description":"The first part of this report contains a case study from each of the eight southern states participating in a late 1970s project which focused primarily on the organization of rural counties for making decisions that affect the well-being of county residents. In the second section, the study counties (identified as low income in 1950) are placed in two groups to facilitate comparison of whether there appears to be a consistent set of circumstances responsible for movement of counties out of the lowest quintile based on per capita income. The &quot;Case Study Commentary&quot; makes it clear that there have been very substantial changes in the counties--they have generally shared in the national trend away from employment in agriculture, they have shared in the very substantial increase in  income even though they still trail national averages substantially, formal education has improved markedly, and jobs held require higher skill levels. The &quot;Commentary&quot; indicates that while much of what has happened in the study counties has been due to accidents of history and geography over which the present population has little control, in each of the counties there is clear evidence that some of the developments are the result of local initiative.

        "description":"A rural land use project originated in the early 1970s when a landowner approached the University of Montana's Department of Geography asking for assistance in planning the use of more than 10,000 acres. The planning process evolved into four phases; the first three phases (biophysical assessment, capability analysis, and master planning) have been completed and Phase 4, site planning, is forthcoming. Biophysical assessment was the process of systematically defining characteristics of the land resource/environment as a basis for subsequent decision-making. Those data were then used in the capability analysis to assess ability of the resource to support various kinds of activities. Using the &quot;relatively objective&quot; capability assessment, the Master Plan evolved by evaluating  appropriate use patterns through assessment of the suitability of specific parcels for various uses given cultural, economic, political, and environmental constraints. An integrated team-design approach was used in the Master Plan whereby social organization and supportive service elements were comingled utilizing land capability and sociological wisdom. While the planning did not develop a perfect system, it does demonstrate that economically and environmentally sound decisions are not mutually exclusive, particularly in rural areas where the unique ability exists to tailor land-use decisions to land capabilities and constraints.

The 3-phase field study (comprised of approximately 15 interviews with 25 participants) included county directors, social workers groups (3 workers from each county), and individual key workers (identified by the interviewer). Common traits ranked high by county directors were flexibility, supervision, use of community resources, and generalist approach. Interviews with social work groups and key individuals revealed that the majority grew up in rural areas and chose to work there. Emphasis  was placed on the need to work with informal networks developed by the social workers, using community members as resources. Peer supervision and flexibility were also held to be important factors. Distance and time taken for travel to reach outside resources were listed as the most negative aspects by workers; however the situation presented by these and other obstacles met in rural areas was listed as a challenge and the major reason social workers chose to remain in rural areas. Three Iowa social worker job descriptions are appended. (AH)",

Extension workers with limited training in conflict management have had to cope with situations usually involving the nature of the problems, the data and information available, establishment of goals, alternative policies for goal achievement, allocation of scarce resources, and vested interests of individuals, informal groups, organizations, and communities. As a follow-up to a 1977 North Central Region Staff Development Workshop on Coping with Conflict, it was decided to develop a resource publication for staff development which would contain the major workshop presentations regarding  social conflict. These papers relate to (1) social conflict in community resource development and public policy education, (2) the nature of social conflict and how it operates, (3) understanding conflict strategies and developing skills to deal with it, (4) managing stress in conflict situations, (5) coping with conflict among organizations, and (6) the role of the educator's values in conflict intervention. A final section presents an annotated bibliography of selected resources for dealing with social conflict. (BRR)",

Major community needs were found to exist in engineering and public works, industrial development, recreation, education, health and welfare, housing, and planning. The five major capacity building needs were fiscal, staffing, planning, citizen participation, and inter-governmental coordination. Lack of adequate finances was a major capacity gap uncovered in all communities. Rural local governments were  being called upon to handle assignments that required an increasingly higher degree of staff professionalism. Although comprehensive plans had been developed in rural communities, such plans were not widely followed in making decisions. Because financial and personnel resources were limited, rural local governments relied heavily on citizen volunteers. To retain rural government viability in program activities requiring large capital investments, specialized expertise, and area-wide planning, increased attention was being given to pooling of available resources. Recommendations are included for each of the identified gaps. (BRR)",

The study identified community needs, capacity building needs, capacity building gaps, and suggested mechanisms that could be used to minimize or alleviate the capacity building gaps. It was found that most capacity building gaps could be reduced without large additional expenditures of taxpayers' money or creating additional bureaucratic units in government. It was recommended that local governments make  maximum effort to close fiscal capacity gaps through local tax efforts and cost-effective management, establish and periodically review job descriptions of all staff personnel and provide for clearcut lines of authority and responsibility, and take steps to involve more citizens in the planning process. Further, state and federal laws originally enacted to provide more open and responsive govenment should be reviewed to determine whether they tend to reduce citizen participation in local government.

        "description":"The participation in certain classroom processes by students of high and low mathematics confidence who scored above the mean in mathematics achievement was studied over 2 years. The processes selected were: (1) specified types of teacher-pupil interactions, and (2) student engaged time in high or low cognitive level mathematical activities, spatial activities, and with peers. Eighty-two seventh graders were observed daily in their regular mathematics classes for 3 to 4 weeks during the spring semester of 1980, and were again observed in 1981. Between 3 and 14 target students were within each observed class. Roughly equal numbers of each sex were chosen based on the following characteristics for the sample: (1) mathematics achievement scores were at or above the sixth-grade mean  of four middle schools, and (2) confidence in mathematics scores were in either the top or bottom quarter for all pupils who had achieved higher than the mean. Two trained observers recorded data on target student and teacher behavior in each classroom. Data were collapsed across classrooms and analyzed using analysis of variance, with sex, confidence level, and year as factors. (MP)",

        "description":"The cognitive processes involved in the human ability to understand and use positional notation (i.e., place-value) were investigated in a series of psychological experiments. Although the tasks used in all studies were very simple, usually only requiring the tested individual to identify the larger of two numbers as quickly as possible, a number of unintuitive results were obtained. For example, in two digit number comparison, skilled adults' decision times are affected by the ones-place digit even when the tens-place digit is logically sufficient to determine the correct response (e.g., is 48 less than or more than 55?). However, when the number of places is a sufficient cue to answer the question (is 735924 more or less than 5000?), insignificant place information is not  extracted. Memory for numbers was also shown to be affected by place-value information. Surprisingly, speed of understanding the relative value of numbers is slowed when the numerical value conflicts with the relative physical size of the numerals. Overall, several physical and symbolic factors strongly influence our ability to understand, manipulate, and remember numbers. (Author)",

The second section, &quot;Games,&quot; reflects the authors' conviction that games have a contribution to make in the mathematics classroom, particularly in the areas of basic skills practice, applications, and logic and strategy development. Like the first section, it is organized by grade level. The majority of activities are appropriate for the primary and elementary levels  although many include variations suitable for higher grade levels.

The private sector has traditionally taken the lead in this field, pressing governments of both developed and developing countries to adopt appropriate policies and to extend family planning services and education nationwide. While each organization has its own distinct program, most population organizations work cooperatively to support effective actions and new initiatives in such varied fields as family planning services and communication, contraceptive and demographic research, and political action. Population organizations worldwide now number literally in the hundreds. Therefore, the list of 40 organizations provided (with descriptions of their activities) is highly selective,  including only major private organizations with a primary focus on population trends, family planning programs, and reproductive rights. Additional selection criteria include publisher of influential publications, funder or implementing agency of family planning programs, and extensive outreach or influence (implied by an annual budget of $350,000 or more). A supplementary listing of major professional membership organizations in the population field, multilateral organizations and government agencies providing population assistance, U.S. foundations providing funding for population programs, and major U.S. (university-based) population study and research centers is also provided.

Further, construct validity of the items was established in relationship to an underlying theory of response outcomes, and the utility of the  superitems was noted as demonstrated.

No differences in degree of program implementation were found between partnership and treatment teachers, but both of these groups implemented more than the control instructors did. Among other findings, program teachers differed notably from control teachers in that program instructors used more problem-solving strategies. Further,  significant differences in problem-solving scores were noted for program pupils when contrasted to students in control classes, and gains in student achievement were paralleled by higher problem-solving implementation scores in program instructional situations.

The second program focused on the development of instructional strategies for attempting to improve students' skills for solving verbal problems. The data base for building such a training program was considerably more limited than the base available in designing the general program. The second experiment was run with 36 teachers and other 1000 sixth-grade students. Data suggest that verbal problem-solving skills of treatment students were enhanced in comparison to  that of control students. Research that examined the impact of instructional programs upon particular student types is also reported. Interactions were noted between treatment condition, teacher type, and student type.

Subjects, attending four public and private schools in the Columbus (Ohio) area, completed three instruments (included in appendices): (1) Defining Issues Test (DIT), measuring a preference for a particular mode of reasoning in moral issues (based on Kohlberg's moral dilemma series); (2) Environmental Issues Test (EIT), measuring thought patterns and processes using dilemmas set in an environmental rather than general social context; and (3) Student Survey, measuring demographic background information,  including educational and religious background. Statistical analysis indicated no significant difference between the level of sociomoral development between public (N=78) and private (N=52) school students. Public school seniors scored significantly higher in environmental-related issues. Religious involvement did not correlate significantly with DIT or EIT. Regression analysis showed EIT P score, science courses, and religious affiliation as significant predictors of DIT P score. Significant predictors of EIT P score were DIT P score, public school attendance, religious affiliation, and female sex. Implications and recommendations are included. (Author/JN)",

The advisor's guide provides more detailed background information and suggestions for helping the child carry out the study. Although materials may be used by individuals  independent of a school, they are designed for distribution by a teacher. In this mode children are invited to participate voluntarily. An evening parents' meeting is held by the teacher to explain the rationale of the activity and to conduct a workshop on the forthcoming unit.

        "description":"This project developed an effective science curriculum, &quot;Science for the Hearing Impaired&quot; (SFHI), through adaption of two Houghton Mifflin science programs for use with hearing impaired adolescents (ages 9-13). This adaption included reorganization of objectives and content within lessons, deliberate and appropriate teaching of science processes and inquiry skills, multi-sensory presentation of content through active participation, paraphrasing of text and use of language and identification cards, a selected science vocabulary taught through active experience, a variety of communication techniques, and a placement and evaluation system for science learning designed around the capabilities of the hearing impaired. Results from a 1981 trial period were used to produce a final  edition of the program, the first available program at the national level providing early adolescent hearing-impaired students with an easily accessible and effective science curriculum adapted to their specific needs. Additional assessment of student progress included cognitive development level, pre-post unit tests of science learning and language development, and science interests and attitudes. Included are the project's developmental and evaluation processes, evaluation results, and in five appendices: project activities/staff listings, trial center descriptions, evaluation instruments, and media material guide to accompany use of the SFHI program.

(2) Which has more energy: one teaspoon of alcohol or one teaspoon of alcohol gel? (3) How far can a balloon rocket go on compressed air in one full balloon? (4) Will flashlight batteries that are twice as large last twice as long? (5) How much longer does a C-size battery last when it is turned on-and-off compared to continuous  use? (6) Will rye flour cause a bigger boom than wheat flour? (7) Will a flywheel that goes twice as fast go twice as long? (8) Will a flywheel made of 3/4 inch plywood spin 3 times longer than one made of 1/4 inch plywood? and (9) Will a spool go twice as far if its rubber band motor has twice as many turns? (JN)",

        "author":["Low, Setha M."],
        "description":"This paper describes two research projects in the anthropology of landscape architecture design which show that &quot;professional culture&quot; restrictions often prevent anthropologists from putting their theories into practice. The first research project grew out of the author's assumption that landscape architecture students were not producing socially relevant designs because the information they had about the users was incorrect or inaccurate. The author analyzed the processes used by architecture students who had to define for the residents of a local urban neighborhood how an abandoned park could be revitalized to meet their needs. The students did not produce designs for a park that the community would like. The reason was not inadequate data, however, but the professionalization  of the student. The qualitative methods of anthropology created a cultural description of what the community desired. The students, however, used books of landscape requirements and asked their faculty for assistance in developing their design. In the second research project the author did a content analysis of the journal &quot;Landscape Architecture&quot; to determine the dimensions of professional culture as a barrier to the integration of theory and practice. Journals from every fifth year from 1910 to the present were evaluated. The data did not describe a linear development of the field as expected. Instead the author found a congruence and interlocking of macro-societal processes and the development of the landscape architecture profession. The author concludes that as anthropologists move  toward an increasingly active role among the applied social sciences, they must look for a metalevel of analysis that will aid them in their role as social and cultural translators.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to articulate the relative meanings and values of various forms of subject matter. The paper first constructs a synthesizing definition of subject matter. All subject matter is conceptual in nature and is composed of words or statements concerning objects and events of the world which are to be taught and learned. The paper then discusses the three major subject matter types or approaches and their value and meaning: the life skills and experiential curriculum approach characterized by practicality, utility, and function; the romantic curriculum approach which emphasizes involvement, creativity, and expression; and the structuralist curriculum approach which emphasizes lawfulness, order, precision, and predictability. The three types of  meaning--extrinsic, intrinsic, and formal--are then applied to six fields of human activity--the individual person, groups of persons, things, groups of things, concepts, and words. From this application emerge 18 subject matter sub-types the meaning and value of which are discussed. For example, the application of extrinsic meaning to individual persons shows persons as psychologically functioning persons. This meaning is basic to personality functioning studies that emphasize the interaction of persons with their environment. Another example is the application of extrinsic meaning to things showing things as utilities. This gives economic meaning which is basic to courses of study that emphasize consumer, vocational, and business practice. (RM)",

        "description":"This study examines the role of the high school as a political environment in which students may acquire experiences which contribute to the development of their political competence. The paper explains the objectives of the study, discusses the methods used, describes the schools in which data were gathered, reports the findings, and identifies areas for future study. Specifically examined is the relationship of political attitudes to participation in school groups and to the types of participation students engage in within groups. Also examined are differences in the political characteristics among groups that may have an impact on the experiences students have within groups and on the skills they develop. And finally, since both school size and social/economic status (SES)  have been linked with attitudes and participation, the effect of these variables is explored. Thirteen secondary schools in urban, suburban, and rural settings were selected for primary data collection on the basis of convenience and accessibility. Questionnaires were developed and administered to random samples within each school to assess student attitudes, school system political characteristics, and within-school group political characteristics. Data for the study were collected in 1974, and again in 1975 and 1976 from the same schools and students. Findings show that student political attitudes are associated with both quantity and quality of participation. The study also found a lack of relationship between school SES and level of participation within the school. (RM)",

        "author":["Mathieson, John A."],
        "description":"This essay examines the various economic effects of U.S. trade with developing nations to determine whether or not such trade is in the U.S. interest. Expansion of trade with the Third World is very much in keeping with the Reagan administration's economic goals. It stems from the conviction that solution to the problems of poverty and insufficient economic development is to be found in the magic of the market place. U.S. gains from trade include access to needed raw materials, consumer benefits, economic efficiency, and growing markets for U.S. exports. Although U.S. trade with the developing countries is quite favorable (with the exception of oil), it is not sufficient to look exclusively on the positive side. One serious cost to the United States is loss of employment  opportunities in declining industries. Study after study identifies the same industries as being most sensitive to import competition: textiles and clothing, footwear, leather goods, and consumer electronics. Compared to a protectionist stance, the article concludes, in the long run, a set of policies to stimulate world trade and distribute its costs equitably carries with it a much greater potential for improving the economic well-being of all nations.

An overview of some ethnographic studies of schools and the process of schooling is provided to illustrate the structural-functional orientation predominant in this body of literature. The paper is composed of two sections. The first section discusses concepts and theoretical orientations underlying the argument for a more structural, functional, and systematic approach to accounting for this problem of differential school outcomes. In this section, the focus is on a consideration of the nature of schools, the relationship of  schools to social structure, and some predominant sociocultural functions of schools. The second section discusses some representative research on the actual school experiences of children from subordinate groups. Here the focus is on the manner in which schooling functions to perpetuate patterns of subgroup relationships predominant in the larger society via both latent and manifest structuring of differential classroom experiences.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is threefold: to describe grounded theory research strategies, to present a summary of several studies in education that have followed this approach, and to explore the potential uses of the grounded theory techniques in curriculum theory generation. The paper is arranged into six parts. In the first and second parts of the paper the background for grounded theory research is discussed. Primarily a pragmatic, inductive approach, it is a comparative method which alternates data collection and data analysis. Before any hypotheses are defined, data are collected, coded, and arranged into concepts. Then, an analysis of these concepts is made to develop working hypotheses and provide direction for the next stage of data collection. Alternating states of data  collection and analysis follow in a refining process. The third part of the paper briefly describes several studies that have been done using the grounded theory approach. These include a study to explain the intragroup dimensions of interdisciplinary teaching teams; a study on the process of teacher change brought about by inservice education; and a study on the role personalization of beginning secondary teachers. The fourth section focuses on new applications of grounded research in the curriculum field. The fifth section discusses planning a grounded study of curriculum design and implementation. Section six, a conclusion, mentions the general advantages of grounded theory research--it is in touch with actual educational situations and it is a holistic and expansive approach.  (Author/NE)",

Focus is on the applicability of ethnography and ethnology to matters of theory and practice in educational research. A major goal of the Consortium for Educational Research has been to coordinate the efforts of both researchers and teachers in the design, implementation, and analysis of seven planned educational change projects. The bulk of this report uses anthropological theory to analyze case study data from these nine projects. The purpose of the analysis is to show how patterns of participant relationship can influence school improvement efforts. The projects are  described in terms of their patron-client and colleague patterns of participant relationship. Major focus is on project design and implementation. The analysis suggests the need for more collaboratively designed local school improvement projects. Participants must develop and adopt mutually satisfying relationships as a precondition to the implementation of the project itself. Cross-site (ethnological) analysis suggests four strategies for the development of colleague patterns of constituent relationship. A group external to the local school community can more effectively facilitate the development of a locally defined problem-solving strategy by taking into consideration the following: local definition of the problem to be solved; the selection of appropriate technical assistance;  pre-project feasibility proposals; ethnographic methods and collegiality.

To develop the model the author investigated the structure and process of a small, rural educational system. The purpose of the research was the refinement of educational anthropology observation methods and classroom sampling procedures. The model suggests the use of two classroom observation strategies: (1) cross-sectional observation which defines, describes, and provides an empirical base for conceptualizing and explaining the interrelationships of single units such as classrooms and grade levels; and (2) longitudinal observation which defines, describes, and explains activities and events occurring over time within a single unit. The model also suggests a narrative  qualitative method by which the nature of schooling can be more accurately described and presented. For example, the data can be reported in a narrative format communicating a sense of and prosaic feeling for what it's like to \"go through\" American public schooling. Both behavioral and analytic notes should be presented side by side. Excerpts from the elementary school data collected by the author illustrate this presentation format. The report concludes with a section that summarizes the research project activities and reviews pending research tasks. (RM)",

The study focuses on their unfolding careers, the decisive events in their lives, interconnections in their life histories, and social interaction between them and others in society. Five hundred and fifty-four members of social science and humanities professional associations ranked and nominated the black scholars. These respondents also filled out a brief questionnaire that included information on their own educational and occupational mobility and success. The five nominated scholars were John Hope Franklin, W. Arthur Lewis, Kenneth B. Clark, Matthew Holden, Jr., and Darwin T. Turner.  These scholars were asked questions about family background and economic circumstances; community race-relations climate; parent's philosophy of education; experiences in school, college, and graduate education; and career development. Using the event-structure theoretical framework of Allport, the critical events in the life histories of the five scholars were identified and case studies prepared. Among the findings are that career, education, and family development processes are relatively independent in that each process has a life-range of its own and a sequence of stages. The last part of the document contains a survey of the education and careers of respondents, which includes a demographic analysis of the study sample and an examination of career patterns by age and race. Last, the  five outstanding scholars are compared to the national sample which ranked them. (NE)",

There are five major parts to the report. Part I contains a narrative summary of regional center activity from 1969 to 1971. Serving the states of Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas, the Center had three general objectives: (1) to strengthen the professional education of teachers; (2) to provide a means for successful implementation of new social studies curricula; and (3) to create a setting for research on problems of teacher training and curriculum innovation. &quot;Man: A Course of Study&quot; (MACOS), a conceptually designed, inquiry oriented,  multimedia social science curriculum designed by the Educational Development Center, was selected as the most viable vehicle through which to implement the Center's stated objectives. The second part of the report discusses a community controversy which arose when a group known as Citizens for Moral Education sought to remove MACOS from the Columbia County public schools in Florida in November 1970. This case has particular merit for those who are interested in the support systems necessary for curriculum innovation. Part III evaluates the two week summer institute conducted for teachers by the Center in 1971. Teachers evaluated the institute, their MACOS training, and MACOS as a curriculum. Part IV contains reflections and generalizations of the directors regarding the entire project.

Cultural imperialism is defined as the process whereby the culture of a weaker nation is dominated by that of a stronger nation. In September 1981, Belize, formerly British Honduras, gained its political independence from the United Kingdom. In the past the major force influencing the Belizean culture came from the British Isles. The trend now is toward an increasing pattern of Americanization and a corresponding decrease in British influence. The paper examines current imperialist patterns which reflect this trend: economic imperialism and socio-political imperialism. The private land in  Belize is now largely owned by U.S. interests. In the worlds of finance and trade, there is also a growing North American orientation. The unit of currency in Belize is now the dollar. Many of Belize's exports such as sugar and seafood come to the United States. The U.S. influence can also be seen in the production process. The Hershey foods ship cacao to Pennsylvania and an American born doctor grows and sells mangoes to the United States. The U.S. socio-political imperialism can be seen in communications, migrations, and the military. For example, most vehicles in Belize are now American; one of the major sources of immigrants is North America and this is also the most important destination for emigrants; and the United States has recently agreed to provide training for the Belize  Defense Force.

        "author":["Fairweather, Malcolm"],
        "description":"This paper analyzes the spatial patterning of participants attending four annual conferences of the Association of American Geographers (AAG). The four most recent conventions were selected for the study: Los Angeles in 1981, Louisville in 1980, Philadelphia in 1979, and New Orleans in 1980. A conference participant is defined as a person whose name appeared on the conference program as presenting a paper, chairing a session, operating a workshop, or the like. Two of the most common variables in migration studies were utilized: the size of the population at the point of origin and the distance to the destination. For each of the years under review the &quot;Directory of College Geography of the United States&quot; was utilized to determine the number of full time geography faculty in each  state. This variable represented the population mass of each state or origin area. Desire line measures were used to ascertain distance factors and were calculated from the geographical center of each state to each conference city. Results show that the number of conference participants did not vary dramatically from year to year, in spite of the fact that some of the conference locations were over 3000 miles apart. This phenomena can be accounted for by the fact that those states with the largest numbers of full time geographers tend to send the largest contingents of participants to the annual meetings. Although the location of the conference did increase participation numbers from nearby states, this factor did not significantly influence the overall spatial patterns of participants.  (RM)",

        "description":"In an effort to improve understanding and to provide better solutions to the world's political problems, this paper examines national territory or states in terms of their functional processes and their spatial structures. Examples from Third World states are provided. The author first presents a model of political territory. It has a boundary incorporating a state's legally defined political territory. This formal region of the state can be subdivided into two units. The first, called the effective national territory or ENT, is that portion of state territory where the central authority has control and can exercise coercive power. Within this regional unit would be the capital. The second unit is the noneffective national territory or N-ENT. It is that portion outside the normal  reach of the state's central authority. The author maintains that the N-ENT is as important to the state as the ENT in spatial terms because its presence establishes a two region spatial structure in the political area. This structure has impact on the political processes of the state because in functioning effectively the central authority will attempt to eliminate this element if it is to fulfill its prime objective. Many Third World states have a portion of their territory as N-ENT. For example, a number of states in Africa such as eastern Mauritania, northern Mali, and northern Chad have large stretches of their national area without a permanent population. Another type of N-ENT is where a section of one state is outside the central authority's control because of a neighboring state's  claim and occupation. This occurred in Chad when Libya claimed a strip along the northern border. (RM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate some of the significant factors that relate to the effectiveness of the geographer and departments of geography in developing the important role that the discipline of geography has to offer to higher education in the United States. Geography must continually be conscious that many administrators, faculty, students, and society in general are not fully aware of geography's value. High quality research production and application, excellent teaching, and interdisciplinary programs are excellent methods for demonstrating its worth. The geography faculty member must be conscious of responsibilities both as an individual and as a member of a department. Many impressions of a discipline and a department are gained through informal faculty  contacts and committee efforts. Major attention must be given to the maintenance of a positive internal image and reputation. Attention must also be paid to developing and maintaining the local and state image. The chair or chief administrator of the geography department also plays a crucial role in the success of a discipline. The leadership ability of the chair in reflecting the goals of the geography department upward through administrative channels is critical to the success of a discipline in a given university. Also of importance is the fact that each institution has a unique political and economic power structure. It is incumbent upon the chair and the faculty to be aware of and adjust to this structure. Success and sometimes survival require skillful playing of the political game.  (RM)",

        "author":["Manson, Gary"],
        "description":"This report examines objectives for geographic education recently developed by 6 of the 50 states. The objectives reviewed come from the states of North Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. These states were selected because there was evidence of recent and intensive effort to develop relatively explicit objectives for geographic education. Therefore, an analysis of these objectives should provide some insight into current ideas about geography in the schools. Only knowledge and skill objectives were analyzed. Two limitations to the study are acknowledged: (1) data from the six states, selected as they were, do not permit generalizations about all the states and (2) some geographers would disagree with the content classification scheme used in the study.  Findings and conclusions include the following. Differences among the objectives for geographic education in the six states are striking. For example, more than half of the objectives from Utah and Virginia fall into the information processing category, while less than 10% of South Dakota's are so classified. Twenty-five percent of Wisconsin's objectives concern earth science/physical environment, but in North Carolina that category contains only one percent of the objectives. Overall, judging by these objectives, precollegiate geographic education is a composite of information processing, area studies, and to a lesser extent, man-land geography. Much less attention is given to physical geography, problem solving, and the spatial tradition. It is concluded that precollegiate geographic  education lacks suitable guidelines and criteria for developing and evaluating objectives. (RM)",

The information needs to be presented in as objective a manner as possible. Science needs to become more social oriented. Team teaching should be encouraged. Elementary and secondary inservice teacher education is needed. When designing a class about nuclear energy, teachers need to be aware that accuracy of informational content needs to be considered from two perspectives. These perspectives are the correctness of the information and the intellectual honesty with which this information is presented. Teachers should also know the major issues surrounding the nuclear debate and some of the arguments on both sides of the issues so that information and  activities can focus on these major points. The paper examines six of these major issues and discusses what nuclear advocates and adversaries say concerning them. The issues are nuclear safety, health impact, nuclear waste management, economics of nuclear power, the need for nuclear power, and nuclear proliferation. In developing a strategy for presenting these nuclear issues in the classroom, there are a variety of available resources that the classroom teacher can use. The paper does not describe the resources. (RM)",

Discussed are organizing information and values on public policy issues and types of public policy analysis including monitoring, forecasting, evaluation, and prescription. Chapters two and three discuss the acquisition of information necessary for the analysis. Chapter two explores the use of many different data sources valuable in acquiring information  including dictionaries and encyclopedias, journal articles, almanacs, newspapers, government documents, and microforms. Chapter three deals with surveys and interviews. Chapter four explores the application of descriptive statistics in the analysis of public policy issues. Chapter five concerns benefit-cost analysis of proposed public policy issues and the use of scientific and quasi-scientific research designs in the analysis of public policy. The concluding chapter discusses the Prince Political Accounting System which is a technique for assessing the impact of various individuals, groups, and organizations on public policy decisions.

Examined are milestones in space, war or peace in space, learning about earth from space, the satellite communications revolution, space industrialization, and the ownership of space. The real beginning of the Space Age was the October 1957 Soviet launch of a 184-pound satellite into orbit. The United States put an object into orbit in January 1958. The Soviet Union has taken an important lead in internationalizing access to space by sending Cuban, East European, French, and Mongolian cosmonauts into space. The current projects of the U.S. and Soviet programs--the space shuttle and the space station--are perfect complements. The superpowers have begun a race for the first time to place weapons of  destruction in orbit. Space militarization is being aggressively promoted by both countries. The most valuable contribution space activities have made is the information they have provided about the universe and about the earth. For example, scientists are learning how the atmosphere, oceans, sunlight, and life forms interact to make the planet habitable and how human actions are altering those systems. The biggest scientific advances have been in astronomy and related sciences. As a result of the satellite communications revolution, satellite TV broadcasts are bringing cultural interactions that for the first time begin to match the scale of the world's economical and political interdependencies. Disputes regarding the ownership of space are beginning to emerge. (RM)",

The first section offers an historical overview of the profession. Preparation programs and curricula are described as they have progressed from the middle of the nineteenth century to the present, with a discussion of the increasing complexity of P.E.T.E. programs in response to changing educational philosophies. Societal influences on the development of curriculum for P.E.T.E. programs are considered in the second section, including government legislation, professional organizations, teacher preparation institutions, and employers and consumers. The third section deals with professional preparation curriculum in P.E.T.E.  programs as it has been expanded and altered to meet not only more stringent certification requirements, but also the increasing trend toward specialization. The impact of the competency based teacher education movement on P.E.T.E. is also discussed. Contemporary views on the role and the responsibilities of the physical education teacher are considered in the fourth section. In the fifth section, a discussion is presented on the needs for further research in developing sound physical education curricula and the values of new teaching techniques in the field. The sixth section offers an overview of certification and accreditation of P.E.T.E. programs. In the final section, a discussion is presented on strategies for changing P.E.T.E., and recommendations are made for improving  certification requirements, curriculum content, and process and methodology. Further recommendations are made for clarifying the role of professional physical education organizations and improving the administration of P.E.T.E. programs. (JD)",

Data for the study were obtained through interviews with 36 teachers categorized as nonusers, occasional users, and frequent users of the voluntary and mandated RISE programs. Teachers' perceptions were gathered on: (1) purpose of inservice programs; (2) inservice and curriculum development; (3) administration and inservice; (4) choice versus compulsory programs; (5) preferred inservice; (6) responsibility and control of professional growth; (7) RISE physical  resources; (8) advisors and consultants; (9) teacher center policy board; (10) preservice education; (11) children's learning; (12) adults' learning; (13) career satisfaction; and (14) life plan. Three interrelated themes emerged from the responses as essential issues; these themes reflected the teachers' views of themselves as professionals and as individuals. In spite of the differences evident from individual beliefs, the interviews supplied useful findings for the teacher center, the overriding theme of which was that RISE provided a composite of attributes, the most important of which was teacher advocacy.

A random sample of 162 teachers in nine junior high/middle schools completed a questionnaire measuring perceptions of: (1) stress; (2) burnout; (3) locus of control; (4) attitudes toward students; (5) intolerance of ambiguity or change; and (6) quality of the school as a work setting. The schools were selected because of evidence that they encompassed a wide range of school climate quality. Teachers reported a moderate to substantial amount of stress and burnout. The highest level of stress was generally reported in interpersonal situations, and the  second highest level was reported in new situations. Teachers having negative attitudes and beliefs about students, an external locus of control, and low tolerance for ambiguity reported more stress and burnout than other teachers. These results suggest that preservice teacher education programs should focus on developing an internal locus of control, positive and realistic attitudes toward students, and tolerance of new situations.

Data were collected during one semester from 82 student teachers and their supervisors participating in a competency based program for secondary level teachers.

One rated the instructional effectiveness of the student teacher, while the other rated two curricular units developed and implemented by the student teacher. All student teachers completed &quot;weekly reflection sheets,&quot; providing  information on their activities and their feelings of confidence or lack of confidence for each week. Findings revealed that non-education majors were rated significantly higher on instructional competencies during the first curricular unit, although this trend reversed itself during the second unit. Differences in morale ratings between the groups were minor, and both groups displayed a common pattern; there was a drop in morale about 2 weeks into the experience, followed by a subsequent rise in self confidence.

College students (N=50) participated in a study to investigate the effects of a personal-universal helplessness manipulation on subsequent task performance. Subjects were divided into three groups: contingent, noncontingent, and control. The noncontingent group was subdivided into two groups and given false feedback about the performance of their peers. All subjects completed the Lubin's Adjective Checklist as well as the Levine Problem-Solving task which measured performance differences among the groups. In agreement with learned helplessness theory, the group exposed to  noncontingency manifested longer latencies on the Levine task solution than the contingent or control groups. However, contrary to predictions, this deficit was observed only in the universal helplessness condition. No emotional deficits were revealed by the Adjective Checklist. The findings suggest that the often observed behavioral deficit in depressed college students may be primarily motivational in nature. (Author/JAC)",

Some dimensions of psychological adjustment (perception of reality, anxiety, self-esteem, depression, environmental mastery, anger) are relevant to both the dominant and the Hispanic cultures. There are some psychological instruments appropriate to measure these dimensions without cultural bias. Any psychological instrument should not be selected solely on the basis of validity and reliability. An additional consideration is the availability of the instrument in Spanish and the equivalence of that translated instrument in both languages. Failure  to use equivalent versions may result in different means, variances, and norms. (Author/JAC)",

To investigate this problem, elderly abuse victims in Detroit completed questionnaires and interviews; their families and social service and health agencies were also interviewed. The abuser tended to be the child of the victim in about half the cases with sons and daughters equally responsible. Other abusers included spouses, roomers, landlords, siblings and grandchildren. Victims tended to be from multi-problem families. Agency problems included difficulty in identifying victims and a reluctance to intervene.

        "author":["Crismore, Avon"],
        "description":"One of the most important functions for metadiscourse (reading directives) is to serve as textual relevance cues. Readers must use metadiscourse to determine the specific task or communicative context for understanding the total meaning of a text. Some of the more common types of metadiscourse include (1) hedges--words used to convey a note of caution or confidence; (2) emphatics--words used to underscore what authors really believe or would have their readers think they believe; (3) sequencers--phrases or clauses that tell the reader the author's sequential plans and intentions for the text; and (4) topicalizers--phrases used to announce a shift in the topic. Metadiscourse can also be classified into three groups of adverbials: adjuncts (indicate the focus of what is being  communicated), disjuncts (express an evaluation of what is being said), and conjuncts (indicate the connection between what is being said and what was said before). More attention must be given to teaching students metacognitive awareness of metadiscourse and strategies for its use so that they may understand what the author is saying; maintain schemata by connecting sentences; shift topics; recognize an introduction, a transition, and a conclusion; recognize the author's attitudes and whether the author is being subjective or objective, and recognize the relevance signals. In addition, readers need to be aware of the mood component. Both metadiscourse and mood should be taught as important factors in comprehension processing. (Appendixes include exercises for metadiscourse and mood.)  (HOD)",

        "author":["Swift, Jonathan"],
        "description":"In terms of direct experience, students are limited to their immediate environment--unless that environment is expanded. A school of global education was therefore developed in the Livonia Public Schools (Michigan) to identify and implement ways by which this sought-after awareness could be incorporated into a secondary school multidisciplinary program. The school staff consists of four teachers and a teaching director, plus teachers from various disciplines. This staffing pattern allows for flexible schedules, team teaching, and an interdisciplinary approach to concepts. The curriculum is written so that the academic commonalities of each discipline are interspersed throughout all the disciplines. In addition, the content is presented so that the emphasis is placed on  interpretation of events and works using a global perspective, rather than on a chronological spectrum of these events and works. Through such a multidisciplinary program it is possible to develop visual literacy, to appreciate more fully language competency in economics and international relations, to evaluate scientific and technological progress, and to highlight and trace the consistency of reading development across disciplines. What is needed is greater communication and collaboration between teachers of various disciplines and their active participation in contributing to the role of reading as an indispensible means of acquiring skills, various experiences, content knowledge, empathetic ability, and heightened powers of imagination and problem solving.

          "Herber, Harold L."],
        "description":"Corrective reading assessment and instruction in middle and secondary schools are based on students' weaknesses rather than on their strengths and bear little relationship to the tasks of content area reading. Two premises serve as a rationale for a positive approach to middle and secondary school reading instruction: (1) the majority of students who \"seem\" to need corrective reading instruction do not need it, and (2) the majority of students who do need corrective reading instruction do not need the kind they are getting. Elementary school reading instruction separates reading into a series of skills, while middle and secondary school reading tasks are holistic in nature. Elementary school instruction concentrates on phonics, but students often do not have the background  knowledge to construct familiar meanings out of new concepts and vocabulary, even when their decoding skills are strong. The key to easing the transition from elementary to secondary texts is advanced instruction in reading-reasoning processes in content classrooms, and, for those who still need it, corrective instruction that builds on their strengths: experience, language facility, decoding skills, curiosity, and the capacity to reason.

        "author":["Duffy, Gerald G."],
        "description":"Classroom studies indicate that turn-taking--when a teacher asks a question or assigns a reading turn, the child responds, and the teacher reinforces or corrects--is the format of most school lessons. The problem with this format is that it emphasizes pupil response without providing for teacher explanation and the other forms of substantive verbal assistance. This absence of teacher explanation leads to instructional inequity, focuses on answers rather than on process, and masks the teacher's explanatory role in instruction. The turn-taking model can be modified so that teachers provide deductive or inductive explanations at the outset of the lesson and then conduct turn-taking. Including such explanations provides students with specific assistance regarding problem solving  strategies. Qualitative studies reveal that effective teacher explanation includes explicit information on what is being taught and why it is important, and clearly tells students how to do the task. In addition, effective explanation requires that teachers talk more and monitor student cognitive processing as they restructure their explanations, providing appropriate elaboration as needed. Finally, good explanation provides cohesion across lessons. Turn-taking is difficult to modify because it is a tradition in American schools, one that appears to work and to ease the problems of classroom management. However, providing explanations is a crucial part of the teacher's instructional effort, and is essential if all pupils are to view reading as a sense-making rather than a mechanical  process.

The second section reviews the use of radio in educational development (the advantages of radio, radio in education, radio and language instruction, and radio and unqualified language teachers). The third section summarizes current theoretical descriptions of the reading process and their congruence with  the use of radio (psycholinguistics and reading, reading in a second language, language and language arts instruction, and radio and reading).

        "description":"A study examined the factors that seemed to affect the way teachers adapted the critical components of content area reading innovations that were presented to them in a 3-year staff development project. In the first year of the project, 23 high school content area teachers were interviewed concerning their use, in content area reading instruction, of such critical components as reading guides, devices to introduce and reinforce content area vocabulary, ways of establishing purposes for reading, ways for involving students in class discussions about their reading, and ways to elicit responses from students concerning their answers to questions in reading guides. During the following two years, these components were presented and developed in workshop sessions and demonstrated in  classrooms. In addition, participating teachers worked with a staff developer in devising content area reading lessons for use in their classrooms, and many were also hired to develop content area reading lessons during the summer. At the end of the project, the teachers were again interviewed to determine why, to what extent, and under what conditions they had used the innovative lessons. The interviews were supported with observations and an analysis of materials developed by the teachers. The findings revealed that most of the teachers only use components of the content area reading innovation in a mechanical way. Interview data suggested that this was due to the pressures of time and energy that most teachers felt. (A copy of the interview form is included.) (FL)",

This computer assisted research has revealed that where the eyes go for fixations is of significance to normal reading and that during each fixation only a word or two is being read. In addition, it has shown that when during the fixation a word is perceived the length of fixation varies, probably depending upon when the mind is ready to deal with that information. Eye movement research techniques are likely to be useful in studying higher mental processes occurring during reading and will probably be important in the future for diagnosing specific reading difficulties.

In a study conducted to discover whether peripheral facilitation was taking place during reading, 16 college students read short texts on a cathode-ray tube as their eye movements were monitored. As they read, the contents of certain word locations changed from fixation to fixation, alternating between two words differing in two letters. The results indicated that the words were read only when directly  fixated, and that there was no facilitation from prior peripherally obtained information about the words, thus supporting the word unit hypothesis of information processing.

Subjects were 130 eighth grade students who read 6 prose passages that had been manipulated for content familiarity and for use of explicit connectives and implied connectives (those brought about by the author's arrangement of sentences). Forty-one multiple choice test items accompanied each passage. The findings indicated that the familiarity of the content of a passage is an important variable to consider when studying comprehension. In addition, the more able readers appeared to exhibit more sensitivity to disruptions in the connectivity of the passages than did the less able readers, and their sensitivity was evident in both familiar and  unfamiliar passages.

        "description":"The many studies comparing good and poor readers have yielded few conclusive findings as a result of a number of problems. The first set of problems has to do with the choice of tests or tasks. There are many differences in the cognitive demands of reading and listening tasks children encounter in school. In listening, prosodic cues facilitate sentence analysis, and teachers provide external aids in retrieving relevant prior knowledge, focusing attention on main ideas, and monitoring comprehension. Determining main ideas and monitoring attention are especially important in taking advantage of the permanence of written language. As psychologists and educators turn their attention to reading comprehension, rather than individual word recognition and decoding, the differences  between listening and reading warrant careful study. It is likely that causes of many reading problems will be found in the skills necessary in reading that differ from the skills children have mastered in listening. Another set of problems has to do with subject sampling and experimental design and measurement. Good discussions of these problems have been available for many years, but inadequate procedures continue to appear in published studies, and results from these studies continue to be accepted in review articles. Even when the procedures are adequate, there are serious problems in interpreting the results of studies comparing good and poor readers. The studies do not identify causal factors of reading disability nor do they recognize the great diversity of patterns of reading  disability within each group of students. (HOD)",

        "description":"While studies of college-level readers have yielded evidence both for and against the use of phonological or speech recoding in the recognition of written words, no consistent picture of when recoding occurs has yet emerged. However, one model, the adjunct access model, can account for the previous research findings. According to this model, recoding will not occur when a subject is aware that a speech code may be detrimental to task performance, but will occur at least some of the time when a speech code is not detrimental. The model posits that direct lexical access (word recognition without prior speech recoding) is followed by an automatic but slow adjunct access of the phonological representation of the word. Using this model, the effects of phonological relationships  between words, which were previously interpreted as evidence for speech recoding occurring before word recognition, can now be interpreted as being due to the adjunct access of phonological representations occurring after word recognition. An experiment conducted to test whether semantic relatedness between word pairs would influence the time it takes to make decisions based on phonological characteristics confirmed the model's predictive validity.

Two stories were read aloud to the subjects, each based on the medical beliefs and practices of one of the cultures. The stories were read in standard English, after which the subjects were asked to retell the story. The Aboriginal subjects were permitted to retell the story in Australian Creole English if they so chose. The subjects who responded in Australian Creole English tended to use a more heavily creolized variety in recalling the Aboriginal text.

Preliminary evidence gained from a study involving fifth grade students indicates that the method is superior in many ways to the multiple choice method of assessment. Analysis of \"false alarms,\" cases in which children say they know the meanings of nonwords, reveals that good readers aggressively apply morphological rules to hypothecate meanings for unfamiliar terms, whereas poor readers engage in phonemic experimentation with unfamiliar items to transform them into common words.

Ashcraft found that people tend to know more properties of items they rate as typical of a category than of items they rate as atypical, suggesting that variations in typicality result from variations in familiarity. Three experiments were designed to challenge this suggestion. The first investigated whether familiarity is necessarily correlated with typicality ratings for a large sample of category members that span the typicality range. In this experiment, 20 college students generated properties for category members and 19 other students rated the category members for typicality. Approximately 300 students participated in the second experiment, which tested whether, for a random sample of 15 items from each of 8 categories, a positive correlation would be found between  typicality ratings and number of properties listed. The third experiment produced a set of typicality ratings in which the 20 subjects were able to indicate that they were unable to rate the item because they were unfamiliar with it. Results showed that (1) subjects sometimes produced more properties for items they rated low in typicality; (2) in a large, random sample of items, subjects tended to produce fewer properties for atypical items; and (3) subjects tended to assign totally unfamiliar words to the bottom of a typicality scale rather than reflect low typicality of the referents themselves.

The data were analyzed to determine (1) the extent to which patterns, classified as general American English (GAE), black American English (BAE), and intralectal (IL)--neither GAE or BAE--varied from oral to written language; (2) the effects of nonedited American English (NAE) patterns (categorized as dialect patterns, speech code errors, and print code errors) on text effectiveness; and (3) the extent to which more proficient and less proficient writers differed in their use of NAE patterns. The results of the  analysis revealed that subjects did vary in their oral and written production of non-GAE patterns and that the variations occurred in different forms. Specifically, it was found that dialect patterns had a greater effect on text effectiveness scores than did patterns in the other NAE categories and that high and low proficiency writers differed both quantitatively and qualitatively in their use of NAE patterns.

It was hypothesized that if French language newspapers appealed to the intelligentsia and opinion leaders, then their content should be serious and responsible; and that, by contrast, the Arabic press should have popular, nationalistic content. Following a content analysis of more than 2,000 stories appearing in 2 Tunisian newspapers (1 French and 1 Arabic) and 2 Algerian newspapers (1 French and 1 Arabic), rankings of content type were drawn up for all 4 publications. Content types considered were (1) foreign activities of the home country, (2) events in the home country involving foreign participants, (3) news of countries  other than the home country, and (4) other international news. The results indicated that none of the four newspapers was dominated by stories with mass-appeal topics such as sports, crime, or entertainment. On the contrary, all four emphasized &quot;elite&quot; topics such as international and domestic politics and economics. Further analysis indicated that theme rankings within each country correlated strongly and significantly, while correlations within language correlated weakly. The findings call into question prevalent thinking about elite newspapers. (FL)",

Programs were developed to \"Americanize\" foreigners, emphasizing conformity to white, middle class, Western European values of patriotism, culture, cleanliness, and social living. Percival Chubb, who for a time was director of the Ethical Culture School in New York, was a pioneer in emphasizing the cultural and civic values, rather than the purely academic, of the English curriculum. Yet English teachers held out for teaching the classics while merely toying with the concept of the social significance of literature. By 1924, there was not only a quest for internationalism, for peace, and for other cultures, but also an awakening of language  consciousness. The 1930s highlighted progressivism and \"intercultural\" and \"interracial education.\" Educators began to stress the influence of literature and communication on the psychosocial development of the child. By 1937, the study of world literature across the country was a \"fait accompli.\" During the 1950s institutional support for intercultural education and its by-products waned. Later, as ethnic \"powers\" became methods of operation, there was a refurbished cry for the study of ethnicity. In 1973, an article on black English appeared in the \"English Journal,\" signalling an increase in multicultural awareness that had finally become nationwide. (HOD)",

An examination of (1) the letters and speeches of Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, the first regulator of broadcasting; (2) the congressional debate over the regulatory issues of monopoly, censorship, scarcity, and listeners' rights; and (3) other contemporary documents reveals why, in the strong laissez-faire, marketplace-oriented atmosphere of the 1920s, radio policy makers strongly advocated federal regulation of the medium. The examination reveals that while scarcity of spectrum space first led to the Radio Act of 1927, early regulators recognized that the possible detrimental effect of monopoly and censorship also  provided a strong rationale for radio regulation. The new law was seen as protecting the public's interest in radio because, under its provisions, no individual or corporation could monopolize broadcasting. Censorship by government was declared illegal and through the creation of an independent agency to regulate broadcasting, censorship by broadcasters was curtailed. Under the act, listener rights were firmly established, and stations were legally bound to operate in the public interest, convenience, and necessity. (FL)",

        "description":"On the premise that a gap has developed between the newsworthiness of the national political party conventions and the television network resources allocated to cover them, the three major networks' coverage of the 1980 Democratic and Republican national conventions was analyzed to document patterns that influence the networks' portrayal of party conventions. Prime time coverage of the second night's proceedings (generally limited to debate on the party platform and party loyalists speaking to the convention) was taped from all three commercial networks. Three main categories of content were coded for analysis: (1) official proceedings, (2) anchor analysis, and (3) correspondent reports and interviews. The results showed that although official proceedings still accounted for  nearly half of broadcast coverage, the networks' own interpretations of convention events dominated coverage. All three networks relied heavily on floor correspondent reports, interviews, anchor analysis and commentary to punctuate coverage. Official convention proceedings were dispensed to viewers in 6- to 8-minute segments, with convention organizers usually adapting their agendas to meet network constraints. Within these similar structures, each network emphasized its particular organizational strength, and inter-network competition was evident throughout the convention. Network producers, sensitive to this &quot;newsworthiness gap,&quot; may devise a new coverage model for 1984, abandoning continuous coverage of the conventions. (HTH)",

        "description":"Defining development as a participatory process within a society aimed at creating or maintaining social structures and institutions that allow a society's present and future needs to be met, a study was undertaken to discover what kind of treatment was given to development news by Third World media. Eleven foreign newspapers from a university library were analyzed for content for 1 month. The papers came from a variety of countries, including China, Israel, and Canada, and from five countries in Africa. A total of 3,031 development news items were found, or about 9 or 10 items per issue. A measure of the proportion of the page and determination of the priority each item had received were made. Over half of the items were less than one-eighth of the page. Priority estimation  followed a similar pattern, in that only 28.5% of the items were high priority, 49% were given middle priority, and 22.5% received low priority. Development news was primarily gathered by the newspaper staff or the national news agency of the country, and most items came from the latter. The results appeared to support the charges that Third World media place no more emphasis on development news than do Western news agencies. (HTH)",

The 60-item questionnaire elicited demographic information, as well as information related to job satisfaction. The results showed that most of the respondents were satisfied with their jobs and were especially satisfied with (1) the freedom they were given to do their work, (2) their relationships with their colleagues and department chairpersons, (3) their teaching loads, and (4) their opportunities for professional growth. They were most dissatisfied with their physical working conditions, salaries, and the financial support provided  for their research. Most of the respondents preferred to teach, but said that they must engage in research to obtain tenure and promotions. Many complained that tenure and promotions at their institutions were not administered fairly. Differences in the job satisfaction of men and women faculty members were minor. However, faculty members with tenure were more satisfied with their jobs than were nontenured faculty. Senior faculty members received significantly more rewards and were more likely to believe that the rewards were distributed fairly. These senior professors also seemed to be more productive than their junior colleagues. (A copy of the questionnaire is appended.) (FL)",

Stories about Robert Kennedy were analyzed from January 1, 1968, until the week of his assassination, and stories about Edward Kennedy were analyzed from January 1, 1980, until the week of President Jimmy Carter's renomination. The researchers studied 10 different types of statements that appeared in the stories, recording instances of attribution and adverbial and adjectival bias, as well as statements about the Kennedys' ages,  appearance, personalities, families, religion, and wealth. Statements were rated favorable, neutral, or unfavorable. Analysis revealed that statements published about the three brothers by both magazines were approximately about 20% favorable, 50% neutral, and about 30% unfavorable. Both magazines treated President John Kennedy more favorably than they treated either of his brothers. &quot;Time&quot; published 454 adverbial and adjectival phrases about John, Robert, and Edward, while &quot;Newsweek&quot; published only half as many, but the magazines were remarkably consistent in their slant, with just over half of these phrases in both magazines rated favorable.

Researchers then rated each figure on a five-point &quot;helplessness&quot; scale, based on the figure's comparative inability to affect the outcome of events or behaviors described. Results showed that more than 25% of the figures were rated as not helpless, while  approximately 40% were rated as strongly or completely helpless. The remaining figures were rated mildly or moderately helpless. Five types of figures accounted for almost 62% of all central figures: American public, foreign nations, United States politicians and public officials, business persons or organizations, and persons with diseases or illnesses. In those segments where the central figure was the American public, the mean helplessness score was markedly higher than the average for the entire sample.

Undergraduate journalism students applied R. F.

Both articles were then rewritten, giving attention to the feedback provided by the students' stopping behavior. W. Taylor's cloze procedure--a measure of the redundancy of language patterns--confirmed that the revised articles were more redundant than the original versions, although both were approximately the same length. Similarly qualified students then applied the same  stopping procedure to the revised articles. Results indicated that changes in redundancy made in response to the feedback of the first group significantly decreased reader confusion. However, reader interest and scores on an objective comprehension/recall test were not increased significantly. These results suggested that feedback from typical readers can help science writers to communicate scientific information to selected audiences more effectively.

Many similarities were found between the electronic and print media feature stories. How-to-do-it articles, personality profiles, and complex/analytical stories were about equal in number, with fewer personal experience stories and no  strictly historical stories. The findings also revealed that the television magazines were dominated by stories concerning health, actors and actresses, novelists, and women in business and entertainment. Stories covering complex issues focused on antisocial behavior, sex and pornography, leisure, and government inefficiency.

        "description":"Lines are elemental design devices that provide the primary structure for visual expressions in printed media. Gestalt principles of perception emphasize the role of the viewer, so the energy of the lines and the commercial viability of a particular design depend upon the designer's and photojournalist's understanding of both the viewer's programed response to lines and his or her mental set. Although the roles of intuition and &quot;previsualization&quot; are debated, the mechanical nature of mass media and the common link of realism probably make previsualization more important for the designer and photojournalist. The complex relationship between form and content that results when photographs are printed in the mass media depends upon cropping as well as upon lines and shapes. Framing  is nothing more than the lines that mark the border between artifact and environmental space or image and border. Lines are also the primary tool of previsualization, and necessary in the creation of three dimensional effects. As physical events, lines represent a balancing of compositional forces, and they can also be perceived temporally. Although photojournalists discover lines while designers create them, students in both disciplines can benefit by instruction in their use. (A slide presentation outline is appended.) (JL)",

An examination of three Chicago, Illinois, newspapers--the &quot;Tribune,&quot; the &quot;Times,&quot; and the &quot;Daily News'--during the 1877 railroad strike, the 1886 eight-hour day controversy, and the 1894 Pullman strike and boycott reveals that in spite of sharply opposing views on business-labor relations, these papers tended to exhibit similar fundamental business values--a commitment to public interest consumerism, an obsession with commercial order and social control, and a growing faith in organizational/bureaucratic modes of  conflict resolution. The unique nature of the newspaper as it evolved in the nineteenth century explains these positions. As public institutions that saw themselves as custodians of the public interest, newspapers abhorred conflict and were committed to peace and order at all costs. Their faith in arbitration reflects journalism's faith in the efficacy of information gathering, application, and analysis. These values were essentially those of the progressive movement and point to the continuing values of contemporary journalism. (JL)",

Analysis of the responses indicated that about 32% of the newspapers had formal, written policies governing the use of anonymous sources, and about 69% had informal, oral policies concerning such use. Larger papers tended to have formal policies, while small and medium-sized dailies tended to have informal policies. The most common aspect of these policies was that editors had to  know the identities of anonymous sources. Other major aspects included using anonymous sources only as a last resort, verifying anonymous information through other sources, and describing unnamed sources as fully as possible to allow readers to judge their credibility. Independent newspapers tended to have the statement &quot;granting confidentiality to protect sources&quot; in their policies more often than did group-owned newspapers. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; incident had affected the policies of most of the newspapers.

Specifically, it noted the frequency of occurrence of nostalgia in the two graphic design areas of artwork and display typography and compared them with the use of nostalgic motifs in headlines. The study included 12 magazines representing fashion and design-oriented publications--both general interest and design trade magazines--published from 1959 through 1979, and focused on a total of 11,816 advertisements and 2,511 articles. Findings showed that nostalgic motifs seemed to be used more in designer publications than in consumer  publications and that nostalgic themes were used more often in articles than in advertisements. In terms of use in headlines, art, or type, graphic design was more likely to display nostalgic motifs than were the headlines of the article or advertisement. More specifically, type was more likely to be the indicator of nostalgia than was art. The most favored style for nostalgic treatment was the Victorian period. The level of nostalgia also seemed to vary with historical events and periods as evidenced by a visible increase in nostalgia during and following periods of economic recession, as well as following periods of social and civil unrest.

The paper explores the concurrent decline of central cities and that of the mass media, as well as the rise of decentralization and &quot;suburbanization&quot; and the rise in media specialization. It suggests that the increase in multiple media with many centers may bring a new city or &quot;mediapolis&quot; in the postindustrial, information-centered society. The paper notes the response of central city daily newspapers to the urban crisis, the decline in the old print media, and the rise of the electronic newspaper. It reviews the proposed use of new communications technology as a tool for utopias and technocracy in relationship to the efforts to rebuild the old cities and create  new ones. The paper raises questions about the negative impact of new communications technology, such as decreases in interpersonal contacts, threats to privacy, and dangers of communications overload. In addition, it probes the possible impact of the pluralistic communities of geography and interest on the political dilemmas of metropolitan areas without a central government. The paper calls attention to the continuing media fixation on geography and centrality, and cites the need for a sophisticated and comprehensive information specialist in the newsroom of the future.

However, it does appear that there are two areas where the journalism teacher can be found negligent for breach of the duties to instruct and to supervise properly. Liability could result from \"misfeasance,\" whereby the teacher assigns a student reporter to a risky or dangerous story that might result in injury to that student. The teacher might also be held liable for \"nonfeasance\" if he or she fails to advise a student reporter or editor properly concerning tortious content of a story or fails to provide proper instruction within the curriculum concerning the legal responsibilities of  newsgathering and publishing. In brief, journalism training in the public schools can no longer be confined to the practical skills of newsgathering and reporting. Every curriculum must include instruction on the legal responsibilities of publication. The best protection schools can have against lawsuits is to hire only certified journalism teachers, preferably those with some professional experience. (Author/FL)",

The &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; were selected for study because of their extensive foreign news coverage and because of the widely documented reductions in the number of their foreign correspondents. Fourteen randomly sampled issues per year were selected for analysis, yielding a total sample of 154 issues from 1969 to 1980. All foreign items were coded for geopolitical focus, originating agent (correspondent or wire service), and media source. The &quot;Tribune&quot; showed a pattern of  growth in the publication of borrowed news, despite overall reductions in international item publication and overseas staff cuts. Publication of Wire service borrowed news grew significantly for the &quot;Times&quot; during the study period. The study failed to identify a relationship between staffing level and overall incidence of borrowed news published. But a pattern of news borrowing of Third World items in the wire service stories suggests that wire service journalists are responding to a gradual reduction in the available news sources and may be choosing, or are forced, to rely on official or partisan news organizations in Third World nations, where government control of press activity is allegedly increasing.

During its first year, &quot;My Day&quot; addressed humanitarian concerns such as poverty, unemployment, conservation, and the role of women, but much of it could be read as ingenious political propaganda during an election year. The column gave the Roosevelt administration a highly flexible  weapon in its political arsenal, and Mrs. Roosevelt and the President most certainly conferred on some of its contents. Numerous columns during the years of World War II contained patriotic messages, descriptions of Mrs. Roosevelt's travels to various war areas, letters from servicemen, and advice from the Office of War Information. Beyond its political overtones, &quot;My Day&quot; sent a series of mixed messages regarding the position of women in society. While the column failed to offer a role model of much meaning to the average woman, it nevertheless showed a middle-aged woman continually on the move, establishing a place in the competitive occupation of journalism, and defining a role for herself outside the customary boundaries of her position.

        "description":"A study analyzed the attitudes of newspaper subscribers and nonsubscribers to determine whether the two groups were truly distinct, homogenous segments of the public or whether there were &quot;atypical&quot; subscribers and nonsubscribers. Data were gathered through telephone interviews with more than 1,000 adults in the southeastern United States. Based on their responses to a number of questions related to newspaper use, these adults were segmented into four groups: (1) hard-core newspaper subscribers, who indicated that they would continue subscribing to a given newspaper; (2) marginal subscribers, who said they might stop subscribing; (3) potential subscribers, who said they might begin subscribing; and (4) hard core nonsubscribers, who indicated that they would not begin subscribing.  Analysis of data generated in the study revealed that newspaper subscribers and nonsubscribers are not distinct, homogenous groups. When segmented to reflect strength of commitment to continue subscribing, the respondents indicated that there are atypical subscribers and nonsubscribers who share many of the same demographic and news content interest characteristics. The findings suggest that two segments of the reading audience are of critical importance to newspapers--the marginal and the potential subscriber. By identifying the members of these segments, newspapers can focus their promotional and marketing efforts on the people most likely to affect circulation trends. (FL)",

        "author":["Shapiro, Stephanie Ann"],
        "description":"In the United States, where printed literature is the primary vehicle of myth, the journalist plays a critical role as creator and perpetuator of myth through the narrative form. Narratives of fiction or fact express the traditions and metaphors of a particular culture and transform archetypal myths into myths unique to that culture. A comparison of American cultural myths with newspaper feature stories reveals their shared qualities of a sense of timelessness, repetitiousness, and reaffirmation of the values that define and direct cultural conduct. The realism of feature stories recasts abiding myths in contemporary form. From examples drawn from the &quot;Washington Post,&quot; one can observe that the journalist neither establishes nor recharts mythic consciousness, but fulfills the  social obligations established for the myth. Although a feature story may depict a world alien to that of its readers, their values are generally upheld rather than disputed by the depiction. Feature stories, like all popular art, are designed to sell, and thus conform to popular values and images. Several critics contend that the audience's need for myth is exploited by the press and leads to deceptive reporting. They also cite a disparity between newspaper stories and the actual experiences of those who read them. But their cultural analysis only stresses the role of the newspaper as a disseminator of information and overlooks its equally vital role as a medium through which national mythology is celebrated and reaffirmed. As the link between myth and the feature story emerges through  illustration, so does the inescapable role of the journalist as myth-maker. (Author/HOD)",

Groups surveyed were Irish, Greek, Czech, Italian, Lebanese, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Polish, Romanian, Slovene, and Ukrainian. From a total of 644 people, 392 were interviewed again in 1980-81, for a completion rate of 58.9%. Both surveys tested ethnic media use, metro media use, ethnic interpersonal communication, ethnic cultural patterns, and social status. Results indicated that although income was negatively associated with ethnic identification and behavior in the 1976 survey, the influence was mediated by ethnic communication  when ethnic identification was the criterion variable and by identification and communication when the criterion variable was the observance of ethnic customs and holidays. Also, both mass and interpersonal communication filled mediating positions between social status and ethnic cultural behaviors; however, environmental factors may shift the relative importance each plays in the future. Changes in media delivery systems and communication technologies may also affect both ethnic identification and social status. (JL)",

One possible reason is that the structures within which scientists work do not encourage their members to get involved in the public dissemination of information. Using a national sample of both physical and social scientists, a study sought to discover if scientists themselves perceived the existence of any constraints in three different scientific structures: science itself as a social organization, scientific societies with which scientists are often affiliated, and institutions that employ scientists. Specifically, the following research questions were asked: (1) Do scientists perceive the structure of science as a social system to be a barrier? (2) Do scientists perceive the policies of  scientific societies to constitute a barrier? and (3) Do scientists perceive the policies of organizations who employ them to be a barrier? Subjects were 456 scientists drawn from the reference work, &quot;American Men and Women of Science.&quot; Responses to the survey showed that scientists seemed to perceive some of the structures within which they work to be barriers to their involvement in the public dissemination of information through the mass media. Both the social system of science and the scientific employer seemed to present barriers to many of the respondents. Many acknowledged the inadequacy of training programs in preparing scientists to deal with the media, and the priority that communicating with fellow scientists has over any obligation to get research findings into the public  domain. Most importantly, responses indicated that scientists felt they had little to gain within science by engaging in the public dissemination of information. (HOD)",

Results showed that the editors and bishops agreed on the three major roles of the diocesan press--providing news of significance to Catholics, intradiocesan communication, and religious education--but ranked them in opposite order. Editors seemed to have a precarious balance of adversarial and institutional norms, putting primacy on the news function of their papers, while bishops emphasized the institutional communication and religious education roles of the press. The findings suggest that the pull from institutional  communication demands and those of a semiautonomous watchdog creates great stress on editors of such publications.

In the opening sections, the theory is defined, and the early information diffusion studies and public opinion polls that led to its formulation in 1970 are described. In the next sections, pertinent qualities of all the published and unpublished knowledge gap studies are identified and treated as variables for the construction of a table of conclusions about the validity of the hypothesis. These characteristics include (1) date and location of research, (2) sample size, (3) completion rate, (4) type of population, (5) research design, (6) number of measurements in time, (7) method of data collection,  (8) topic studies, (9) type of knowledge studied (awareness or depth), (10) operational definitions of education and knowledge gap, (11) an assessment of amount of media publicity involved, and (12) knowledge gap findings (education/knowledge data). The report points out that the data reveal that the theory's proposition--the higher the education, the greater the knowledge of various topics--is supported by most of the studies, but its other proposal about the correlation between knowledge and mass media levels is not. Future considerations for research follow the conclusions, as do three tables in which the review data are presented and summarized. (JL)",

Writing teachers can provide their students with models of the research process to guide them in their quests for information. Search strategy outlines map the path one should follow in the course of a literature review, progressing from the collection of background information to the identification of specific literature, and can be modified from one discipline to another. Mastery of the search process enables students to develop understanding of the context of their topics within disciplines and to refine their topics appropriately. Many colleges are integrating library instruction in cross  curriculum programs with apparent success. Such programs require planning of objectives and consultation with faculty outside the library. Library instruction should be provided only for those parts of a writing curriculum that require research, and serious thought should be given to the library's ability to support its proposed activities. In an alternative approach, libraries could function as centers for faculty development training of peer tutors, who could instruct students in the use of search strategies and ways in which different disciplines organize their literature.

Most of the students are engineering majors, but do not necessarily know how to use a computer. However, they accept the necessity of following a logical set of commands, and that every program must be \"debugged.\" The course makes revision as integral to writing as debugging is to programing. The course still emphasizes attention to audience and use of visuals, as well as rhetoric, but access to a word processing lab encourages students to revise and make corrections on a screen that they might be reluctant to make on a typewritten page. The system also has an automated dictionary, that seeks out misspelled words in the text. The  software automatically sets up document formats so students need not be concerned with margins, tabs, centering, or the psychological defeat of a blank page. In a traditional class, students find themselves spending so much time recopying some parts of their papers that they have little motivation to critically read and revise what they have written. For engineering students who typically write weekly lab reports, progress reports, or proposals, updated versions can be generated by the word processing program without rewriting the whole report, and documentation for research projects can be stored, and arranged in a variety of ways.

Analysis of both postdiscussion measures of work partner preferences and interpersonal attraction and pretest measures of racial attitudes revealed the following: (1) Belief rather than race was the major determinant of choice of work partner. (2) For female  subjects, belief was significant in determining work partner; for males this factor fell just short of significance. (3) Nonprejudiced subjects were just as likely as prejudiced subjects to discriminate against Hispanics as work partners. (4) The prejudiced subjects tended to select either Hispanics who agreed or whites who disagreed. (5) Members of each \"undesirable\" group (disagreers, Hispanics, and disagreeing Hispanics) apparently became more acceptable as work partners when they were physically attractive.

        "description":"Although Britain's Open University employs television case studies resembling the documentaries seen on general service television as part of its multimedia distance learning system, evaluations of the program have shown that many students were unable to achieve the learning objectives put forth by the program producers. Because of production pressures, there was a tendency for the program producers to concentrate on the content rather than on the learning process. Even if the producers were perfectly clear about the learning process they wanted to initiate, students also had to know what they were expected to do with the material and why. Open University is now using five approaches to help students make better use of the television case studies: (1) more extensive materials to  support the television programs; (2) supplemental television programs broadcast early in the course to help students develop an analytical approach to the case study component of the course; (3) audiocassettes to follow up television case studies; (4) training packages with videotaped extracts from a range of programs, an accompanying handbook, and specially prepared exercises; and (5) restructuring the case study programs so that help for the students is included in the basic structure. More of the explanatory frameworks in which a program's version of reality was constructed should be revealed to the students. (HTH)",

        "description":"In recent years, Japanese management techniques have been proclaimed by many as the salvation of American business. It would be dangerous, however, to apply these techniques to American business situations without critically examining them. Whereas Americans regard responsible individuality as a virtue and view lack of autonomy as a constraint, the Japanese regard individuality as evidence of immaturity and autonomy as the freedom to comply with one's obligations and duties. While there are no significant differences in the style of decision making used by Japanese and United States managers, the dominance of face-to-face communication among the Japanese may account for the perception that there is more openness about major decisions in Japanese firms and more desire for  employers and employees to explore and learn together. There are problems with the Japanese system, however. For example, permanent employment operates mainly in the larger Japanese firms, applies only to a minority of Japanese workers, and is reserved for males. To avoid the stigma of becoming a temporary worker or manual laborer, Japanese children are pressed at increasingly younger ages to learn enough to be admitted to the most prestigious schools, since career opportunities are dependent on educational achievement. After careful examination, Japanese management appears to be a system of contradictions. Before American business people start a wholesale application of Japanese management techniques, they need to ask whether success should be measured in terms similar to those used by  the Japanese.

        "description":"Recent reviews of the literature demonstrate that there is little research providing insight into the nature of hospital communication. Using the model of the sociology of communication, five specific research questions can be generated about hospital communication: (1) How is information processed? (2) What communication is satisfying? (3) What are the internal feedback mechanisms of the organization? (4) What factors constrain communication? and (5) How is communication related to organizational effectiveness? An application of these questions to a review of the literature about hospital communication reveals that employees of hospitals have less of a need for information than employees of other organizations; that employee uncertainty is related to satisfaction with the  organization; that individual responses to a lack of feedback include unionization, a method of formalizing feedback; that the perceptions of individuals employed in hospitals are constrained by the usual physical and historical factors such as age, educational level, and sex; and that there are no data to support the claim that there is a strong relationship between communication and hospital effectiveness.

On the one hand, the woman manager is told to forget that she is a woman; on the other, she is advised to cultivate feminine qualities to achieve managerial positions in departments where these qualities are valued. Women's participation in management increased slowly. Whereas one-third of the work force is made up of women, less than 2 percent are business executives. Although a number of studies demonstrate that there are no differences of any consequence to management between the mental, motivational, or physical capabilities of men and women, there is discrimination against women in business and government organizations. Stereotypic prejudgment is especially acute in the area of promotions. Although it is evident that women  are not advancing in organizational hierarchies as fast as men, it is unclear whether this differential advancement is due to bias, discrimination, choice, or inexperience. If the study of women as managers is to lead to any meaningful insights into gender differences, then there are at least four issues that must be addressed: (1) differentiating highly mobile managers from less mobile managers, (2) differentiating promotion from advancement, (3) determining the effects of the \"velvet ghetto,\" and (4) determining the effects of communication on the advancement of women in organizations.

        "description":"It is unfortunate that the field of organizational communication has neglected communication in political settings, because the bulk of students enrolled in social science curricula are likely to work in public or semipublic institutions. Problems unique to the political setting stem from the fact that most public agencies must tailor their external and internal messages to a variety of public audiences. A two-quarter graduate level course sequence offered at the University of Illinois (Chicago Circle) is structured to provide an introduction to the organizational communication field with an emphasis on political settings. The course begins with a general discussion of the nature, importance, and technical and ethical problems of organizational communication, with examples drawn  largely from the field of politics. Next, the course focuses on the major roles of information gathering in the work of governmental and other political organizations. The third major focus of the course is formal and informal internal and external information flows, structures, and climates. Finally, the students spend considerable course time developing the research skills needed to carry out major research projects, including communication audits. Unfortunately, the literature available for teaching such a course is inadequate. If the field is to develop properly, several good texts are needed, as well as intellectual transposers who can restructure available data about organizational communication in political settings into appropriate formats.

Subjects were 114 college students and their &quot;willing&quot; conversational partners. Each subject completed a questionnaire concerning a conflict he or she had had with the conversational partner, an interpersonal conflict tactics and strategies scale, an interpersonal communication satisfaction inventory, and an interpersonal solidarity scale. Analysis of the data revealed that the use of constructive message strategies in interpersonal conflict tended to produce positive affective outcomes--specifically, interpersonal communication satisfaction and interpersonal solidarity.  By the same token, the use of destructive or avoidance conflict message strategies was significantly less likely to yield satisfaction and solidarity, and might even have inhibited such outcomes.

Analysis of the data revealed that the higher the educational attainment of parents, the more carefully they considered schools when locating the family residence and the more advanced schooling they expected their children to obtain. The number of contacts  with teachers initiated by parents was affected particularly by the parents' educational level and the sex of the child involved; parents of boys initiated a significantly higher number of contacts. The study suggests that the benefits of parental support and involvement accrue most often to boys with higher academic capabilities and better educated parents. Further, patterns of parental choice and involvement seem more likely to maintain the social status quo than to challenge it. (Author/PGD)",

The researchers considered parent participation to be an aspect of educational politics. They measured the level of participation at the \"micro-level,\" where household and schoolroom meet, by analyzing the frequency, degree of self-initiation, and content of the contacts maintained by parents with their children's teachers. The study found that these three factors were positively related to the parents' educational attainment, preferences for more individualized instruction, and higher expectations for their children's future schooling. Higher levels of teacher contact  were maintained for male children and contacts were more frequent when the children's academic capabilities were rated either extremely high or extremely low as measured by a test of reading comprehension. Parents new to schools also maintained higher levels of contact, while longer-term residents initiated fewer interactions. The mother's employment status, the number of children in the family, and the parents' satisfaction with their children's schooling experiences did not correlate with the participation measures.

        "description":"Focusing on the problems of the federal role in education, the educational &quot;competency&quot; of federal programs, and the usefulness of research-based knowledge for educational practice, this report evaluates the Experimental Schools Program (ESP), a small federal program in the early 1970s that aimed to help poor and minority students by encouraging &quot;comprehensive change&quot; in school districts' educational practices. Data for the evaluation came from ESP documents and interviews with ESP staffers, local school officials, and ESP researchers. After a general discussion of federal-local relations in education, the authors look at the differences between federal and local approaches to change, the variety of local responses to ESP, and the problem of defining comprehensive change. They  next examine the conflicts arising from ESP's misunderstanding of school districts' decentralized structure and from its insistence on both local control and detailed federal monitoring. The following section describes ESP's holistic evaluations of its programs, the difficulties in applying holistic methods to the study of ill-defined changes, and the effects of evaluation on local administrators and teachers. The concluding section summarizes the authors' assessment of ESP. (RW)",

        "description":"Research on grades 9-12 in an elite, coeducational private school in an urban area examined the effects of the school's social organization on students' commitment to educational goals and their sense of academic purpose. The author gathered data through 2 years of participant observation as a teacher-researcher and through questionnaire interviews with 87 percent of the school's 254 high school students. The questionnaire data on students' academic achievement, sociometric status among their peers, acceptance in college, feelings of satisfaction, socioeconomic status, and parent involvement in the school indicate that students placed a high value on academic achievement. Student values thus matched the school's and parents' formal values. Results of the participant observation  suggest that three school characteristics fostered student commitment to achievement: the school's function as a close primary community, continuity over time in students' educational experiences, and students' substantial power over their own school lives. Further research is needed to discover whether other private schools stimulate student commitment in similar ways and whether such motivational mechanisms can help improve public schools.

Focusing particularly on the Northeast and New England, the document reviews literature on school-community relations and presents numerous examples of school-community interaction. First, the author looks at how schools are embedded in communities, especially at how schools and communities share resources, solve mutual problems, and plan collaboratively to reach shared goals. Next she presents examples both of barriers to effective school-community relations--such as miscommunication, limited resources, or problems in educational structure or state regulation--and of how educators have overcome some of the barriers. Finally the guide  considers ways that SEAs are helping schools overcome communication, resource, structural, and state regulatory barriers. Appended is a 33-page annotated bibliography that contains 201 document references. Included are pieces covering school-community relations in general, case studies, and &quot;how-to&quot; manuals and guides, as well as a list of 20 public and private resource agencies.

The comprehensive school concept involves increasing the number of years of basic education for students while postponing the time when they will be tracked into specifically academic or vocational high schools by approximately 3 years. The paper analyzes the effects of changes in government on the availability of support for experimentation and discusses the failings of a  strategy for development that called on the experimental schools to develop programs independently while contributing to the national effort. The types and functions of research necessary for implementation and evaluation of an innovation are considered next, followed by descriptions of the research done on the comprehensive school experiment and of the purposes to which the research was put. The paper concludes with an analysis of the factors affecting innovations and offers recommendations for more effective research, implementation, and policy-making strategies. (PGD)",

        "description":"The current trend toward deregulation of education at the federal level will not prove particularly significant if deregulation does not also occur at the state level. The Reagan administration's handling of deregulation has been clumsy, slow, inappropriate, and apparently guided by motivations other than the easing of administrative burdens. These conclusions are drawn from an examination of the effects of the withdrawal of the Lau Regulations, the abortive effort to allow tax-exempt status to racially discriminating private schools, and the extensive budget cutting accompanying the consolidation of categorical grants into a block grant program in Chapter Two of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act. Even successful federal deregulation would only affect 8 percent of  educational funding, however, and tax reform efforts like Proposition Thirteen have assured that true control will revert to the states. The likelihood seems remote that significant changes will occur in pay rates, hiring practices, licensing requirements, or other regulated areas. The opportunity for local schools to compete more successfully for personnel or to provide higher quality services seems as a result to be unlikely to develop. Still, the imperatives of scarcity and the new federal role make deregulation at the state and local levels a simple necessity. (Author/PGD)",

Fourteen of the original districts' strategy implementation teams were contacted and two members of each team interviewed by phone. Analysis of the responses suggests that the implementation strategies may have had permanent results. Programmatic changes made by the districts tended to be maintained across all categories of Title IX concern, including the areas of equity in physical education, athletics, and academic courses for students and equity in personnel practices for teaching and administrative staffs. New  initiatives tended to be taken most frequently in districts that had made appreciable gains in the original experimental period. (Author/PGD)",

Attempts at disseminating research findings and implementing programs based on those findings have revealed many problems that can only be resolved with adequate research on knowledge use. This research concentrates on four major topics: the change process that occurs when innovations are attempted; the mobilization period preceding implementation of new programs; the contextual influences affecting implementation; and the ways in which externally-generated knowledge  enters the school environment. This discussion of the current state of research on knowledge use includes descriptions of 10 active projects funded by grants from the National Institute of Education and concludes with brief analyses of three areas that will receive emphasis in the future.

        "description":"Interviews with persons responsible for interpreting and transmitting labor relations policy to negotiators at the local school district level in New York revealed considerable consistency in the ways the relevant laws, regulations, and legal opinions were assessed and used. Policy interpreters turned first to documents and then to consultants when faced with matters difficult to resolve. The techniques adopted for analyzing and disseminating policy information were found to be fairly uniform. The policy interpreters had a dual view of policy, regarding it both as a set of universalistic principles embodied in statute and decision, and as a set of devices to be used for tactical purposes as dictated by local circumstances. The authors of this report indicate that it is commonly  understood that state interests in labor relations policies are to be subordinated to the needs of local situations. The authors suggest that this common understanding makes labor policies more effective at the local level than almost all other policies, which tend to be characterized by an insistence on the dominance of the state's interests over local interests.

In order to establish such a foundation, researchers used the methodology of clinical analysis to determine the goals, purposes, and beliefs underlying the overt behavior patterns found in the effective school improvement projects being conducted in four states and at least eight Connecticut school districts. The characteristics of effective schools found through this process consisted of isolated, if not unrelated, variables. Analysis revealed a common theoretical basis for behavior across three effect domains: school effects, teacher effects, and student effects. The analysis also suggests listing overt behaviors as a method of identifying what actions  might be taken at the school level to increase student achievement. Clinical analysis of one effective school characteristic, the opportunity to learn, supports a theory stating that the principles of behaviorism can be built into the school and the classroom and can ultimately be brought to bear on the student.

It is based on the proposition that no general prescriptions are equally appropriate for all students. A brief description of Hood River Valley (Oregon) High School shows how one CP program is set up. Any school establishing a CP program must consider four principal components: (1) program scope and sequence, concerning curricular goals and course arrangement; (2) selection of instructional materials; (3) the management system, governing recordkeeping, materials quality, individual student plans and conferences, the learning environment, physical arrangements, and use of aides;  and (4) the teacher-adviser system. Examples of five more CP programs, using different program structures and covering different subject areas, come from Andrews (Texas) High School, Howard County (Maryland) School System, Bishop Carroll High School in Calgary (Alberta, Canada), P. K. Yonge Laboratory School in Gainesville (Florida), and Chalmette (Louisiana) High School.

He next describes the characteristics of and legal foundations for the different levels of the educational structure: nursery, primary, special, secondary (including pre-university, general, and several vocational programs), and higher education (including both universities and advanced vocational  institutions). Brief descriptions of the educational systems of the United States, England and Wales, Sweden, and the Soviet Union are provided, and major differencs between the Dutch system and those of the other countries are analyzed. Arguing that significant change is needed, the author concludes with a discussion of innovative trends in Dutch educational thought, noting in particular the implications of changes proposed by the current Minister of Education. A brief description of the Netherlands' Educational Research Institute in the North (RION) is appended. (PGD)",

The first section details the judicial and legislative background, enactment, and politics of implementation of the law. Chapter 2 reviews theories and research about the conditions for educational change, and describes the study's research design in which 9 sample and 7 case study schools were selected from 67 in the district and implementation criteria designated. The school district from which the schools were chosen is examined in the third chapter which touches on merits and disadvantages of the administrative structure, the history of special education in the district, and implementation strategies employed. The next two chapters focus on  implementation factors in the elementary and secondary schools selected, with overview of each of the school's student population, administrative climate, teacher morale, and rate of referral to special education. Among findings were that high performing schools shared a commitment and ability to meet individual needs of children as well as a differentiated program structure; and that secondary schools were shown to be very limited in the special education services they offered and in the handicapped populations they served. A final chapter summarizes implementaton progress and problems in the following areas: child find/referral; provision of services in the least restrictive environment; staffings and individualized education programs; the school district; the general experience of P.L.  94-142; the federal, state, and local role; and strategies of leadership at the local level. Among the study's conclusions are that ways must be found to change grass root routines; complete federal delegation to the states of responsibility for implementing the law would be an abdication of federal responsibility; and implementation may be only indirectly, if at all, related to favorable outcomes for children.

Thirty students responded to a problem solving index on the same basis. No significant change in self esteem was revealed, although significant improvement in fluency, flexibility, and originality was noted. It was concluded that the learning episode was not sufficient to alter so stable a trait as self esteem, especially in a dual focus program (cognitive and affective), but that fluency, flexibility, and originality are modifiable outcomes under certain  conditions of enrichment programing for gifted students.

In &quot;Making Media Decisions,&quot; G. Richman explores procedures for selecting the most appropriate medium to carry the message of a given product. The fundamental questions are addressed: what is the goal; who is the audience; and what is the message. Five variables to consider are suggested--appropriateness, use, timeliness, production requirements, and cost. A second chapter, &quot;Marketing Concerns--Design to Distribution&quot; by C. Daniels, points out that marketing concerns in three areas (target audience, competition, and marketing factors) affect the planning and development of a product. Specific characteristics that can determine a product's  marketability are seen to include completeness, timeliness, audience, content appropriateness, quality, effectiveness data, format, market scope, prior dissemination, and legal status. Several available distribution channels (such as the Market Linkage Project for Special Education) are described. K. Cotton, in &quot;The Print Product--Design, Development, and Production,&quot; stresses the predevelopment importance of establishing target audience, purpose, and need. Five major formats for educational print products are discussed: awareness materials, manuals/guides, reports, student materials, and instruments and forms. &quot;The Nonprint Product--Design, Development, and Production&quot; (J. Mann and A. Murphy) looks at the initial decision about the needs and characteristics of the target audience, and  the purpose and need for the intended product. Discussed are such nonprint media formats as slides and slide tapes, filmstrips, audiotapes, and television. A final chapter, &quot;Some Guidance for the Evaluation of Dissemination Activities&quot; by C. Allen and L. Kliot, addresses the evaluation of dissemination with three major sections on the nature of and stages in dissemination, the role of evaluation in dissemination, resources for evaluation, and product development and evaluation in the context of dissemination.

Finally, findings on the cases are analyzed in terms of the provisions of the law. The executive summary outlines selected findings in terms of institutional responses to the Act, implementation of the central provisions of the Act, the least restrictive appropriate environment mandate, and parent involvement. Cited among study findings are the following: the county in which Ss live has not yet developed an adequate continuum of service at the preschool level for handicapped children; there continued to be very little coordination between service systems serving handicapped children; school districts were  generally passive in informing parents of their own and their children's rights under the Act, despite plentiful special education services; the county offered no mainstreamed public preschool options; and when there was deeper parent involvement, there was more tension between parents and professionals.

        "description":"The document contains the final report of a project to determine the factors that account for disproportionate representation of minority students in special education programs, especially programs for mentally retarded students; and to identify placement criteria for practices that do not affect minority students disproportionately. Chapter 1 looks at six potential causes of disproportionate placement of minorities in educable mentally retarded (EMR) programs: legal and administrative requirements, characteristics of students, quality of the instruction received, possible biases in the assessment process, characteristics of the home and family environment, and broader historical and cultural contexts. Chapter 2 describes characteristics of EMR students, then reviews the  historical origins of special education in America with attention to the role of the standardized intelligence test for identification and placement of mentally retarded students. A third chapter is split into two sections--one on the issues surrounding the instruments that comprise a comprehensive battery for assessing a child who is unable to learn normally in the classroom, and the other on an ideal assessment process in which the comprehensive assessment would be embedded. Chapter 4 considers the components of effective education programs for EMR students and reviews three approaches to instruction (the separate class structure, the resource room, and the teacher consultant model). A final chapter lists recommendations for improvements in special education referral, assessment, and  placement procedures and instructional practices. More than half the document is comprised of six background papers with the following titles and authors: &quot;Biological and Social Factors Contributing to Mild Mental Retardation&quot; (J. Shonkoff); &quot;Classifying Mentally Retarded Students--A Review of Placement Practices in Special Education&quot; (W. Bickel); &quot;Testing in Educational Placement--Issues and Evidence&quot; (J. Travers); &quot;Effects of Special Education Placement on Educable Mentally Retarded Children&quot; (K. Heller); &quot;Some Potential Incentives of Special Education Funding Practices&quot; (S. Magnetti); and &quot;Patterns in Special Education Placement as Revealed by the OCR Survey&quot; (J. Finn). (SB)",

A comparison of special versus regular class placement revealed significantly better social adjustment in special classes, while comparison of special versus resource classroom placement revealed no difference in overall social adjustment. Ratings by teachers and peers indicated better adjustment for students in special classes while ratings by adults other than teachers tended to indicate superior social adjustment in  regular or resource classes. Self reports of social adjustment revealed no placement differences. Policy implications included the importance of considering different perspectives on the issue of social adjustment. (Author/CL)",

Five chapters are designed to answer the following questions (sample findings in parentheses): Who should set test standards? (difficulties encountered when local school districts set standards); Who should be included in competency test programs? (legal requirements stating that decisions be made on an individual basis); What kinds of competency test should be used with handicapped students? (modification of test  administration procedures rather than development of special tests for handicapped students); When should competency tests be administered? (use as a screening test for early detection of learning problems); and What should graduation criteria be for handicapped students? (use of differential standards). (CL)",

The course was distinctive in that the instructor undertook to learn the subject along with the students. The goal of the course was that the students would learn something about Greek, about language in general and about their own native language in particular, and about the more abstract notion of \"learning about learning.\" Each person in the class, including the instructor-learner, started with an autobiographical report that included motivations and previous experience with language-learning. Class time was spent in studying the Greek language, with particular attention to the Greek alphabet, transliteration from Greek to English and vice-versa,  cognate study, and the vocabulary and grammar of the first nine lessons of the textbook used in the course. The study of grammar and syntax highlighted problems with English syntax in the critical areas of Greek case inflection and verb endings contrasted with word order in English and the English system of auxiliary verbs. While the student evaluations were not overwhelmingly positive, the course was thought to have enough value to bear repetition using a different language. (AMH)",

Until materials are developed that are specifically geared to a systematic development of communicative competence, textbooks must be adapted. This handbook is directed toward that need. It emphasizes the following points: (1) the central features of communicative proficiency and the process of communicative interaction as these relate to the specification of learning outcomes for foreign language courses; (2) the feasibility of designing academic foreign language courses to parallel this process through the application of concepts of communicative and functional-notional syllabus design; (3) a systematic approach for adapting textbooks; and (4)  illustration of the application to guide teachers in their own materials adaptation. The systematic approach to textbook-adaptation provides a step-by-step analysis of the process and includes tables linking points of grammar, meanings, and ordering for functional practice; tables on the common purposes of language use related to language skills; and a hierarchy of communicative activities. The process is illustrated by numerous examples of purposeful language activities that may be derived by attaching meanings and functions to points of grammar in basic text series.

Questions are suggested and the use to which answers can be put is outlined. A second issue is helping children adjust to a new culture. It is suggested that teachers talk to members of the ethnic group under consideration. Questions leading to examination of the similarities and differences between cultures are suggested. Next, oral fluency, reading, and writing acquisition are discussed and activities are proposed for the basic skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  Ways of fostering concept development are described and an outline of facts relating language learning to concept development, along with suggested applications is provided.

It is of particular interest to teachers, administrators, and others concerned with educating children whose first language is not English. The first chapter deals with preschool second language acquisition. It examines processes of acquiring the sound system, the meaning system, the rules for language use, the developmental stages in acquisition, and the differences between first and second language learning in preschool children. Chapter 2 treats second language acquisition in the classroom. It examines the nature of the school experience and how the language of the school differs from language used outside the classroom. Bilingual education programs in Canada and in the United States  are compared and various types of U.S. bilingual programs are discussed in order to specify the various instructional and interactional features that differentiate bilingual classrooms. The third chapter describes ways in which researchers have investigated second language acquisition. The major research areas are studies of the second language-learning process, the question of language assessment, and research on the effectiveness of bilingual education. Each chapter contains suggestions for further reading. (Author/AMH)",

These factors are fluency; flexibility; elaboration; originality; sensitivity to problems; and the ability to synthesize and analyze, to reorganize an idea, to handle complexity, and to evaluate. Creative thinking, or \"divergent production,\" is contrasted with convergent thinking, an orientation that concentrates on finding a definite or correct approach to problems. Divergent production is explored with regard to its educational implications, foreign language outcomes, communicative ability, classroom climate, and structuring teaching methods in such a way as to foster creative behaviors. This discussion  includes an informal teacher checklist on classroom climate and an interpretation of the checklist. Over 50 activities are described. These activities are grouped according to the creative thinking categories of fluency, flexibility, elaboration, and originality.

With regard to techniques for correcting oral work, there is general agreement that the approach should be positive. Within this perspective, a number of techniques are  suggested for oral correction under the headings of self-correction, peer-correction and teacher-correction.

The first section of the report deals with the question of what educators can expect to learn from studies of classroom discourse. The second section considers how the study of discourse has developed in relation to the various fields taking part in it, especially linguistics. This section reviews and critiques the literature in linguistics and discourse analysis, philosophy of language,  ethnomethodology, and interaction and cultural orientation. The third and final section considers critically the notion of language itself in relation to the notion of discourse. It suggests that the evolution of studies of language and discourse may be toward the establishment of a style of work which has special relevance to education. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"The assumed connection between ease of language learning and age has been investigated in recent years by researchers from a wide range of disciplines. With the exception of the findings of research that authentic accents are more easily acquired by children, studies seem to indicate that efficiency in language learning increases with maturation. Evidence does not indicate that there is a firm qualitative distinction to be drawn between the respective ways in which children and adults master a second language. However, much thinking of theorists in second language acquisition has been based on the assumption that children are more efficient second-language learners. Results of this theorizing are outlined under the following headings: (1) imprinting; (2)lateralization and  cerebral plasticity; (3) the thalamus theory; (4) the cognitive developmental hypothesis; and (5) affect and motivation differences between children, adolescents, and adults. It is concluded that the evidence for a general age-related deterioration in the capacity to learn a second language is scanty. Of the theories proposed, those which seem to be most consistent with the evidence are those which do not assume a sharp cut-off point for all aspects of language acquisition. (AMH)",

Both groups participated in an 8-week instructional program which consisted of three experiences: (1) a 6-week course in beginning French, (2) a 1-week training program using biofeedback instruments and autogenic techniques aimed at widespread achievement of the alpha brain wave state or pattern, and (3) a 1-week activity called &quot;instant theater&quot; in which participants performed for their peers in a series of self-expression exercises. In addition to the concentrated 1-week alpha training  session, the alpha trained group received 10 minutes of relaxation exercises daily before the instructional period. All other experiences were the same for the two groups. The untrained group received alpha training during the final week while the trained group had &quot;instant theater.&quot; Results showed no significant differences between the comparable groups on daily French tests and overall French achievement. However, there was a significant difference in dropout rates, retention, and frequency of disruptive behaviors, and attitudes and self-management skills showed marked improvement. (Author/AMH)",

        "description":"Negative journalistic opinion on bilingual education has been widespread enough to have formed the context of public opinion within which national policy on bilingual education has been set. It can be surmised that what is propelling the journalistic assault on bilingual education is the particular orientation English monolinguals have adopted toward this activity. Orientation is here used as a description of the composite of attitudes, beliefs, prejudices, and perspectives that influence thinking and behavior. What is proposed is that proponents of bilingual education must develop a well articulated positive orientation toward bilingual education to be counterposed to the negative orientation in the mass media and other arenas. Such an orientation should be based on both ideal  and reality principles, and be expressed in the interplay between and among these principles. Ideal principles suggested are: (1) &quot;e pluribus unum&quot;; (2) responsive government which would bring assistance and protection to bilingual communities; and (3) community groundedness, or grounding bilingual policies on the needs of bilingual communities from the perspective of these communities. In addition, several reality principles are suggested. These have to do with history, social status, and political power or powerlessness. (AMH)",

In the introductory material some of the literature on teaching effectiveness and coding procedures is discussed. It is noted that most educators who have been involved with classroom observation instruments divide classroom behaviors into cognitive and affective domains. The two main parts of the form described here correspond roughly with cognitive and affective behaviors. The form includes both verbal and non-verbal behaviors of both teachers and students under the headings, \"Classroom Management\" and \"Learning Environment.\" The observer is required to check the presence or absence of a  particular behavior or activity and to give examples as he or she checks. The sections of the form are described in detail, and the form designed for use with a practicum at a community college is shown in the appendix. (AMH)",

The database is updated annually to provide members with baseline reference information on the status of administrative information systems in colleges and universities. Information is based on responses from 350 CAUSE member campuses, which are described in terms of control, type, and size. Detailed findings are presented concerning administrative information systems organization, staffing, budgeting, computer hardware and communications, and software. It was found that the larger, more complex institutions were more likely to have separate administrative computing installations, even though 69 percent of responding institutions reported combined academic and administrative  installations. When detailed information about full-time-equivalent staff in each administrative information systems organization was analyzed by five major staff categories, little difference was noted regarding the distribution among the major institutions groups (management, analysts/programmers, systems programmers, operations, and clerical). Almost three-fourths of the institutions were spending between one and four percent of their total operating budget on administrative computing. Differences between public and private institutions, and between 2- and 4-year institutions are examined. Charts are presented that show the distribution of computers by the major institutional groups and by the 10 leading manufacturers. Information concerning the use of proprietary software and  administrative applications is presented. Appended materials include questionnaires, information on research methodology, a list of participating institutions, and a bibliography. (SW)",

Three steps in preparing agendas are the development of a statistical or factual overview of recent developments, the review of appropriate approaches and their relevance to the issues to be researched, and consideration of the availability and limitations of current databases. The following developments and concerns are addressed: the market for college graduates, the impact of future job prospects on enrollment, the effect of tuition levels on enrollment, and rates of return on education. It is suggested that some idea of future conditions in the job market is essential to formulating a realistic hypothesis about the propensity of students to enroll, and  that anticipated earnings are not the sole determinant of reasons why students enroll. The opportunity to compete for better jobs, not necessarily better paid, may also be a powerful incentive. Attention is directed to rates of return calculations, state appropriations for postsecondary education, the allocation of state support between institutions, managing declining enrollments, and institutional finances. It is suggested that studies of financial concerns be integrated with broader-based studies of the functions of institutions. Attention should be directed to a shift in majors chosen by undergraduates, declining graduate enrollments in the leading research universities, and lack of growth in real terms of outlays for research and development. In view of limited funds, approaches that  the National Institute of Education might take are noted. (SW)",

The study design includes: (1) trend analysis of changes in characteristics of the science-oriented freshman pool from 1971-1979; (2) a longitudinal study of the educational and occupational choices of 7,000 members of the freshman class of 1971 over an 8-year period; and (3) interviews with 30 professional women in scientific and technical fields. Four success measures were considered: planning at the time of college entry to pursue a SME major or career; earning a bachelor's degree in one of these fields; pursuing a related graduate degree; and (4) being employed in a SME-related professional field. A  longitudinal analysis of graduation with a science degree, predictors of undergraduate success, family background, and marital and parental background are presented, and a profile of the interview sample is given. Reinforcers of an orientation toward science and math are identified, such as high school advising, role models, and research exposure. Higher education decisions and experiences during undergraduate years, graduate study, and professional study are then discussed, followed by an examination of choosing and pursuing careers (developing career awareness, the labor market, work experiences, and career goals). Barriers to scientific and technical fields are considered. Among the conclusions offered are: minority women are underrepresented in careers in science and engineering;  engineering is more popular among women than science-related careers; and a strong high school background is reported among most respondents. Appendices include: CIRP Freshman Survey Form for 1971; HERI 1980 Follow-up Survey; and the interview protocol. (LC)",

The degree to which the program objectives were reached is examined. Objectives include the following: expanding opportunity for graduate education in Southwest Virginia, focusing on medical-surgical nursing and also on education, clinical specialties, and administration; developing faculty members and additional graduate educated nurses for service in the rural setting; and improving the overall  quality of nursing care in the area. Evaluation efforts were also directed to the direct instructional costs of the off-campus program, using student credit hours; and average academic degree program costs for a student. The following benefits of the program were also evaluated: personal and social economic benefits/noneconomic benefits for students, faculty, the nursing school and the University of Virginia, and the community. Negative outcomes and problems as reported by students, faculty, advisory committee members, and nursing school administrators were also determined. Among the conclusions was that the institutional and professional relationships resulting from the Outreach Program were important outcomes.

Advantages and disadvantages of the following five methods of evaluating faculty are examined: self-evaluation, student rating, administrator observation and visitation, colleague review, and evidence of student learning. It is suggested that (1) a combination of methods provides a check-and-balance system, and (2) as faculty members participate in developing an institutional evaluation system, they should aim at a balance between the institution's need for competent and productive faculty and the reasonable demands of faculty for job security and due process. Thirteen standards to ensure fair treatment or due process that may be  established through collective bargaining or other mechanisms include: an individual should receive specific, valid reasons for an adverse decision; the individual should receive prompt notice if an evaluator views his performance as deficient in some respect; and the individual should be given a reasonable length of time to correct noted deficiencies prior to the adverse decision. It is suggested that there is a need for an evaluation system to reflect the nature of the institution (e.g., 2-year and 4-year) and the actual work of each individual evaluated. Activities pertaining to teaching, scholarship, and service are outlined. Some evaluation approaches permit the faculty member to select the weights to be given to various general duties. Political aspects of evaluation design,  development, and implementation are addressed, and descriptive summaries of common evaluation methods and an annotated bibliography are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"The characteristics and attitudes of 982 incoming freshmen who attended 2-day orientation programs at the University of Maryland, College Park, were compared to those of 566 incoming freshmen and 378 transfer students who attended 1-day orientation programs. The University New Student Census (UNSC), a 78-item questionnaire consisting of demographic and attitudinal items, was administered during the 2-day freshman orientations, while a shorter version of the UNSC consisting of 20 items, was administered to participants of the 1-day orientation programs. The shorter version included five items designed to gather information from transfer students. Unlike those who attended the 2-day sessions, students who attended the 1-day orientation programs tended to come from slightly less  affluent families, planned to live off-campus, and planned to work at an off-campus job during the school year. Students also differed significantly in their reasons for deciding to go to college, for choosing the University of Maryland, College Park, in particular, and in the reasons they might foresee for withdrawing from the university. Students who attended the 1-day programs were also different in terms of the types of careers they chose and their plans after graduating from college. The average age of transfer students who attended the 1-day orientation was 22 years, and 50 percent of these students transferred from other 4-year colleges. Additional views and also characteristics of the respondents, including sex, race, and income are reviewed. (SW)",

Ratios were obtained by dividing the amount expended for a specific category, such as instruction, by that expended for total educational and general categories combined. Institutions are ranked from low to high, based on the ratio of expenditures for instruction to total educational and general expenditures. Additional information includes expenditures for instruction as a  percentage of total educational and general expenditures, by state, for public institutions as a whole and for four institutional subgroups (public and private 2- and 4-year institutions); and ranking of the states by percentages of overall expenditures for instruction relative to overall total educational and general expenditures. States ranking highest direct the highest percentages of their expenditures to instruction. Possible reasons for variations among the states along with reasons for differences in percentages of expenditures allocated to instruction, are noted. This approach of ranking states allows identification of the status of all institutions of a given type within a state relative to their counterparts in each of the other states, and may facilitate the identification of  clusters of states with similar funding or other factors. Information on the classifications of institutions and expenditures and statistical tables are appended. (SW)",

The study is the first stage of a three-stage quality control project and includes recommended corrective actions to reduce inaccuracies in the grant awards. A sample of 4,500 students were selected as representative of the 2.36 million students in the BEOG recipient population as of fall 1980. Data were collected from federal tax returns, interviews with student recipients and their parents, tax assessors' statements regarding home values, student records on file in college financial aid offices, and interviews with financial aid administrators describing the characteristics and administrative practices at their institutions. It was found that an  estimated $650 million (nearly 30 percent of all program dollars) was awarded incorrectly in 1980-1981, more than 70 percent of all program participants received incorrect awards, funds overawarded exceeded funds underawarded by more than four to one, and an estimated $352 million was awarded to 450,000 students (19 percent of all recipients) who were ineligible under 1980-1981 program requirements. The majority of this error was due to information supplied by students on the application form. Institutional procedures caused somewhat less error, and error by application processors was minimal. Recommended corrective actions are of two kinds: those that can be instituted within the scope of the current delivery system, and those that can be instituted in the context of a radical  restructuring of the system. It is suggested that students be required to prove need rather than claiming need without presenting verifying information. (SW)",

The recommendations are part of the BEOG quality control project and are based on a review of current (1980-1981) levels, distribution, and significance of error in the program and the assessment of the policy context of quality control. Analysis of the levels and kinds of error currently apparent in the program reveals that errors made by students and institutions each account for about one-half of the program error. Only a very small fraction of the total is attributable to the application processors. BEOG error is placed in perspective by considering other similar federal programs. Corrective actions  of two kinds are recommended. The first consists of mechanical actions to make marginal changes in the current delivery system. An example of such actions would be requiring stricter academic progress regulations for BEOG recipients. The second consists of major structural changes in the way grants and other federal aid are delivered to students. Recommendations are offered regarding applicant, institution, and processor, problems. The recommendations are related to the role of the Office of Student Financial Assistance and other federal agencies involved in the delivery process. In addition, the decision steps necessary before developing a structural redesign of the federal aid delivery system are addressed, along with potential outcomes of a redesign effort. A sample Basic Grant  application form for 1980-1981 is included. (SW)",

The financial aid administrator at each institution was interviewed and asked to describe the institution's BEOG processing procedure. At each institution, data from a random sample of an average of 14 financial aid records were reviewed and transcribed. In all, data were collected from 4,500 BEOG recipient records. These recipients and their parents were interviewed, asked about their general experiences in dealing with the  application process, and asked to provide documents to verify the income and household information on their application forms. In addition, data were collected from the Internal Revenue Service, tax assessors, and financial institutions as additional verification of the information that the students in the survey placed on their applications. Information is presented concerning the rationale and specific procedures used to select a statistically representative sample of institutions and students; the response rates for the survey of students and parents; institutional and student/parent field data collection; and procedures used to compile, edit, and convert the survey data to machine-readable tapes used for statistical analysis.

Twelve areas of interest that were selected for analysis from the questionnaire are as follows: age, racial background, average grade in high school, highest degree planned anywhere, reasons noted as very important in choice of college, estimated parental income, probable major field of study, student concern about financing college, political orientation, parents' work status, views on controversial issues, and future estimations regarding education, career, and marriage, Responses are broken down by  students' field of study and sex (when significant). It was found that the average entering freshman at USC for fall 1981 was: female; 18 years old; white/caucasian; a &quot;B&quot; student in high school; hopeful of achieving at least a bachelor's or master's degree; likely to have gone to college in order to find a better job; probably from a family with an annual income of between $15,000 and $50,000; intending to major in business or general studies or undecided; from a household where the mother works all or most of the time away from home; and middle-of-the-road politically.

The program involves a 6-month course of cognitive and experiential training, combined with individual and group counseling, and is followed by a 3-month paid internship in a private business. These full-time positions are worked by two women on a time-shared basis. This guide describes in detail the Goucher experience in launching the WMDP and indicates how other colleges can implement similar programs. Overall topics are as follows: project planning, staffing, developing and coordinating internships, recruiting participants, screening and  selecting participants, the training course, counseling participants, time sharing, evaluation, and cost. Activities pertaining to the internships include: researching potential internship sponsors, producing the employer-oriented brochure, making initial contacts, securing commitments for internships, drafting position profiles, and coordinating with liaisons and supervisors. Participant screening and selection involves: using the preapplication procedure, conducting screening workshops, evaluating and interviewing applicants, pairing candidates for internships, checking references, and preparing finalists for internship interviews. Since the program is not designed to offer academic credit toward an undergraduate degree, the prerequisite of at least a bachelor's degree is considered  necessary to maximize participants' chances for success in placement and future advancement.

Of 3,253 institutions surveyed, 2,350 responded. Statistical tables include the following: percent change in salary levels and numbers of full-time instructional faculty on 9-month contracts by type of institution, faculty rank, and sex for the 50 states and the District of Columbia; number and average salaries of full-time instructional faculty by academic rank of faculty member and by region, state, or other area; percent of tenured full-time instructional faculty and percent change from 1980-1981 to 1981-1982, by type of institution  and level of institutional unit, rank, and sex; women as percent of total full-time instructional faculty by academic rank and control and level of institutional unit; average fringe benefit expenditures for full-time instructional faculty by academic rank, type of institution, and benefit plan; and number and percent of institutional units of higher education responding to the survey by control, level, and enrollment size, 1981-1982. It was found that faculty salaries in the United States rose 9.2 percent for the academic year 1981-1982 over the previous year. The average salary increase was slightly higher for private institutions (9.8 percent versus 8.9 percent for public institutions). The greatest percentage increase occurred at private universities (10.5 percent), while the smallest  came at public other four-year colleges (8.6 percent). The number of full-time instructional faculty in 1981-1982 remained near the 1980-1981 levels for both public and private institutions, and women represented 27.5 percent of the total in 1981-1982.

The new eligibility criteria established by the Education Amendment of 1980 for schools seeking to compete for grants under the Title III institutional aid programs are being reconsidered. The institutional aid programs were established to assist 2- and 4-year colleges expand their enrollments and attract outside financial resources. Four amendments that have been prepared to alter the program eligibility requirements are examined by representatives of government, colleges, and educational groups. It is suggested that Congress presumably intended the eligibility factors to identify institutions that need special assistance because they  enroll large numbers of low-income students and because their ability to provide essential educational services is limited. The first two amendments would eliminate the requirement for a statistically high average student financial assistance award as a consideration for eligibility. For Part A, only Pell grants are considered; for Part B, all Title IV need-based student assistance is considered. The third amendment repeals the new formula for calculating full-time equivalent students for purposes of determining average education and general (E. &amp; G.) expenses, and the fourth amendment deals with the computation of E. &amp; G. expenses for institutional aid eligibility. The U.S. Department of Education supports the proposed amendments, without which many institutions that Congress presumably  intended to participate in Title III will not be eligible. Letters and prepared statements by various schools and organizations are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Testimonies are presented from U.S. Senate hearings on the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program (Pell grant program) for the 1982-1983 academic year. The proposed schedule is tied to an expected appropriation of $2.187 billion for Pell grants for fiscal year 1982. The administration's alternative involving no statutory changes would require a family to contribute at least 40 percent of its discretionary income to a student's education. The second alternative proposed by the administration would make major, substantive changes in the provisions of the Education Amendments of 1980. Among these are: setting the maximum Pell grant at $1,670 and 50 percent of the student's cost of attendance, as opposed to the $2,100 and 60 percent contained in the 1980 amendments for the  1982-83 school year; reinstituting home equity and stipulating that only $30,000 of home equity could be excluded from the calculation of a family's assets, as opposed to the provision in current law excluding all home equity from consideration in calculating a family's assets; reducing remaining assets from $10,000 to $8,000; allowing the Secretary of Education to establish certain cost of attendance allowances for the Pell Grant Program; treating veterans and Social Security educational benefits as part of the family contribution; and treating the income and assets of married independent students who have no dependents other than a spouse in the same manner as those of single independent students. Views of representatives of the government, colleges, and educational groups are  presented, and an application form and draft instructions for 1982-1983 federal student aid are presented. (SW)",

        "description":"To determine whether admission interviews could differentiate commitment, 456 applicants from 2 medical schools were tested on the commitment, 456 applicants from two medical schools were tested on the Defining Issues Test, which measures the amount of principled or postconventional moral reasoning. The participating institutions were two Israeli institutions: the Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, and the Ben-Gurion University. In the Defining Issues Test, the subjects are required to respond to a number of moral dilemmas, each followed by 12 moral issues relating to it. The issues are criteria for solving the dilemma and are designed to represent the various stages of moral development, according to Kohlberg's theory. Each subject rates all the issues in terms of  their importance in solving the dilemma, and rank orders the four most important ones. No difference was found between the scores of the accepted and the rejected applicants of the school using traditional scholastic admission criteria. On the other hand, a great difference was shown in the school that admits students for their personal characteristics as assessed by interviews. However, only moderate correlation was found between the test and interview scores. It is suggested that moral reasoning is a key concept in medical professional behavior and is correlated with clinical performance. A possible use of the Defining Issues Test in the student selection process is to increase the predictive value of the admission process while decreasing its cost. Possible explanations for the  difference in the response rate between admitted and rejected applicants in both institutions are offered. (SW)",

        "description":"Factors related to shifts in governance patterns of church-related private colleges were investigated through historical document analysis, interviews with 34 presidents and board members, and 59 questionnaires returned by current and past board members of 2 New Mexico institutions. Document analysis focused upon mission statements, annual reports, catalogs, press releases, newspaper articles, alumni bulletins, school newspapers, and faculty council minutes. Attention was directed to shifts in governance patterns over the past three decades (late 1940s through December 1981) for two southwestern colleges, both related to the Roman Catholic Church and operated as coeducational, 4-year undergraduate institutions. Since the 1960s, board composition of the two institutions shifted  from absolute religious domination toward a shared religious/law membership. In addition, the size of the boards increased to accommodate the demands for lay representation. The composition of the boards at both colleges reveals dramatic changes in the number of trustees, in the proportion of religious to lay members, and by the addition of students and alumni. Four major factors were involved in the shifting governance patterns: ownership, funding sources, value structures, and politics. The findings suggest that transitions in governance and control in a church-related college are influenced primarily by shifts in value orientations, while the formation of responses to these shifts is primarily a political process, dependent upon the ownership of and sources of funding for the  institution. Additional theoretical propositions regarding governance patterns and recommendations for policy development are proposed. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

The HEOP provides supportive services, including a pre-freshman summer session, credit and noncredit courses in basic skills, individual tutoring, and personal and academic counseling. Economic disadvantage is based on family income adjusted to number of household members, while academic disadvantage is defined in terms of Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores. Transfer students from other opportunity programs in the state are also considered for admission. Information is provided concerning: the SAT scores for entering HEOP freshmen 1976-1981; high school averages for entering HEOP freshmen 1976-1981;  high school averages for entering HEOP freshmen, 1975-1980; the distribution of averages for students who have completed the freshman year at NYU; the ethnic breakdown of HEOP students; the distribution by race and sex for HEOP students, 1977-1982; graduation/attrition for HEOP freshmen, 1976-1981; and a breakdown of state, federal, and institutional sources of financial aid for HEOP students. Since its inception in 1970, the HEOP at NYU has graduated more than 700 disadvantaged students. Since 1975, more than 60 percent of all HEOP students have been graduated annually, compared to a statewide HEOP annual graduation rate of 57.2 percent in 1980-1981. Of 1,422 transfer students entering in fall 1975, 800, or 56 percent, graduated within 4 years. It is suggested that in measuring program  effectiveness, attention should be directed to academic and economic eligibility criteria, personal factors that may impede student progress, academic predictors for measuring potential success, quality and use of supportive services, and reasons for program separation before graduation.

Attention is also directed to the evaluation methodology and the implications of the evaluation approaches and the results. Two major evaluation approaches were used as frameworks for program assessment: a goal-oriented approach, and a case study approach. The goal areas were: improvement of quality of leadership in rural physicians' professional and personal development; and formation of linkages between physicians in rural communities and their preceptors at host medical centers. Each fellow initially formulates goals and evaluation criteria, after which the fellow completes  monthly reports detailing progress toward goals and incidents related to the process of taking a sabbatical. The evaluator and program administrator periodically conduct site visits, and interviews are conducted with fellows, policy board members, and community references. Outcomes of the fellowship program included leadership development in community health care delivery and professional and personal renewal. It is proposed that the program can be used as a prototype for continuing education of other professionals. Appended materials include a bibliography and capsules of fellows' professional data, fellowship programs, and areas of emphasis. (SW)",

        "description":"The use of admission interview comments to predict clinical clerkship success of medical students was evaluated. Narrative comments made by admissions interviewers regarding an applicant's skills and attitudes were coded, as were narrative evaluations of these students during year III of required clerkships in pediatrics and internal medicine in regard to their clinical skills, attitudes, maturity, and overall clerkship performance. For the 88 students of the University of Arizona College of Medicine, the predictive relationship between these variables was determined using multiple regression. Interview variables accounted for 22 percent of the variance in clinical performance as measured by evaluative comments. By comparison, objective preadmission variables for the same  students accounted for 20 percent of the variance of clinical performance as measured by nationally standardized tests. The moderate correlation between these criteria suggests that they may be assessing different aspects of clinical performance, and thus require different kinds of predictors. The findings suggest that admissions interviews are useful in predicting clinical performance and that continuing the current admissions interview process is justified. Under the current selection process, admission interviewers are able to collect information that predicts clinical performance better than grade point averages and Medical College Admissions Tests do. However, the objective admissions measures best predict an objective measure of clinical knowledge. Therefore, choice of admissions  variables will depend on which performance measures are of greatest concern. (SW)",

Five areas of the strategic planning process are identified: establishing the mission, role, and scope of the institution; analyzing data on the internal operations; analyzing data on the external environment; matching institutional mission and strengths in order to capitalize on opportunities for alternative formulations of policy; and choosing the strategies that are consistent  with the institutions' values, are economically justifiable, are politically attainable, and are consistent with serving social needs. Among the most substantial modern roots of the concept of strategic planning, in chronological order of development, are the following: geopolitical theory; field theory; general system theory; transdisciplinary, management school policy studies; the concepts and technique of marketing; and the concepts of organizational effectiveness. Approaches to scanning environmental information include: tracking new ideas that appear in the higher education literature; using a cross-impact paradigm that integrates national trends, local trends, values, and institutional sectors; developing a probability-diffusion matrix for events and trends; force-field analysis;  and using value profiles.

        "description":"Major themes in the literature related to organizational communication and higher education are examined, with emphasis on the internal aspects of organizational communication in higher education. Attention is directed to the systems model and the structure, function, process, and communication patterns of higher education systems. The literature about three information problems is examined: uncertainty, timeliness and distortion, and overload. From this review, an information agenda is developed to help higher education administrators plan communication more effectively. Selected elements of organizational climate that have a particular impact on organizational communication and that have been the subject of previous investigations on educational settings are also addressed:  administrative support, aggressive and innovative faculty formal networks involving consultants or resources, and the establishment of appropriate communication links within the organization. Gathering data for effective decision making is often characterized by an information overload related to the uncertainty of the task. Although computer information support has been helpful, decision-making processes of many college and university groups are characterized by weak information bases, a wide range of communication links, and very flexible boundaries. Discrepancies in power attributed to various positions and role ambiguity of key administrators compound these problems. Communication problems related to the faculty committee system are considered, and views on applying participative  management and management-by-objective in higher education are presented.

To determine three levels of spatial ability, two standardized tests--the Spatial Visualization Test (SVT) of the Dailey Vocational Tests and part VI of the Guilford-Zimmerman Aptitude Survey--were administered to 34 students in the introductory statistics course of the educational technology graduate program at Concordia University. The high, medium, and low spatial ability subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: an instructional simulation developed according to the Brunerian learning theory and a traditional textbook approach. The two groups were administered a pretest, an  immediate posttest, a 1 week delayed posttest, and a 5 week delayed posttest. The first three tests each consisted of five problems with three questions per problem. A 2 Treatment x 3 Spatial Visualization x 3 Test Position ANOVA was performed on the raw scores for the three achievement tests, and the means and standard deviations were calculated. The Brunerian simulation was found to be significantly beneficial for low spatial ability students, and no sex differences were found in spatial ability. Findings demonstrated the usefulness of isolating the significant aptitude required for a specific learning task, as well as the relevance of Brunerian theory for instructional design. Five figures, 6 tables, and 58 references are provided. (RBF)",

The synthesizing structure employed in the instructions was a \"kinds-conceptual\" taxonomy which shows the relationship between concepts. Six versions of the instructions were employed: three with a general-to-detailed presentation sequence and three with a detailed-to-general sequence. Each set of three included a version without a synthesizer, a version with a synthesizer at the beginning, and a version with a synthesizer at the end. Statistical analysis was performed  on the test scores of the students. Though the results did not support the hypothesis that a general-to-detailed sequence is superior to a detailed-to-general sequence, an interaction between synthesizer position and the sequence of instructions was found: learning relationships are facilitated when a synthesizer is presented before detailed-to-general instructions and after general-to-detailed instructions.

The data for the study were collected between 1974 and 1977 from about 650 sixth through ninth grade students in New Jersey. Exploratory analysis of the data indicates that there are systematic differences in the impact of television viewing upon different subgroups of the student population studied. Heavy television viewing seems to do the most damage to students most likely to be high academic achievers and to students with high academic or occupational aspirations. Other factors correlated with the impact of  television on academic achievement include the level of attention paid to television by students during viewing and parental attitudes toward television viewing. In general, heavy television viewing makes a significant contribution to lower achievement scores among students who (1) have higher IQ's, (2) have higher aspirations, (3) seem to pay more attention to what they're watching, and (4) are less likely to engage in some conventional teenage behaviors.

        "description":"In order to test the strengths of radio as a learning tool for children, research was conducted in which radio and television were compared in relation to their abilities to stimulate children's imaginations and to transmit information to children. The research involved a series of studies in which children were presented with two unfamiliar stories in both a radio and a television format. Each study involved 24 boys and 24 girls, in 2 age groups: 6 1/2 to 8 and 9 to 10 1/2 years. Studies included children from middle- and working-class white and black families. For the study of imagination, both the video and audio presentations were stopped prior to the ends of the stories and children were asked to complete them. As hypothesized, radio stimulated imagination more than did  television, but this finding was most pronounced among white children. For the study of memory, children were asked to recount the story and were asked specific questions about its content. On most measures, memory was equivalent for radio and television. A reference list accompanies the text. Appendices to the report include the texts of the stories used in the studies, the scoring manual used in the studies of imagination, and the lists of questions used to measure recall. (Author/JL)",

        "description":"Opening with a discussion of the role of computer simulation in cognitive psychology, this paper proceeds to examine the major perspectives on computer simulation as a tool for theoretical research on cognitive processes. The claim that computer simulation enforces rigor in theory specification is analyzed; the use of simulation as a method for exploring or validating theories is discussed, and empirical analyses of several programs developed for hypothesis-testing are reviewed; and simulation is considered as a source of new ideas about cognitive processing mechanisms, with specific attention devoted to the Heuristic Procedure Modification (HPM) program, the Collaborative Activation-based Production System (CAPS), and the READER model. Psychological simulation languages are then  discussed, as are aspects of programming environments which facilitate simulation work. In closing, a new simulation language, the Program for Research into Self-Modifying Systems (PRISM), is described in detail. Eight figures and a 50-item reference list accompany the text.

        "description":"THINKABOUT, an ITV series for grades 5 and 6 designed to teach thinking skills, has been used in Wisconsin since 1979. The purposes of this study, conducted in spring 1981, were to identify teacher and student outcomes from using the series, ways of helping teachers to better implement THINKABOUT, means of expanding the use of THINKABOUT, and implications for the support and production of other ITV series. Fifty-eight teachers from a sample of teachers who used the series and who volunteered to be a part of the study completed a questionnaire. In addition, from each of six classes using THINKABOUT and two classes not using the series, three groups of four students each were observed as the groups worked together on four problems. The interactions among the students were recorded,  transcribed, and analyzed. THINKABOUT was well received by teachers and students. There was evidence that the series was successfully related to strengthening self-expression and facets of managing one's own learning and flexible thinking. Although thinking skills were not observed being used regularly in all groups using the series, their use appeared to be related to the time spent with follow-up classroom activities. (Author)",

The concept of appropriate technology is defined, the contrast between appropriate technology and current industrial technologies is outlined, and the institutional mechanisms in the American economy occupying the middle ground between appropriate technology and the practices of industrial technology are described. Innovation and its role in the appropriate technology context are then considered and the contrasts between appropriate technology innovation and industrial innovation are reviewed. Problems facing appropriate technology innovation are  also addressed, and an examination of the various perspectives for understanding appropriate technology innovation (i.e., research and development, social interaction, problem solving, linkage, implementation, and delivery systems) are summarized. The four major categories for research on appropriate technology are then presented and discussed: (1) national appropriate technology issues, (2) federal appropriate technology programs, (3) innovation in appropriate technology businesses, and (4) use of appropriate technology.

It was conducted as a modified Delphi process involving 45 participants representing various education and information communities and reflecting different experiences and perspectives. The results of two Delphi studies were used as a basis for further discussions at two corresponding symposiums including participants from the Delphi groups; these in turn served as forums to reach a consensus about issues, trends,  and preferred courses of action for the federal government. This report identifies those facts, trends, and recommendations of most immediate interest to federal planners which obtained a substantial consensus of opinion.

Selected findings, based on a 50% response rate, indicate that almost 80% of the graduates found employment immediately after graduation. Over two-thirds of those graduates working full-time were in positions directly related to their programs of study, and over 70% were satisfied with the job preparation they received at HCC. Of the 27 respondents enrolled at transfer institutions, 50% were pursuing full-time studies, 60% were extremely satisfied with their preparation for transfer, and 46% earned an overall grade  point average of 3.5 or better at the senior institution. Among both transfer- and career-oriented graduates, the convenient location of HCC was cited most frequently as the primary reason for attending. Over 87% of the total sample reported that they had achieved their educational goals by the time they graduated. The survey report includes extensive data tables presenting findings for graduates in transfer, occupational, and general studies programs. In a separate series of tables, findings for HCC graduates are compared with statewide data collected by other Maryland community colleges using the same instrument. The questionnaire is appended.

Chapter I discusses the different meanings of educational access and explains how different implications for public policy stem from various definitions and standards. Chapter II presents information on the extent to which community college access has been achieved in terms of fulfilled aspirations, expectations, enrollments, and student costs. In Chapter III, the limits of student access are explored in the context of financial constraints and conflicting needs, the cost and effectiveness of programs, and the effects of various policy and non-policy factors on access. Chapter IV then looks at community college  practices that influence educational access and suggests that colleges can do much to promote educational opportunities for students. Chapter V discusses the likely importance of access in the 1980s, identifying the conventional arguments for continuing various educational programs and outlining the changing emphasis of policy makers. After a summary of findings and observations in chapter VI, chapter VII presents the main conclusions and the policy implications of the report.

First, a brief overview is provided of the maturation of mission priorities and planning processes in higher education in the United States, followed by a definition of technology transfer as a means to facilitate economic development, increase productivity, and stimulate job growth. Next, several components of OTTO (a statewide network of postsecondary institutions providing small business and industry with the information, advice, and services essential to technology transfer) are described, along with other state and national efforts in the field. A strategic plan to accomplish technology  transfer and human resources development is then presented within the framework of three components: (1) research and development; (2) delivery systems; and (3) evaluation. The research and development component is examined in terms of futurism, trend analysis, high technologies, modes of technology transfer, technology assessment, entrepreneurship, and community development. The delivery systems component is considered with reference to personnel and alternative forms of the electronic delivery of education and training. The process of evaluation is presented in terms of costs, capital planning, and management of the planning process. In a brief conclusion, the future of postsecondary education is linked to the degree to which it meets social needs. (HB)",

        "description":"Market analysis can provide a mechanism for making needs assessment functional and for focusing program development on constituencies in the community that need to be served. The main goals of market analysis are to generate usable information, document needs, assign priorities, locate resources, and respond to identified needs in a systematic way. A successful market analysis involves a number of steps, which must be carefully planned and coordinated: (1) identifying associations, institutions, agencies, and other organizations that have an impact on the market being served; (2) determining which data already exist with representatives from the market; (3) designing, testing, and implementing the market analysis survey and discussing its results with participating groups; and  (4) conducting a follow-up survey to determine whether needs have been addressed and to assess the impact of changes made. At Hagerstown Junior College (HJC), market analyses have proved beneficial to program development and meeting community needs. For example, a market analysis identified the need for a program to train health care personnel, and on the basis of data gathered a degree program was approved. In another case, a program in merchandising was streamlined through an analysis of local needs. Appendices include instruments and findings relevant to two HJC market analyses. (HB)",

        "description":"This instructional guide was designed to assist educators in teaching the topics of consumer credit and consumer credit protection to secondary and postsecondary students in various economics and business courses, as well as for use in adult and community education courses. The guide contains four sections, which can be used singly or in combination. They cover: (1) an overview of consumer credit; (2) the Equal Credit Opportunity Act; (3) the Fair Credit Reporting Act; and (4) the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Through the study of these laws and topics, students learn about types of consumer credit, the pros and cons of credit use, creditworthiness, credit reporting, consumer delinquency, credit shopping, and billing errors. Each of the sections contains five or six  individual topics focusing on specific concepts or skills. These units are sequentially organized with the earlier topics presenting basic concepts and skills that provide the necessary background for the subsequent topics. In addition to directions, each section contains an introduction, key concepts and definitions of terms, an answer key, and information sheets which may serve as masters for overhead transparencies or instructional materials for students. A pretest is also included with each section to help instructors assess student knowledge and select appropriate sections and topics. The guide notes that two additional sections, truth in lending and the Fair Credit Billing Act, will be available at a later date. (AYC)",

        "description":"This report provides information on programs and developments during the 1980-81 academic year in the Institute of Study for Older Adults (ISOA) Liberal Arts program which provided more than 158 courses to over 3,600 disadvantaged elderly residents of New York City. The first section concentrates on progress towards continuing objectives--in particular towards involving students in the selection of courses of study and promoting advocacy of the learning needs of elders to educators and gerontologists. This section reveals that older students prefer academic over non-academic classes and prefer classes they select themselves over those chosen by center staff. After a discussion of the program's recognition, both locally and nationally, the success of projects undertaken in local  centers and of radio shows for the elderly are assessed. The next section evaluates the liberal arts program of ISOA and includes details of a survey of 180 adults. The survey found that ISOA students were not more satisfied with life, socially active, or involved in the community than other groups and that students reported positive changes resulting from their experience with the program. Then, efforts to extend basic education and English as a Second Language to the elderly, involving surveys, interviews, and the development of a program manual, are outlined. Finally, the effects of funding reductions on ISOA liberal arts programs are examined. Appendices include data on funding, enrollment, attendance, and completion patterns. (HB)",

        "description":"The advantages and disadvantages of presenting telecourse video programs are discussed with respect to three basic delivery modes used by Austin Community College (ACC): broadcast television, cable television, and videotapes in libraries and other public facilities. First, background information is presented about Austin, the local availability of cable television, and ACC's experiences in offering telecourses. Next, instructional considerations used in the selection of telecourses at ACC are outlined, including the college's philosophy of applying the same standards and procedures to telecourse programs as to regular on-campus programs and faculty evaluation of programs and materials. Next, the impact of each of the three delivery systems on student enrollment is assessed, the  relationship of viewing method to student age and course content is examined, and reasons students are more likely to view telecourses over broadcast television than cable television, and most likely to view programs in a library are suggested. Then, college and student costs for each type of delivery system are discussed. The viability of buying time on broadcast television is explored in relation to the size of the potential market; the potential for using cable television is related to numbers of households subscribing to the system; and the value of placing videocassettes at off-campus sites to increase enrollments is contrasted with the costs of cassette players, monitors, and tapes.

Survey responses from 6,162 students enrolled in 338 classes in 26 of the 27 colleges were analyzed to determine the relationship between the types and number of courses students completed and their ratings of their educational abilities and progress. Findings included the following: (1) students  felt most confident in their ability to read (81%), write (73%), and speak (70%) effectively; (2) the majority of the students felt they had made progress in all but one of the 14 educational objectives, with the exception being appreciation of art, music, and drama; (3) students who had completed one or more courses in each of four liberal arts areas (i.e., humanities, sciences, social sciences and mathematics) were likely to rate their abilities and progress higher than those without this background; and (4) in most instances, an increase in the number of college units completed was accompanied by an increase in students' ratings of their educational progress.

Next, the plan itself is presented, beginning with a statement of its purpose, a historical overview, legislative and educational code provisions, and  community college policies. Then, existing bilingual crosscultural programs are reviewed based on a survey of 107 community colleges. In the following section, a rationale is put forward for the continued development of bilingual crosscultural programs on the basis of demographic trends and projections. Then a structural framework is outlined, which would allow any community college student in any field to pursue a bilingual crosscultural option within their major.

Chapter I discusses the nature and value of literacy in modern society, examines the community college's role in literacy education, outlines study purposes, and gives a transactional definition of literacy which provides the underlying structure of the report. Following a brief chapter on study design and methods, chapters III and IV describe the Richfield District and Oakwood College, which were the focus of the studies, and highlight the administrative priorities and motivations that appeared to  have an impact on literacy. Chapter V considers literacy with respect to administrative tasks, such as registration, that require reading and writing skills, and with respect to student support services that promote literacy. Chapters VI through IX analyze literacy in the classroom, focusing on reading and writing operations, student motivation, instructor objectives, and the context for literacy provided by classroom events. The concluding chapter summarizes findings and discusses the study's implications for policy and research. Extensive appendices consider the background and details of study methodology and contain the survey instruments for faculty and student interviews. (Author/HB)",

First, the steps involved in the SGID process are described: (1) the initial conference between the instructor and SGID facilitator; (2) the classroom intervention in which the facilitator breaks the class into groups of five or six students and asks them what they like about the course, what they think needs improvement, and how these improvements might be achieved; (3) the feedback session between the facilitator and the instructor; (4) instructor review of SGID results with the class; and (5) a follow-up session between the facilitator and the instructor. Next, a study is  described, which was designed to assess changes in the motivation of 107 SGID participants and 92 non-SGID participants. The study revealed a significant improvement in the motivation of SGID students on 11 of 18 items on a motivation scale, and a decline in motivation for the control group on 11 items. A final discussion of study findings concludes that student motivation is positively affected by using SGID at midterm and that the process is an effective alternative to the standard end-of-term questionnaire evaluations of courses and instructors.

The system involved the use of faculty members as facilitators in conducting Small Group Instructional Diagnosis (SGID) to generate student feedback to instructors about the courses' strengths, areas needing improvement, and suggestions for bringing about these improvements. The SGID procedure involves a number of steps: contact between the facilitator and instructor; classroom intervention to ascertain student opinions; a feedback session between facilitator and instructor; instructor review of the SGID with the class; and a follow-up session between the facilitator and instructor. Following the development of the SGID process, handouts and videotapes were  produced to explain the procedure and the SGID technique was demonstrated in over 130 classes and at a number of faculty workshops. Students' responses to the technique were favorable, indicating that it was a better means of obtaining feedback than other evaluation methods. During the second year of testing, a study comparing student motivation of SGID participants and a control group showed significant improvement in motivation on 10 of 18 variables for SGID participants and none for the non-SGID group. Evaluations by workshop coordinators and instructors also indicated an overall positive response, and an external evaluation suggested that the technique may become a major mode of facilitating instructional improvement.

Some problems of these children stem from adolescent parents' own struggles with tasks unique to their stage of life. Lack of information regarding prenatal care and parenting may be more common among teen parents and may thus result in more developmental difficulties for the infant. Some infant and child problems reported are not directly the result of teen pregnancy per se but may occur as a by-product of interference with life opportunities (such as educational advancement for the mother) which have had to be terminated or limited during pregnancy and after childbirth. In addition,  the social milieu in which teenage parents usually live may affect their child's development.

Nineteen females and 21 males from 3 separate kindergarten classrooms participated in the study. Within each of the three classrooms, children were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. For both groups, the experimenter acted both from outside the play group by giving suggestions, classifications, and so on, and from within the play setting by participating as a co-player. In the experimental group only, the investigator included additional behavior intended to stimulate children's problem-solving skills. Pretest and posttest scores were obtained for each child in both groups on the Preschool Interpersonal Problem Solving Test (PIPS),  and adult play and problem-solving behavior were recorded on a scale developed by the author. Results indicated that adult intervention in children's sociodramatic play can increase generation of strategies for solving interpersonal problems. (Author/MP)",

The population consisted of 5,000 disadvantaged 4-year-olds enrolled in the program. The study provides evidence that the program had a general effect, not restricted to grade level, on the children's knowledge of verbal concepts after they left the program. A sub-study of effects of staff development activities (designed to increase continuity of children's learning experiences) gave evidence that with appropriate follow-up in the primary grades, certain effects, most notably those in the quantitative domain, may persist into the primary grades. The program was most effective for children whose  mothers had the least education. The more time parents spent participating in the program, the higher their children scored on measures of cognitive development. Children who were exposed the greatest amount of time to the program were rated higher by their teachers on task orientations, extraversion, and verbal facility. Perhaps most important of all, children who had participated in the prekindegarten program were more likely to make normal progress through the primary grades. (Author)",

Data were gathered from questionnaires administered to teachers who were unaware of the children's previous nutritional history. The results demonstrated that when compared to the matched sample of non-malnourished children, the previously malnourished children had attention deficits, reduced social skills, poorer physical appearance, and emotional instability. The behavioral deficits associated with prior malnutrition were independent of IQ and were experienced to a greater extent by boys. Socioeconomic conditions at the time of the  study contributed little to the behavioral deficits of the previously malnourished children, as compared with the large contribution of the history of early malnutrition or the conditions producing it.

Also identified are areas which need further investigation and methodological approaches most likely to increase knowledge of the programs and their effects.  Chapter 1 in this first volume of the review provides the descriptive context for the studies reviewed in subsequent chapters, first presenting a history of the enabling legislation, then providing information on the organizational structure and operations of the programs. Chapter 2 describes methods for assessing the nutritional status of children and provides information for studies of program effects.

The aim of the review of research is to provide guidance for the design of the subsequent parts of the evaluation by describing the school nutrition programs and their operations and by providing baseline information on nutritional status assessment, on the nutritional status of school-age children, on program impact, and on the correspondence between targeting of program benefits and recipients' needs. The review identifies areas that need further investigation and also identifies methodological approaches that lead to increased knowledge of the programs and their effects. Chapter 4 in this second volume of the review describes the few large and several  smaller studies which have investigated the impact of school nutrition programs. Much of this chapter is concerned with an analysis of the methodologies used in the reported studies. Chapter 5 first examines how benefits are targeted, next focusing on the correspondence between the nutritional needs of school-age children and the programs' nutritional benefits. Chapter 6 summarizes what is known and not known about the school nutrition programs, describing what kinds of research are needed. All of the studies examined are listed in the bibliography; also appended is the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (PL97-35). (RH)",

        "description":"Developmental changes in preschool children's awareness of the relative effectiveness of four nonverbal strategies in a memory-for-location task were investigated. Fifty-two preschool children (12 three-year-olds, 20 four-year-olds, and 20 five-year-olds) made paired comparison judgments as to the mnemonic effectiveness of marking, touching, looking at, or ignoring the location of a hidden toy. Stimuli in the study were black and white videotapes featuring a 6-year-old model who was presented with a memory-for-location task. The task involved remembering where an object was located when it was hidden under one of six identical cups on a turntable that was subsequently slowly rotated. Following initial demonstration of the four strategies, twelve pairs of strategies were presented  for paired comparison judgments. For each pair, the child was asked to point to the strategy that would help the model &quot;remember best.&quot; All three age groups ordered the strategies identically, judging marking as most effective, followed by touching, looking, and ignoring. There was a developmental increase in the tendency to choose the more effective strategy over the less effective. Five-year-olds were significantly less likely to choose ignoring and tended to choose the marking strategy more often than the younger children. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The traditional separation of the worlds of work and family, reflected in the sociologies of Parson and Weber, is changing due to alterations in demographic, economic, and corporate conditions. Corporate interest and involvement in providing various family support benefits to employees has recently increased. Day care is being discussed in personnel offices, at bargaining tables, and in employee lounges and corporate board rooms. Child care, in some corporate sectors such as hospitals, is viewed as a recruitment tool or as a way of reducing absenteeism and employee turnover. Whether or not the provision of child care services is always in the self-interest of corporations is an open question, since program evaluation studies rarely have been made. Corporate managers should  recognize that other kinds of supports in addition to child care may be needed by working parents, depending on the unique characteristics of the communities to be served. Employers may respond to the needs of working parents by providing services, information, and financial assistance, and by allowing employees more flexibility with schedules. The remainder of this presentation describes innovative programs set up as benefits by many different employers to meet the needs of employees in each of the four areas indicated above. In addition, suggestions are offered for making policy decisions and implementing benefits supporting employed parents. (RH)",

It is not an exhaustive outline of all considerations in the decision-making process, nor does it provide solutions to all the known pitfalls. It does, however, suggest the potential scope and complexity of the issues and the limitations of traditional data collection mechanisms, such as questionnaires and cost-benefit analyses. The thoughts presented are based on the experiences of those who have already researched, designed, and implemented management initiatives for working parents. Information has also been gleaned from national surveys of working parents and from child care consumers. The four basic components of a feasibility study for  assessing the impact of employer involvement in child care are (1) a review of management problems which the employer hopes to ameliorate, (2) an assessment of employee's child care needs and the extent to which management problems are affected by child care concerns, (3) identification of community resources and their ability to meet the needs of working parents, and (4) analysis of costs and effects of the options that could meet employees' needs and solve management problems. Guidelines for conducting activities related to each of these four components are offered, and resources that can be used in conducting a feasibility study are discussed. (RH)",

In chapter 1, technical and ethical problems in early identification of actual and potential handicapping conditions are discussed. The controversial topic of mainstreaming handicapped young children is the focus of chapter 2. In chapter 3 questions are raised about how people are &quot;socialized&quot; into parenthood, and the appropriate content and structure of parent education programs are considered. Chapter 4 deals with major issues in teacher education and certification, including identification of the requisite skills  for effective teaching, certification of child care workers, and the problem of delivering inservice training. The contexts for research and ways research affects the lives of young children are considered in chapter 5. Chapter 6 focuses on problems of interpreting research findings and on challenges of investigating children's development in such interacting contexts as the home, school, and neighborhood. Discussion in chapter 7 centers on issues of public policy, such as public versus private delivery of preschool education, federal support of day care, and the justification of continued federal support for early childhood education.

Of the variables used, i.e., time, location, sex, and race, two variables were significant on levels of aspiration time and location. Educational and occupational aspirations of the 1972 Louisiana rural seniors decreased in comparison to those of 1968. Educational aspirations of 1972 rural seniors from Louisiana were significantly lower than those of both southern region and U.S. rural seniors. In each instance, marginals showed that these differences for Louisiana rural seniors in 1972 occurred throughout the range of each respective aspirational variable and  were not confined to any single or dual categories. Educational aspirations were affected more by time and geographic location than occupational aspirations and rural white females from Louisiana consistently had higher occupational aspirations than all other students. Conclusions point to the possiblity that both communication and counseling efforts for rural youth have fallen short. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) summary tables provide information on six aspiration variables. Appended are excerpts from the research instrument and an overview of the ANOVA measurement technique.

Learning activities included: classes, clubs, town improvement efforts, recreational pursuits, workshops, 1-night presentations, or any other learning or community improvement projects which core group members decided to sponsor. In 1980 two of the six CLCs were continuing to function and two more operated on a more  intermittant basis. Chapter one, which provides a step-by-step description of how the CLC was started, also discusses the organization of core groups and learning activities. The experiences, critical issues, and continuing dilemmas of the participant/facilitator are covered in chapter two.

Arkansas natives were noted, and new migrants and returnees were identified and categorized by year of migration. Respondents were compared with respect to socio-economic and community involvement characteristics, origins and reasons for moving to Arkansas, and attitudes toward community and land use issues. These comparisons were made within the state as a whole, and within each of three destination areas in  Arkansas. Taking all migrant categories together, migrants had more education and higher incomes than Arkansas natives, and they were more likely to be white. Generally, however, migrants were more similar to the native population than different, with larger differences tending to be based on time of arrival in Arkansas. The observed pattern of migration, while perhaps not actually reinforcing the characteristics of the receiving area, at least minimized the change these patterns might bring about. (BRR)",

Section I includes those materials on rural education which provide an overview or comprehensive perspective, definitions, or demographics. Sections II-IV include materials which address major rural education issues: school organization, financing, and legislation; staff recruitment and maintenance; instruction and services. Section V  provides a listing of organizations, journals, and films which deal with rural topics. Section VI lists other resources which relate to rural topics or may be of interest to those studying rural education. The bibliographic form includes complete addresses and costs. (Author/BRR)",

Eight school districts adopted the system's concept and signed a 15 year lease agreement with WWCC. Funds were procured from the Farm Home Administration for system construction, with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation providing resources for equipment placed in each school, and for technical assistance from four universities of the West Central Wisconsin Consortium. Construction began in 1978, was completed in 1980, and includes: three microwave towers to transmit signals throughout the country; 133 miles of cable which interconnect 9 communities and 8 school  districts; a 4.6 meter Scientific Atlanta earth station antenna; intra-school dissemination (all schools have an internal distribution system compatible with the external cable system); two-way transmission capabilities for all schools (allows schools to share staff and facilities to expand educational offerings); and originating receiving equipment (furnished by the Kellogg Foundation). The system also provides opportunities for curriculum and staff development, staff inservice, programs for handicapped or gifted, as well as social services, security systems, and recreational entertainment for rural citizens.

Objectives were to: create an awareness of the unique characteristics, education needs, and barriers preventing full access to quality education for migrant secondary students; identify promising approaches to creating effective interstate secondary education programs for migrant secondary students; and develop alternative policy statements that can be used by decision makers as a foundation for creating secondary education opportunities, including interstate/district credit accrual-exchange opportunities for migrant students. Representing 28 states, the more than 197  participants included Chief State School Officers, state migrant education personnel, state and local board members and superintendents, principals, and migrant program staff. The participants collectively developed nine resolutions pertaining to: graduation requirements; state efforts in identification, recruitment, enrollment and provision of educational services; state and nationwide dissemination of information on secondary programs; implementation of appropriate testing schedules; communication of high school credit requirements; parental involvement in educational process; state commitment of resources; interagency cooperation; and coordination of state and local resources.

The first section describes differences among Hispanic subgroups, and between Hispanics and the rest of the student population, with respect to both measures of achievement (school delay, aspirations, test scores) and possible explanatory factors (language usage, socioeconomic status, immigration history). The next section presents a basic model of the educational achievement process for  Hispanics to investigate the relative importance of the basic input factor (language use and proficiency, family socioeconomic status, length of U.S. residence) as determinants of Hispanic educational attainment, and to explore whether differences in achievement profiles of Hispanic subgroups, which are previously noted, can be explained by subgroup differences in these basic input factors. Prior to presentation of the results, the HS&amp;B data, selection of samples, and other methodological aspects of the study are discussed.

Training equipment discussed includes: videotapes, microcomputers for computer-assisted instruction (CAI) or computer-managed instruction (CMI), solenoid-operated videocassette recorders coupled with computers, and the advantages of videodiscs for CAI and/or CMI. Results are reported from a 1979 survey of 400 companies which revealed that microcomputers for training could be successful and cost effective when: (1) the training problem was delineated and investigated before a computer system was advocated; (2) applications were individualized for learner needs; (3) projects were integrated with a larger  educational environment; (4) training was integrated into the work environment; and (5) training programs were interactive with the student. Also provided is a description of the Florida Title IV-A Project, which is developing staff training packages and purchasing high technology training equipment to be used to upgrade the knowledge and skills of public service workers. It was concluded (from lessons learned thus far from the Project) that agency training staff must be thoroughly convinced of the advantages of using high technology equipment for it to be successful.

The first paper provides a historical review of the founding of country schools in Western Kansas, with specific country schools (many are now historical sites) described. The second paper portrays country schools as being the heart of the rural community where potluck dinners, minstrel shows, 4-H Club meetings, literary meets, church and Sunday school, ball games and most other community activities were held. Teachers, their roles, rules, and regulations are reviewed in the third paper. The basics, reading, writing, arithmetic, and recitation, which were stressed in the country school, are presented in the fourth paper via  stories dealing with the early classrooms and instructional materials. The last paper portrays the public and parochial country school as one of the major elements in Western Kansas that helped immigrants learn American customs, history, language, and patriotism. Among the ethnic groups discussed are: American Indians, Volga-Germans (German Russians), Blacks, French, Swedes, Mennonites, and Czechoslovakians. Appended to the second paper is a list of the 104 historic site forms completed and a list of 35 oral interviewees. (AH)",

Although country schools of the late 1800's and early 1900's often sprang up before there were pupils to attend them, the surveys reveal that many early schools were 3-month subscription schools which generally did not have their own separately maintained school building. Early school buildings are shown to be dugouts, sod, log, plank, limestone block, or brick structures. The typical early country school is described as being one-story, one-room structures made of wood, having a limestone or concrete foundation, no indoor plumbing, and generally having a porch or vestibule at the entry. The survey also states these structures were painted white and about one-third of  them had a cupola-bell tower, one or two doors (to separate sexes), three to four windows which furnished light, and a pot-bellied stove which furnished heat. A description of an outdoor privy is provided along with discussion concerning wells or cisterns for the water supply, regulation school building plans, school yards, furnishings, and locations. It was found that old country schools are being preserved as historical sites, museums, or community centers. (AH)",

Teachers are characterized as being poorly trained and paid, but highly respected and serving as community role models. The schools are described as having limited curricula and even more limited resources  (often there were as many different textbooks as there were families in school), but many eighth graders were able to pass very comprehensive examinations for graduation. Although the majority of early settlers were already &quot;Americans&quot; when they reached Kansas, the schools are shown to have had considerable impact on American Indians and German Mennonite immigrants from Russia. Country Schools are identified as area social, cultural, and oftentimes religious centers. The consolidation movement is traced from 1901 and present uses of school buildings (museums, community buildings, etc.) are illustrated. (BRR)",

Each section begins with a synthesis. Part I contains two papers: one addresses past research and future directions of rural crime, criminals, and delinquents; the other looks at rural victimization in a southern state. Part II is divided into three sections: (1) law enforcement; (2) rural courts and the legal process; and (3) jails and corrections. The first section provides a perspective on rural crime and law enforcement, changing patterns in law enforcement using the county sheriff as a case study, an approach to enhancement of rural law enforcement, and a  community approach to spouse abuse. The following section provides research on rural criminal justice, models for court operations in rural areas, criminal defense in rural America, and rural pretrial services. The last section discusses: problems, people, and solutions for rural jails; a needs assessment for small jails; a national strategy for change in rural jails; a description of the Marengo County Jail Inmate Program; and the philosphy and application of group psychotherapy in regional correctional settings.

Section one identifies three broad topics which should guide the development of a science and society curriculum: the characteristics of science, the limitations of science, and the place of science in Canadian society. Recognizing the student as a consumer of science education with individual needs, section two elaborates on four fundamental issues for consideration in developing a curriculum: different kinds of knowledge  developed from science education, different roles that graduates will play in society, different ways graduates will use knowledge developed from science class, and decision-making processes used in resolving science-related social issues. The final section discusses the characteristics and limitations of science which must guide the development of a curriculum. (DC)",

The main body of the handbook (chapter 2) describes the most important components of an effective science education program: (1) school-level plan; (2) classroom implementation; (3) staffing and staff development; and (4) program support. In addition, the elements of exemplary science education programs are described in detail. Assessment questions and examples of activities are also offered. If the school's program lacks many or most of the elements of effective science education described here, it is suggested that improvements will clearly be needed. Chapter 3 reiterates questions from  chapter 2 in the form of a convenient checklist designed to be used by school-level planners conducting on-site assessments of school programs. It is assumed that the planners will be visiting science classes, talking with teachers and students, reviewing materials, and comparing what they see with the qualities of an effective program described in the handbook. The checklist serves as a record to later analyze their observations. Various resources are presented in the concluding chapter, such as California State School Resource Centers and a list of state publications. (Author/SK)",

The aim of the model is to specify explicitly how problems should be described initially in such a form as to facilitate their subsequent solution. According to the model, the process of initial problem description can be decomposed into two successive stages. The first uses general domain-independent knowledge to generate a &quot;basic description&quot; of a problem, the purpose of which is to identify explicitly the information specified and wanted in the problem, to introduce useful symbols, and to express the relevant information in various convenient symbolic representations. This basic description is then used to generate a &quot;theoretical description&quot; of the problem, that is, a deliberate redescription of the problem in  terms of special concepts provided by the domain-specific knowledge base, involving the particular entities of interest in the problem, describing these entities in terms of concepts specifically provided by the knowledge base, and exploiting the known properties of these descriptive concepts. Focusing on mechanics (physics), the knowledge needed to generate theoretical problem descriptions is discussed, followed by experimental methods for testing the prescriptive model and selected results obtained from such experiments.

Twenty-four paid volunteers (undergraduate physics students) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) model group, induced to solve problems in accordance with the full version of the proposed procedure; (2) modified-model group, induced to work with a less complicated version; and (3) a comparison group which solved problems without any external guidance. Criteria used as measures of good  problem-solving performance and major classes of errors were established and adequacy of solution was assessed with respect to these performance measures. Very explicit rules for constructing initial problem descriptions were found to lead reliably to explicit and correct descriptions of motion and interaction. In addition, these descriptions were found to facilitate achievement of correct solutions. Specific examples of typical difficulties subjects encountered during problem-solving are also discussed.

Based on results obtained from a pilot sample of 115 college students, 52 math-related tasks were selected from an initial 75-item pool. Subjects, 153 female and 109 male undergraduates, were asked to indicate their degree of confidence in their ability to successfully perform the tasks or problems or to complete the college course with a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better. As predicted, the mathematics-related self-efficacy expectations of college males were significantly stronger than were those of  college females, particularly with regard to mathematics-related college courses. Mathematics self-efficacy expectations, but not any mathematics performance index, contributed significantly to the prediction of the degree to which students selected science-based college majors, thus supporting the postulated role of cognitive mediational factors in educational and career choice behavior. The utility of the concept and measure of mathematics self-efficacy expectations for the understanding and treatment of mathematics anxiety and mathematics-avoidant behaviors is discussed.

A major innovation in the curriculum is a new 1 year graduate-level course, Advanced Mathematical Modeling, which emphasizes industrial applications of mathematics and academic-industrial interaction. The latter is accomplished in two principal ways: (1) a series of lectures by applied mathematicians from industry or government and (2) student  research projects proposed by local companies or government agencies. A volume of lecture notes generated during the project is being published (Pitman Publishing Limited) under the title &quot;Case Studies in Mathematical Modeling.&quot; Appendices include requirements for the program, lectures/topics in advanced mathematical modeling, industrial projects, table of contents for Case Studies in Mathematical Modeling, and list of presentations concerning the program.

Correlation coefficients for administrations of X and Y forms of the STAI ranged from 0.93 to 0.94. Means and standard deviations for all administrations from 1977-1981 are reported. Many students expressed interest in workshops to reduce anxiety about science and science teaching. However, when such a workshop was made available, few were able to attend because of lack of time in their schedules. Although the small  sample size (workshop participants) obviated attempts at experimental research, the results were sufficient to encourage additional systematic investigations. (Author/JN)",

A variety of new methodologies and measurement techniques were developed for examining cognitive processes in broad domains such as &quot;general mathematical problem solving.&quot; Experts were shown to perceive the &quot;deep structure&quot; of  problems where novices were misled by the &quot;surface structure.&quot; Experts have much better &quot;executive&quot; or metacognitive strategies than novices, which prevent them from squandering their problem solving resources in the way that students do. Moreover, it was shown that students'&quot;belief systems&quot; about mathematics and the way it is done often make it difficult for them to learn mathematics or to use it effectively.

Results indicated that: (1) scientists/engineers are significantly more field independent than the general population, tending to confirm characteristics thought to be associated with the field independent  personality (more analytical and less social); (2) field dependence/independence interacted with educational structure variables to affect outcomes, suggesting a need for more interaction among field dependent personalities, who like non-lecture classes, and a lack of tolerance for seminars among the highly field independent; (3) &quot;advancement&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; are more important than &quot;satisfying requirements&quot; or &quot;diversion&quot; as motivators, the major blocks to continuing education being time and course availability; (4) recitations and seminars are preferred (even by field independent subjects) over lectures; and (5) university courses are regarded as poorer than those sponsored by employers and professional associations.

However, if the meaning of the terms \"thinking critically\" or \"thinking scientifically\" is not clear, these phrases will become vacuous slogans beyond translation in teaching methods and curriculum materials. Therefore, the fundamental aspect of these terms must be embraced in the discourse of science teaching itself. Since science knowledge is growing in a way that makes it imperative for everyone to know how to handle knowledge itself, the task of getting clear about scientific thinking is imperative. Suggesting that scientific thinking (or critical thinking in science) is more than puzzle-solving and logic-wielding and avoiding a detailed philosophical and psychological treatise on the  nature of thinking, some examples of what appears to pass for thinking are presented. These examples show that conventional ways of talking about \"thinking\" in science education are inadequate to the task of showing what students have to know as base to think scientifically. The nature of scientific knowledge is then considered to build some ideas about what it means to hold scientific knowledge, the essential points illustrated with extracts from science teaching. Implications and recommendations for science instruction are considered. (Author/JN)",

In addition to assessing specific needs for various kinds of engineering education, the two surveys also examined the perceived effectiveness of current and past offerings. In designing and analyzing the questionnaire for the survey, previous questionnaires on engineering education needs were studied along with literature on questionnaire design and continuing education needs of engineers. A questionnaire was prepared, reviewed, piloted, and revised (including an appendix with responses). Some of the major conclusions  reached are as follows: (1) About two-thirds of the engineers surveyed believed that the education engineering students received would be improved by a shift toward a professional school model; (2) The colleges or universities regarded as being most effective were schools with local main campuses rather than extension campuses of in-state or out-of-state schools; (3) Live programs offered by universities at the place of employment also were considered very effective; and (4) Area employers of engineers generally were supportive of further continuing education for their professional staff and wanted more opportunities.

Specific topics discussed focus on personnel levels, continuity of on-going research, and program changes. A general description of the Directorate and its programs, tables comparing funding for fiscal years 1980-1982, highlights of budget cut impacts, data on impacts, and NSF staff opinions (including their views on the impact of cuts on the communities and objectives they serve) are provided for each Directorate. Based on first quarter fiscal year 1982 planned expenditure rates, the  programs affected most were in the following areas. All science and engineering programs would be eliminated except for graduate fellowships (Science and Engineering). Substantial cutbacks would occur in the social, economic, cognitive, and anthropological sciences (Biological, Behavioral, and Social Sciences). Reductions would take place in almost all programs of the Scientific, Technological, and International Affairs Directorate. Support to state and local governments would be sharply curtailed, and some programs such as the Appropriate Technology, University Based Innovation Centers, and State Science and Engineering Technologies program would be totally eliminated.

        "description":"Suggesting that headings provide useful cues for input/output processing, this investigation examined the utility of intact (topic outline format) and embedded (appropriately positioned within text) headings as processing aids with non-narrative text material under conditions of immediate and delayed recall. Passages were selected from biology (ecosystems) and geology (plate tectonics) textbooks. General psychology students (N=95) were randomly assigned to training or no-training groups. Results indicated that input/output training on use of headings was ineffective in comparison with students who employed their &quot;normal&quot; study methods with the headings; it was suggested that this failure to find a facilitative effect of training may have been due to the limited amount of time  students had to integrate new strategies with their existing techniques. Results also indicated that students provided with text containing headings performed significantly better than did students whose text did not contain these processing aids. In general, results supported the assumption that the presence of intact and embedded headings facilitated performance with non-narrative text, particularly at long-term delays, suggesting that these devices may be more useful as retrieval aids than as comprehension aids, particularly when students have limited prior knowledge of subject matter.

Results indicated that embedded headings improved delayed test performance. The second study focused on instructions for input (tying headings to text material) and output (using headings  as cuing devices for recalling text) processing. It was found that psychology students (N=106) assigned to groups using headings/instructions outperformed groups using headings without instructions or no headings/instructions. A discrepancy was observed between the two experiments in that the presentation of headings without instructions failed to significantly increase test scores on dependent measures (essay, outline, multiple-choice) in the second study; sensitization to headings was proposed as one possible explanation.

        "description":"Because many textbooks contain sparse headings or no headings at all, the effectiveness of having students generate their own headings while studying material from an introductory biology text was investigated. General psychology students (N=51) were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) Headings Generation, given instructions on creating a hierarchical set of headings to facilitate recall of a passage; (2) Headings Given, studied passage containing embedded headings with no instructions on headings usage; and (3) Control, received passage with no headings or instructions. Four measures (essay, outline, multiple-choice, short answer) were used to assess performance on an ecosystems passage. Results supported the expectation that the Headings Generation group would score  significantly higher than the other two groups. However, the second expectation that the Headings Group would score better than the Control group was not supported. It is suggested that the mere presence of headings in text is not necessarily sufficient to substantially facilitate processing of academic text. Instead, it appears that the learner's attention must be directed toward the processing aids, supporting the notion that having students generate their own text headings is an effective strategy for both directing students' attention to the salient topics within a passage and encouraging students to actively process the text material.

The first experiment tested whether or not knowledge schema training improves processing and recall of a passage on plate tectonics (32 college subjects served as subjects). The second experiment investigated the effectiveness of using a knowledge schema to organize the prose passage in addition to replicating and extending the results of the first experiment (88 general psychology students served as subjects). As a preliminary step, a knowledge schema specifying the categories of knowledge important to understanding a scientific theory was developed. Results of both experiments indicated that training students to use this  schema as a processing aid significantly facilitated recall performance. In addition, it was found in the second experiment that organizing the presentation sequence of major concepts of the passage according to this knowledge schema significantly improved subsequent recall in comparison to a coherent, alternate presentation sequence. It is suggested that increasing students' comprehension and recall may be accomplished by training students to use a set of specified knowledge schema relevant to a number of areas and organizing material according to this same set of knowledge schemata.

The support is placed in categories, current concerns about the supply of engineers and conditions of engineering schools are related to the support, and the changes made by the fiscal year 1982 budget are identified. It was found that 38 programs in 11 federal agencies provided more than $240 million for engineering education in 1980. About 79 percent of this was from the U.S. Department of Education's Student Financial Assistance program. None of the programs were primarily intended to support engineering education per se. Most federal funding was related to concerns about the supply of engineers. Comparatively little was related to how well the engineering schools are doing. Fiscal year 1982  funding should not substantially change the general character of federal support although funding levels for individual programs may be significantly altered.

The purpose of the ICE project was to design and test a model for improving the political/citizenship knowledge and attitudes of K-12 students by infusing citizenship education into an existing social studies curriculum. This evaluation examined the effectiveness of each of the five teacher support components of the change model (staff development, administrative support, cognitive and affective objectives, community resources, and materials) from the teacher's point of view (process evaluation). Also assessed was the impact of the curriculum change on student performance (product evaluation). Subjects consisted of 17 project and control elementary and secondary teachers, 345 secondary  students and 214 elementary students. The measurement instruments for the process evaluation included a multiple-choice instrument and questionnaires. Project and control students were pre- and posttested using the Citizenship Knowledge Test and the Opinionnaire on Political Institutions and Participation. Teacher evaluation results indicated that they made a significant gain in knowledge from staff development, objectives were very helpful, principals were somewhat supportive, and the materials were very helpful. Product evaluation indicated that the ICE Project did significantly and practically affect the political knowledge and attitudes of secondary students; however, elementary students were not significantly affected. A re-evaluation of this project indicated that the ICE project  model does significantly affect the knowledge and attitudes of elementary students. Discussion is included on conclusions, limitations, and implications. (NE)",

        "description":"The sociocultural significance of clothing and dress in Deerfield, a rural, midwestern elementary school, is examined. The underlying assumption is that clothing and dress illustrate the symbolic level of correspondence between patterns and meanings in public school life and those existing in society to which schools are linked. The first part of the paper describes student clothing and dress in preschool through grade six classrooms. Data on student clothing and dress were collected across grade levels by observing and recording clothing worn during the midyear winter semester at Deerfield. Two forms of dress were identified: those clothing items symbolizing high status (dress which is aesthetically rather than functionally oriented, multipurpose, and sex specific) and those  items symbolizing low status (clothing which is functional and utilitarian). There was an association between student grouping patterns in rooms and student dress patterns. The second part of the paper discusses the stratification functions of items of student clothing and modes of dress. Across grade levels, it was found that the \"tracked\" structure of the educational system also \"tracks\" the clothing and modes of dress symbolic of stratified social identities, statuses, and roles. The third part of the paper notes some secondary cognitive and behavioral implications of these customary items of classroom material culture. Two implications are that clothing and dress influence teacher expectations, attitudes, and behaviors, and that student status and identity have the potential to be  associated with student clothing and dress.

        "description":"Essays in this special issue of the \"Journal of Family History\" focus on the teaching of family history by using artifacts. The articles were written by the staff at Old Sturbridge Village (OSV). The first article discusses how family history is taught at OSV. Students study a real family using demographic information and artifacts such as documents, paintings, and houses. They obtain a picture of family life as they participated in activities such as spinning wool, chopping wood, and cooking over an open fire. The second article shows how photographs and paintings can be used in the classroom. Suggestions on how to analyze a photograph, how to select photographs for the classroom, and how to design teaching activities are offered. The third essay discusses the value of using the  historic house as a primary source for the study of family history. It provides activities and strategies for a study of an historic house that reveal values and lifestyles of families. The fourth essay discusses using probate inventories as a way of reconstructing aspects of the past. Salem Towne's records inventory is used as an example. The last essay discusses how political speeches, Supreme Court opinions, and foreign travelers' accounts can be used in the teaching of family history. Each essay includes an annotated bibliography.

The project involved 24 Massachusetts high school teachers in art, social studies, industrial arts, and the language arts working with project staff. The teachers attended two week-long summer courses. They learned about systems for analyzing visual information through building styles, plans, and design features, and how to interpret buildings as cultural evidence. An interdisciplinary approach was emphasized. During the school year teachers tried out different approaches to integrating the subject of architecture into their courses through examples of buildings from their communities. In over 1500 class sessions and 37 subjects--from  studio art, literature, writing and architectural drawing to U.S. and world history, psychology, and economics--teachers designed architectural lessons tailored for course material they ordinarily covered and learning objectives they had set themselves. Their application involved a range of disciplines, teaching methods, and points of view, as well as students of varying abilities and grade levels and different types of schools and communities. The first two parts of the report discuss architecture as a resource for learning. The third and major portion of the report contains basic resources--including drawings of house styles and plans, and a list of recommended books--for finding buildings and using them for classroom teaching.

The project involved 25 Massachusetts high school teachers in art, social studies, industrial arts, and the language arts working with project staff. Participating teachers attended two week-long summer courses. Then, during the school year, they integrated the subject of architecture into their courses. There are three main parts to this evaluation report. Part I, the \"Case Study,\" gives an account of two teachers' participation in the program. Part II contains interviews with eight second-year teachers. These teachers had integrated architecture into social studies, art,  language arts, and industrial arts courses. Questionnaires were sent to 15 other program participants to collaborate the findings of the interviews. The third part of the report contains teachers' responses to these questionnaires. The report concludes with a summary of findings. The results, overwhelmingly positive, indicate that the project is an outstanding example of inservice teacher education and make it clear that architecture as a teaching tool has great potential for high school instruction in general. The results suggest, however, that a basic course and some form of on-site support for ideas, materials, and feedback are necessary for a program such as this to be successful. Interview questions are appended. (RM)",

        "description":"This paper outlines a two-dimensional model of political specialization and discusses its implications for social science education. The first dimension, interest specialization, involves the choice of whether or not to devote time and resources to political affairs at all. The interest specialization process of young adults and adults was examined using data from a 1978 National Public Affairs Study and a recent national survey of adults designed by Miller and Prewitt (1979) respectively. Looking at both analyses, it appears that politics are salient to only half of the adult population and to slightly fewer young adults. The second dimension, issue specialization, involves the number of issues within the political system that any individual can follow knowledgeably at any point  in time. Data from the two national surveys indicate that most citizens who are interested in politics follow only two or three political issues, and it is on this limited set of issues that individual political behavior decisions are formed and executed. The political specialization process (the combination of interest and issue specialization) of both young adults and adults has implications for political education, including the following. Citizenship should be presented to students not as a duty and a responsibility but as an opportunity involving both costs and rewards. Citizenship should be discussed and taught in less moral terms. New courses modelled after those that are successful at the college level should be offered in high schools. (RM)",

The Advisory Council reviewed the federal sex equity activities in education in light of the Reagan administration's views regarding the federal role in education; e.g., giving the states and localities greater control over education programs and dollars. Actions recommended by the council for maintaining a federal role in providing equal educational opportunities for women are presented. The next part of the report describes the accomplishments of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in federally assisted education activities.  The Women's Educational Equity Act Program (WEEAP) is described and evaluated. Equity in vocational education is discussed. A publication presently being prepared by volunteers which will describe tried and successful solutions to sex equity problems is discussed. The remainder of the report presents the Council's contribution to the U.S. report to the United Nations and Council publications and activities. Also included is the description of a survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics to find out about evening and weekend courses leading to bachelor's degrees.

        "description":"This report describes and evaluates the effectiveness of summer workshops designed to provide high school psychology teachers with an intensive review of general scientific psychology and an opportunity to develop new curricula for use in the classroom. In general, high school psychology teachers are more oriented toward life issues and adjustment, while college teachers stress science. It was the assumption of those conducting the workshops that the successful incorporation of scientific psychology into high school courses depends not only on the teacher's exposure to scientific content but also on the teacher's ability to teach this material with comfort and satisfaction. The morning sessions of the workshops focused on psychological concepts through a combination of lectures,  discussions, and films, supplemented by informational handouts. In the afternoons, participants were involved in activities such as conditioning a rat, exploring the operation of depth perception, conducting human learning experiments, carrying out a self-defined observational study, and developing curriculum units tailored to their own needs. During the workshops, participants were surveyed weekly to see how likely it was that they would incorporate the new topics, activities, and materials into their curricula. The surveys showed the workshops to be very successful. For example, in 10 areas where workshop staff combined lectures with demonstrations and activities, the great majority of the participants reported a strong likelihood that they would incorporate these demonstrations and  activities into their own curricula. Many of the teachers borrowed materials to use the following year in their classes. It was concluded that if a more scientific curriculum is to be adapted at the secondary level, teachers must be provided with an education in academic psychology. (RM)",

Chapter I suggests ways to teach economic concepts in grades K-3. Projects include a year long unit for teaching children to become more efficient energy consumers, an \"Economics Open House\" for parents sponsored by a third-grade class and fifth-grade remedial reading students, and a \"Kentucky Kinder Crafts\" business in which kindergarten children used local resources to produce unique items to sell. Chapter II for grades 4-6 includes  projects which focus on computer assisted instruction, the construction of a miniature town, and a study of the recent Cuban refugee situation. Chapter three describes a course which uses social studies skills lessons to teach economic concepts and analysis; an economic project for educable mentally handicapped students; and a 6-week seminar on simplified modeling of a free-enterprise system. Chapter four, projects for senior high school students, includes a description of how a field trip to Old Sturbridge Village brought economic concepts to life, presents a method for teaching students to analyze economic proposals critically, and looks at how high school students in a first-year accounting class learned about economics by studying a local cheese making business. The concluding chapter  describes projects that fit into what is called an \"Open Category.\" For example, how the Minnesota community studies curriculum teaches economics is described. (RM)",

As soon as deliberations become specific, a variety of constituencies with a  variety of agendas soon discover that they may agree only in the general concern for the family. Sections five through eight describe various support systems to the family, including self-help, neighborhoods, religion, and ethnicity. Families do not live and function as isolated units, but have informal and complex relations with several networks that provide support and sustenance. Section nine deals with family policy considerations. Whether or not federal policy is too crude and clumsy an instrument for dealing with the diversity of families and their variety of needs is discussed.

Given the position of the United States as a world power, it follows that factors which affect the United States inevitably have an impact on other nations. Following an introduction there are four major sections: &quot;Europe's Civilization: A Glorious Past without a Future?&quot;, &quot;Western Security in the Coming Years,&quot;&quot;Which is the West That Will Survive?&quot; and &quot;NATO and the News Media.&quot; While conference participants showed little disposition to play down the growing military strength of the Soviet Union, its  economic and ideological shortcomings were also noted, together with the obvious capacity of NATO and, in particular, its strongest member, the United States, to contain this strength. Euro-communism was seen as a phenomenon not yet fully understood, but perhaps equally disconcerting to East and West. In the field of defense doubts were expressed about the West's will, as distinct from its capacity, to hold firm in what must be a long tug of war, with the difficulty for Western public opinion of successfully combining a true understanding of detente with the continuing support of an increasingly burdensome defense effort. Confidence was expressed that such institutions as NATO and the European community, despite their imperfections, could and should assure Western survival.  (RM)",

        "author":["Lundgren, Ulf P."],
        "description":"This paper examines educational reform and practices in Sweden from 1940 to the present. There are three major sections. The first section discusses the first generation of school reforms from 1940 up to the end of the sixties. Section two examines the second generation of school reforms which started in the late sixties and are still going on. The Swedish school reforms can be described in terms of two types of cycles: the reform cycle and the adjustment cycle. The first generation of reforms aimed at an integrated, comprehensive organization of the school system on all levels. This was the basis for the second generation of reforms, which aimed at integrating the school into the community and adjusting resources to local demands, thereby partly decentralizing the school system.  The consequence of the reforms has been that their primary ideological motive has been built mainly into the outer organization of the school system and the overall goals but has not been absorbed in the detailed syllabus. The third section of the paper looks at the newest and most exciting ideas that have emerged in Sweden during the last decade. For example, in the new curricula there has been a shift from curriculum units to a concept or thematic approach. This means that for each subject the central concepts to be mastered must be defined and the teaching must center around these concepts. (Author/RM)",

The first section provides an overview of the history of dance and religion. The first essay provides an historical review up to the Middle Ages and describes dance as a &quot;catalyst for religion&quot; during this era. Other essays discuss dance and the Catholic church during the Middle Ages, describe the gradual acceptance of dance, particularly sacred dance, up to the present time, and examine dance among the Plains Indians of America. The second section, &quot;Dance and Organized Religions,&quot; contains essays that examine the role of dance in selected religious denominations, including the Mormons, Southern Baptists, and Jewish denominations. The third section discusses the use of  dance as spiritual expression and as prayer. For example, one essay describes dance as a spiritual experience with elements of movement, form, rhythm, and meaning. One author humorously examines his return to organized religion through a physically toned and tuned body. The fourth section examines &quot;Dance in Places of Worship.&quot; For example, one essay discusses how as the dancer's training goes on, the dancer becomes aware of the perfection of God's creation. Another essay argues that out of this new technique and awareness of purpose, new forms of dance should evolve to better serve the purposes of sacred dance. (RM)",

A major purpose of the review and analysis was to form a basis for recommendations for future directions that might be taken to improve social studies. The report contains six sections. The first section provides a broad and integrative analysis of the interrelated topics of rationales, definitions, approaches, goals, and objectives of social studies. The second section, &quot;Curriculum Organization in Social Studies,&quot; describes the typical pattern of social studies programs from kindergarten through grade 12, stating that despite numerous variations that have occurred, the dominant pattern  throughout the nation is one that was established more than 60 years ago. &quot;Social Studies Curriculum Materials,&quot; the third section of the volume, describes the great extent to which students, teachers, administrators, and the public accept and rely on curriculum materials as essential aids to teaching, learning, and classroom management. Foremost among curriculum materials being used are textbooks. The topic of the fourth section is &quot;Social Studies Teachers.&quot; There is general agreement that the teacher is &quot;the central figure,&quot; the &quot;key,&quot; or &quot;the magic ingredient&quot; in the learning process. The fifth section, &quot;Instructional Practices in Social Studies,&quot; presents a detailed report on what teachers do. The last section, &quot;Barriers to Change in Social Studies,&quot; focusing on the fact that the new  social studies had relatively little impact on the schools, explores reasons for lack of change in schools.

The report contains four sections. In the first section, &quot;A Perspective on Social Roles,&quot; each of the social roles--citizen, worker, consumer, family member, friend, member of social groups, and self--is described. Also included are a justification for the approach and an explanation of how it can help alleviate the six problems and achieve the desired states identified by the project. This section concludes with a brief summary of other curriculum orientations similar to the social  roles approach and answers to questions concerning the implications of this approach for the present social studies curriculum. The second section, &quot;Using Social Roles to Organize K-12 Social Studies,&quot; shows how this framework might be used as the basis for a K-12 curriculum. A brief summary of the advantages of a social-roles approach for K-12 social studies concludes this section. &quot;Social Roles: The Main Ideas,&quot; the third section, presents a succinct, point-by-point description of the main ideas related to each of the seven social roles. Listed for each role are 10 or more main ideas that could be emphasized in the social studies curriculum. The volume concludes with &quot;Social Roles: Relating the Main Ideas to Topics and Courses,&quot; which illustrates how social roles can be used as a basis  for refocusing existing secondary social studies courses.

        "description":"A comprehensive, international program is proposed to help nations optimize and conserve natural resources. The aim of the program is to increase the overall supply of natural resources available to improve the chances for world peace. The energy and material resources of the world are finite. We must live with and adapt to the concept of finite resources distributed inequitably around the globe. Given these limitations and given the growing demands of the developing and developed nations for energy and material resources, it has become increasingly evident that the availability of and accessibility to resources are crucial factors in determining the harmony, or lack of it, among nations of the world. Middle Eastern domination of oil supplies, Central African domination of cobalt  and precious metals, and Southern African domination of cobalt, chromium, and precious metals are three leading examples of limited resource availability that have created sizable tensions and political frictions. This situation is made more serious by strong inflationary pressures, the growing inequity of incomes, and the growing use of resources as political weapons. In discussing conservation as a force for peace, the author recommends three basic resource optimization strategies. We should make and use fewer resource products; make and use simpler, more efficient alternative processes and products; and recycle the raw material and energy content of waste resource products. Efforts at resource optimization to date are examined. (RM)",

        "description":"Two international diplomats from the Soviet Union and the United States focus on the need for a treaty to ban the use of radiological weapons. Radiological weapons are those based on the natural decay of nuclear material such as waste from military or civilian nuclear reactors. Such devices include both weapons and equipment, other than a nuclear explosive, designed to cause destruction or injury by dissemination of radioactive material. They are generally considered one of many so-called &quot;weapons of mass destruction.&quot; As yet undeveloped, radiological weapons have been the subject of investigation both in the Soviet Union and in the United States and could conceivably be perfected for military use in the future. It was with this possibility in mind that the United States and the  Soviet Union proposed in 1979 a joint draft of a Radiological Weapons Treaty to the Geneva-based Committee on Disarmament. A Radiological Weapons Treaty would be a modest achievement at best. However, under the current circumstances of heightened cold war rhetoric and mushrooming military budgets of the two superpowers even a modest agreement to ban a potentially highly destructive new weapons system assumes an added significance. It suggests the two major nuclear-weapon states have concluded that arms limitation progress must proceed and that more substantive agreements may be possible in the future. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This paper examines the effects of schooling on political socialization and presents a theoretical perspective on the learning of civic norms which will provide insight into both the limits of schools' current efforts at instilling civic norms and the potentialities of new approaches. Norms are defined as personally binding conceptions of right conduct. Civic norms refer to norms on political as well as moral and social questions. A review of research establishes two important points. First, the social studies curriculum, especially with respect to the development of political and moral attitudes, is failing to have any noticeable impact on students' acquisition of norms. Second, the teacher and classroom climate have the potential to be significant influences in the learning of  civic norms. This pattern of findings indicates that the forces which influence the learning of civic norms center around the social, interpersonal interactions in schools and the resulting school climate. An interpretation of this phenomena is offered based on the legal socialization perspective of Hogan and Mills which acknowledges the social basis of civic learning. It is suggested that current approaches to civic and moral education place too much emphasis on student reasoning. The social dynamics involved in the acquisition of social norms, which involve nonrational factors, are largely absent in social studies theory and curriculum. Suggestions for curricular reform based on the Hogan and Mills framework are presented. For example, teacher education programs should sensitize  prospective teachers to the attributes to which children selectively attend which result in the perception that the teacher is worthy of respect and credible.

        "description":"Worldwide economic productivity is examined in this paper. There are seven major sections. Section 1 is an introduction which discusses how as the seventies came to a close without producing a strong and sustained recovery from global economic recession, the spotlight of public concern focused on the problem of productivity. Trends which have affected productivity are discussed and ways of measuring productivity are examined. Section 2 discusses why productivity is important. Higher productivity is a mechanism for improving the material quality of life. A rise in output per hour of work can finance increases in income, help restrain inflation, and enhance the competitiveness of products in the international market place. Structural shifts in the economy are the focus of the third  section. For national economies, the major cause of higher productivity has been structural change, the wholesale movement of workers out of less productive sectors of the economy into more productive ones. The fourth section examines changing relationships among the factors of production. At the root of the current crisis in labor productivity is an abrupt change in the relative prices of the factors of production. Productivity and employment are the topic of section 5. The major impact of microelectronics on labor productivity and hence on jobs is examined. Section 6 discusses distributing the gains from higher productivity. Examined are the ideas of a guaranteed income, labor displacement because of automation, shorter work weeks, longer vacation time, and early retirement. The  concluding section looks at &quot;The Productivity Prospect.&quot; (RM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to suggest some reasons why feelings are important to study as a part of K-12 social studies and to suggest a few ways this might be done. Reasons why feelings should be taught include the following. Knowledge of how people feel in various situations, as well as knowledge of the forces and factors which bring such feelings about, can help students understand the real world and how it works. If we want to help students understand the actions, beliefs, and values of people as fully as they can, we need to help them understand as much as possible about what causes people to act as they do, believe what they do, and hold the values they do. In addition, an understanding of how people feel in different types of situations is also crucial to moral  development. Specific objectives which the explicit study of feelings can help social studies teachers attain are listed. The second part of the paper describes and provides examples of two types of activities which will help students study the feelings of people. First students should be involved in various types of experiences likely to produce an emotional reaction on their part. This experience should be followed up by discussions with them as to how they felt during and after participating in the experience. For example, the students might visit a nursing home and talk with the residents. The second type of activity would engage students in discussions of what they would do in various sorts of emotion-laden situations, how they think other people placed in such situations might feel,  and what they think might be the possible consequences of various actions on other people.

        "description":"Recertification of teachers, in other subject areas or for other grade levels, can become an important response to the oversupply of teachers in certain subject areas. By successfully completing a formal training program in a different subject area, teachers certified in one specialty can be licensed to teach in another, leading to the possibility of multicertification and a new concept of what a teacher ought to be. However, questions on the applicability and morality of recertification abound and must be addressed. If it becomes increasingly likely that teachers will be required to be competent in more than one discipline, a new look at what is known about the structure of subject matter and learning is required. Criteria for selecting teachers to be retrained should be  considered, as well as the characteristics of retraining programs. In urban areas, recertification can help alleviate the &quot;last hired&quot; syndrome and provide answers for mid-career rejuvenation. Several arguments can be raised against recertification, such as the question of its effects on recruitment of new teachers and the principle of maintaining a natural supply and demand job market.

Part One of the report starts with a review of the background of organized international health activities and the birth of WHO. The structure and functions of WHO are described along with the administrative evolution of activities  related to the education of health personnel and the development of health manpower. Part Two discusses the development of HMD activities under the state priorities of WHO: (1) greater supplies of conventional health personnel; (2) improved personnel standards and academic excellence; (3) international standards and migratory freedom; (4) health personnel to serve all people; (5) efficient training and performance of health personnel; (6) preparation for future requirements; (7) training of appropriate personnel for local health needs; and (8) health service needs determining manpower developments. Part Three examines all HMD activities as observed in six countries (Ethiopia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Gabon, Costa Rica, Barbados). A description of overall world trends in HMD is presented with  an analysis of the extent of the relationship between health manpower resources and the health status of the national population. The estimated impact of WHO on national health manpower developments is assessed. Part Four summarizes the findings reported in the previous chapters. (JD)",

        "description":"An active staffing process used by teacher center personnel was investigated as a method of improving teacher center operations and of helping users of teacher centers. Through a preliminary survey of users' attitudes toward teacher centers, three expectations were formulated: (1) Many initial requests in the active staffing process would center around a request for materials; (2) Teachers could easily be referred to other teachers for exchanges of ideas; and (3) Teachers would tend to see staff members as supervisors rather than as peers. One staff member was trained in active staffing techniques, which included developing a problem-solving relationship with the user and concentrating on multifaceted, long-range concerns of the user. By building on the user's knowledge and  experience, the staff member and user were able to identify the concern, work through the issue together, and maintain contact for future developments. After training, the staff member worked with six experienced teachers who had been reassigned to unfamiliar teaching situations and with three beginning teachers. Data on the active staffing process and teachers' attitudes were collected from logs kept by the staff member and through post-study interviews with eight of the participating teachers. A comparison of pre- and post-study interviews revealed that teachers' perceptions of the consulting service showed a marked rise, and that needs in other curricular areas, such as lesson plans, became priorities. From teachers' comments, it was concluded that the active staffing process helped  six of the eight teachers interviewed. (FG)",

        "description":"The reflections of two social scientists regarding an inservice education program for elementary school teachers were the basis of their approach to inservice programs: Teachers need to have analytical and inquiry skills that will allow them to read research reports and listen to inservice presentations, digest the information, and then apply what seems useful to them in their particular situations. When an elementary school was about to undergo a transition from a traditional, self-contained classroom structure to an open-concept school, where teachers worked in teams, a summer workshop was developed to teach needed analytical and inquiry skills to teachers. The development of certain skills would benefit the teachers: (1) journal keeping; (2) ability to reflect on one's own  performance; and (3) an ability to observe the actions of others and gain understanding of those actions from the perspective of the participants. A 2-week workshop was designed and implemented through day-by-day schedules. While the participants at first had difficulty in accepting the concept that development of inquiry skills would be valuable in a team-teaching situation, the master plan of the workshop eventually became apparent to them. Follow-up studies in the fall, however, revealed that, because of the organizational structure of the school and lack of time, teachers had little opportunity to utilize all the skills they had learned. The inservice workshop was successful in changing some teachers' beliefs about teaching. However, it was not successful in that it did not deal with  the problems faced by the teacher in implementing these changes, given the constraints imposed by the ways schools are organized. (JD)",

Research has demonstrated that students' numerical judgments of the strength of relatedness among ideas drawn from a domain provide insights into how they have organized their knowledge of that domain. When these judgments are analyzed through multidimensional scaling, a graphic array can be generated in which highly related ideas are grouped together and less related ideas are located farther apart. These graphic arrays are called &quot;cognitive maps&quot; because they map out a student's understanding of the structural interrelationships that exist among ideas. The use of multidimensional scaling-produced  cognitive maps provides a systematic way of presenting structural knowledge which, because of the sequential nature of traditional lectures and texts, might not otherwise be presented at all.

        "description":"Research findings on teachers' perspectives on teaching tend to indicate that institutional pressures are not strong enough to control what teachers think and how they act within their classrooms. While teachers will conform to organizational demands, their basic teaching styles are likely to remain unchanged. This study explored the socializing effects of the student teaching experience on the perspectives on teaching of 13 student teachers. Before the start of their student teaching, the subjects responded to the Teacher Belief Inventory (TBI). The TBI was developed to assess teacher beliefs related to six specific categories: (1) teacher role: passive-active; (2) teacher-pupil relationship: custodial-humanistic; (3) knowledge and curriculum: strong frame-weak frame; (4)  student diversity: negative-positive; (5) the role of the community in school affairs: passive-active; and (6) the role of the school in society: reproductive-transformative. Responses in each of these areas provided a profile of teacher beliefs that comprised the individual's perspectives on teaching. In addition to completing the TBI, each student teacher was interviewed at least five times between January and May, 1981, and observed while teaching at least three times. Interviews were also held with pupils, cooperating teachers, and supervisors to discover developments of perspectives of the student teachers, any observed changes, and influences that might induce change. Resulting data indicated that student teaching did not result in an homogenization of student teacher perspectives.  Students came into the experience with different perspectives on teaching and significant differences among them remained at the end of the semester. Little evidence was found of passive response to institutional forces. It should be noted, however, that the subjects of this study selected the schools in which they did their student teaching and, in this selection, naturally chose positions in schools most reflecting their own perspectives.

Recent research on these elements are cited and discussed in the context of a well-organized and well-managed classroom and the distinguishing differences between effective and ineffective teachers.

During interviews, 98 elementary school teachers described general strategies to twelve types of problem students: (1) failure syndrome; (2) perfectionist; (3) underachiever; (4) low achiever; (5) hostile aggressive; (6) defiant; (7) passive-aggressive; (8) hyperactive; (9) easily distracted; (10) immature; (11) shy/withdrawn; and (12) rejected by peers. Teachers also discussed specific responses they would make to typical classroom events in which the twelve problems occurred. It was found that teachers whose role definitions stressed general student socialization (rather than a more narrow emphasis on instructing students in the curriculum) made  greater efforts to help problem students and were more willing to make allowances for them. Data also indicated that teachers' responses to problem students were affected by causal attributions, teacher-versus-student ownership of problems, and by more specific motives arising from the impact of the students' behavior on teachers' needs, emotions, and values. In dealing specifically with hostile-aggressive students, teachers were found to react differently according to their motivation: (1) by personal concern for these students; (2) by a sense of personal responsibility to prevent students from developing into violent or criminal adults; (3) by survival concerns; and (4) by personal anger or irritation with hostile-aggressive students.

Although it combines interdependent and interrelated curricular components, IGE is a flexible system that has had many local variations since its inception. However, IGE goals of shared decision making, instructional programming, and continuous progress have remained common to IGE practice.

Many of these changes seem to follow a regular developmental pattern from which three stages can be discerned. Stage I is the survival stage, during which beginning teachers are concerned about their skill in maintaining classroom control, teaching content areas, and in continuing to develop their teaching abilities. Teachers at Stage II, during the second, third, and fourth years of teaching experience, adjust to the teaching situation and gain confidence in handling most classroom situations. These teachers are more likely to be able to assess their own needs and seek assistance. In the third stage, after five years of  teaching experience, teachers reach a professional maturity and are skilled in a variety of techniques. They are more committed to their careers at this stage. Studies have shown that: (1) The first four years of teaching is the primary time of job skills acquisition; (2) By the third stage, most teachers change their techniques rather than their philosophy of teaching; and (3) Stages of professional development have a significant effect on personal development. Appended is a table showing a matrix of the three stages and the changes in professional characteristics experienced at each stage. (FG)",

Selected studies in educational research are analyzed and grouped into four areas. The first research design considered is the traditional empirical-analytic, or hypothesis testing paradigm, through which studies are conducted to test the truthfulness or accuracy of predetermined hypotheses. The second research design is hypothesis generating, focusing on the meanings behind events and situations. Alternative uses of this design are presented in the areas of anthropology and ethnography. A combination of these two methods form the third research approach, which is used in many of the research reports that were reviewed. Researchers' recommendations for future directions and  implications for research in teaching and learning are explored in the fourth category of research. A chart synthesizes and compares hypothesis generating and hypothesis testing research designs. A list of over 100 references is appended. (FG)",

        "description":"Teachers have different job skills, knowledge, behaviors, attitudes, and concerns at different points in their careers. A number of these characteristics follow a regular developmental pattern. Three stages of teacher career development have been identified, with different developmental characteristics at each stage. In the survival stage, which occurs during the first year of teaching, the major concern of the teacher is meeting professional responsibilities and adjusting to the school environment. The second, third, and fourth years of teaching are years of adjustment, growth in classroom techniques, and increasing confidence. At the mature stage, from the fifth year on, most teachers feel professionally secure. School administrators can help teachers meet the stresses in each  of these developmental stages in many ways. The confusion and uncertainty of the first stage can be allayed by direct supervisory assistance, with the supervisor assuming primary responsibility in helping the teacher. A collaborative supervisory approach is appropriate at the adjustment stage, with the supervisor and teacher taking equal responsibility for meeting the teacher's needs. Stress which teachers experience in the mature stage of teaching appears to center on the teachers' ability to keep teaching interesting for themselves and to meet changing educational expectations. A nondirective supervisory approach is appropriate at this stage. The supervisor listens, encourages, clarifies, presents, and helps to solve problems, while the teacher assumes the primary responsibility for  improving instruction through self assessment. (JD)",

The Leadership Training Model was developed by the Edgewood Independent School District/Trinity University (Texas) Teacher Corps Project as a response to the need for training teachers to be leaders in professional development. The Leadershp Training Model involves the formation of a Professional Development Committee (in each school), which consists of the instructional support teacher, the principal, counselors, other teachers, paraprofessionals, parents, and students. This committee is responsible for designing and conducting a professional  development program specifically tailored to the school and for creating a school climate program. One outstanding teacher is selected to act as instructional support teacher and is freed from all other teaching duties. Chapters in this manual present workshops for the instructional support teachers on: (1) professional development; (2) consultation skills; (3) group facilitation; (4) leadership skills; (5) clinical supervision; and (6) workshop design.

Interpretation of the data resulted in an exploration of: (1) interactions between teachers' personal and professional lives; (2) difficulties in separating personal and professional lives; and (3) tensions stemming from their jobs. Findings indicated that teachers' personal and professional lives inevitably affected each other. Most teachers reported that their personal lives affected their teaching, usually in a positive and supportive manner. However, some conditions in the professional environment produced negative  effects on teachers' personal lives, leading them to try to separate their personal and professional lives as much as possible. Teachers in their early years of service were less able to separate their personal and professional lives than were more experienced teachers. Most teachers mentioned sources of tension throughout their careers. Beginning teachers reported that stress from their jobs had an adverse impact on their personal lives, mainly due to over-commitment to work. More experienced teachers indicated that tension in their professional lives was relieved by relaxing activities in their personal lives. (JD)",

        "description":"The general hypothesis of this study was that college students, according to their perception of the amount of learning achieved in a class, will judge the quality of the interpersonal relationships between them and their teachers differently. Specifically, the hypotheses tested were that (1) students in \"learn-most\" classes would perceive themselves as receiving from their teacher more regard as individuals, more empathetic understanding, more acceptance of themselves as unique individuals, and more feelings of being totally themselves, than would students in \"learn-least\" classes; and (2) There would be differences between the \"learn-most\" and \"learn-least\" students on the basis of sex, grade received, subject, level of course, and student year. The instrument employed to  obtain a measure of interpersonal relationships was the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (1962). One hundred eighteen college students, randomly assigned to two groups, completed the inventory. One group responded with their perceptions of the teacher from whom they learned the most, and the other group responded with their perceptions of the teacher from whom they learned the least. Findings tended to substantiate the general hypothesis. \"Learn most\" students judged the quality of their interpersonal relationships with their teachers more positively than did \"learn least\" students. The second hypothesis was not proved. The implications of the findings are that teacher education programs should emphasize the ability to develop positive interpersonal relationships with students  rather than methods and materials.

        "description":"Part of a 1968 commencement address by John W. Gardner is used in this paper as a foundation for explaining the status of teacher education and as a background for proposals on six teacher education issues. In Gardner's speech, an imaginary view of what scholars, living in an authoritarian society of the twenty-third century, will think of twentieth century society, is presented. These \"scholars\" blamed unrestricted efforts to change societal institutions for the collapse of twentieth century civilization. The observations of the \"scholars\" were that twentieth century institutions were designed to obstruct change and were not capable of continuous renewal, and that they faced a continuous crossfire between uncritical supporters and nonsupportive critics. These points are used to  illustrate the problems faced in teacher education, particularly in regard to maintaining inflexible positions on current issues. Six issues are described in which teacher educators are urged to take a proactive position: (1) accreditation of teacher education institutions; (2) competency assessment of teachers; (3) extended 5-year programs; (4) selective admission standards to teacher education programs; (5) teacher supply and demand; and (6) governance and collaboration between the training institutions and the practicing profession. The summary acknowledges the bleak outlook presented in the paper, but stresses the importance of proactive criticism through professional organizations. (FG)",

Ethnography and evaluation differ in determination of problems addressed by the researcher. Ethnographers are interested in slow cultural change, while evaluators address policy questions requiring immediate answers. The micro-ethnographic evaluation limits the scope of the study to the school, viewed as a subculture. The resultant data is limited to the perception of a small number of participants. The macro-ethnographic evaluation considers school interaction as interrelated with other cultural subsystems. The process of enculturation occurs as part of the curriculum. The advantages and disadvantages of micro-and macro-ethnographic evaluations are  outlined. The ethnographic approach to evaluation reduces the cultural bias of evaluators, thus making it appropriate in explaining programs for minorities. Another advantage of this approach is eliminating the necessity for a control group. It does not require statistical methods, thus making evaluation reports more easily understandable. The cultural suitability of the educational program is assessed through a macro-ethnographic evaluation. Ethnographic evaluations are appropriate when a comprehensive understanding of the program and its relationship to society is the major factor in judging program quality. (DWH)",

Rates of exposure to industrial arts and commercial courses exhibited large sex differences and small racial differences. Both white and female advantages in exposure were due to differences in rates at which groups initiated course taking. Program differences in academic instruction were large and varied considerably across groups. The findings concerning allocation of vocational instructional resources were that pupils enrolled in non-vocational programs received more of vocational instruction resources than students enrolled in vocational programs. Females received more  vocational instruction resources than males. It appeared black pupils received more vocational resources in academic programs, but less in vocational or general curricula. High school course track membership was found to be the major factor influencing a pupil's academic preparation for subsequent schooling and employment. This study concluded profound track-induced barriers to post-secondary access are built up due to the strong variation in course exposure over tracks. This occurred regardless of the ultimate aspirations of the students. (DWH)",

Clarification of basic entities to be studied was a critical step in research planning. Classroom observers usually study instructional arrangements and other classroom phenomena. The author used activity structure and its component activity segments as the focus for study. An activity segment was defined as a unique time block in a lesson which occured in a fixed physical setting. Segments have instructional forms designed for the accomplishment of specific tasks. Daily activities in a classroom conform with the general type of curricular approach and goals. Activity structures are produced to accomplish certain goals. When observational data is characterized by distributions which are  bimodal or have many zeroes or non-occurences, summary with means and standard deviations may result in erroneous conclusions. The author observed 20 fifth-grade math classes from diverse school districts. He determined that combining data within two clusters, highly individualized and whole class programs, provided more meaningful and interpretable results. Researchers and writers need to include background descriptive information about the programs and contexts which they have studied to facilitate sorting of data. (DWH)",

Research and development (R and D) is a sequential, changing process. The formulation of standards and criteria is a function of the stage of development and type of technology. The criteria should be generalizable and evaluation measurements and methodologies should be appropriate for that technology at a given stage of development. The evaluation of large R and D programs must begin to include institutional factors, i.e. the political element. The evaluator should include institutional considerations into a set of formal evaluation approaches. Technology typologies must be constructed to be suitable for comparison with present and future  alternative options. The early metaevaluation tasks concerning the evaluation of social implications of technologies currently in planning and R and D stages include specifying concrete areas for inquiry, rather than a premature holistic approach. A long term research plan should be structured so that progress can be directed, accumulated, and measured. The third task might be the systematic institutionalization of multidisciplinary research across technology issue-areas, skills, and capabilities which will be in great demand. (DWH)",

It provides the principal with an agenda for assessing program needs and determining appropriate responses to improve a schools' writing program.

Methods to stabilize rating criteria and readers' application of them are necessary. Most writing assessment programs use guidelines from norm-referenced test methodology. Use of this method of criteria application based on ranking within-occasion endangers or precludes between-occasion uniformity. Judgment stability within a session and across sessions are other problems of measurement. The instability of ratings has been a major weakness of writing skills measures. Two indicators of rating variability are discussed. Rater drift is the rater's progressive deviation within a scoring session from previously shared criteria. Scale instability is the differential  application of criteria by raters in different scoring sessions. During scale development and validation, assessments should collect separate ratings on component text features that comprise a total score. Rating methods should intersperse periodic checks. Frequency of checks and nature of feedback on scoring accuracy are important. Sound writing assessment requires scale stability. (Author/DWH)",

Appropriate preparation activity was defined as that which contributes to students' performance on the test near their true achievement levels, and which contributes more to their scores than would an equal amount of regular classroom instruction. The program concentrated on basic testwiseness skills, as advanced tactics often required more skill than the skill being measured by the test item. Research showed that test practice was beneficial if done once, near the time of the actual test. Skills taught to all  students included: following directions, understanding item formats, understanding a test's terminology, symbols and procedures, using time wisely, checking answers, marking answers properly, knowing how to ask questions about the test, being physically ready to take the test, and thinking logically. The attached materials for preparing students (and teachers) for standardized tests include: Guidelines for Test Administrators, Packets for the Preparation of Students for Standardized Testing, All-Purpose Answer Sheet, and Explanation and Examples of Testwiseness Cues.

The Spanish or English versions of the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS) were administered to 1259 students in 81 second, third, fifth and sixth grade classrooms in 5 California school districts. Statistical and content analysis provided evidence of three possible sources of bias: problems inherent in translation, the match between the test and instructional material, and intervening cultural values. Dual language tests also raise the question of whether, and how, standard achievement tests can match the wide variety of curricula used by  American schools. Further empirical studies are necessary to isolate the cause of bias for individual test items, whether in the CTBS or any other test. Studies providing more information concerning biases stemming from cultural interference and curricular match are needed in order to develop a methodology beyond the statistical approaches now available.

A test administered in two languages to children selected for their language facility provides a special arena for the study of these problems. The Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS) was selected because the test content between the English and Spanish language versions is similar in rationale, administration, and interpretation; the differences that exist between the language versions are the result of literal translation problems. Evidence based on performance of English- and Spanish-speaking pupils suggests that the CTBS contains multiple sources of bias. The vocabulary subtest of the CTBS was administered to 1162 second-graders in bilingual education  programs in the Southwest; 58 students received both test versions because the students were equally proficient in both languages. Results show that patterns of performance for these students differ markedly between the two language versions, supporting the contention that the method of direct translation from English to Spanish for bilingual vocabulary testing may not be fully adequate for the needs of the bilingual program student, even when the Spanish version is a rather faithful translation of the English original.

Ten equatings were completed for pairs of alternate forms of the Advanced Placement Program, which measures different content areas and traits in each subject area. It was found that despite the apparent violation of the unidimensionality assumption, the equating results obtained through the IRT equating model were found to be in agreement with those of the conventional equating models. By demonstrating that the IRT equating results parallel those of the simpler, less costly, conventional methods, it has  been shown that it is still possible to equate scores on non-parallel tests under conditions which make conventional equating inapplicable.

Program evaluation is needed to provide information for making program as well as policy-making decisions. The results of a national survey, which examined current vs. perceived-ideal procedures for determining program evaluation budgets, implied that educational evaluators need to increase their efforts to communicate evaluation results and encourage educational leaders to use these results. The Task Force recommends the adoption of a common definition of program evaluation; that  requests for evaluations be accompanied by a statement of the use to which the evaluations will be put; and, that appropriate funding levels for conducting evaluations be set using a sliding scale.

The present study provides an analysis of the relationships among TOEFL and GMAT total scores and subscores for a large sample of foreign GMAT candidates. The sample included GMAT candidate files from September 1977 to August 1979 of candidates (1) who were not United States citizens; (2) whose language of greatest fluency was not English; and (3) who had taken TOEFL between 1977 and 1979. Scatterpoints were generated for samples of candidates for each of the  least-squares regression analyses. The results suggest that the apparent &quot;discrepancies&quot; between TOEFL scores and GMAT verbal scores are, because of differences in score scales, norming populations, intended purposes, and levels of difficulty, to be expected. The relationships (and &quot;discrepancies&quot;) between TOEFL and GMAT scores are relatively similar for candidates from several countries. (Author/PN)",

Conclusions drawn from the survey results were that Iowa high schools are generally satisfied with ITED testing programs. There were indications that student motivation for taking tests could be better. It is believed that a major factor influencing student motivation is the attitude of teachers toward the tests. Testing directors who would like their teachers to have a more positive attitude toward testing should  consider adopting a method to distribute ITED scores to teachers as soon as scores become available, providing help to the teachers in the interpretation and use of scores, and informing teachers regarding the administrators' and counselors' use of test scores.

        "description":"Through an extensive nomination process, six school districts which were trying to link their testing and evaluation activities with instruction were identified. Interviews with these districts were conducted over a 2-year period; the results dealing with the dissemination and use of testing for instructional change are presented here. Three conditions that were present in all six districts, and which appear to be necessary for a data-based instructional change management strategy, are: (1) the presence of some strong impetus or collection of incentives; (2) the presence of \"idea champions\" who have interest in both tests and instructional improvement; and (3) coordination within the central office and communication channels between the central office and the schools. Three  different management strategies were used by these districts: a personnel-improvement-orientation staff development strategy, a building-oriented problem solving strategy, and an instructionally-oriented objectives based strategy. These strategies, as developed in each district, were characterized by the uniqueness of their applications, the non-exclusive nature of the districts' orientations, and their ability to evolve in an episodic fashion.

The integration of available knowledge into a viable framework is recommended to prescribe current practice and determine future research. In a domain-referenced view of instruction and assessment, the definition of a subject, delimitation of instructional goals and efforts, sampling of criterion behaviors to describe competence are stressed. The writing skills domain is described and an approach discussed to provide the appropriate framework for integrating basic research, instruction and assessment of writing achievement. Research has begun to explore an interactive model of the writing process and its  associated skills, and to describe behavioral differences to distinguish competence. To teach students a skill that transcends particular classroom instruction or task characteristics, the teaching and assessment of behaviors is suggested. The qualities of an assessment program are described. (Author/CM)",

This research would provide a more objective basis for the writing of passages and items. Two aspects of content validity are distinguished and the relevance of psycholinguistic research to them is examined. The two aspects are the validity accruing from appropriate selection of skills to be tested, and validity based on relevance of items to the selected skills. Key linguistic and psychological terms are defined and several specific reading models are discussed. Their contributions to reading achievement test design are assessed. Analysis of passage structure can be used as an editing procedure to check the coherence of stimulus  passages. A brief passage is analyzed to illustrate some practical applications of the theory of text structure and processing. The analysis helps distinguish objectively what is literally present from what must be inferred. Scientific descriptions of the skills and reading materials are needed to assess the use of reading skills. (Author/DWH)",

Yearly state assessment tests, standardized norm-referenced test batteries, criterion-referenced tests, minimum competency tests, and teacher-made, curriculum-embedded tests were used. Testing in most areas was more frequent in upper elementary levels than in primary grades. Test results provided teachers with an estimate of the ability of new students. Required test results functioned as a standard of comparison, while teacher-made tests were used for instructional decision making. Teachers' attitudes toward required testing programs were generally negative. Test use was influenced by grade level, availability of classroom aides, and years of teaching  experience. Results of the survey indicated required standardized tests comprised a small fraction of classroom assessment activities. Curriculum-embedded tests were more prevalent and played a larger role in instructional decision making. They had more validity for teachers in terms of appropriateness for students and curriculum coverage. Most teacher training related to testing occurred during preservice education. Staff development activities might increase teachers' knowledge of new approaches to testing. (DWH)",

A preliminary assessment model is described in the first paper, &quot;Contextual Examination of Test Use: The Test, the Setting, the Cost&quot; by J. Herman and J. Yeh. Empirical findings are sought about the nature of testing and its actual use or non-use in schools. To frame an understanding of testing practices, the model examines various achievement test types used in instructional decision-making. Test characteristics, settings or contexts used, and financial, student opportunity and psychological costs are considered. phase I of the project will culminate in a national survey of teachers and administrators to learn how educators think about and use achievement testing results.  Preliminary interviews with elementary and secondary teachers, principals and other school personnel are discussed in the second paper, &quot;The Conduct of Testing from the Classroom Perspective&quot; by D. Dorr-Bremme, C. Lazar-Morrison, and J. Lehman. Findings concern the range of assessment devices and amount of time used in evaluating students. The national survey pilot-test is discussed. In the third paper, &quot;The Design of Testing Programs with Multiple and Complementary Uses&quot; by J. Burry, the three-district preliminary interviews are discussed in the third paper as examinations of educators' views about multiple and complementary uses of assessment in external accountability and instructional decision-making. Design factors such as organizational influences, leadership and policy are  considered. (Author/CM)",

Different groups were surveyed to determine their perceptions of conditions in the district. Data collection and analysis established the status of children's educational needs. The district's most serious problems were: improving student achievement in basic skills; implementing procedures for personnel evaluation; attracting and maintaining students; managing the impact of enrollment decline to control costs and increase quality; and developing a strategy for individual school improvement. The results were disseminated through interactive slide show sessions and written reports. Utilization of needs assessment results are of concern  to evaluators. Three categories of use are instrumental, conceptual, and persuasive. Factors influencing utilization are timing; identification of a primary client; evaluation design; avoidance of political attacks; variety of research strategies; substantive knowledge of education as a process and structure; preliminary testing of survey instruments; atmosphere for presentation of results; and the credibility of data. The authors recommend a client orientation approach for school district evaluation. (DWH)",

All elementary school principals in California were surveyed in 1979 regarding the uses they made of the report. Over 70 percent used their score reports to compare results across years looking for trends. Other common uses included: closer examination of curriculum; revision of existing programs; development of instructional strategies to correct problem areas; to call attention to new problem areas; and reflecting to the community the favorability of programs. A factor analysis of these responses distinguished four types of uses: curriculum review; program evaluation; monitoring of achievement; and textbook review. Monitoring and curriculum review had  strong positive correlations with achievement; textbook review had the weakest correlation with achievement. When achievement was regressed on school background factors and the four use factor variables, monitoring had the strongest positive weight, and curriculum review had the next largest. A cluster analysis indicated that above average use of the score reports was associated with above average achievement. (Author/BW)",

During April of 1980, all third grade students in California took a test consisting of reading, mathematics, and written language items. Item intercorrelation matrices were constructed for each skill, and the latent roots extracted. Methods of outlier analysis were applied to look for large drops in the size of the latent roots from each matrix. Mathematics skills tended to have smaller initial roots and a second root closer to the first than the reading skills. The evidence does not support the hypothesis of unidimensionality for the money and fractions skills, but does not contradict the hypothesis for the mathematical applications skill or for reading skills.

A two stage cluster sample of learning disabilities teachers (n=674), school psychologists (n=176), and speech/language teachers (n=240) was selected and surveyed by questionnaire. Although tests with high reliability and validity were generally preferred, poor tests were frequently used when superior substitutes were available. All classes of specialists tended to overrate the tests they used, and generally indicated a lack of familiarity with the  psychometric properties of commonly used tests. Although a majority of specialists valued clinical judgment over test scores for diagnosis, substantial numbers appeared to lack knowledge of procedures to ensure the validity of such judgments.

Item and factor analyses were conducted on samples equated in ability through the Armed Forces Qualification Test-7a. The true score theory item analyses show the subtests to have relatively easy items in most cases. Item-test biserial correlations are quite high (about .60), indicating subtest internal consistency. In keeping with these indexes, the subtest means are high, and distributions of raw scores are skewed toward the easy range. Subtest scores have high reliability as befits  homogeneous groups of items. Item response theory analyses show much the same information with easy items. Test information curves are generally unimodal and skewed toward lower ability subjects. Average item information is good. The factor analyses show the six forms to be quite similar to each other and to previous ASVAB forms. Solutions with the four factors labeled Verbal, Mathematical, Vocational Information, and Clerical Speed showed a median intercorrelation of .51 with a limited range. (Author/PN)",

Recent findings raise fundamental questions about whether an exclusively skills-focused curriculum in the early years provides the needed grounding in context learning and conceptual analysis for skills to be productively applied as children grow older. Absorption with the promotional aspects of the Basic Skills Test may overly focus attention on promotional testing causing the comprehensive curriculum to give way to a curriculum of 30 testable objectives. Because state funds granted for remediation are to be used only for students who fail the promotional tests, summer programs must be  established, thus causing a duplication of already existent remedial programs, as well as planning and logistical time constraints. No dollar figure has been proposed for the cost of this mandated effort in staff and teacher time or for the problems of test administration. The discussion concludes by urging testing proponents to consider whether the costs involved with such testing override the benefits and to keep alert to the need to make programmatic adjustments as they become necessary.

        "description":"The creation of Title XX of the Social Security Administration in 1975 has led to a tremendous increase in homemaker, task, and home management services to the frail elderly. Several needs assessments of the rural elderly have pointed to discrepancies between services rendered and services actually wanted or needed by clients. The Senior Services Council program was developed to assist the frail elderly with light household tasks so that they could continue to live at home. Clients (N=27) of the program, aides (N=19), and staff members (N=9) completed a semi-structured interview about services provided by the program. Results revealed that clients, aides, and staff differed widely in the frequency and types of responses mentioned, and that these differences depended on whether  the program or the aides were being evaluated, and on whether fulfilled needs or unmet needs were considered. Clients, aides, and staff agreed to some extent on important fulfilled and unmet needs. The major inconsistency between the groups was the extent to which the staff placed heavy emphasis on human service and personal maintenance needs. The findings suggest that the seminar services program is highly successful from the standpoint of meeting the role and scope of formal organizational objectives, but that some issues remain unresolved with regard to unmet needs.

        "description":"The importance of programs that help the elderly to continue living at home has been clearly established. Homemaker aides in these programs generally provide homemaking assistance and psychological support to their clients, but may experience role conflict as a result of responding directly to the demands of both clients and the program. Clients (N=27), aides (N=19), and staff members (N=10) of the Senior Services Council (a program to assist the frail elderly in light household chores) provided answers to 18 Likert-type items about situations that might create potential conflict for the aide. Results indicated that staff members considered the potential problems to be more significant than the aides; the aides regarded the potential problems to be more significant than the  clients. For all three groups, the primary problem was that the client tried to get the aide to talk about herself and other clients. The perception of a test item as a problem depended upon the rater, i.e., staff member, aide, or client, of the item. These findings suggest that the aide's position is not well understood by the aides, the staff, or the clients. (NRB)",

        "description":"Interest in the problems and concerns of dual career couples has increased markedly in the last decade. However, little research has been done with dual career couples in such traditionally non-female professions as engineering. To examine work, home, personal, and interpersonal characteristics and concerns, married female engineering graduates and their spouses completed a questionnaire. Results revealed that financial benefits were cited most often as an advantage, while concern for time problems was cited most often as a disadvantage. The average age of the respondents was under 30 years old, reflecting the relative recency of dual career engineering couples. Most couples did not work at the same facility, and most worked for private organizations. Most took jobs by choice,  although more females took jobs by availability. Both partners expressed a similar degree of satisfaction with their jobs, but tended to emphasize the male partner's career when making decisions about a job change. The findings suggest that engineering couples experience many similar concerns of dual career couples in other fields. (JAC)",

The occupational card sort, Occu-Sort (O-S), was administered to junior and senior high school students from suburban and urban communities to assess its effectiveness in broadening the career options of female students, and also to evaluate the reliability of the three-letter occupational code obtained from the O-S. To avoid sex bias, the same set of cards was used by both sexes. Neuter forms of occupational titles were used and occupations with strong sex-role associations were avoided. Groups using the Self-Directed Search (SDS) and a no-treatment group served as a control. Results revealed that use of the O-S  suggested a greater proportion of nontraditional jobs to female students when compared with the SDS; male students were unaffected. There was no difference between O-S and SDS students in ability to recall the three-letter code. The O-S letter occupation codes were moderately stable over time and provided moderately positive evidence for the construct validity of the codes. (The appendices provide an O-S lesson plan, an SDS teacher guide, student opinion forms, and three vocational guidance questionnaires.) (MCF)",

        "description":"Readability formulas were originally conceived of as being evaluative measures. However, if a text is being rewritten or revised so that it matches a particular level of ability in its intended readers, it is rather inescapable that readability formulas will influence the changes made. Tacitly or not, formulas now are used to diagnose what causes difficulty in reading. If they are used this way, they can only give wrong answers to the question of what changes should be made in a text to make it easier to read. Changes should be made in a text because of inherent difficulty or problems of ambiguity in that text, and not just to influence the score that the text will receive via readability formulas. Any changes that require knowledge of language, literary style, and the ability to  express ideas in the best way to communicate the content and logical relations of the text should be left to the writer or editor. A comparison of two versions of four texts--the original and an &quot;easier&quot; adaptation--shows clearly the influence readability formulas now exert on textbook preparation. Among the deleterious changes found in the analysis were the deletion of connectors; loss of causal and other relations between parts of a sentence; loss of background, focus, and topic information; and changes in points of view.

The paper discusses three types of interactions occurring within the framework of these processing domains: bottom-up, top-down, and sequential. Among the conclusions of the studies reported are that (1) young adult readers who differ widely in skill as measured by a standardized test of reading comprehension do not differ in their ability to decode  orthographic forms successfully, find referents for pronouns, or perform many of the other tasks used to analyze the components of reading; (2) performance differences within the various components investigated were tied to the difficulty of the test materials; (3) the distinction in the efficiency or automaticity of components appeared to extend to all three processing domains; and (4) the less efficient processes were of an attention demanding nature.

The study was confined to three main sequences: (1) the topical or independent relationship, in which two adjacent question cycles are structurally separate, but frequently related by topic; (2) the conjunctive relationship, in which two or more question cycles are tied together because the same question is asked of more  than one pupil; and (3) the embedded relationship, in which one question cycle is contained within another because the teacher reaction involves a new solicitation. Graphic displays of the taped lessons suggested that the structural sequencing of question cycles varied a great deal from lesson to lesson, and that much of this variation was derived from the instructional strategy or teaching procedure being used. Comprehension of a conjunctive cycle appeared to depend on a pupil not only realizing that the same question was being asked more than once, but also understanding why the question was being repeated. Comprehension in an embedded cycle appeared to depend on the pupil recognizing that the teacher's reaction did not close out the matter at hand, but that the topic was being pursued  further. (HOD)",

The number of students who fell below the twenty-third percentile on a reading achievement test (the criterion for Title I participation) was tabulated for each year to determine the program's effectiveness both in selecting students and in improving student reading ability. The results showed that Title I intervention reduced the number of students scoring below the twenty-third percentile at the time the students were tested in third grade, but these gains were not maintained after the third grade. The achievement records of individual students revealed that both those students who were remediated successfully by Title I participation in the early  grades and then discharged (to continue with regular reading instruction) and those students who were achieving well in the early grades without the help of Title I began to fall behind after third grade. The Title I program &quot;cured&quot; less than half of the students, and many students--particularly those with low ability--needed continued assistance in order not to fall drastically behind their peers. These results conflict with results from single-year evaluations mandated for all Title I programs, suggesting that data from a single year may offer incomplete or even distorted information on whether students are learning to read.

In this method, generative words concerning foods, holidays, or practical aspects of adult life are discussed and carefully arranged from basic phonetic sounds to more complicated sounds (17 words can express all of the 24 sounds of Spanish). Students who are still deficient in basic skills but too advanced for Freire's method are taught Spanish skills while they learn English. A system, based on the generative word concept and an educational notebook discussed by Freire, was developed to  teach English as a second language while reinforcing the primary language. First, problem areas are identified through evaluation of student essays and an error list is compiled, from which generative themes are developed. After discussion of the themes, students construct a list of common words that reflect the concept being taught, write a paragraph, and then discuss the theme, this time in English. Finally, a paragraph is written in English. Both the modified Freire and the generative theme methods are based on the premise that thinking and discussion precede the processes of reading and writing. (HTH)",

        "author":["Bruce, Bertram"],
        "description":"A model for the levels of social interaction between author and reader provides a framework for examining the devices through which the author engages the reader. An important aspect of this model is the creation of additional levels of social interaction involving, for example, an &quot;implied author&quot; and an &quot;implied reader.&quot; Newly created characters may in turn create additional levels of social interaction. Various devices, such as explicit embedding, commentary, and irony, are used by authors to create the various levels of a story and the interactions that will engage the reader. The successful layering of story features causes the reader to become deeply involved with the beliefs and intentions of the implied author and determines the latter's relationship with the implied  reader. Layers of embedded stories, with corresponding implied authors and implied readers, complicate the task of the real reader; but this very complexity provides more characters that come alive for the reader and makes the reader care about what is being said. This is one clue to the effectiveness of story telling as communication: by inducing active involvement of the reader, the story form ensures that the reader is working at making the communication successful. (Stories used to illustrate use of the social interaction model include &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; by Washington Irving, &quot;The Tale of Benjamin Bunny&quot; by Beatrix Potter, and &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; by Henry James.)

Eight passages were used in the study--four from a standard social studies textbook and four written for the study. Each passage was divided into propositions, where a proposition was a clause or phrase expressing an idea for the first time in the text. A group of 110 sixth grade students read the passages and rated each proposition for its importance to the passage. Another group of approximately 60 sixth grade students then read and recalled the passages by stating their main ideas. Results showed that both rated importance and position predicted recall. In addition, the quadratic  of serial position was a significant predictor indicating a recency effect. Neither the interaction term nor the quadratic of importance was significant, nor was there a significant correlation between importance and the linear or quadratic of position. (FL)",

The various types of inversions have been examined and classified into the following areas: (1) positively literary inversions, such as &quot;said Mary,&quot;&quot;such is the case,&quot; and &quot;be it resolved&quot;; (2) perfectly  colloquial inversions, such as &quot;here comes John,&quot;&quot;was he mad,&quot; and &quot;so do I&quot;; and (3) the larger set of inversions that, while characteristic of either literary writing or conversational speech, may also be found in literary speech or colloquial writing, respectively.

A detailed examination was made of 20 college students' eye movement patterns as they read a group of selected passages. The passages contained manipulations of word variables that involved interword redundancy and distorted spelling patterns. The results supported the claim that language constraint does affect the manner in which information in text is processed during reading and suggested that certain aspects of visual detail have a high degree of cognitive prominence.

One experiment was conducted with 24 subjects and the English alphabet, the other with 15 subjects and the Hebrew alphabet. In each experiment a letter was presented for identification, but was preceded by a brief presentation of either a mutilated version of the target letter or a neutral pattern. Mutilations were accomplished by eliminating a specific segment, such as the lower horizontal stroke of the letter E. It was reasoned that the more critical the eliminated segment, the less the altered version would activate the letter code in memory, thus the longer it would take for a subject to name the subsequently presented target letter. This procedure was successful  in detecting significant differences consistent with expectations. The latency data were highly correlated with the distinctiveness of the mutilated segment, its uniqueness in the alphabet, its impact on the letter's global shape, its topography within the letter, and other variables. The dependency of latency on the various factors varied considerably between alphabets. Two of the informational variables, distinctiveness and uniqueness, were found to have a significant effect, the first just in Hebrew and the second in both languages. (RL)",

        "description":"Arguing that the vagueness with which the relationship between social interaction and language is often treated in the literature makes it difficult to explicate and evaluate different views of that relationship, this paper poses four questions designed to differentiate positions and to provide a system for organizing data potentially relevant to evaluating them. The questions posed by the paper are as follows: Are the acquisition of social knowledge and linguistic knowledge simultaneous? Are there facilitating effects of one system on the other and are they unidirectional or bidirectional? How much is the relationship mediated by the internal properties of the child? and Is the relationship based on structural commonalities? As a way of examining the data bearing on the answers  to these questions, the paper outlines and evaluates four different kinds of relationships between social interaction and syntax that are distinguishable on the basis of the different sorts of answers they provide to the questions. The paper concludes that the set of reasonable relationships adheres to the following constraints: (1) while some social knowledge is acquired earlier than linguistic knowledge, it is unlikely that much of the acquisition of one system occurs prior to the other; (2) it is unlikely that facilitation is bidirectional, if it occurs at all; and (3) there is at best only a partial structural commonality between the two domains, suggesting that internal properties of the child are central to a characterization of the relationship.

The first paper demonstrates how certain uses of traditional readability formulas may actually lead to more difficult texts. The second paper presents a model with which to examine conflict in stories and discusses the application of this model to children's literature to expand students' understanding of  what they read. The third paper describes a method of mapping the structure of expository texts and discusses its possible uses as a measure of text comprehensibility.

Others have argued, however, that the generic terms cause readers to &quot;filter out&quot; or dismiss females from consideration. If generic terms do function to exclude females from consideration, they might also influence memory for facts--that is, subjects who have a greater interest in the material they read are likely to recall more information than those who are less interested. A study was designed to examine the effects of generic versus female-inclusive written language on memory for factual material in male and female subjects. Twenty-eight male and 50 female college  students read one of two versions of a 400-word essay, one using generic terms and the other using female inclusive terms (&quot;he or she,&quot;&quot;men and women,&quot; and &quot;they&quot;). Two days later, they completed a recall and recognition task. The results indicated that the female subjects displayed better recall of facts from their reading when the referent pronouns were female inclusive, while males showed better recall with generic masculine pronouns.

The adult learner may be at different developmental stages and display different learning styles, depending on the context in which the instructional interaction takes place and the attitudes, behaviors, and resources that the learner brings to that specific situation. Adults do not learn in a rigidly fixed continuum, nor do their skills develop in a predictable hierarchy. To meet the needs of these students, the new role of the college reading teacher should be that of the \"college communications and learning skills professional.\" By working with faculty across the college, the reading teacher can promote the development of programs suited to the needs  of adults and can insure a high number of students who graduate with a positive sense of themselves and their capabilities. As the focus and the role within the institution change, so changes the reading teacher's relationship to students. Today the reading teacher should act as a facilitator of students, thus more closely approximating the role of the consultant in business than the teacher in the classroom by providing resources for student self-assessment. In this new capacity, the college reading teacher becomes the agent of empowerment for students and faculty in their own institutions, for the workplace, and for the community. (HOD)",

The analyses showed that the students reached a peak in syntactic growth after ten weeks (20 hours) of sentence combining practice.

The FCC currently uses a 5-5-10 standard: five % of all programing is news/public affairs, five % is locally produced, and ten % is nonentertainment programing. The analysis showed that the television stations appeared to be doing a &quot;good&quot; job when it came to meeting and exceeding FCC public interest program minimums, although about nine % of the stations failed to meet the minimum requirement for local programing.  Most of those failing to meet this local programing standard operated in smaller markets. Overall, the television stations covered by the 5-5-10 standard aired about three times more news and public affairs programs, about two and one-half times more nonentertainment programing, and nearly twice as much local programing as the amounts demanded by the FCC.

        "description":"The &quot;Chicago School&quot; is the communications legacy left by late nineteenth and early twentieth century Chicago sociologists and journalists. It represents a research tradition of participant-observation and urban journalism concerned with the quality of urban life, as well as a commitment to solving urban problems through civic involvement and journalistic and social enlightenment. John Dewey, Jane Addams, Robert Park, and others of the Chicago School saw urban communications as a key to the study of society and the resolution of issues. For them, the ideal sociologist was one who knew the city, explored it, and thought of ingenious ways to gain insight from it. Chicago-style research experienced a decline between the late 1930s and the mid-1960s, but the explicit techniques of  the Chicago School--a combination of communication and social action--have been rediscovered in the past 20 years. There is now frequent acceptance and use of qualitative approaches to journalistic research and practice, such as the urban and environmental critic who not only observes urban life, but also evaluates its quality. There is also the continuing practice of gathering news through both undercover and identified personal reportorial experience in places like mental hospitals, schools and prisons, welfare agencies and nuclear plants. Furthermore, contemporary practicing journalists are using personal participation to reveal the communications process in news-gathering. Thus, the qualitative research tradition and communication theory of the Chicago School are no longer dormant.  (RL)",

        "description":"Punctuation and capitalization are basic, surface features of written communication. However, it was not until the nineteenth century that authorities recognized that punctuation marks should be primarily an integral part of the sentence pattern, not an indicator of pauses. Throughout the literature on punctuation two major purposes recur--to bring together and to separate. More recently, five major purposes for punctuation have been identified: to terminate and separate, to combine and separate, to introduce, to enclose, and to indicate omission. Generally, the rules for punctuation and capitalization are relatively standardized. Because of the large number of rules, however, errors can be expected--even among good writers. For most writers, the smaller set of rules that they  know may be sufficient for adequate written communication. Nevertheless, sentence fragments, run-on sentences, and the punctuation of relative clauses are three problems that occur frequently. A review of the literature reveals that very little research has been conducted in the teaching of mechanics. Generally, introduction to mechanics begins with instruction in the rules, followed by mispunctuated or unpunctuated sentences that illustrate the need for appropriate punctuation. Whereas many people suggest teaching mechanics functionally--when students need it--they rarely have any suggestions about how to do this. (HOD)",

        "description":"Every writing program contains implicit information on the amount of writing that should be assigned, how the essays should be evaluated, the type of grammar--if any--students should study, and the type of composition instruction that will be most effective. Research has not identified an optimal level of writing frequency, and although frequent writing may increase fluency, it does not by itself improve writing quality. Combining formal essays with informal, ungraded writing can help students improve both the fluency and the quality of their writing without increasing teachers' paper load. Research also suggests that the tradition and time consuming \"student writes, teacher corrects\" method should be modified. Giving students evaluative comments while they are drafting their  essays encourages them to revise their writing to incorporate suggested changes. Peer evaluation helps students revise and develop a stronger sense of audience. Although students seem unable to translate concepts from formal grammar to strategies which improve their writing, research does support other approaches to grammar instruction, such as one which combines concepts from both traditional and transformational grammar. Grammar study is most useful when teachers make it an integral part of the writing curriculum and help students apply their grammatical knowledge during the final stage of editing or proofreading essays. Research also supports the claim that students learn to write better when teachers focus on the process rather than the product of writing. (HOD)",

Ninety-eight college students were randomly assigned to one of five experimental or five control sections of a freshman composition course. In the control sections, students learned principles and rules from a rhetoric textbook and applied these in their writing assignments. Students in the experimental sections first went through a graduated sequence of source sentences, transformation models, and exercises, then wrote essays while continuing to make analogies and extrapolations according to the teacher's instructions. Both groups were pretested and posttested for punctuation  and sentence combining and then assigned an exit essay. A comparison of the results from the two groups showed that when judged solely by gains in T-unit length, the &quot;incremental&quot; version of generative rhetoric yielded results similar to those obtained by &quot;pure&quot; sentence combining and generative rhetoric. The experimental treatment increased the syntactic variety of students' writing and increased the percentage of appropriate punctuation. (HTH)",

Part one reports on the psychology of learning through writing, enumerates the connections between writing and learning, and explains why journal writing is a powerful learning tool, uniquely suited for professional thought and reflection. The point emphasized in this first section is that writing requires the writer to simultaneously represent ideas in all three of Jerome Bruner's modes of representation--enactive, ikonic, and symbolic--forcing a degree of thought integration not found in other modes of expression. Feedback and opportunity for reflection are also cited as powerful writing features that support learning.  Examples of using intensive writing as part of graduate and undergraduate courses in education are also discussed. Part two of the paper describes &quot;systematic reflection,&quot; a specific set of journal-keeping techniques that have been found useful in helping teachers take control of their own professional development.

However, the passive voice does have legitimate uses in technical and scientific writing--the problem is to define the appropriate or effective uses and the inappropriate or ineffective ones. An examination of passive voice usage in six scientific and technical journal articles showed that more than 70% of the passive structures were truncated, or the subject deleted. Generally, the full passive was used when the subject of the passive was the theme of the discourse segment, or if the agent was so complex linguistically that its placement in the subject position could lead to a perceptually more difficult sentence. Truncated passives were often used in  descriptions of experimental procedures, standard procedures, the state of knowledge, and natural processes. It would seem that the main fault of many prescriptions about the use of the passive voice is that they are overgeneralizations. (HOD)",

        "description":"In 1928, the Federal Radio Commission (the precursor of the Federal Communications Commission--FCC) noted the need for special radio channels that could carry radio across the United States free from interference from other radio stations. Many of these &quot;clear channels&quot; still exist as protected entities. Perhaps no other FCC policy better reflects the potential roles, problems, and inequities of broadcast regulation than does its clear channel policy. Perhaps, too, that is why this policy continues to be under constant review and appeal and why it has been modified significantly. Since the policy decisions surrounding the granting of clear channels encompass the values and problems of regulation in general, a review of the evolution of the FCC's clear channel rules provides an  interesting and useful look at that body's behavior in allocating scarce and special resources over a long period of time during which the conditions justifying the policy changed dramatically. Such a review shows many instances of lack of clarity of purpose and decisiveness on the part of the FCC. Ironically, the slowness with which it has dealt with clear channels has allowed the Commission to respond to new technologies, changes in population density, and changes in social concerns. The review suggests that in spite of problems, the regulatory system is working. (FL)",

The major content characteristics of the qualitative methods course are typically lecturing, training within the experience of the phenomenal world, and evaluation of  the student's performance based on observation notes, formal writing, and participation in class discussions drawn from field experiences.

A random sample of 46 caucus participants and nonparticipants in the state precinct caucuses was surveyed.

(1) The family resemblances typically cited between the arts and the sciences are trivial, tend to be wish-fulfilling analyses of the common logic of art and science, and promise more than they can deliver. (2) The common denominator that does link art and science is the fact that successive works of the artist are products of experimentation that, as with the scientist's experimental testing of specific hypotheses, represent the undertaking of acts of inquiry. (3) Artistic conceptions, as with scientific hypotheses, are drawn deductively from formal or informal theory. (4) The results of the artist's experimentation reflect in kind upon the  artist's theory as does the scientist's confirmation or disconfirmation of hypotheses. (5) The primary focus of evaluation of the artist's work is upon the experimental product itself, the artifact, with limited concern for its theoretic implications. (6) The nature of &quot;progress&quot; in art differs from the nature of &quot;progress&quot; in sciences as a function of the differential focus of critical evaluation: in art the focus is upon the artifact as a unit of achievement, while in science the focus is on the solution of a problem and clarification of theory as the unit of achievement.

The main section of the paper reports on evaluative data illustrating the popularity and scope of this communiversity program. Also discussed are the sources of funding for the courses, responses from participants in the 1980 communiversity program, characteristics of the program's faculty and students, and topics in speech communication that are planned for future communiversity programs. The final section of  the paper describes methods used for developing and advertising the communiversity concept to the public. (RL)",

The study also tested the validity of two behavioral theories: (1) reactance theory, which predicts that when a behavioral freedom is restricted or eliminated an individual is motivated to restore that freedom, and (2) commodity theory, which predicts that individuals attach greater value to objects that are in scarce supply than to objects in greater supply. Four film plot synopses, each assigned one of the four ratings, were given to 383 college students, who were asked to read them and decide if they were likely to attend the films. Additional information on frequency of movie attendance and movie attitudes was gleaned from  questionnaires returned by 170 of the subjects. The MPAA ratings, with which all the subjects were familiar, were found to significantly affect likelihood of movie attendance. Likelihood of attendance to both PG- and R-rated movies was found to be significantly greater than for both G- and X-rated. No significant difference in likelihood of attendance was found between PG and R ratings, or between G and X ratings. The results did not support either the commodity theory--in that the two least prevalent movie ratings, G and X, were least preferred--or the reactance theory, because both PG- and R-rated movies were preferred over G- and X-rated films.

Participative decision-making through groups or councils requires clear, unambiguous arrangements, support from the chief administrator, and a commitment to real power-sharing. The author provides guidelines for effective group procedures, for meeting group members' needs for inclusion, control, and affection, and for deciding the principal's role in the group. Communicating effectively with teachers and school staff requires that administrators understand the communication process, remain accessible, and develop skills in  paraphrasing, describing behaviors and feelings, checking perceptions, and requesting feedback. A short selection of exercises for improving communication skills is included. For effective communication with the public, administrators need to develop public relations strategies that include personal contact, both formal and informal, with parents and with opinion leaders and other key communicators. Advisory groups and public surveys are among suggested methods for improved communication. Administrators also need good media relations to facilitate communication with many people in a short time.

        "description":"Many educators advocate school-based management, a method of decentralization wherein the school, instead of the district office, becomes the primary unit of educational decision-making. This shift is part of American education's long-term oscillation between administrative centralization and decentralization. Centralization, say its critics, has led to rigid, hierarchical structures and a lack of creativity, while decentralization offers greater diversity and flexibility in meeting student needs and gives parents and the community more say in their schools. Examples of school-based management are described in Florida and California and in the school districts of Lansing (Michigan), Edmonton (Alberta), Cherry Creek (Colorado), Louisville (Kentucky), Eugene (Oregon), Salt Lake  City (Utah), and New York City. Under school-based management, school boards still set goals and policies and make final decisions, but central offices become facilitators, supporting and evaluating the schools, while principals gain greater authority and assume actual school leadership. Under school-based management the decisions schools control include curriculum matters, personnel selection, and budgeting (within a lump-sum allocation from the district office). School-based management also entails increased staffing and community involvement in decision-making through faculty committees and school advisory councils. (RW)",

        "description":"Recent research suggests that, on the whole, school discipline problems are not as widespread as the public believes. In 1975 the Bayh report depicted schools as hotbeds of violence and vandalism. Restudies of the Bayh data show the report was skewed toward large schools, where violence is more likely. The National Institute of Education's Safe School study and surveys of California and Indiana educators reveal that most schools have few violence problems and that most discipline problems do not involve violence. New information on the causes of school violence, provided by a New Jersey study and the Safe School data, help identify school, community, and student characteristics that accompany school violence. School characteristics correlated with violence include large size,  overcrowding, lack of resources, and particular educational levels (especially junior high school); for communities, they include urban location and low socioeconomic status; and for students, they involve race, gender, and perceptions of disciplinary fairness and consistency. These results imply that school administrators can reduce violence by ensuring clear, firm school governance and by cooperating with teachers in setting school disciplinary policy. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"This paper, an offshoot of a larger study, looks at doctoral dissertations on women in education administration completed and abstracted from January 1973 through January 1979 and categorized as coming from a feminist perspective. Two domains are examined--problem selection and research methods. Within the domain of problem selection, six general subject areas were identified: women's status, women in educational administration, attitudes of and toward women, barriers to women, leadership styles and effectiveness, and the structure of organizations. In these studies, use of the male model of research is the norm, sexism is perpetuated, and women are investigated not as populations but as topics. The dissertations' research methodologies are equally male-oriented, according to the  author. To correct the male-orientation of research, a new paradigm is proposed. This paradigm would expand the use of the naturalistic method of inquiry; emphasize the generation of hypotheses; grow out of the personal experiences, feelings, and needs of the researcher; place the authority for truth in the subject; rely on the oral tradition; and use research as an instrument of social change. The implications of this paradigm in the two domains of research are explored. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"To gain insight into the nature of cooperative and collaborative processes and to contribute information to those considering similar research, an effort was initiated by a school district and a research center to work together in a \"collaborative\" mode. It was anticipated that the needs of the school district would be addressed, that the goals of the research center would be met, and that a descriptive model for collaboration would emerge. This paper presents a brief sampling of the literature on such joint efforts, a narrative of the context and events of the case study, an analysis and identification of the components and relationships required for both cooperation and collaboration, and descriptive models of cooperation and collaboration with predicted outcomes of each.  Although the attempt at collaboration failed, it provided insight into the natures of collaboration and cooperation. Interinstitutional cooperation is a model wherein one institution is primarily involved in the task and the results fill that organization's needs. In contrast, collaboration involves both institutions in a shared task and provides mutually rewarding gains. Additional benefits also accrue in collaborative relationships. (Author/IRT)",

It includes general legal rules from legislation, from the courts, or from higher administrative levels. The key to the definition is lack of integration of the new rules with the main rules already constituting the system or the lack of integration of the new channels of control with the old ones. The main argument of this paper is that legalization is a product of the rise of more central (now, national) controls and pressures in a system that is organizationally decentralized. Interventions, in such a system, take the form of specialized rules unintegrated with the rest of the educational system. Such legalization  creates a good deal of organizational disorder in the educational system itself, though this is not inevitably to be seen as unsatisfactory. Policy implications and possible future directions for change are discussed. (Author/JM)",

Beginning with a list of ways in which educational organizations differ from business or military organizations, the author warns that educators must be cautious when transferring organizational structures from other disciplines to education. He then examines current and emerging forces on education to illuminate the question of whether traditional organizational structures for schools are still appropriate. The history of special education is then reviewed, focusing on the shift from segregation of the handicapped to placement in the &quot;least restrictive alternative,&quot; with an emphasis on the new demands this has placed on the organization of special education.  Avoiding a definition of matrix organizational structure, the author instead demonstrates how two different matrix organizational structures might be applicable to special education. Under one such organization, the common supervisor would be the superintendent of instruction and matrix managers would be the supervisor of special education and the building level principal. Advantages and disadvantages of the organization are listed. Finally, the author recommends that matrix organization be considered for its efficacy in addressing some of the emerging concerns in special education. (Author/JM)",

The compliance indicators describe what the Oregon Department of Education will accept as evidence of compliance with each standard. The commentary is intended to provide insight into the state board's intent when adopting each standard and to reduce misinterpretations. The booklet includes brief sections on graduation  requirements; curriculum requirements for basic skills, career education, special education, elementary schools, and secondary schools; general overall requirements for instruction, such as daily class size, required days of instruction, equal opportunities, personnel, and textbooks; and assessment and evaluation of individual students and the instructional program. A section on support programs deals with guidance and counseling, health services, emergency plans, operating policies, personnel policies, records and reports, and auxiliary services. Sections on implementation dates and administration conclude the guide. A companion document assists administrators in achieving compliance. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Resting on the assertion that there is less criticism of the federal role in education in Australia than in the U.S., this paper attempts to identify the structures and practices associated with this less negative view and to determine if they are transferable to the U.S. The first section provides a contextual comparison for national education activities in the U.S. and Australia, focusing specifically on similarities and differences between the two countries. The second reviews the development of Commonwealth involvement in educational policy in Australia and describes the important characteristics of Commonwealth education programs. The third identifies the major issues of program implementation in the public school sector that were raised in interviews with Commonwealth and  state education officials. The fourth section draws on this discussion to assess the implications of the Australian approach for educational policy in the U.S. The first suggestion elicited from the Australian experience is the desirability of consolidating the large number of U.S. federally funded programs and of focusing on a few major priorities. The Australian experience also suggests greater devolution to the state level of authority for implementation in an effort to minimize federal regulations and requirements. Use of a school-based policy is also suggested. (Author/JM)",

The topic is education finance issues. Identified as the foremost educational problem today and in the future was the financing of elementary and secondary education, especially its adequacy. Most respondents favored increased funding. Respondents were unanimous in their opinion that federal education policies have affected educational decision-making at the state, local, and school levels, and they cited both positive and negative results of federal interventions. The tendency of federal programs to increase staffing levels was noted. In general, the  respondents felt that federal programs did provide needed services, but were often accompanied by restrictive paperwork. Except for respondents associated with private schools, most did not favor new federal policies for private schools, such as vouchers or tuition tax credits. The federal role in elementary and secondary education to date was viewed favorably by national level respondents, but state and local level respondents dwelt more on the negative aspects of federal involvement.

It is aimed at state departments of education, school districts, and schools. Organized as if it were a presentation by four members of a study committee, the paper looks at CBE and four areas: student learning goals, curriculum, student assessment, and program management. Regarding CBE learning goals, three points are elaborated on: CBE programs are goal based; one important type of goal is the competency; and the community is involved in setting learning outcomes. Regarding CBE curriculum, four points are discussed: the  curriculum is derived from student learning goals; instruction is personalized; time is flexible; and students attempt problems commonly encountered in adult life. The presentation on CBE assessment explains three points: assessment is goal based; programs often include a wide range of assessment options; and performance reports are used to provide assessment information. Three points relate to program management: it is goal based; planning is a major activity; and programs are adaptive. (Author/JM)",

The purposes of the study were to discover the political interactions leading to policy decisions on the management of underutilized facilities, to determine the actual policies that resulted from those activities, and to investigate the satisfaction of persons who participated in the process. Two main methods of data collection were used. The first involved the review of documents available within the district and of secondary documents about the district's experiences. The second method was a survey of those who had participated in the decision-making. Results indicate that policy development passed through three periods: a  period of preparation for an uncertain future, a time of issue clarification after the enrollment decline was accepted and consolidation of schools began, and a time of implementation of policies that had been consolidated into a single set of priorities and procedures that recognized school and community interests. The general level of participant satisfaction was good. Guidelines for multiple uses of school buildings are included. (Author/IRT)",

The review concludes with descriptions of some programs for training minority administrators and with recommendations for areas of further  research. It is argued that minority principals with significant input into policy decisions and with control over the implementation of those policies can use their insights and experience to meet the educational demands of a culturally pluralistic society.

        "description":"Instructional supervision is intertwined with the debate on how humans learn and on what knowledge is of greatest import. Those who believe that knowledge is acquired as an individual chooses to follow his or her own inclinations tend to favor nondirective supervision. Those who believe that learning is the result of reciprocity and experimentation advocate collaborative supervision. Those who believe that learning is acquired through compliance with a set of standards advocate directive supervision. Because all methods can be successful when applied in the proper circumstances, it is important for a supervisor to be aware of his or her own beliefs on supervision. To help create such an awareness, the author includes a self-assessment questionnaire for supervisors to use in  determining their beliefs. The questionnaire is followed by a discussion on which of ten behaviors on the supervisory behavior continuum (listening, clarifying, encouraging, presenting, problem-solving, negotiating, demonstrating, directing, standardizing, and reinforcing) are associated with the orientation. A paradigm of four teacher categories (dropouts, unfocused workers, analytical observers, and professionals) based on teacher commitment and level of abstract thinking is developed to help supervisors determine which supervisory orientation is appropriate for a specific teacher's developmental stage.

The current attendance accounting procedures and policies are based on the need to have attendance figures to ensure that students are in school, as required by the compulsory attendance law, and to determine a school district's average daily attendance (ADA), which is the basis for its state funding. The accounting procedure is complex; in 1979-80 a total of 18 types of ADA and enrollment accounting were recorded for the state. After examining current and alternative methods of apportioning  state money, the department recommends that state funding be based on average daily membership (ADM) or, if ADA is kept as the standard, that only full-day absences be counted in determining ADA. The plan to improve student attendance includes recommendations for roles to be played by students, parents, schools, school districts, School Attendance Review Boards, and the state department of education.

With energy conservation as a goal, windows were replaced, roofs were insulated and HVAC systems were modified or replaced. Estimated annual dollar savings (from electricity payment records) were divided into the amount spent on improvement to determine the number of years required for payback. The findings indicated that ten of the fourteen buildings became more energy efficient and eight were able to pay back the initial improvement costs within their  expected life span. A relationship between initial improvement costs and operational costs of school buildings was supported in that the initial costs of improvement could be repaid by the resultant reduction in operational costs. A brief review of the literature is included, which also supports these findings by showing instances of life-time savings resulting from comparatively higher initial construction costs.

These measures have been used for various purposes, including assessing the effectiveness of desegregation efforts, the changes in patterns of desegregation, and the relationship between desegregation status and school district characteristics. For this study, school enrollment data for the 1978-79 school year were obtained for all public schools in Florida's 67 school districts. Eight indices of segregation or racial isolation were computed for each district. The measures were Thiel's and Finizza's Measure of Racial Entropy (1967), Cisin's Segregation Index Number One (1970), Cisin's Segregation Index Number Two (1970), Farley's and  Taeuber's Dissimilarity Index (1974), and Replacement Index (1974), the Index of Feasible Desegregation (Rossell and Crain, 1973), the Interracial School Contact Index (Coleman, 1975), and the Standardized Measure of Segregation (Coleman, 1975). These measures were compared across the Florida system while the size of the district and the proportion of minorities were used as independent variables. The results indicate that different indices will lead to different conclusions in identical situations. It is possible to pick an index to get a desired result. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"The description reported here is the result of an analysis of two major dimensions of the occupation of the senior high school principal: the orientations engendered by occupational structures and the meanings attached by principals to their work. A guide was developed for use in semi-structured \"intensive,\"\"elite\" interviews with 15 principals in central Ohio. The interviews were conducted by the researcher in the principals' own schools. The general and open-ended questions focused on those dimensions of the occupation that provide insights into its ethos--the structures of occupational recruitment, socialization, and reward, and the meanings that high school principals attach to their work. The following dimensions reflect the basic elements of the principal's occupational  ethos; an insular view of the high school social system, an emphasis on leadership style, a concern for the process of schooling rather than for the product, and a sense of control over the domain of the high school.

        "description":"Currently there is a growing realization that the schools are only one part of a larger network of learning environments important to effective education. Six societal conditions have encouraged a dialogue that is redefining the role of the school: the fragmented associations among all the educating institutions (family, mass media, schools, peer groups, church, and so forth), criticism of the school as an institution, the shrinking financial resources available to support the schools, fluctuations in the student population, the limited success of the schools in serving groups that have been marginal to the society, and the changing labor market. The boundaries of educating institutions should be permeable and educators should lead in establishing connections among institutions  that share the responsibility for educating. This outreach can begin with the family, the mass media, and the workplace. Before responsibilities can be shifted, education must be defined, goals for all the institutions established, and the nature of the curricula determined. Building a coordinated system of public education that spans several settings may prove to be the educator's greatest future challenge. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"Weaknesses in the structure, levels, and sequence of Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive domains emphasize the need for both a new model of how individual learners process information and a new taxonomy of the different levels of memory, thinking, and learning. Both the model and the taxonomy should be consistent with current research findings. The Stahl Perceptual Information Processing and Operations Model (SPINPrOM) details a 21-component process explaining how individuals think and learn. The SPINPrOM process begins with environmental information and moves through stages that include perceptual register, transient storage, an &quot;executor&quot; to assign meaning and choose responses, working memory, long-term memory, utilization of retrieved information, and feedback. SPINPrOM is related  to the proposed Domain of Cognition taxonomy, which identifies eight levels of cognitive behaviors involved in thinking and learning. The eight levels comprise preparation and observation, reception, transformation and information acquisition, retention, &quot;transfersion&quot; (applying old information to new situations), incorporation, organization, and generation. Ten principles useful for teachers can be derived from the new model and taxonomy, involving learning times, similarities between cognitive and affective information, and learners' use of rules or guidelines when thinking.

The 72 studies were divided by an objective statistical test into those showing large effects of open education and those showing small effects. The researchers then compared seven features and four aspects of open education with six student outcome variables, controlling for nine characteristics of the research studies' design and methodology. Among the open education features were multigrade student groupings, open space, individualized instruction, and team teaching; open education aspects included the number and extensiveness of open education  features in each study. Outcome variables comprised students' self-concept, creativity, attitude toward school, and reading, math, and language achievement. The results showed that the size of open education effects varied for different features and outcomes. For instance, for student self-concept, open education programs showing large effects averaged two more features than those showing small effects, while for student creativity, programs with larger effects had one more feature.

Data were gathered from parent interviews and student reading achievement tests in 153 families with fifth-grade children. The families were stratified according to the expenditure per pupil and median family income of the districts in which they resided. Forty-three percent of the households chose residence without consideration of school, while 37 percent located because of their school's reputation  and 20 percent because of specific school characteristics. Forty-seven percent of the households reported few contacts with teachers which were initiated and structured by the teacher; 53 percent reported larger numbers of contacts, most of which the parents had arranged around specific inquiries. The strongest predictor of both school selection and school contact variables was parents' educational attainment. (Author/JEH)",

Nine types of positions were identified, including classroom and nonclassroom teachers, vice-principals, principals, specialists, and central office administrators. The variables examined comprised educators' sex, age, ethnic group, training, experience, and absenteeism, as well as the schools' proportion of nonwhite students, average reading levels, student attendance, and faculty characteristics. Analysis reveals little movement along career paths and only small chances for advancement, primarily because there is very little turnover. Males are more likely to gain promotions than females, but ethnic  characteristics do not appear to affect promotion probabilities. Given declining enrollments in Chicago but a slight increase in staffing, projections for the next five years indicate low rates of turnover and heavier representation of males in central administrative, nonclassroom teaching, and specialist positions.

The authors construct a model of fiscal strain that combines budget constraints with school district decision-makers' preference functions and indifference curves. Using this model and 1976 and 1980 data from one school district, they analyze the three causes of fiscal strain, including price increases, changes in educational resources and technology, and enrollment decline (which increases per-pupil costs, reduces staff-pupil ratios, and causes salary and district wealth bracket creep). The greatest factor affecting the district's fiscal strain is found to be price increases. Enrollment declines show little or no causal effect  on fiscal strain, while technological changes account for an intermediate proportion of the strain. Price and enrollment changes are unintended factors contributinq to districts' fiscal strain, note the authors, but technological changes result from intended shifts in federal or state policies. The authors suggest that current government subsidies to local schools target unintended fiscal strains when they should focus on intended factors. (Author/RW)",

Data from a survey of 245 principals who began the program in 1980 reveal wide ranges in their years of experience and the size of their schools, but indicate that they agree on several important  issues. The respondents are shown to be satisfied with their careers and with their role as educational leaders but dissatisfied with the number of their problems, their lack of time to improve instructional programs, and their personal loneliness. They feel that success with students and staff is the most important aspect of the principalship and that schools must improve in meeting students' needs and involving parents in the educational process.

A brief introductory section describes current research findings on the actual situation in schools today, with a focus on factors serving as potential barriers to educational change. Next, the literature on educational change and the implementation of educational innovations, such as Project Follow Through, is critically reviewed. A third section looks at the literature on effective schools, especially those in low-income areas, and  instructional leadership. A synthesis of these findings leads to the concept of support functions, which is explained in some detail. The authors emphasize that these functions can be performed by a principal, supervisor, change agent, or other administrator. The final section offers a conceptual model for looking at and measuring some critical aspects of implementation attempts in core curriculum areas. A concluding brief description of a case study shows how the concept of support functions can lead to potentially fruitful analyses and empirical investigations of change. (Author/JM)",

The term \"legal-administrative processes\" refers both to laws affecting schools and to the administration of those laws. Laws, standards, and funded programs generated by state legislatures, the courts, and administrative agencies are examined. The paper discusses legal-administrative processes affecting three areas: the composition of the educator labor force (affected by laws concerning certification, affirmative action, and teacher and administrator training programs); employer-employee relationships (affected by collective bargaining and laws governing fair dismissal and tenure); and interaction of school  personnel, citizens, and local governmental agencies (affected by laws concerning alternative school programs, attendance, open meetings or parent-citizen involvement in school-site councils). The authors are especially concerned with the way the laws, guidelines, and funded programs in each area influence decisions about the mix of personnel in the district; working relationships among school personnel; the hiring, firing, transfer, and utilization of personnel; and the classroom agenda and use of resources and incentives to improve student achievement.

The intention is to inform and encourage administrators and their supporters who attempt to improve student achievement. The paradigm is presented in three stages. First, classroom variables that affect student learning are identified. Second, the effects of educational policy on administrators is reviewed. Third, the influence of administrators (in terms of both work supervision and work support) on classroom variables is highlighted. Briefly,  according to the paradigm, educational policy affects administrative work, which affects classroom work, which in turn affects student achievement.

        "description":"Researchers analyze the cost effectiveness of educational administrator training programs for Native Americans at four universities: Harvard, Pennsylvania State, Minnesota, and New Mexico. The programs vary in scope, duration, clientele, admissions, and five other characteristics. The programs' average costs per student are computed and are related to differences in program characteristics. The researchers then compile effectiveness rankings for seven different outcome measures, including program completion rate, post-program jobs and salaries, shifts in job aspirations, and students' perceptions of program quality, changes in their decision-making responsibilities, and realization of preprogram expectations. Program rankings on each outcome are weighted and averaged, and a  measure of program cost per unit of effectiveness is computed. While one unidentified school is found to have lower costs, the authors conclude that no school can be considered more cost effective because the use of different outcomes or weights would yield different figures for cost effectiveness. They discuss the problems of analyzing the cost effectiveness of social action programs, especially in relation to variation in program goals, structures, resource constraints, and outcome measures.

        "description":"Research in classrooms must be sensitive to new dimensions of teaching tasks that emerge at the group level. There are at least two tasks that can be identified as being affected by changes in group characteristics. The first task is to set the stage--the teacher must establish the proper context or setting to support academic activities. The second task is to instruct. The data reported here is from a subsample of 16 junior high school mathematics and English classes. The classes were categorized into three groups--extremely heterogeneous, homogeneous with high ability, and homogeneous with low ability. The heterogeneous classes pose problems because teachers must plan and execute instructions so that all students are provided with a focus for their behavior throughout the class  or period while the teacher must differentiate instruction to meet widely differing needs. In the high ability group, the teacher must use group characteristics to maximize the amount of academically engaged time while minimizing the intrusion of the needs for social organization. The low ability group poses serious problems both in setting the stage and in instructing. Teachers often accept less desirable forms of participation in an attempt to maintain some student involvement in classroom activities. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"A history of Roosevelt's New Deal education policies shows that the Depression of the 1930s led to unprecedented experimentation in federal educational programs. Three aspects of New Deal education policy are important. First, the New Deal set precedents that redefined and legitimized the federal government's role in education. Working through structures parallel to traditional education--such as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Works Progress Administration (WPA), and the National Youth Administration (NYA)--the federal government constructed schools, helped employ teachers, and offered a wide variety of courses. Second, the New Deal demonstrated the necessity and the effectiveness of federal intervention for the education of blacks and other educationally deprived  groups. The CCC, WPA, NYA, and other programs emphasized the training of blacks, though often in segregated circumstances. Third, however, the New Deal failed to institutionalize its new policies. Thus it built no group of professional educators committed to federal participation in education. The New Deal's experiments in educational policy did help establish new ideas about federal responsibility for education and new goals for equal and democratic education. (Author/RW)",

The handbook, written in question and answer format, is a distillation of the contributions of presenters and participants at the 1979-80 Institutes for Program Improvement. The first chapter on program evaluation looks at such things as types of evaluation and problems of testing. The section on leadership development highlights both situational leadership and how to deal with school district personnel and administrators and the community. Proposal writing is also covered, or more  specifically, assessing the needs of bilingual populations, formulating a program, and translating that program into a fundable proposal. One chapter deals with strategies for parental involvement, and another deals with strategies for involving bilingual and monolingual students in joint activities. Ways to formulate a parallel curriculum and some problems related to diagnostic and placement testing are also touched on. (JM)",

Major emphasis is placed on defining account classifications that provide meaningful financial management information. After describing the need for and advantages of a proposed account classification system, defining the system's framework envisioned in the coding structure, and clarifying the multiple uses to be made of the coding structure, the publication discusses the implementation of the account classification system and cost accounting for educational programs. The publication's content and format are based on the double-entry and accrual or modified-accrual basis of accounting. However, an appendix identifies the additional  classifications needed to operate on a single-entry set of records and needed to provide the balance sheet accounts most frequently used in a cash-basis/double-entry system. The use of the classifications and definitions in this handbook, claims the author, will enhance the comparability of recorded and reported financial information at the local, state, and federal levels.

Additional discussion centers on where and  how legislators choose to spend time and effort and the relationships among legislators and various groups such as staff, teachers, and state departments. The major functions of legislative education leadership discussed include (1) developing and processing legislation; (2) reviewing the executive budget; (3) overseeing ongoing state programs; and (4) providing services for constituents.

As proof of this, studies have indicated that principals may perform as many as 50 separate tasks in an hour. Principals also must interact with a wide range of individuals, must accomplish tasks requiring many different skills, and are required to make a number of different affective and cognitive responses. All these activities are regularly interrupted by other tasks, problems, or crises. The combination of task brevity, variety, and fragmentation makes it extremely difficult for principals to make sense of their work. These three properties make the job hectic, complex, and hard to learn experientially. An understanding of these properties should guide those who select and train  principals.

Data are drawn from U.S. government sources, the National Education Association, and a survey of public pension funds in 49 states and 7 municipalities. The report first describes the number, size, and eligibility criteria of teacher retirement systems. It then discusses the funds' benefits (including income and insurance plans), the &quot;vesting&quot; in employees' names of their rights to their pensions, and the  relationships of pensions to other post-retirement income. Following a review of the methods of funding pensions and of calculating each fund's pension obligations, the authors examine the systems' administrative structures and the fiduciary responsibilities of fund administrators.

He identifies two constitutional norms the court uses to interpret the relationship between education and the state: equal protection and the legitimacy of educational decision-making and policy formation. Efforts to make current practices in German education comply with these norms have led the court to develop its own notion of legalization in the twin principles of &quot;statutorization&quot; and &quot;parliamentarization.&quot; The author argues that while the court succeeds in satisfying the equal protection norm, it may have underestimated the seriousness of the legitimacy issue. The paper concludes with preliminary  notes comparing this analysis with parallel considerations in the legalization of American education. (Author/JEH)",

To examine the possible causes and cures of this feeling of regulatory intrusiveness, the author compares the regulation of business with the regulation of education. In discussing each field, the author covers, first, overinclusive regulations, legalistic enforcement, costly compliance measures, and other factors that he considers make regulatory programs both unreasonable and ineffective. Next the paper describes strategies of regulatory reform--especially flexible enforcement--that might curtail regulatory unreasonableness. Finally, the obstacles to flexible enforcement are analyzed, including  enforcement officials' fear of scandal, their disapproval of nonuniform treatment, and their imperviousness to arguments based on regulatory costs.

Demographic data are available on Hispanic students in elementary, secondary, and higher education but fail to distinguish among different Hispanic subgroups. Existing data indicate increasing segregation of Hispanics in elementary and secondary schools and only a slow increase in Hispanics enrolled in postsecondary education. Research on Hispanic students has failed to explain their high attrition rate, either blaming Hispanics themselves or simply labelling Hispanics &quot;disadvantaged&quot; without offering further causal explanations. Research in educational finance has been more complete, especially on financial support of Hispanics in postsecondary schools, but more  research is needed on educational equity and the returns on education to Hispanics. What little research exists on Hispanics and educational governance confirms that very few Hispanics sit on school boards or work in local or state educational agencies. Recent theoretical research, using the &quot;internal colonialism&quot; model, identifies six roles that Hispanics assume in postsecondary education, but the theories need empirical testing. (RW)",

        "description":"In the public school governance structure that evolved between 1900 and 1920, schools were removed from the world of politics, authority was concentrated at the top of the hierarchy, and boards of education were reorganized, resulting in less participation by working-class people. Teachers had little power. Teacher political activities after this were sporadic because the National Education Association (NEA) concentrated power in the hands of school administrators. Following World War II, the McCarthy period had a chilling impact on teacher organizing efforts. Teacher unions became a driving political force in the protest decade of the 1960s. Since that time, teacher negotiation agreements have enlarged the scope of bargaining from initial demands for improved salaries, fringe  benefits, and working conditions to involvement in educational decision-making. In addition, teacher unions have engaged in local politics, and have made their influence known at the state and national levels. In light of the teacher cutbacks occurring throughout the country, unions have become more protective of teacher gains. More research is needed on the role being played by teacher unions in American education, focusing primarily on local and state teacher unions. (Author/MLF)",

They focused, first, on how states' political and organizational contexts interacted with federal program characteristics to shape the response patterns of state education agencies (SEAs), and, second, on the consequences of SEA response patterns for federal policy objectives. Data were gathered through interviews with state legislators and staffers, SEA officers and personnel, professional and client groups, and others. The variables considered included federal and local policy and management choices, state governmental and  resource contexts, state political culture (popular attitudes toward the political system), SEA organizational characteristics, local social and political contexts, school district characteristics, and program design and delivery. Research results indicate that a state's political culture, especially the state government's traditional relationship with local jurisdictions, is the chief factor affecting state and SEA implementation of federal programs. The researchers discuss the implications of their findings for federal block grant proposals and enforcement of federal program requirements. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"A comparison of leadership theory and administrative theory will help to show whether there is a conflict for educational administrators between being a leader and being an administrator. Two definitions of leadership stress the importance of initiating activities within a group. In education, leadership necessitates decision-making within an organizational structure (an institution). The democratic nature of educational organizations means that decision-making is best shared with teachers and staff. Studies of leadership style reinforce this emphasis on shared decision-making. Administrative theories are quite diverse, but they generally emphasize that administration by an individual or a group involves dealing with cyclical activities and with policies, resources, and the  execution of decisions, all within a larger system. Hence the nature of administration is dependent on the nature of the services to be delivered and on their organizational context. By relating leadership to administration, then, one sees that they both imply working with groups, involve decision-making (preferably democratic, in an educational institution), and are dependent on the nature of the institution within which they take place. Thus, because leadership is so closely related to administration, educational administrators should be both leaders and administrators. (RW)",

These factors were investigated according to demographic variables. Among findings were that children from Black families had more social interactions with a wider variety of people and were evaluated as having better interpersonal skills than were children of White families; family income did not seem to be systematically associated with attitudes toward mainstreaming; females were more likely to be expected to remain at home or to live on their own and to work in a sheltered workshop while males were more likely to be expected to  live in a community facility and work in the community; the higher the family income the more likely mothers were to express negative feelings and perceive negative effects; about 90% of the parents were satisfied with their children's school; and the only family activity influenced by income was religious participation. Service needs and satisfactions noted include personal and community support networks and organizational and political involvement. (CL)",

Insights into research are provided in discussions of the role of ESL programs in hastening the extinction of indigenous languages in foreign coutries, the relationship between bilingualism and cognitive function, intake control in second language learning, the role of  prefabricated utterances in learners' progression toward native-like control of English, language proficiency of newly placed students compared with that of continuing students, and the attitudes of American undergraduates toward the language of foreign teaching assistants. Papers focusing on practice and application include reviews of university training programs for the rural ESL teacher, teaching in non-instructional settings, communicative disorders in the ESL classroom, problems in ESL programs, language learning via drama, ESL teacher intercultural awareness training, and vocabulary preparation for reading in the content area.

        "description":"This is a report of a case study, in the anthropological tradition, of an elementary school with a bilingual-bicultural program. The research was carried out in 1978. The school is in a community of 45,000 located close to the California-Mexican border. Eighty-seven percent of the pupil population are of Hispanic background, 10 percent are Anglo, 1 percent are Filipino and slightly over 1 percent are black. The school has used a language maintenance bilingual education model since the program was begun in 1969. The study is based on a general view of schools as academic organizations with internally generated social norms, role expectations, and patterned behavior and as instruments of cultural transmission and socialization for the parental constituency and the broader  culture/community. The research focused on questions relating to: 1) the interaction of cultural differences, schooling processes, and teacher behavior; 2) the effect of federal and state intervention on the organization of the program and the life of the school; and 3) the role and involvement of parents in the school.

Its main purpose is to indicate the kind of information that can be gathered using cloze procedures, with the aim to integrate this information into further learning strategies for the acquisition and retention of second language vocabulary. Students of English at a German university were given an examination testing vocabulary, reading comprehension, syntax, and translation. A statistical analysis of cloze responses was undertaken. Results reveal that not only are the correct responses to cloze passages of interest, but also those responses considered \"incorrect.\" The author investigates the kinds of vocabulary items  generated in response to the cloze items. In all but a few cases, a high degree of structural sensitivity was exhibited by the students. Cloze items, along with whatever else they may reveal about the readability of a given prose text or about other language skills, can provide information about the vocabulary range of a group of subjects. In dealing with a \"dictionary of expectancy,\" students reveal the strategies used in selecting a finite set of words from a potentially infinite second language vocabulary. (JK)",

        "description":"This study examines the relationship between an open-ended cloze test and its multiple-choice versions generated from three sources: (1) interlingual learner-generated distractors--distractors selected from one language group and administered to a different language group, (2) intralingual learner-generated distractors--distractors selected from one language group and administered to a similar sample of the same language group, and (3) teacher-made distractors--distractors generated by a team of trained ESL/FL instructors and administered to their students. Open-ended cloze tests, multiple-choice cloze formats using intralingual learner-generated distractors, and cloze formats incorporating teacher-made distractors appear somewhat similar in terms of their relationship to general  ESL proficiency. In selecting a cloze passage in terms of its discourse, teachers/testers need be aware of and sensitive to their learners' needs and goals. If a language program involves an English for science and technology focus, the appropriate discourse to be taught/tested includes science and technology as academic subjects. If a language program involves a professionally heterogeneous group of learners, a variety of authentic discourse types need to be tested/taught. Some cloze passages are more appropriate than others for language teaching, testing, and learning. Tests and distractors are included. (Author/JK)",

The development of an instrument for language assessment of Greek bilingual children is presented and traced. The subjects for the development of the instrument were 403 male and female first through fourth grade students enrolled in bilingual programs in the U.S. The final instrument consists of 80 items, 40 for the Greek and 40 for the English text, 30 of which are designed to elicit a response to a verbal stimulus using multiple choice pictorial alternatives. Each multiple  choice item consists of a word stimulus to be matched to one of a series of five related pictures that follows. The remaining items are verbal stimuli in sentence form, designed to elicit a grammatically and syntactically correct answer to a question. Examination of the instrument in relation to field-test data, internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, reliability by school and sex, and validity demonstrated that the instrument possesses high reliability and usable validity values.

It is suggested that a communicative or functional or functional-notional syllabus must not be viewed in contrast to a structural or grammatical syllabus. Functional notions are necessary inclusions into the class and into texts, but language cannot and does not function independently of structure. In reviewing the functional-notional approach and speech act theory, an application of functional notions to ESL instruction is discussed using a currently available ESL textbook. This application includes the revision of pattern drills to include extending the situation of the drill to the classroom itself, involving the students in role-playing, and incorporating alternate  linguistic and nonverbal devices. Among the class assignments discussed is the selection of communicative language functions common to all language usage and their subsequent classification into type of illocutionary act. Both this assignment and others mentioned aim to inform the students that language is a functional tool. However, ideas cannot function to inform, instruct, request, etc. until they are set in some linguistic form. (JK)",

Research aids practitioners in more effective program planning, implementation, and evaluation. To compensate for the time lag in availability of materials, concerned teachers must keep up with current research, analyze its findings, and apply them to their teaching approaches and instructional materials. This paper presents: (1) an overview of major research areas in second language acquisition and refers to a sample of studies whose findings have clear implications for the classroom, (2) a second language learning model that incorporates many of the recent research findings into a taxonomic  scheme, and (3) criteria and guidelines for applying second language acquisition research findings to the bilingual classroom. Four major areas of importance to the classroom teacher in current second language acquisition research are the comparison of first and second language acquisition; social, affective, and cognitive factors; second language input; and second language learning in school settings.

It suggests that a self-pacing individualized option should be available to students to deal with unique problems. The problems may be dealt with by identifying the range of possible causes of the learning difficulty and by suggesting specific remedial activities that correspond directly to that difficulty. With this as the aim, the report discusses cognitive styles and learning strategies, labeling the learning problem, some diagnostic instruments and procedures for determining sources of difficulty, and classroom activities for responding to learner needs. Among these activities are:  (1) the analysis of samples of the language with attention to linguistic and semantic units; (2) the synthesis of elements of the language to create an organized whole; (3) the paraphrasing, expansion, or transformation of ideas; (4) the analysis and synthesis of information to make inferences about missing cues or conclusions; and (5) the expansion of capacities for remembering words, phrases, sentences, grammatical features, and ideas in the foreign language. Sample exercises are provided in French, Spanish, and German. (JK)",

        "description":"Concentration on the formal features of language and on developing speaking skills in a second language fails to provide the language student with the necessary level of conversational ability. The concept of communicative competence has resulted in a new emphasis on the nature of interaction and the rules of discourse. Interest has shifted from studies on language structure to studies on social interaction, the meaning of utterances, and the functions of speech. This paper explores how recent advances in sociolinguistics and discourse analysis can aid one's understanding of the roles and privileges of teachers and students engaged in verbal interaction and how verbal behavior can be changed or acquired for greater conversational competence. Areas discussed include: (1) natural  discourse (speech acts, pragmatics, turn taking, moves, topic), (2) natural discourse and first and second language acquisition, (3) classroom discourse, and (4) practical applications (including exercises for developing skills for participating in debates and discussions). Excerpts from English, French, and German language conversations are cited throughout. The appendices present hesitation and expansion strategies in conversation and some conversational management strategies used by French and German native speakers. (JK)",

Discourse analysis provides an understanding of those skills second language learners need to acquire to converse with native speakers and an understanding of how these skills may most beneficially be acquired. These skills are both linguistic and communicative. One way to combine them and to prepare ESL students to converse with native English speakers is to practice conversation, use conversational English, and introduce various conversational techniques. The focus of this report is to discuss: (1) aspects of conversational language, (2) pre-conversation activities, (3) passage from controlled to free conversation, and (4)  conversation activities. Among the conversation activities included are roleplay, question-and-answer activities, class discussions, problem solving, games, and other group activities. A variety of sample exercises, dialogues, and suggested activities are included. A discussion of conversation in the classroom points out the importance of identification of teacher and student role.

        "description":"This booklet proposes to approach the teaching of French from a multicultural perspective. The introductory section presents the reasons for recommending this orientation and the pedagogical advantages to be derived from it, emphasizing the fact that French serves as a link between several Francophone nations and their widely different cultures. Accordingly, a multicultural approach is viewed as more realistic than one that focuses solely on France, and more likely to broaden the appeal of the language as a tool for international communication. The second section offers a panorama of the Francophone regions of the world, with brief introductions to the historical and linguistic contexts into which the French language and culture were thrust, and with a list of basic readings on  Francophone literature. The third section presents various activities for teaching about the cultures of the French-speaking world, arranged by level of language proficiency. The fourth section suggests ways of making or collecting instructional materials. The fifth section, a selected bibliography and guide to resources, lists sources of print and audiovisual materials for each Francophone region, including addresses of U.S. distributors and of Francophone nations' embassies in Washington.

The first section presents an outline for a six-part interdisciplinary unit for foreign language and journalism teachers. The purpose of the unit is to prepare for the promotion of Foreign Language Week. The unit also illustrates how foreign language teachers can relate their curricula to other disciplines in their schools through the promotion of their programs. The second section presents a compilation of Foreign Language Week materials used in Washington State. It includes extensive  examples and details on reaching various community constituencies. Section three presents a step-by-step process for presenting an educational issue to the community. A format is discussed for bringing together representatives of business, government, the media, civic organizations, and education. In the fourth section, examples of promotion and press pieces developed to use at the annual state foreign language conference as a public relations event are presented.

This report attempts to provide these institutions with a general picture of the ESL situation today and to suggest ways in which they might sensibly assess and respond to the functional, sociocultural, and educational needs of their English speaking members. Two different types of communities of second language speakers are identified. One is the relatively stable, permanent community whose members need to function with near-native proficiency in English. The other is transitory and temporary and their language needs will vary depending on the domains in which they  operate. For the former group, educational needs may take precedence while for the latter group sociocultural and functional requirements are preeminent. Topics reviewed include: (1) the needs assessment process including the identification of language-minority communities, determining community goals, and determining the extent of needs; and (2) characteristic assessment practices of some specific communities including public schools, colleges and universities, junior/community colleges, corporate programs, and adult basic education programs.

Veltman discovered that minority languages in the United States are following the patterns of previous immigrant languages: while first generation newcomers speak their native language and learn some English, their offspring are likely to learn English first. The parents' language is seldom used by the majority in subsequent generations. A panel reacted to the findings as follows: (1) methodological difficulties regarding interpretation of results were presented, (2) Spanish language maintenance was cited as a fact, and (3) the belief was expressed that language assimilation should not be equated with cultural or ethnic  assimilation. Implications of the findings and of the discussion for policy were set forth: (1) bilingual education alone will not curb trends in language attrition, although this is not a legitimate argument against bilingual education; (2) the need for a national language policy is clearer than before; (3) Hispanics are special; (4) the situation in the U.S. does not parallel that in Canada; and (5) the role of mass communication in assimilation is instrumental.

        "description":"An examination of existing data was conducted to determine the effects of different kindergarten options on subsequent academic achievement in French immersion programs. It was concluded that there was no evidence for any superiority in outcomes for full-day bilingual as compared to half-day French kindergarten. No clear trends emerged in the comparison of full-day bilingual vs. half-day English groups at the grade 1 level, although differences in French skills were apparent between these two groups in grades 2 and 3. These trends are interpreted as tentative evidence that exposure to French in kindergarten influences subsequent performance in French. Analysis of further studies confirmed this interpretation, although several studies indicated the possibility of students who did  not experience French kindergarten closing the gap in French skills. Virtually no data were found that considered possible differential effects on half-day vs. full-day kindergartens on students with different background characteristics. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"A varieties grammar (VG) attempts to provide a unifying apparatus for various kinds of language varieties: diatopic, diastratic, and diatypic. The notion of \"family grammar\" appears to be especially useful in that process since it permits the postulation of a supergrammar for the whole family as well as that of subgrammars for the individual members. In order to restrict the scope of a VG, the present approach defines varieties as typolects, which are interpreted as contrasting with idiolects. In order to make the theory of a VG applicable to pedagogical purposes the notion of a VG is further restricted to that of the grammar of a repertoire of varieties as it might exist for real speakers of English. The consideration of the needs of speakers of English as a second language  leads to a redefinition of grammar in holistic terms, i.e., to an inclusion of sociocultural aspects of language into the framework of the grammar. While it is impossible to write a VG for all the varieties of English, it seems to be possible to set up ad hoc VGs of English, for instance, for English for special purposes. (Author)",

        "description":"A project at Alverno College, a Catholic liberal arts college for women, that focuses on the way liberal education can enhance the undergraduate student's growth in ethical perception, moral reasoning, and related abilities, is described. Attention is directed to how commitment to this project began 10 years ago and to general philosophic and pedagogic concerns. Examples of how the curriculum has been rethought and reshaped are presented, and the approaches of instructors in various disciplines to examining the valuing dimension and to implementing challenging teaching/learning strategies are considered. Detailed examples of assessment techniques, including samples of student performances and how they were judged with respect to the student's development, are presented. Program  evaluation efforts, which included internal and external tests, are reviewed, and information is presented on what is currently understood about the valuing process and how Alverno students developed. The college's goal was to help the student develop fluency in the process by which she actively engages her values in personal, professional, and societal contexts in which she must choose, decide, and act. Six levels of the valuing process have been distinguished: sharpening awareness of what is involved in making value judgments and decisions; developing the ability to infer valuing and trace its sources by focusing on literary, artistic, historical, philosophical, and religious works; developing the ability to infer and analyze valuing implications in scientific and technological systems;  applying valuing first-hand in complex decision-making situations; applying valuing in intercultural settings; and focusing on valuing holistically. It is suggested that components of the valuing process can be described as knowing, judging, and acting. (SW)",

        "description":"Ways are discussed that internal changes in pricing, tuition collection, and cash-flow management might be sources of financial aid for college students ineligible for state and federal assistance programs. The experiences described are the result of two FIPSE (Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education) projects, one dealing with &quot;unbundling,&quot; the other with tuition deferral and installment programs for working adults. The first part of this report examines the issue of whether the traditional tuition pricing system based on credit hours could be made equitable for part-time working adults, and how internal changes in pricing, tuition, and cash management could provide aid. This practice is called &quot;unbundling,&quot; since it can untie from the traditional pricing system a  range of traditional ancillary and student services that the nontraditional student may not wish to use or pay for. The second section examines the possible uses of unbundling to improve or assess quality in part-time education. It asks what advantages and disadvantages might accrue if institutions were to quote separate prices for instruction, assessment of direct instruction, counseling, certification, and other services. Unbundling is also viewed as a consumer protection measure. In the third section results in a 1980 survey of the &quot;Fortune 500&quot; companies on their employee tuition assistance programs and policies are reported. Responses from 361 companies to the questionnaire (which is included) are charted, without narrative analysis. The questionnaire elicited responses about the  companies' policies on eligibility, kinds of courses allowed, dollar limits, course-load limits, and aid payment timing. (MSE)",

Topics discussed include: the history of City College, urban higher education, open admissions, the liberal arts, ethnic studies, professional training, biomedical education, community outreach of the college, fund-raising for urban public education, the tax-levy budget, and private fund-raising. It is argued that during the years between 1964 and 1970, colleges and universities were the centers of disruptions and social explosions that emanated from social, economic, political ethnic, and generational forces. Many American campuses were physically surrounded by racial minorities whose expectations and  anticipations had been elevated to new highs by federal court decisions and legislation in the earlier years of the decade, and whose disappointment and frustration of the nonrealization of the promised improvements turned later to rage and hostility toward society, government, and the educational system itself. The response of City College in the seventies through education for urban students, improvement of the physical plant, and community outreach is documented. (CC)",

Criteria for equivalency outcomes, the second set, includes: an evaluating agency, an evaluation coordinator, coordinator qualifications, content objectives with basis in an authoritative professional content document or documents, evaluation instruments (cognitive, psychomotor, and affective), minimum performance levels, and agency records.

        "description":"The potential value of marketing principles to help solve educational problems in higher education is addressed. Four variables that are within the decision power of those in higher education and those in the commercial world are the product, distribution, promotion, and price. The marketing concept demands that policies be built on a base of customer needs and wants and requires serious research of the market. In the business world, sales depend upon customers perceiving value of the product being sold, while the higher education institution must offer something of value to students, donors, and others. For example, auxiliary services beyond education may be important to students (i.e., day care centers so that mothers can attend classes). It is claimed that teachers and the  academic community have the responsibility to provide a realistic information base that the students can use to assess how to use the education they are receiving. It is suggested that good selling on the part of faculty members will continue to be an important ingredient for attracting and retaining students. Faculty also need to gather data that can determine which curricula are marketable on both a short-term and long-term basis. It is important for college administrators to conduct research to determine what influenced a student's college choice so that they can undertake realistic institutional planning and reform. It is suggested that college pricing has generally been rigid and may have worked against the growth of some segments of the institution. Variable pricing of tuition may  be a reasonable alternative. The value of promotion techniques and a marketing plan is noted. (SW)",

It is suggested that a college or university operation can be examined within the same context as any product organization, if focus is on basic customer groups. The university can be viewed as marketing services; research services to society generally and institutions specifically; instructional services to both undergraduate, graduate, and nondegree customers; and auxiliary services to the public, such as theater and football. It is suggested that variable pricing of tuition offers a reasonable alternative to higher education pricing. Variable pricing  would provide a better balance and relate costs more realistically to demand, although it would have a detrimental effect on high-priced special programs. It is suggested that many colleges need to assess their current advertising approach and perhaps undertake a readership study of its catalog to determine what students and parents have or have not read or to determine why and how they arrived at the decision to register at the school. A market analysis tool that may be helpful to higher education is psychographic segmentation: examination of the behavioral patterns or life styles of various groups within the total market. It is suggested that if colleges carefully managed their marketing functions, they would assume the responsibility to provide an information base that students could  use to assess the education they received.

It uses information currently being produced but not reported, and takes into account user feedback. Only instructional revenue and operating costs are considered. Model components include: (1) an instructional personnel profit or loss statement, which takes into account teaching activities (measured in student full-time-equivalents and representing direct revenues) and salaries (direct costs) of  each faculty member; and (2) the departmental instructional profit or loss statement comparing totals in four categories of instructional revenues (faculty and support position salaries, operating funds, program improvement funds, and equipment funds) to the corresponding four categories of actual expenditures. By carefully analyzing these components the department may choose to increase revenues, decrease expenses, or do both.

        "description":"A study was undertaken in the winter and spring quarters of 1980, addressing aspects of the baccalaureate application, admission, advising, and graduation processes at the General College of the University of Minnesota, a nontraditional postsecondary education program. Among the issues addressed were these: the distribution and trends of baccalaureate applicants in the schools and divisions, admissions success ratios, admissions response time, graduation rates in the school and among division, and advising flow and advisor load. Data were drawn from three institutional databases: baccalaureate program information file cards, committee action lists, and graduation lists. The results, presented in narrative and chart form in this report, indicate that 32 percent fewer students  applied to the college's baccalaureate programs in the final year of the study (1980) than in its initial year (1976), a fact awating further study. However, the application figure for the final year represented an upswing from the previous year. Admissions success rates were inversely related to application rates, with proportionately more applicants being admitted toward the study's end. Divisional data generally followed the college-wide trends in these areas. However, divisional advising loads were not found to be equitable, with the science, business, and math division bearing the greatest load and the arts, communication, and philosophy divison having the smallest load. The composite adjusted time taken by the college to respond to an admission application was found to be seven  weeks for 76 percent of applicants, or as high as 85-89 percent in some individual years. A sample student record card and notes on data compilation are appended. (MSE)",

        "description":"A study was undertaken in 1980 of employment attitudes among faculty at the General College of the University of Minnesota, an institution for nontraditional postsecondary education. The long form of the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire was used, with a new demographic questionnaire substituted. The survey sample consisted of 96 teaching, administrative, and student service faculty members employed at least half-time. Results show three work-related factors that strongly satisfy General College faculty: moral values, social service, and activity. It is suggested that these factors might be used in the future to improve overall faculty satisfaction and in faculty recruitment. The identified work-related areas of dissatisfaction cluster around organization and management  functions, and include advancement, compensation, and company organization and policies. Full professors were relatively satisfied with advancement; men were more satisfied than women with advancement and security; Ph.D. faculty were more satisfied with security and creativity; those with the longest service were most satisfied with security, social status, and working conditions; faculty with salaries of $30,000 or over were most satisfied with advancement, security, and compensation; and full-time faculty, with moral values, security, and variety. Instructors showed most satisfaction with authority, co-workers, creativity, recognition, responsibility, social status, supervision-human relations, and supervision-technical relations. Female faculty were more satisfied with achievement,  activity, authority, and social service, and less satisfied with advancement and security. Other satisfaction levels and categories are highlighted in the report. The survey has resulted in development of faculty hiring, promotion, and tenure guidelines; small group discussion on job reinforcers; and development of a questionnaire more oriented toward the General College environment. The demographic questionnaire is appended. (MSE)",

Highlights include the following: There was a modest decline in entering freshmen over the previous year, consistent with projections in the statewide plan. The decline was not uniform across sectors, with a higher decline at Rutgers University than at state, independent, and community colleges. Women continued to comprise the majority of freshmen at 52 percent. The racial/ethnic distribution was six percent Hispanic, 12 percent black, and 82 percent &quot;other&quot; (including white, American Indian/Alaskan native, Asian/Pacific Islander, and non-resident aliens). The greatest percentage decline was among blacks.  A two to three percent decline occurred in all age groups except 35 and over, in which it grew about one percent in the last year. The number of New Jersey residents declined by four percent in the last year, while out-of-state residents increased 13 percent, although state residents did increase in the community college sector. Of the freshmen in senior institutions who are high school graduates, 70 percent were in the top two-fifths of their high school classes, an improvement over the previous year. Students' Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) verbal component scores remained about the same, with the proportion of math scores over 500 declining two percent. Tables show distributions of students characteristics such as sex, ethnicity, age, geographic origin, class rank, and SAT scores as  well as five-year trends.

        "description":"English language sociological research on higher education in Canada from 1970-1980 is reviewed. Functionalists have tended to concentrate upon the task of describing the perceived functions of the educational system in the society and have usually considered major educational change as occurring in response to the requirements of the polity and the economy. Conflict theorists tend to emphasize features of social life that involve conflict, coercion, and the struggle for scarce resources. Some evidence indicates that the university expansion has not been accompanied by more than a small increase in the participation rates of lower class student relative to the participation of students from the more privileged classes. Community college students in two-year terminal programs  appear to be representative of all socioeconomic groups in the Canadian population, while undergraduate students and community college transfer students appear to be much more likely to be drawn from the upper socioeconomic strata. Findings concerning the relationship between social background, level of educational attainment, and occupational choice are analyzed. It is suggested that the sociological study of educational organizations, including universities and colleges, has hardly begun in Canada, and that even the postsecondary expansion of the 1960s stimulated no substantial flow of research on Canadian campus life or student attitudes. Another neglected research field is the academic profession, the Canadian professoriate. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Alternative educational delivery systems that might be useful to community colleges are considered. The following categories of delivery systems are covered: broadcast delivery systems; copy delivery systems, print delivery systems, computer delivery systems, telephone delivery systems, and satellites. Among the applications for broadcast television are: open circuit television, instructional television fixed services, cable television, and slow-scan or compressed video. Two main categories of radio instructional applications are the primary carrier and the SCA or subcarrier. Copy delivery systems are those that deliver programs in the form of tapes, discs, or cassettes through a physical distribution system rather than being transmitted electronically. Copy delivery systems  include: videocassette, videodisc, and audiocassette. The two major forms of print delivery systems available are correspondence courses and courses by newspaper. Two well-known forms of computer assisted instruction are TICCIT and PLATO, while two types of computer managed instruction are RSVP and ORACLE. Four ways in which the telephone is being used as an alternative delivery system are: teleconferencing, telelecture, telewriting, and dial access. Satellites extend the distribution and delivery of services to persons and places not otherwise served or inadequately served, and they increase the quality and number of services and programs for areas already served and at affordable cost. Among the reasons that many of these systems are not being used are cost, opposition to change, and  lack of understanding on the part of county and state board members and state legislators as to what the students need and want.

Six categories of delivery systems are described: broadcast delivery systems, copy delivery systems, print delivery systems, computer delivery systems, telephone delivery, and satellite delivery systems.

Two major forms of print delivery systems are correspondence courses and courses by newspaper. Additionally, computer managed instruction and computer assisted instruction, and various applications for broadcast television and radio are  described. Important considerations in selecting an alternative system include the target audience, the nature of the course content, the cost, and the availability of software or courses to meet identified needs. Points to consider when previewing courseware for use via an alternative delivery system include: the local need or demand, the interest level of the media component; course design and learner objectives; the flexibility of course materials; and whether the materials encourage active participation by the student. Operational support is probably the most overlooked and underrated factor in implementing alternative delivery systems. Students enrolled in alternative delivery courses and faculty teaching these courses require much more than do teachers and students in the classroom.  Support functions might include using a microcomputer to do course evaluations and test scoring. (SW)",

(2) Guidelines and funding mechanisms for addressing the need for adult continuing education should be developed and coordinated  with various providers of educational opportunities in academic institutions, governmental agencies, business, or industry. (3) The needs of education consumers should be clarified in surveys. (4) Manpower demand and supply analysis for selected fields should be conducted. (5) Regional (multi-state) planning and resource sharing should be encouraged. (6) A state-level student loan program should encourage access to any institution. (7) The concept of a state-wide postsecondary education agency is endorsed to plan postsecondary education and to advise the governor, the legislature, and the educational community. (8) Community colleges should maintain an open admissions policy and low levels of tuition and fee charges for community college students. Further suggestions are made for program  offerings, vocational planning, adult basic education, and budgeting. (SW)",

Resource allocation has been addressed from the cost side alone (without taking into account the value of output) through a wide range of studies,  from individual institutions to the national university system. Alternative arrangements for financing higher education have received proportionately more attention than in the United States or the United Kingdom due to the continuing dilemma of federal responsibility for manpower, economic development, and regional equity and the provincial responsibility for education. Much of the current research effort is at the institutional and provincial level, with emphasis on the flow of persons through the system. This includes the development of numerous forecasting models to predict enrollments according to program of faculty, institution, and province. Another recent research innovation has been an analysis of the economic impact of educational institutions on their geographic communities.  Much current research activities tends to be descriptive.

Fifty-five percent of all freshmen reported having taken their first drink with friends by age 15; 10 percent reported that they did not drink. Males reported higher frequency of use of both beer and whiskey than did females, while females drank dinner wine more often than males. In comparison with females, males tended to have been drunk more often, to have driven more often after having at least three drinks, and were more likely to say that most of their friends drink. Males drank most frequently in public places such as cars, ballgames, or  concerts, while females drank most often in restaurants or lounges. Males and females also differed on several drinking attitude questions. Males more often thought alcohol safer than marihuana, barbituates, amphetamines, opiates, and psychedelics than did females. Males more often thought their parents preferred them to use alcohol rather than marihuana than did females. It is concluded that there are different patterns of drinking behavior and attitudes for different groups of students and for different types of alcohol, and that these differences are important in understanding alcohol use among students.

The results indicated that the revised form elicited responses that paralleled those reported for the standard SAS. Principal components factor analyses, using squared multiple correlations as commonality estimates, were conducted on the combined A and B forms. The factor configurations suggested that students responded to the items in each situation as a unit. The first 10 factors extracted appeared to represent each of the 10 situations. (The situations include: new family in your apartment complex, personnel office announces promotion preferences, children bused to school, union adds new  apprentices, best friend engaged, stopped by policeman, neighbor joins swimming pool association, medical school admission slots, neighborhood changes, and financial aid office reserves jobs.) White students tended to react with more negative feelings when situations involved proximity, interaction, or competition with blacks than when race was not specified. All 10 items referring to a situation involving preference in promotions received a more negative response when preference was given to black employees than when the employees' races were unspecified. As in previous SAS administrations, the situation that portrayed an engagement of a best friend (white with black) also elicited highly significant differences by form.

        "description":"At the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP), 352 white freshmen completed the Situational Attitude Scale (SAS) in a study of racial attitudes. The SAS (1972) was developed to minimize the degree of subject withdrawal from the measurement of racial attitudes and to eliminate the &quot;social set&quot; problem that keeps subjects' real feelings hidden. The results showed generally negative attitudes about blacks, particularly in situations of black neighbors or a friend becoming engaged to a black. Women were found to be more positive towards blacks than men in situations allowing more social distance, but tended to be more negative than men in situations requiring intimate black-white contact. This same pattern of results has existed at UMCP since the late 1960s despite many changes  in the social context of the campus and society, including increased racial diversity on campus. The findings indicate that whites do possess negative/racist attitudes towards blacks in a variety of situations; that the situational context does make a difference in determining attitudes; that white females do have different racial attitudes than do white males; that these differences appear to fall along a physical distance/safe-unsafe continuum. It is concluded that workshops and classes designed to eliminate racism should be funded and endorsed by all levels of administration and faculty. (Author/LB)",

        "description":"In a study of 404 University of Maryland, College Park, incoming freshmen who complete an anonymous poll regarding their behavior and attitudes toward drugs, approximately 60 percent reported using marihuana. Thirty-five percent said they used it once a month or more. Hashish had been sampled by about one-third of the freshmen, with 10 percent using it once a month or more. About 15 percent acknowledged having used cocaine, speed, downers, and PCP; however, fewer than five percent reported using these substances once a month or more often. DMT, heroin, mescaline, and LSD had been tried by five percent or less of the freshmen respondents, and monthly or more frequent usage of these substances was reported by fewer than one percent of those sampled. Alcoholic beverages were the  most frequently used substances. Over 90 percent of the incoming freshmen had drunk beer, wine, or hard liquor, and over half drank once a month or more frequently. Cigarettes had been tried by about 48 percent of the sample, which was roughly equivalent to the percentage who had tried marihuana. Twenty-two percent continued using cigarettes once a month or more often. The most frequently cited reasons for drinking alcoholic beverages were to get drunk, to relieve boredom, and to be more friendly. For other substances, the most frequent reason was to get high; the only exception was cigarette smoking, which was done to relieve general anxiety, tension, nervousness, and irritability.

        "description":"Two hundred sixty-six white freshmen (128 males, 138 females) were administered the Situational Attitude Scale (SAS) to assess their attitudes toward blacks in a number of personal and social situations. Results of two-way analyses of variance indicated that significant differences occurred by sex and form of the SAS. Differences between the two forms, one that depicted blacks, and the other, which did not mention race, were taken as evidence for a differential reaction to blacks. Regardless of form, women reacted more negatively than men to situations regarding rape, a magazine salesman, and men loitering on a corner; men felt more negative about new neighbors, a friend's engagement, and a new member of a social group. On form, regardless of sex, whites reacted most negatively  to blacks as new neighbors, and a friend being engaged to a black. Whites tended to react positively to blacks in service roles (selling magazines, policeman). The interaction of sex and form was not significant. These results, along with previous samples of freshmen, suggest that whites have had and continue to hold basically negative attitudes toward blacks, and the pattern of those negative attitudes has remained the same for a decade.

The sample was 86 percent white, 9 percent black, and 5 percent other minority groups (largely Hispanic and Asian American). White students were found to differ from minority students on several dimensions within the areas of background, attitude, and perceptions of self and environment. In addition, black and non-black minorities were found to have differences in demographic and academic backgrounds, needs, and attitudes. Minority group students were found to be more likely than white students to aspire to an educational degree beyond the bachelor's degree. Staying in school was more likely to depend on part-time  employment for all minority students than for white students. There were additional differences in financial need and anticipated retention within the minority groups. Black students were significantly more likely than white and non-black minority students to feel that if they left the university before receiving a degree, it would be due to financial hardship. While there was little agreement with the statement &quot;I thought seriously about not going to college,&quot; non-black males disagreed the most strongly with it and non-black females evidenced the least disagreement.

Salary and the adequacy of free time were seen as the main reasons for deciding to teach or not to teach summer school. Most faculty activity during the summer consisted of teaching (42 percent), research (25 percent), and writing (17 percent). Faculty did not want either shorter or longer summer sessions, were against visiting faculty, and generally did not see summer school students as different from those attending during the academic year. Faculty were not in favor of a special workshop for themselves, and held relatively positive views of the summer school administration. The best things about summer school were seen as smaller classes, better  faculty/student interaction, and a schedule that allowed for time off during the summer. The worst things were seen as low pay, lack of time to cover material, conditioning teaching contracts, and classes meeting every day. No differences were found by sex, rank, or amount of summer teaching experience; however, there were differences of opinion found when faculty were grouped according to 10-month salary level.

Preliminary results of a study using the model to examine both white and minority student predictors of retention is discussed. It is shown that for the first semester GPA, there appears to be a strong relationship between the seven noncognitive predictors and retention, especially for minority students. When Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores were used with noncognitive measures, many of the previously significant noncognitive items were no longer significant, especially in the white sample. This trend occurred less in the minority analsyes.  It is suggested that, for whites, these noncognitive predictors are tapping dimensions that overlap or are related to the traditional SAT scores, but this is not true for blacks. For blacks, traits separate from what is tapped by SAT scores appear to be related to GPA for the first semester in college. (Author/LB)",

        "description":"The use of simulation games is considered by which the college teacher addresses selected topics by having students engage in activities that approximate the realities of a social situation. Simulations offer a stimulus for examining theoretical models and their applicability to everyday social situations. The Prisoner's Dilemma is presented as an example of a frame game, or a game that can be played with a changed scenario and payoff chart while allowing essentially the same preparation, rules, and strategy for introducing, running, and debriefing. The Prisoner's Dilemma presents a situation where pairs of players must decide what they will do as prisoners: confess or not confess to a crime that they are accused of committing together. The players make their decisions  independently and without knowing what the other will decide. The players make 10 separate decisions while sitting back-to-back during 10 rounds of play. Among the cognitive objectives of the game are: to learn that under the American criminal justice system a person can often obtain a reduced sentence by turning state's evidence and bargaining for leniency; to learn that the pursuit of one's own self-interest does not necessarily lead to social benefit; and to learn that people who make the same decisions often have different reasons for those decisions. Affective objectives are to feel the effects of restricted communication when making decisions directly involving other people and to discover that under pressure they may behave in a way that they normally find morally objectionable. A  checklist for using games for instructional purposes is included. (SW)",

Using the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business award as a model, attention is directed to why awards are important, who can give them and to whom, and how to develop an awards program. An award or prize is defined as any form of recognition bestowed upon an individual, organization, or group in order to acknowledge efforts in promoting equity for women. Although consideration is given primarily to awards in the academic community, many of the concepts will be applicable to awards given in other settings, including awards given by community organizations and businesses. Awards that recognize efforts to bring about equity for women in academe can: increase awareness of  women's programs and achievements; legitimize activities designed to promote educational equity for women; stimulate others to develop similar equity-promoting activities or programs; identify specific winners and specific award programs as models; and encourage the development of similar award programs in other settings and/or by others in the same fields. Specific types of programs and materials for which awards can be granted, different types of awards, and specific types of organizations and institutions that might offer awards are listed.

Development of the longitudinal file (1974-75 through 1977-78) containing statistics on virtually all U.S. colleges are discussed, along with reliability and validity issues regarding the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) data. Sixty-one indicators were selected as possibly being related to institutional viability. All had been suggested by experts in the field, used in previous research, or published in reports on the status of higher education  institutions. To validate the relation of these indicators to institutional viability, certain colleges were identified as probably being in distress in each year based on a combination of objective measures in the file: closure; default on a federal loan; and extreme enrollment declines, reduction in faculty salaries, declines in current fund balances (for private colleges), and declines in current fund revenues (for public colleges). Almost no public universities, four-year colleges, or private universities were identified as being in distress. The indicators found to be related to distress were used to construct a summary index of viability defined separately for each educational sector. The summary measure of viability accurately classified colleges as being in distress in the year  for which it was developed--1978. Distributions of the summary measure (converted into five grades of viability--&quot;A&quot; down to &quot;E&quot;) are displayed for a variety of different kinds of colleges (e.g., traditionally black colleges, women's colleges, two-year vocational colleges). Twelve kinds of colleges were found to frequently receive low scores on the summary measures (i.e., grades of &quot;D&quot; or &quot;E&quot;). Means on the 61 indicators are appended. (Author/LB)",

        "description":"Developed as part of the Mission, Role, and Scope Procedures projects, conducted from 1977 through 1979 by the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS), this book identifies topics to be covered in determining an institution's mission and how such a determination could be achieved through traditional, campus based, academic decision-making processes. It is suggested that the retrenchment era confronting higher education brings demands for planners to use strategic planning as a tool for integrating curricular, financial, and personnel planning more carefully. An understanding of the institution's mission provides a framework for achieving the needed integration in addressing these issues. The book is intended for several different audiences: senior  institutional administrators, those charged with long-range planning or self-study responsibilities, faculty self-study committee members, and state master-planners. Part One, &quot;Mission Review in Higher Education,&quot; discusses the history of planning in higher education, mission review as a foundation for planning and decision-making, the content of a mission statement, conducting mission review, and conclusions. Part Two presents the SUNY-Albany Mission Statement, including SUNY-Albany abstracts of three-year plans for each institutional unit. Mission review is concluded to: (1) serve as an invaluable foundation for campus planning and budgeting activity, (2) require careful organization and broad development, (3) be most successful when approached from a strategic-planning perspective, (4)  continue to grow in importance at the state level, and (5) receive increased attention in institutional planning. A supplemental section discusses state-level mission review and identifies ways that state-level review differs from institutional mission studies. Issues of centralization and standardization are among those discussed. A bibliography is included. (LC)",

        "description":"To examine the relative attractiveness of program offerings for different types of higher education institutions and the relation of these offerings to the viability of the institutions, three data sources were used to derive eight composite indexes describing the market values of degrees awarded by colleges and universities. The indexes, termed Higher Education Product-Value Indexes (HEPVI), describe the program offerings and changes in program offerings over time for schools in six institutional sectors and 18 National Center for Higher Education Management Systems institutional classifications. Several of these measures are shown to be significantly correlated with the levels of distress experienced by higher education institutions in three of the six sectors. The principal  data sources were the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS), the &quot;Occupational Outlook Handbook,&quot; published by the U.S. Department of Labor, and the annual surveys of starting salary offers made to recent graduates conducted by the College Placement Council. The eight indexes calculated for each institution were weighted by the proportion of degrees awarded by the institution at the various levels in each field. For research purposes, the HEPVI measures serve as first-approximation indicators allowing, for example, the examination of the relationship between program offerings at institutions and the financial health of these institutions. The HEPVI estimates are not suitable for evaluating or ranking individual institutions. Additional details and data relevant to the  construction of the indexes are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Attitudes and behavior of students and employees at The University of Maryland, College Park, regarding the Maryland Student Union (MSU) were surveyed. The typical respondent was a single, white, undergraduate female, who commuted to school and was likely to use the MSU approximately four times a week. There was a generally positive attitude toward the MSU among students and employees. The MSU was viewed as a facility where students (more than employees) could go to meet with friends. International and black undergraduates were more likely to feel this way than were graduate students. After 7:00 p.m. during the week was the most convenient time for most respondents to attend MSU programs; films (40 percent), arts and crafts fairs (36 percent), and games and tournaments (20  percent) were the programs attended by the largest percentages. The textbook store, fast food restaurant, rest rooms, bulletin boards, the movie theater, and the information center were the resources used by the largest proportion of individuals. The wide use of information and publicity services such as the bulletin boards, the information center, and the school newspaper dispenser highlights the role of the MSU as an information exchange for the campus. These services were likely to have a greater frequency of use by MSU patrons than other services. International students tended to differ most often from the other groups in the use of food services; they use the food services at the MSU more frequently for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. (SW)",

        "description":"Perspectives on reform in theological education are considered. It is suggested that the lack of coherence in theological education is primarily due to the conflict between certain sociopolitical realities that place antithetical demands on faculty and administrators of theological schools. Conflict between the academic study of religious phenomena and the study of matters that affect the governance of the church, or between theory and practice, is at issue. Reform might involve designing courses focusing on major global issues facing the church and taught by faculty teams, including members of the arts ministry (practical) as well as the systematic and historical (academic) faculty. For example, Christian education might focus on developing the ability to reflect and communicate  a theological &quot;on-look&quot; on major world issues within the realm of responsibility for church governance. Additionally, the present emphasis of methodological survey and practice could be altered to include a theological critique of contemporary schools of thought in education, psychology, sociology, and models of management. One major category in the new curriculum would be foundation studies that provide an introduction to historical/systematic studies and arts of ministry studies. Interpretive studies would allow students to elect courses taught in the traditional disciplines, and integrative studies would include the courses covering global issues. Another priority area for revised theological studies would be the spiritual discipline. If this type of reform is implemented, faculty must  be allowed greater freedom in the allocation of time, and institutional reward systems must consider the new and more collaborative style of research and teaching.

Project thrusts were: to develop assessment instruments for judging the success of faculty development programs; to provide formative and summative evaluation for the programs of the 24 participating institutions; and to explore the effectiveness of a number of strategies aimed at faculty growth in a variety of institutional settings. After a literature search on potential goals of the faculty development program, experts rated item and suggested criteria for evaluating whether particular goals had been reached. Site visits and case studies of the faculty development programs at the 24 schools were undertaken, along with the  design and administration of seven survey instruments. There were four principal surveys (on the faculty role, on teaching, on scholarship, and on program evaluation), plus a demographic sheet, and two secondary surveys (faculty viewing students, and administrators defining scholarly activity for their faculty). Among the findings are the following: faculty apparently have a highly internal set of criteria for judging their classroom performance which is supported by personal experience with students and is relatively free from colleagues' and supervisors' opinions; the professor's task is to transmit knowledge and skill to able people who agree with the teacher's goals; most faculty will lecture regardless of the course size or level; improving teaching in the classroom was the faculty's  leading desire, followed by the desire to improve interpersonal skills. Sample survey forms are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Approaches to promoting justice education on a Catholic university campus are considered. A model of experiential learning for the sake of justice, based on the insights of liberation theology and research on cognitive development and style, suggests that there are a variety of instances within campus life where skills of justice can be learned. Another approach is that of programming centers, which can be utilized on campus to educate for justice and to make justice education an integral part of the mission of the university. The conditions for institutionalizing these programming centers, for insuring an appropriate resource base for them, and staffing approaches are examined. The experiential learning model has four major movements: awareness of institutional dilemmas and  success (experiences of injustice and justice); critical reflection on dilemmas and successes to understand the social context of these experiences; creative formation of change models; and testing implications of change models in new situations through individual and group action that sustains or modifies the structures of the institution. This model can help understand how students learn the skills of justice in settings such as residence halls, student government, and curriculum development. The approach of programming centers, or justice centers, promotes recruitment and retention of students and faculty committed to justice, and facilitates scholarship and research on major justice issues (e.g., racism, world hunger). Reference is made to the concept of the pastoral circle and Kolb's  experiential learning model. (SW)",

        "description":"The impact of higher education on the cognitive and social development of students was studied in three experiments. A longitudinal comparison of moral reasoning development in the four years after high school among those who did and did not attend college was undertaken. Instruments used were the Reflective Judgment Questionnaire, the Concept Mastery Test, the Defining Issues Test, and the Sentence Completion Test of ego development. Over the first two years after high school, scores of both groups increased by about the same amount. In the second two years, the increase for the college attenders was greater than that for the nonattenders. Additionally, a cross-sectional comparison between undergraduates in liberal arts majors and undergraduates in engineering majors was  conducted. On both a measure of verbal reasoning and a measure of complex reasoning about issues that have no simple right or wrong answer, seniors in both majors scored higher than freshmen. The senior-freshmen difference suggested a similar amount of growth in both kinds of majors. The third study assessed the impact of graduate education on cognitive and cognitive-social developmental measures. Advanced graduate students, first-year graduate students, and college graduates who had not entered graduate school were compared using five instruments measuring reflective judgment, moral reasoning development, ego development, verbal reasoning, and socioeconomic status. Age and selection appeared to explain differences on the measures between beginning and advanced students and between  students and nonstudents. Theories and research relating to moral development, ego development and reflective judgment style are reviewed. Although methodological flaws in the research are acknowledged, among the conclusions are that people in college grow in moral reasoning (and at a faster rate than non-college attenders), and that college seniors do not differ significantly from freshmen in ego development. A bibliography is appended. (Author/SW)",

More than a million black students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities in fall 1980, and slightly more than half of these students attended colleges in the Southern and border states. Over a third of the black students in the Southern/border states were enrolled in predominantly black colleges. Most of these students attended traditionally black institutions (TBIs), while the rest were enrolled in newer predominantly black institutions (PBIs) that were founded in the last 25 years. Enrollment has been increasing in both the TBIs and the PBIs, even though the purposes of these colleges differ greatly. Most of the TBIs are four-year colleges that stress academic and  first-professional education, while the majority of the new PBIs are two-year vocational schools organized for profit. Almost half of the PBIs are located in North Carolina (eight) and South Carolina (seven). About one in five black students in colleges outside the Southern/border states attended a school in which over half of the students enrolled were black. Most of these predominantly black institutions are two-year schools emphasizing vocational education, and over half are public and two-thirds are located in three cities: New York City (eight), Chicago (eight), and Detroit (five). In addition to data on black students enrolled in black colleges by state, enrollment profiles are presented of TBIs and PBIs. (SW)",

Past research has shown that these students tend to graduate at a low rate, relative to those who do declare majors. It was hypothesized that these students also perform less well on the average than those who do declare majors. Of particular concern were high-ability, &quot;undecided&quot; students. Three criteria were used to evaluate the advising program: first-semester dropout rate, first-year dropout rate, and first-semester grade point average (GPA). Two samples of high-ability (ACT Composite greater than 25), undecided freshmen, coming from two entering class cohorts, were used in the study. One  group was included in the new program; the other was advised in the traditional manner. The results of the study were mixed, depending on the criterion of choice. Given the selected priors and loss function, analysis with first-year dropout rate as the criterion was supportive of the program, whereas analyses with the other criteria were not. It is suggested that a similar analysis with second-semester GPA as the criterion, could further examine the effectiveness of the program for high ability, undecided students. It is also suggested that the effects of the new advising program are not fully seen until the second semester of the freshmen year. (Author/LB)",

Each college has a retention task force consisting of faculty, administrators, student affairs staff, and students. A steering committee with one representative from each college, generally the dean of students, coordinates consortium activities. The consortium activities focus on four areas: data collection, organizational development, program development, and networking. The colleges are currently collecting data concerning the financial consequences of attrition, the characteristics of dropouts, and their reasons for leaving. One major source of student data is the Cooperative Institutional Research Program findings, which help to monitor local changes  in the goals, interests, and experiences of entering students and which can be used for assessing the past and planning for the future. The consortium colleges also are planning special surveys of current and former students as part of their effort to assess the causes and consequences of attrition. The willingness of both institutions and individuals to use information to improve student retention is important. Efforts are being undertaken to help faculty and departments learn how to make improvements based on the student retention data. Another goal is to use the student data to develop a comprehensive set of interventions to attack the attrition problems, and to make adjustments once the interventions are operative, based on both national and campus-based research. The consortium  provides a structure for contact and sharing of ideas and program results. The participating colleges are: Azusa Pacific College, Chapman College, Harvey Mudd College, Loyola Marymount University, Mount St. Mary's College, Pitzer College, Scripps College, and Whittier College.

Among those who had aspired to postsecondary education as high school seniors, the majority had achieved or exceeded their expectations. Whites were considerably more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to have received a bachelor's degree by October 1979. As of October 1979, more than four out of five of  the graduates were employed either full-time or part-time. High school graduates with six or more years of work experience had about the same hourly earnings as college graduates with less than two years work experience. Part-time work rates were greater for women than for men, and black women worked part-time at higher rates than white women in the three years following high school, but at lower rates since 1977. Over three-fourths of those working were in the private sector, about 17 percent were in the public sector, and 5 percent were self-employed or in a family business. College graduates were more than twice as likely as those with no college education to be employed in the public sector. As of October 1979, 57 percent of the men and 70 percent of the women were or had been  married. Selected questionnaire items and information on the research methodology are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"A model that is designed to measure and provide early understanding of the principle factors governing state support of public higher education and which is based on M. M. Chamber's annual data on state higher education appropriations is described. Design principles of the model are identified. The model consists of seven independent factors, four dependent factors, and a final output measure of financial support. Four factors are classified as nonvariable and collectively labeled &quot;inputs;&quot; three are adjustable by legislative action and labeled &quot;financial process factors.&quot; The &quot;output&quot; measure equals the inputs multiplied by the process factors. In brief, the model derives state and local government appropriations by the fiscal actions of taxing effort and allocation applied to  the state's inherent tax wealth or capacity. The student load is derived by application of a college attendance ratio to state high school graduates, and enrollments are adjusted by a system cost index. The final output measure of estimated appropriations and tuition revenues per student adjusted for load represents a comparable overall support level for public higher education provided by state residents. The input factors of tax capacity, high school graduates, college attendance ratio, and system are relatively stable, while the process factors of tax effort, allocation, and tuition factor can be altered by legislative action. These measurements are described in detail and reported in two tables: collectively by state in alphabetical order, and independently by state rank order. The  eight elements of raw data with source information also are presented. Additionally, general observations to promote understanding of the overall or macro role of state governments and citizens in financing public higher education are considered. (SW)",

Library associates (professional staff members without graduate degrees in library science) from public, academic, and special libraries throughout Ohio, and librarians from the Ohio public school system without graduate degrees in library science or educational media were surveyed as the most probable source of future enrollments. Two questionnaires were developed from the survey, one for library associates and the other for school librarians, and distributed to personnel in libraries around  the state. Analysis of the data was restricted to descriptive statistics. Approximately 20 percent of each group surveyed had definite plans to pursue a graduate degree in library science, while 50 percent had at least contemplated such study. Most of those intending to pursue degrees intended to enroll within the next two years (1981-82), though many were undecided on which institution they would attend.

A survey questionnaire was sent to a sample of Ohio academic, public, special, and school library directors. Descriptive statistics were applied to the survey data. Projected annual openings in  Ohio libraries were compared to the number of new MLS degree-holders expected to graduate from Ohio programs. Since library growth rates will slow through the 1980s, it was found that projected library personnel needs can be filled by the existing Ohio graduate library science programs.

Based on the rationale that a computer literate faculty must be available to make decisions on effective computer use, the paper discusses the roles that teachers and computers will play in educating students in the 21st century. Citing the need to match instructional and learner objectives, a paradigm for training teachers to be computer literate is recommended as the initial step in achieving that goal. Categories outlined for this initial introduction include information systems, information collection and retrieval,  communications with a computer, computers in the marketplace, and computers in education. Suggested activities for generating additional competencies would include programs on: (1) the automatic control of processes, (2) the concept of input-process-output, (3) coding systems, (4) preparation of input and interpretation of output, (5) using computer program packages, and (6) hardware and software in context.

        "description":"This is an evaluation of Phase Two of the Federal Library Network Prototype Project which involved the use of telefacsimile and slow-scan television for interlibrary loan and communication activities among federal libraries from July 1978 to March 1980. The evaluation procedure included site visits to participating libraries, analysis of data recorded by participating libraries on transaction forms, interviews with 38 library staff members, a literature review, and discussions with experts. Analysis of the transaction data shows that interlibrary loans accounted for 75 percent of the activity, with correspondence responsible for another 15 percent. Patrons found the information helpful approximately 72 percent of the time. Seventy percent of their requests were for journal  articles, with the material available on time 60 percent of the time. Library staff felt that the project did increase contact with other libraries, and 40 percent said they would continue interlibrary loans with these libraries. However, librarians also felt the project increased the work load and that it was unfavorable from that point of view. Overall, the telefacsimile, while useful, seemed to impose a labor-intensive situation on libraries and future trials of slow-scan television in a wider range of contexts are recommended.

        "description":"This paper offers an historical perspective as to why teachers may be reluctant to accept new technologies, and what might persuade them to use computers in their classrooms. The analysis also suggests some methods for minimizing the inhibiting factors and maximizing the acceptance of computers in elementary and secondary school settings. Explanations for the failure to use technologies are traced to: (1) little concrete evidence of the effectiveness of the use of these media; (2) teacher resistance to change; (3) lack of training in the use of equipment; (4) lack of adequate hardware, software, and courseware; (5) the need to change teaching style to use the technology; and (6) the fact that extra time and preparation are required to use these technologies. Suggestions for  overcoming these inhibiting factors include providing a specialist to consult with teachers on computer applications in the classroom, conducting training sessions for teachers on computers, and rewarding those teachers who are innovative in adapting computers to their instructional programs. Four examples of successful computer programs in elementary and secondary school environments are cited. Twenty-two references are listed. (MER)",

The basic design of the game calls for the computer to display a coordinate grid on which it graphs any equations that are typed in by the student. Thirteen &quot;Green Globs,&quot; each about .7 units in diameter, are scattered about the grid. The goal of the game is to explode all of the green globs by hitting them with graphs specified by typing in equations. If a shot misses the expected targets, diagnostic feedback is provided to debug the ideas used. The game is scored using an algorithm which encourages cleverly planned shots and provides a wide range of achievable scores. The decision  to exclude the possibility of trigonometry functions in favor of other options is discussed. A provision of the game allows students to view any of the ten top scoring games and see what shots and strategies the top players have used. Highlights of classroom use of Green Globs are provided, including descriptions of techniques used by some of the more advanced students. One reference is cited. (CHC)",

Quantitative guidelines, where specified, are arranged in three levels to enable North Carolina schools to develop both short-range and long-range goals. It is recommended that, since the schools are either approaching or have achieved Level I (Minimal), they should attempt to reach Level II (Desirable) within a 3-year period, and should develop plans to attain  Level III (Exemplary) within another three years.

After a questionnaire was designed and tested, NLS members were surveyed by mail, or by phone when necessary. In December of 1979 a supplemental questionnaire was sent to regional and sub-regional libraries in the NLS network. The major findings of the surveys related to user characteristics, use of library service, equipment use, reading materials, user assessment of library services, and the perspectives provided by network libraries. The recommended actions to be taken based on the survey results include:  a campaign to attract non-white, less educated, and low income readers to NLS; a review of the process by which readers are introduced to NLS; and the development of a method for obtaining input from readers on a regular basis. The survey findings are presented in 83 tables, and copies of the user and network library surveys are provided as appendices. (JL)",

The studies were identified by a literature search and those that included a description of cost impacts were selected for detailed analysis. Most studies considered labor savings through workload reduction and/or time saved and labor force reduction. The saving of nursing labor was the largest single cost reduction identified. Four different techniques used for estimating workload changes were task analysis, job content analysis, work sampling, and trend analysis. Other methodological issues indicate that  turning time savings into labor force reductions requires a deliberate effort to reorganize services and cost, and that benefits must be evaluated and documented in selecting an AHIS. Also, regression analysis can be used to study impacts of AHIS implementation retrospectively. A comparison of three AHIS cost impacts, predictions, conclusions, and recommendations for an approach to AHIS cost evaluation, and directions for future research are included.

After an introductory section tracing the history and role of the community/junior college, the increasing curricular importance of vocational education, and current approaches to general education, the paper outlines arguments for the retention of the general education component. Included are arguments based on humanistic, basic life competencies, pragmatic, and theoretical orientations which favor general education. The paper then identifies a second faction composed of those who warn of the dangers of the increasing domination of technical skills courses in vocational programs. Next, arguments  are presented for the limitation or exclusion of the general education component, which focus on students' desires for additional technical courses, the unnecessary lengthening of vocational programs by general education requirements, the possibility that students' personal and social growth is achieved without general education, among other arguments. Next, the essay reviews efforts to respond creatively to new demands to combine general education with the world of work, looking at cooperative efforts between schools and industry, experiments with interdisciplinary and nondisciplinary approaches, and suggested ways of revitalizing general education courses. The paper concludes with a summary of the purposes of general education. (AYC)",

The questionnaire solicited information on the geography courses offered; frequency with which they were offered; new courses planned; faculty degrees; responsiveness of geographical associations and community college organizations to professional needs; possibility and desirability of expanding the geography curriculum; need for faculty support from geography organizations; interaction with four-year college geography faculty; and interest in a New York State geography society. Study findings, based on a 100% response rate from the 38 community colleges in New York, include the following: (1) the most commonly offered geography course was  Introduction to Cultural Geography, offered by eight colleges; (2) the total number of geography courses taught increased from 49 in 1976 to 62 in 1981; (3) among the 27 faculty members teaching geography in 1981, only 16 held degrees in geography; (4) 22 of these instructors were employed full-time, and five were employed part-time; (5) 72% of the responding colleges felt that more geography courses could be taught, 66% felt more should be taught; and (6) the needs of faculty were not felt to be met by four-year college departments, professional associations, or community college groups.

        "description":"As part of an effort to reassess its enrollment forecasting methodology and techniques, the Florida Division of Community Colleges conducted a national survey of state directors of community/junior colleges to identify successful forecasting practices. A conceptual framework for analyzing responses was developed from a review of the literature on enrollment projections and used to summarize the state of the art of enrollment forecasting. Four categories of approaches were identified: (1) trend extrapolation approaches, i.e., curve-fitting techniques, such as simple and moving averages, which utilize historical enrollment data as the basis for projections, and causal models, such as cohort-survival techniques, which give consideration to independent factors in addition to historic  enrollment data; (2) subjective judgments, which involve the use of expert opinion or futuristic approaches; (3) combination approaches, which use both extrapolation and subjective methods; and (4) no state-level forecasting. The survey revealed that nine of the 46 responding states conducted no systematic state-level forecasting; 12 states used curve-fitting techniques; 18 states used causal models; one state based its enrollment projections solely on subjective judgment; and six states reported using combination approaches. The survey report details methodology and findings by state and concludes with observations on responsibility for, success of, and desirability of enrollment forecasting. (AYC)",

Specific recommendations concerning the form and content of parent education materials are linked to the philosophy that human development and experience occur interactively within an interdependent community and that such a viewpoint should guide developers of parent education materials. Various audiovisual materials are judged to lack a specific focus and/or to lack sophisticated presentation; among the authors' recommendations is the suggestion that viewpoints regarding  child development and parenting underlying materials be made more recognizable to consumers. A review of materials notes that the traditional focus within parent education has been on promoting mental health and cognitive development. Current parent education materials emphasize child rearing and parental responsibility in establishing guidelines for children's acceptable behavior; recent research investigates the outcomes for the increasing numbers of children placed in alternate child care by working women.

In both tasks, the 18 items were separated into six groups and the subjects studied their locations on shelves or in compartments before instructing the 7-year-olds. Two students unaware of the purpose of the study coded each subject's references to the 18 items according to a system elaborated from Olver and Hornsby (1966). The statements were coded in terms of superordinate, functional, and nominal categories. Each of the coders rated 20 tapes, including 8  reliability tapes, which were interspersed throughout the coding phase. Results suggest that when categorization is the means to the goal of teaching children, functional categories assume great importance for adults. Category use also seems to vary according to whether communication is in an everyday context as opposed to a school or laboratory setting. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"This evaluation of the New York State Experimental Prekindergarten (PreK) Program was designed to investigate the extent to which efforts to enhance program continuity through staff development activities produced lasting effects on children's cognitive and noncognitive development. Three children in each of seven of the 48 PreK school districts in New York were selected for intensive study. For each child, a team was formed consisting of the child's past, present, and future teachers, as well as nonteaching staff members and the building principal. The team worked together as the child moved from PreK into kindergarten and then into the first grade. Together they focused on developing skills in observing children, recording observations, collecting meaningful data from various  sources, reviewing data, and using data for planning instruction. Generally, results indicate that, on two different cognitive measures, children who had experienced greater continuity in their educational programs during this period scored higher than did children who had experienced less continuity. It is concluded that these findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of activities designed to strengthen continuity in children's educational experiences when those activities follow a developmental program.

The central objectives of the survey were to describe from a public policy perspective the major preschool education activities in the host countries; to document the nature, objectives, and central variables constituting the &quot;decision rules&quot; governing program implementation; to analyze the implications of these objectives and decision rules; and to formulate testable  assertions and/or suggested program guidelines for early education programs in developing countries. Among 10 policy questions stated were: Whom should programs be serving? How can the full range of children's basic needs be met? How should the role of parents be defined? and, what should be the nature and extent of intersectional cooperation in early childhood education? Attachments include a list of variables identified as influential in decision making in early childhood education in Latin America. An annotated bibliography is also provided. (Author/DB)",

A mailed questionnaire was sent to 1,200 parents (of whom 800 were receiving child care and 400 were eligible but not receiving care), to a systematic random sample of 2,186 providers (of whom 456 were center providers, 500 were family day care providers, and 1,009 were aides), and to all day care service workers and consultants in Michigan (samples of 187 and 38, respectively). The first part of the questionnaire asked for demographic and personal information, the second part elicited respondents' choices about  current and proposed child care policy and practice, and the third part asked respondents to indicate their level of agreement with values which might be expressed by other actors in the child care policy field. Results of the questionnaire are reported in the following manner: first, characteristics of the respondents in each major category are described; then their responses to the questions on policy and practices are reported. Next, statistical comparisons among subsamples on 10 selected variables related to the study's hypotheses are discussed. Mean levels of agreement with each of the statements in part 3 of the questionnaire are reported. Finally, statistical differences in subsample scores on the dimensions of control/responsibility, scope, and quality of child care are outlined.  (Author/MP)",

Described here are the results of the interview phase of the study, which involved 28 interviews with parents, 29 with providers, and 12 with state agency personnel selected at random from the survey respondents. The purpose of the interviews was to gain greater understanding of survey respondents' opinions by exploring the reasons they gave certain responses and by extending the questioning to related issues drawn from their  personal experiences. Interview responses occurred in six question areas identified by the MLHS as being of particular interest: (1) access to child care; (2) quality of care; (3) parent support and education; (4) financial support; (5) regulation; and (6) general system functioning. The report discusses the views of parent respondents first, then outlines practitioner respondents' views, concluding with a statement of basic issues which must be resolved if child care policy is to meet the needs of welfare recipients.

The hypotheses tested concerned relationships between perceived vulnerability to health problems and age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Data were obtained from a group administered a 15-item questionnaire; a characteristic item illustrating the basic format of these questions was &quot;What chance is there of your getting the flu during this next year?&quot; The specific health problems investigated were a bad accident, a rash, a fever, having a tooth pulled, a sore throat, a toothache, a cold, bleeding gums, an upset stomach, being sick enough to miss a week of school, a cavity, a bad headache, breaking or  cracking a tooth, and cutting a finger. Seven additional questions were used as filler items. For each question the subjects selected one response from seven alternatives in a quasi-interval scale. Results indicated that age was significantly but nonlinearly related to perceived vulnerability. Females showed significantly higher levels of perceived vulnerability than did males. In the younger sample, perceived vulnerability was related positively to higher socioeconomic status. Implications for theory and health education programs are discussed. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The experience of consultants in a pediatric hospital indicates that infant failure to thrive is almost always associated with strain in the relationships of the infant's caregivers. Consequently, a nontraditional, long-term, home-based, and family-centered model of evaluation and treatment of failure to thrive has been developed which involves family members in assessing how family influences disrupt nurturance and which engages family members in ongoing therapeutic work. Intervention is directed toward containment of family relationship problems, employment of more adaptive stress management, and restructuring of the child's nurturing context. To assess the effectiveness of the family-centered intervention, comparisons are being made between outcomes of two alternate approaches  to intervention: a parent-centered approach focusing on the major caretaker and an advocacy approach involving short-term support and indirect treatment. Infants are assessed at six-month intervals on intellectual development, play behavior, attachment, and language competence. Additionally, monthly home observations are being made of parent-child interaction. Preliminary follow-up data for small samples of predominantly low-income families with infants at 1 year of age reveal improved weight gain, maintenance of intellectual abilities, and, in comparison to prior studies, more positive attachment behavior. Analyses of data now being collected are expected to show that the family-centered approach to intervention results in longer lasting gains in infants' developmental and psychosocial  competence.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine if prosocial development could be positively influenced through a classroom intervention strategy using selected children's books and critical questioning techniques. In order to determine ability to share and to take different perspectives, 99 subjects from kindergarten and first grade classes were given a pretest in which they were asked to answer questions about pictures and stories depicting conflict. Treatments were then administered by specially trained teachers to 31 experimental and 33 control subjects who did not initially give sharing responses to the pretest tasks. In the experimental condition, nine readily accessible children's books focusing on sharing, were read at a rate of three per week to the subjects. The feelings of  story characters, the causes of characters' feelings and behaviors, solutions to the conflict situations in the stories, and the role that sharing played in resolving the conflict were emphasized. Nine books not focusing on sharing were similarly read to the control group and the teacher simply discussed story events. Subjects were posttested with the same materials and questions used in the pretest. Results suggest that children's prosocial development, with respect to sharing and perspective taking, can be facilitated through a classroom-oriented intervention technique. Experimental subjects gave more sharing responses and more appropriate explanations of the type of information they used to identify a character's feelings (e.g., the character's facial expressions and body gestures).

It was hypothesized that caregivers would ask girls more personal-social questions and boys more referential-objective questions. This hypothesis was based on the notion that girls are socialized to be nurturing and expressive, whereas boys are socialized to be instrumental. Subjects in this study were 24 male and female toddlers whose day care fees were paid by Title XX funds. Observation of adult-child interaction employed A Procedure for Patterning the Responses of Adults and Children (APPROACH) for recording behaviors.  The hypothesis was confirmed that girls would be asked significantly more convergent questions related to feelings and personal-social content than were boys. The hypothesis that boys would be asked more questions relating to referential-objective content was not confirmed but tended toward significance. The higher rate of male toddler responses to open-ended questions suggested that girls may be socialized to respond to safe, routine questions rather than to questions requiring cognitive restructuring of the objective world.

(The data base for this study was 32 videotapes of mothers preparing their 7- or 9-year-old children to take a memory test.) The four strategies (frequency coding, fine-grained sequential analysis, single-case ethnography, and comparative ethnography) are discussed in terms of their utility for providing an empirically adequate account of how individuals achieve meaningful communication within the context of an evolving interaction. Strategies are then evaluated in terms of (1) the questions each method can answer, (2) procedures related to data analysis, (3) problems of assessing the validity of the analysis,  (4) problems of assessing the reliability and validity of data collection, and (5) limits each strategy imposes on statements concerning the generality of the findings. While all of the strategies were found to have utility for examining particular aspects of data on the socialization of cognitive skills, neither frequency coding nor fine-grained sequential analysis were found to represent adequately the complexity of the dyadic interaction. The single-case ethnographic method, however, was found to provide accounts of how participants jointly accomplished cognitive tasks, how mothers established and maintained a common framework, and how both mother and child dyads worked toward a transfer of responsibility for the direction of the task. In order to examine the prevalence of structures  of interaction found in the single-case ethnographies, two multi-case, comparative ethnographic studies are presently being conducted. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"The author contends that families are uniquely constituted to bestow the gifts of caring, courage, and problem solving ability upon children. Clinical and epistemological insights as well as research evidence concerning child development and family relationships are presented as sources of information which will aid families to bestow these gifts. Among theories considered pertinent to child rearing are: Bettleheim's analysis of the effects of fairy tales on children, Rousseau's and Gesell's notions of naturally unfolding child development, Freud's psychoanalytic view of child development, Watson's behavioristic view of child rearing, Erikson's psychosocial view of personality development, Piaget's view of cognitive development, and the social learning theorists' views of  socialization. Research and clinical evidence which are considered germane to parenting include studies which have correlated parental nurturing and parent-child attachment, secure infant attachment and toddler compliance and cooperation with parents, secure infant attachment and infant ego resiliency and social competency. Research on parenting styles conducive to later school achievement, altruistic behavior, and nurturing behavior are discussed. Salient parenting ideas which emerge from research and theory are given. Some suggestions are also given regarding what society can do to promote the development of caring, courage, and problem solving in children. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Under the Social Security Act, federal funds are available to all states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands for strengthening and improving programs of Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Under the 1972 amendments such funds continue to be available to Guam and to the Virgin Islands for programs of old-age assistance, aid to the blind, and aid to the permanently and totally disabled, and to Puerto Rico for its single category of aid to the aged, blind or disabled. In the other states assistance to needy eligible aged, blind, or disabled persons is available through the federal program of Supplemental Security Income, which went into operation January 1, 1974. This publication reports on the state public assistance plans of the fifty states  and four other jurisdictions which were approved and in effect October 1, 1980. Information for each state is presented in four subdivisions: administration, eligibility requirements, need determination, and extension of the program. In addition, tables list the titles of the state agencies, give the dates on which each of the programs was begun, and explain the formula for federal financial participation in grants to the states. Three special tables related to the states' standards of assistance are also provided. (Author/MP)",

The pamphlet, one of a series produced by the Division of Scientific and Public Information, National Institute of Mental Health, is designed primarily to help parents care for their children and themselves in ways that promote good mental health.

        "description":"Guilt and anxiety in mothers of preschool children as a function of marital and career status, child care arrangements, and traditionalism were studied in a sample of 51 non-student women. The sample comprised four major groups: Group One mothers had an intact marriage and were at home with their children; Group Two mothers had an intact marriage, were not employed, and their children were at nursery school; Group Three mothers had intact marriages, were employed, and their children were enrolled in nursery school; and Group Four mothers were single, working, and their children were in nursery school. It was hypothesized that guilt and anxiety would be most strongly found among traditional women with children in nursery school. Each mother filled out a questionnaire that measured  (1) conservation of temperament and radicalism; (2) &quot;untroubled adequacy&quot; and guilt proneness, and (3) maternal guilt concerning the quantity of interaction with their preschool children. The major hypothesis was not confirmed. However, Group One mothers exhibited the least amount of guilt and anxiety and Group Four mothers the most amount of guilt and anxiety. Results suggest the need for a support network among single working mothers. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"It has long been recognized that childhood socialization occurs mainly through relationships with others, but only within the last decade or so can it be said that the study of relationships has become central to developmental psychology. As young children grow older, their sphere of relationships extends beyond the primary caretakers, and perhaps siblings, to others, i.e., other caregivers and other children. The child's relationships with these others are often based on the assumption that fundamental differences exist between parent-child and child-peer relationships. One major difference between these two types of relationships is the dimension of symmetry versus asymmetry. By definition, adult-child relationships are mainly asymmetrical while peer relationships are basically  symmetrical. Generally, asymmetrical relationships are complementary and symmetrical relationships are reciprocal. Asymmetrical and symmetrical relationships constitute different socialization contexts, containing different developmental challenges for the growing child. It seems likely that the socialization of children within the context of both asymmetrical and symmetrical relationships fosters more successful outcomes than socialization in either context alone. In conclusion, implications of the discussion for practitioners (e.g., clinicians and educators) concerning the socialization and assessment of children are pointed out. (Author/RH)",

Results illustrated wide diversity of family and cultural characteristics within a small, ostensibly homogenous community and problems inherent in looking at groups of Indian students rather than individuals. Findings included: average family size was 5.7 children; students from 20 families spoke Navajo; at least 10 families used medicine men, some in conjunction with western medicine; 40% of families interviewed had no employed head of household; 83% used wood-burning stoves; 62% of homes had no running water, 17% no  electricity, and 44% no television. Teachers reported most Canoncito students worked together as a group, resisted being singled out, and wanted their group to be good; despite skills-test scores slightly lower than school average, school performance differed widely among Canoncito students. The decision-making process was also investigated, revealing that parents felt the children themselves had decided whether they would attend the Canoncito Bureau of Indian Affairs day school or Albuquerque public schools. Translated transcripts of comparison interviews, conducted in Navajo, with nine parents and one student from Torreon, a community similar to Canoncito, comprise two-thirds of the document. (NEC/MH)",

Chapter Two focuses on the way in which education serves the interests of the dominant group, mirroring the stratified structure of the larger society, assuring the fulfillment of the dominant group's interest. Chapter Three examines the relative position of Mexican Americans and Anglos in the American social structure, exploring differences in income, occupation, and political representation. Chapter Four considers the research on achievement, dropout rates, higher  education, and other areas for Mexican Americans and Anglos. Chapter Five discusses the process of social change as perceived within the conflict perspective, concluding that basically, change in the larger society precedes change in the educational system, and that the dominant group usually attempts to control the process of social change, reacting most forcefully where it perceives the greatest loss of power, wealth, and prestige. The conflict model provides a framework of techniques for placing political pressure on established institutions to better respond to the needs of Mexican Americans nationwide. (NEC)",

        "description":"From Fiscal Year (FY) 1967 through FY 1974, the allocation for each state's Title I migrant education grant was determined through a formula utilizing estimates of the migratory agricultural labor population of each state. Until the Migrant Student Record Transfer System was fully validated in FY 1975, there were no totally reliable counts of actual numbers or periods of residence of migratory children in each state. Revisions to allocation computation procedures occurred with the passage of Public Laws 90-247, 93-380, and 94-482. The allocation formula now operates as follows: (1) each state accumulates one residency day for each day that a migratory child is resident in that state; (2) a state's total of accumulated residency days is divided by 365; (3) each state total  full-time-equivalent is then multiplied by 40% of the state's per pupil expenditure rate; (4) the computed amount then provides the total amount available for grant to each state. Individual state allocation totals provide the total national program allocation. The amount of funding is then taken 100% &quot;off-the-top&quot; of the total Title I authorization. Allocations have increased from $9,737,847 for 169,910 children in FY 1967 to $245,000,000 for 369,182 children in FY 1981. (NEC)",

The booklet describes the administrative design and the process used to develop community education in Arkansas. Problems, defeats, and outcomes reached are addressed. The booklet is divided into three chapters. The first describes conditions in Arkansas prior to the initiation of networking strategies, including geographic and population statistics, the educational organization and climate, financial constraints, and the status of community education. It also describes the formation of the Arkansas Community Education  Development Association. The second chapter outlines the approach used by Arkansas in developing its community education program, including funding, flexible staffing, board governance, and the Arkansas five-year plan. The third defines and discusses the networking skills necessary to a successful community education program, which include conceptual skills, organizational skills, and communication skills. The booklet highlights the unexpected benefits received from the program and the pitfalls encountered. The final section contains a summary, recommendations, and conclusions. (CM)",

American Indian viewpoints are either stereotyped, distorted, or omitted. To assist educators and publishers in developing awareness of American Indian heritage and culture and contemporary issues facing American Indians, general guidelines and a rating scale have been compiled by the Ethnic Heritage Project Advisory Council, to be used when evaluating textbooks and instructional materials. The guidelines may be applied at all grade levels and concentrate on content, language, and illustrations. Content considerations include awareness of American Indians' perspective; contemporary as well as historical activities, contributions,  and concerns; and avoidance of inferences that American Indians are \"all the same\" or that different lifestyles or customs are undesirable. Textbook language must: explain that the term \"Indian\" is a misnomer; not use derogatory terms; avoid generalizations; be consistent when comparing activities of American Indians with other groups; reflect contemporary roles and life situations. Illustrations should avoid negative stereotypes and caricatures, be historically and culturally accurate, and depict American Indians in the same range of modern socioeconomic settings and occupational roles as other groups of Americans.

        "description":"A brief overview of the status of language use in Native American communities reveals that while approximately 206 different languages and language dialects persist today, an estimated 49 languages have fewer than 10 speakers aged 50 or over, while 6 of these languages have more than 10,000 speakers of all generations. That these languages persist attests to the vigor of Native cultures and the value placed on Native languages by parents and parent surrogates who did, and still do, consciously teach children a Native language. Historically and contemporarily, schools and the educational processes have been the most effective means by which Native Americans have become oriented to a new lifeway. Early government policies were repressive, restricting the use of Native languages and  resulting in language adaptations, many influenced by Christian missionaries and rituals. Despite current concern for the need for bilingual bicultural education for Indian students, research has not yielded data which indicate the ranges and viability of bilingualism in Native American communities. In this era of enhanced Indian identity, speaking an indigenous language is now a decided asset for any Native American. There has been a recent proliferation of Native language courses taught in institutions of higher education. (NEC)",

The scope of the project covered two film production grants, a grant for archiving uncut footage at the National Anthropological Film Center, a grant to produce accompanying film essays, and a final grant for additional instructional materials. Cost of producing the footage was $875 per finished minute. Some 60 people participated in the project. The project entailed producing materials on five themes in five societies for the purpose of creating interchangeability of the materials, either by culture or by theme. The main philosophy behind the  project was that of visual evidence using film as raw data. The basic premise was that some visual materials are sufficiently representative of reality to support scientific judgements and that valid research footage is a useful instructional tool. The overall project was reviewed in professional journals as outstanding, has received six national awards, and has been much utilized at the college level. Some utilization has also occurred at the pre-college level and in educational television usage. (Author/CM)",

The purpose is to help state supervisors upgrade the quality of training given to the plant operators by their instructors. Since a survey indicated that operator training instructors are technically competent, the focus is on training rather than content or operating skills. Section I outlines the procedures involved in planning a seminar for operator training instructors, describes the task of an instructor, and provides an overview of the seminar, forms and questionnaires, and agendas. Section II contains 13 complete lesson plans, each of which has three parts, lesson plan cover sheets, and instructional material. Eight of the lessons  address the development and preparation of a good training program including content, objectives, methods, and preparing lesson plans. Five lessons focus on classroom delivery techniques such as group discussion and demonstration. (DC)",

Children lacking division skills received treatments in which they either verbalized division strategies, verbalized freely, did both, or did not verbalize while learning to solve division problems. Results showed that combining operational strategies with free verbalization produced greater skill development, higher percepts of efficacy, and greater subsequent interest. Free verbalization alone led to equally high skill development. Verbalizing only strategies resulted in no benefits compared with not verbalizing. Regardless of treatment condition, self-percepts of efficacy  were positively related to arithmetic interest. (Author)",

The model used has been in effect in one classroom in El Cajon, California since 1974. An elementary level classroom teacher there initiated and implemented an effective program of teaching metrics to parents of 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students. This investigation reports on the model as implemented at the Cannon Road Elementary School in Silver Spring, Maryland. Four of five teachers of grades five and six mathematics participated. Statistical analysis of data shows all groups of learners increased their metric knowledge significantly as a result of participation. The only  possible exception was male parents, whose mean pretest score was the highest of any group. Additional research is viewed as necessary to provide insight into the learning process which occurred at home. It is not known whether children actually taught parents or whether adults gained knowledge from self-instruction. It is felt that with some modification, the instruction model could easily be duplicated in other parts of the country, with assurance that substantial gains in metric knowledge would be achieved.

        "description":"The results of an investigation of the development of children's knowledge of addition and subtraction concepts before they start school are detailed. The purpose of the study was to test the predictions of the three-stage model about the distinctions between the last two stages. Twenty-four children participated in the investigation. None of these children had started first grade. The results support the existence of the qualitative and quantitative stages. The data indicate that: (1) Before children begin school and are given formal instruction on addition and subtraction problems, they can use the magnitude of the difference between two arrays and two transformations to make predictions about final numerosities; (2) A method of examining the relationship between understanding  addition and subtraction and number conservation now exists; and (3) The distinction between qualitative and quantitative understanding allows for children to solve complex problems without relying on estimator solutions.

        "description":"This document deals with the observation of students in a direct translation scheme in the solution of word problems in a university freshman-level Intermediate Algebra class. It is felt that since successful problem solvers of algebraic equations often have as much difficulty in solving word problems as do other students in the classes, the problem for most students must exist in the translation of words into algebraic expressions and equations. The focus of this study is directed towards the translation aspect of the solution of word problems. The observations detailed are based on the collected papers of 84 students. Ten problem samples and associated pupil errors are detailed. Among the recommendations made: (1) Students should be encouraged to set up an equation in phrases  containing all the variable names for unknown quantities; (2) Teachers should stress the phrase structure of sentences and then proceed with a direct translation scheme; and (3) The use of auxiliary cues and representations should be encouraged, including pictures, diagrams, and flowcharts. It is noted that human problem solving is a complex task and insights into teaching strategies can be developed by understanding the thinking process. (MP)",

        "description":"This publication contains teacher developed activities for teaching about global issues in grades 5-8. The self-contained activities are organized into three major parts. Part I, \"Global Awareness,\" introduces students to the concept of global education. Students are made aware of the nature of the world and the part they play in it as inhabitants of the planet. For example, the activity, \"Global Connections,\" involves students in interacting with one another to discover how their class is connected to the rest of the world. Using a bingo game format, students look for classmates who fit appropriate squares on their game sheets. Each square represents a certain kind of \"global connection.\" Through the activities in Part II, \"Global Interdependence,\" students learn that they are  connected to other people and countries in countless ways and that these links exist across cultures as well as time and distance. In the \"Peanut Butter Crunch\" activity, students examine the effects of the drought of 1980 on the manufacturing of peanut butter. Because of the drought and the lifting of the peanut import quota, the United States began to import peanuts from China, India, and Argentina. In other activities, students examine the relationship between the United States and oil exporting nations, variations in the price of gasoline, and multinational corporations. Part III contains activities designed to teach cross cultural understanding. Students analyze the news for violations of human rights and examine the McDonald's fast food restaurant chain as a worldwide phenomenon.  Related resources in the ERIC system are cited.

        "description":"This paper examines bureaucratic resistance to implementing policy mandates on sex equity. Three facets of a women's program are examined: 1) the legislative and organizational history of Women in Development (WID) within the Agency for International Development (AID); 2) the resources available to the WID Office within the context of AID policies; and 3) the interaction between the office and outside constituencies at the point of interface--the feminist WID political appointee. The data was derived from the author's field notes, internal memoranda and documents, and participant observation. In recognition of how women have been excluded, even disadvantaged by past national and international efforts, the Percy Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act in 1973 established as policy  for AID that women are to be integrated in all development efforts in developing countries. Although the WID office is charged with the broad mandate to integrate women through project review, studies, linkage with constituents, and international coordination, its annual program budget has been limited to one million dollars or less since inception. The WID office is constrained in its structural location to an exhorter role, rather than as a supplier of technical assistance or project monies. Monitoring is extraordinarily difficult, and the data produced are not always reliable, due to dependency on resistant field missions for whom paper compliance is a developed art. Overlaying all this is the tokenism which the all women WID staff faces in a male-dominated bureaucracy.  (Author/RM)",

The author explores the prospects for international security and advocates a number of policies which would benefit both societies. The first section in the booklet discusses how U.S. security cannot be assured even if the Congress goes along with the administration's request to approve expenditures of more than a trillion dollars on defense over the next five years. What we buy and how we use it are more important than how much we spend. Soviet vulnerabilities and Western assets are then examined. Republican administrations have been more successful than Democratic administrations--at least since World War II--in defusing conflict with the Soviet Union. The records  of various presidents are discussed. U.S. policy must flow from a judicious mixture of firmness and flexibility, of restraints and incentives. Specific steps that the United States can take to improve United States-Soviet relations are suggested. The booklet examines relationships between the superpowers and the Third World. Like it or not, linkage exists between superpower activities in the Third World and efforts to cap the volcano of United States-Soviet arms competition. The survival requirements of each country ought to outweigh any displeasure experienced over the actions of its rival in some remote region. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This booklet examines the components of aesthetic education, reviews some of the current school programs in the arts, and points out some of the needs for improving aesthetic education in the schools. The purpose of aesthetic education is to help students experience the joy of beauty. To develop a program of aesthetic education, the stages of aesthetic development that a person goes through must be taken into consideration. Although individuals of the same age may be at different stages of development, all experience three facets of aesthetic awareness. They are performer, appreciator, and critic. These three stages provide a framework for developing a program of aesthetic education, no matter what the subject area the learner is studying. Through the work of various funding  agencies, both public and private, many programs are now having an impact on the arts in the schools. For example, CEMREL, one of the regional educational laboratories located in St. Louis, has contributed a long-range curriculum development program for the arts in the elementary grades. The Utica School District in New York has instituted a pilot project called SEARCH in which film makers and poets worked both as artists in residence and as learning resources to teachers. If schools are to contribute to improving the quality of life of students, more attention must be given to the preparation of teachers in aesthetic education. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"Major objectives of this monograph are to explore the condition of American public education, offer an educational agenda for the 1980s, and suggest ways to restore public confidence in education. America's public education system is characterized as being currently stymied by the end of economic growth, unsure of what is expected of it, beset by declining enrollments, trying to solve problems on the basis of political balancing, and unable to deal with expectations that all students are entitled to equal benefits, regardless of ability, effort, or output. Various suggestions are offered to help educational policy makers deal with these and other problems. Major suggestions include that educators should concentrate on (1) developing and rewarding merit among teachers and  students; (2) strengthening basic skills, including art and music as well as history, reading, writing, and arithmetic; (3) including more practical experience in teacher education programs; (4) developing a common intellectual ground among students by exposing them to great literary works; and (5) providing students with opportunities to study foreign languages and humanities. The conclusion is that educators will be successful in improving the educational system and in restoring public confidence in education if they concentrate on implementing these and similar reforms and if they take a cohesive look at what the sum total of 12 years of education ought to achieve.

        "description":"This publication clarifies the basic education movement by placing it in a historical and philosophical context. In many ways, the basic education movement of the 1970s is part of a continuum of similar movements in American education that have occurred with almost clocklike regularity--appearing in rather regular cycles since the 1930s. First, the current basic education movement that originated in the 1970s is reviewed. Criticisms made by proponents of basic education and some remedies proposed that may cure the problems believed to exist today in public schooling are presented. The Essentialist movement of the 1930s is then examined. The Essentialists were a group of professional educators who challenged the then progressive trends in American education. Like today's advocates  of basic education, the Essentialists charged that public education, despite its vast extent and heavy cost to society, was appalling, weak, and ineffective. They believed it was crucial that the curriculum be organized systematically and sequentially and that instruction stress logical, chronological and causal relationships. They argued that the teacher should be restored to a position of central authority in the classroom. Lastly, the publication discusses arguments of the educational critics of the 1950s. A new educational movement called &quot;Life Adjustment Education&quot; brought about by World War II became the target for a group of educational critics. The proponents of Life Adjustment Education maintained that the purpose of the schools should be broader in scope than stictly academic  programs. The critics perceived of the function of the school in academic terms. (Author/RM)",

The title of the student guide is &quot;History, Heritage, and Hearsay: A Children's Guide to Ethnic South and Southwest Philadelphia&quot; (SO 013 690). Students, through readings and learning activities provided in the &quot;Children's Guide,&quot; learn about the culture and history of Afro Americans, Irish Americans, Italian Americans, Jewish Americans, and Polish Americans. The program also involves students in examining their own ethnic background. The teacher's guide consists of three sections. The first section provides background information on using the program with youngsters. Topics in this section include  intergroup understanding and tolerance in youngsters, current trends in ethnic heritage studies, ethnic heritage studies concepts in the program, and different ways to use the program. The second section suggests ways to help youngsters work through each learning activity. It also suggests how to expand and enrich activities. The final section contains a glossary of special terms, a resource guide of places to explore and examine in South and Southwest Philadelphia, and a bibliography of selected readings and other materials in ethnic heritage studies.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the news acquisition habits of students and their knowledge of the news. Differences in the performance of males and females were compared. Two thousand, eighth- and eleventh-grade students from four school districts in Virginia were administered a current events test and asked to respond to questions about their viewing habits concerning the use of mass media. All students were enrolled in social studies classes at the time of testing. Rural, urban, and suburban schools were represented in the study. Results include the following. Both sexes chose television as their main and most accurate source of news information. Newspapers trailed far behind followed by parents, classes, friends, and news magazines. Even though nearly half of the  students indicated that they discussed the news in their social studies classroom daily or several times a week, they failed to identify the classroom as a primary source of information. Regarding knowledge achievement, boys scored higher than girls on the test. Boys did considerably better than girls on questions related to international and national events. On items involving state news, both groups were very similar. Concerning news acquisition habits, the boys watched both local and national television news more than girls. They also read a daily newspaper more than girls. Boys had an overwhelming preference for sports while girls strongly like human interest stories on the local television news. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This paper stresses the need for consumer education programs which reflect social changes and which will be relevant in the future. Specifically, it explores ways in which educators can develop and implement consumer education programs which stress quality of life, simplified lifestyles, and changing American consumption habits. Quality of life is interpreted to include a degree of excellence in lifestyle that could be available to all citizens, rather than wealth, privilege, affluence, and materialism. Many of the ideas upon which recommendations for changes in consumer education curricula are based derive from a contemporary social movement called &quot;Voluntary Simplicity.&quot; One of the best known advocates of this simplicity movement, Michigan Senator, Philip A. Hart, is often  cited throughout the paper as an example of an intelligent and thoughtful consumer. Recommendations regarding how to develop consumer education programs based on quality of life concepts are presented in three areas--consumer decision making, consumer resource management, and consumer citizen participation. Recommendations include teaching students how to make a conscious effort to reduce nonessential possessions, encouraging students to become less dependent on large institutions, stressing knowledge and skills needed for citizen participation, helping students understand how consumption habits affect other people and the environment, and helping students mesh their desired lifestyle with their career goals and future earning capacity. The conclusion is that educators should learn more  about the simplicity movement and should incorporate its objectives and concepts into consumer education programs. (DB)",

        "description":"The author conducted a cross national analysis of sociological research reported in leading journals at two points in time over a ten year period to determine if sociologists' ability to produce valid social generalizations had improved significantly over the recent past. The official journals of the United States (American Sociological Review), Canada (Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology), and Great Britain (Sociology) were selected for examination. Also included in the analysis were two other highly reputed journals--the American Journal of Sociology and the British Journal of Sociology. Only articles reporting the results of empirical research were included in the comparative analysis. All of the research reports contained in the five journals were examined to  determine the research design employed, the type of sample or population investigated, and the method used to collect the data. Results include the following. Particularly in the American journals, but also in the Canadian Review, the analysis revealed changes over the past ten years in the methodological characteristics of published studies such that sociologists' ability to make valid social generalizations may be improved substantially. By taking readings at several points in time, selecting a broadly based sample, and not relying exclusively upon one or two methods of data collection, it is extremely likely that the generalizations produced are less affected by measurement artifacts and instead reflect effects of relevant factors as they impinge upon the variables sociologists seek to  explain.

Data for the study were collected from records such as grant proposals and from interviews with Congressional and Department of Education staff, members of the President's Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies, government employers of foreign area specialists, interest group representatives, and persons from Title VI area studies centers. The study consists of six major chapters. The first five chapters describe and evaluate how Title VI operates at the federal level; the activities of college and university area studies centers; the Foreign International Studies Programs; and the research program. The study concludes by  examining future program directions in chapter six. The study notes that the basic policy dilemma facing Title VI is the tradeoff between specialist training and general diffusion of international knowledge. Despite its limited resources, Title VI will continue to address both these objectives. The study recommends that the existing stock of specialists be maintained and that more realistic incentives for professional training with an international studies focus be created. The program should pay greater attention to area studies and to materials development at the K-12 level. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the needs of high school students and teachers that writers and publishers of psychology materials and textbooks should keep in mind. To take students' needs into consideration, publishers should stress practical application and relevance of subject matter, provide opportunities for interaction with peers, aim reading materials at ninth or tenth grade reading levels, emphasize a study skills orientation, and consider the maturity level of students. The needs of teachers include an emphasis on teachability of materials, clear objectives, adherence to sound psychological principles, appropriateness of topics covered, and teaching techniques and activity suggestions. In addition to student and teacher needs, there are other constraints to be kept in mind, such  as budget, limited subject matter background of teachers, time constraints, community censorship, level of students' ability, and lack of communication among teachers. In terms of satisfying the needs of students and teachers working within these constraints, several major problems exist in currently available materials. The primary problem is that authorship of texts and supplementary materials is still, for the most part, at the college level. Professors lack the experience of teaching at the secondary level which is essential for creating effective materials. The fact that college level writers are often not aware of the specific needs of high school students and teachers is also evident in the reviews they do on the currently available resources. Many teachers use these as a basis for  text selection. (Author/RM)",

One section describes the origins of the modern computer, another defines computer terminology, and two sections explain computer hardware and computer software. Another section discusses three major ways in which computers are being used in schools. The first is computer assisted educational management systems which are designed to provide the evaluation of entering students, prescription formulating, individualization of instruction, record keeping, curriculum development, and evaluation. Second, computer assisted instruction (CAI) is being widely used. Drill and practice, tutorial help,  simulations, inquiry modes (these allow students to ask questions within the context of the lesson), problem solving, and computerized games are common varieties of CAI. And third, computers are being used in what is called computer assisted learning. Students use the computer as an aid in solving problems, reviewing, and evaluating their progress. The booklet discusses training teachers to use a computer. Instructional software for teachers is cited. A sample lesson, \"Election Projections,\" for using computers in the social studies classroom is provided. The booklet ends with a discussion of what the future holds. The results of a national survey to assess the use of computers in public elementary and secondary schools are also provided. A bibliography is included. (Author/RM)",

In the project's first phase, 38 school districts and higher education institutions located throughout the state were surveyed to determine the need in the areas of culture, economics, world issues, and language. The results of the survey are discussed. The second phase of the project involved state and regional inservice education. The project held many workshops for Local Education Agency representatives. Superintendents, teachers, principals, and staff coordinators received training on how to plan, organize, and promote cultural understanding in their schools and communities. The training  activities consisted of small and large group discussions, hands on simulations, and getting acquainted with cultural publications, brochures, and related literature. A wide variety of activities were then implemented in the schools and community. These activities are described in the report. According to a series of on site evaluations, the project was very successful. As a result, more than 47,000 Oklahomans representing state and local government, education, community and civic organizations, business and local student groups now have a broader view of world cultures. The project also succeeded in enhancing increased cooperation and understanding among local school personnel and community representatives. (Author/RM)",

The first provides an overview for instruction. Each exercise is described briefly with notations on the skills that the activity develops. Italicized notes draw the instructor's attention to special preparation of materials that may be needed. The two charts that accompany this section aid in the decision whether to chose a particular exercise and in preparation for its subsequent use in the classroom. Specific reports that must be available for students to complete  the various activities are cited. Since many of the desired 1980 census reports may not be published until late 1982, most examples were drawn from 1970 materials and include instructions that allow either 1970 or 1980 data to be used depending on availability. The exercises are located in the second part of the workbook and are organized according to six themes: collecting the data; accessing the data; the fieldwork interface; numerators and denominators; applications in the public sector; and applications in the private sector.

        "description":"Educational research is not having the impact on teaching practice that it could and should be having. In the past fifteen years, a four-tier pattern has emerged, with each tier more complex and revealing than the one before. Earlier researchers focused on description and differentiation in their studies, building a body of knowledge that could be tested and validated. After placing values on the findings, practice is altered, and improvement is sought. However, difficulties have arisen due to the lack of a comprehensive and systematic view of how research findings can and should be used to influence change. Recently, educational researchers have moved toward strengthening the understanding of process-product relationships, making it easier to use and apply research results.  Teacher educators should make sure that prospective teachers not only know the terrain of teaching and learning (product), but also know about it (process). In order to make the best use of research findings, teachers must conceive of and support appropriate delivery systems and take research utilization beyond edict, policy, and entreaty. (FG)",

        "description":"Withdrawn and disruptive students can make progress in an alternative school where they receive individualized instruction and attention with a system of earned credits and fines. The student body in an alternative school may be hetereogeneous, ranging from the borderline mentally retarded and learning disabled to the emotionally disturbed. Their ages can range from 13 to 19. However, the students have several factors in common: their personalities are out of control; they are seeking information about boundaries for their behavior; and they need success in a school environment. The academic work done by students can be a source of positive reinforcement if it starts at a point where success can be attained. By setting up a system where students must perform according to a  self-imposed contract, with privileges and grades earned through a point system, both boundaries and goals are clarified. Misbehavior, such as showing disrespect for teachers or for other students, smoking, or cheating, is punished by penalty points taken away from the contract. The only way students can fulfill their contracts is to achieve the agreed-upon number of points, through classroom assignments, listening to lectures, or doing office work. Students accumulate and can \"spend\" their points on grades, free time, or other privileges. This method, based on an economy of trade-offs, rechannels 95 percent of the destructive energy generated by withdrawn and disruptive students. (FG)",

        "description":"Attitude changes by student teachers resulting from participation in early field-based experiences in an inner-city elementary school were examined. Introductory sophomore-level courses (Introduction to Exceptional Children, Foundations of Educational Thought, and Human Growth and Development) were offered to two groups of students in a field-based and a campus-based program. Two attitude scales were used to measure pre- and post-test attitudes of these selected groups. One, a semantic differential scale, was designed to measure attitudes toward the three courses and the teacher education program. The second instrument, a questionnaire, sampled the attitudes toward schooling and multicultural education. Results of the testing revealed that the field-based students became less  positive in their attitudes toward schools and schooling while the attitude of the campus-based group remained the same or more positive. Both groups became more positive in their attitudes toward mainstreaming exceptional children. In their attitudes toward human development, the field-based students developed more positive attitudes toward people, while the campus-based group showed a tendency to become more negative. It can be concluded that, not only can early field-based experiences allow students to develop more realistic attitudes and expectations about the processes of schooling, but they can also provide an opportunity for self-assessment and can direct a student's career choice.

The first paper, &quot;Investigations into the Instructional Process (DPA Helsinki)&quot; describes the background, goals, and approach of the DPA team. Research was conducted on the development of a DPA classification of instructional events, joint lesson planning by teachers and students, and the use of the DPA taxonomy in characterizing the instructional process in selected classrooms in Finland. In the second paper, research on teacher decision making is  reviewed. One study in particular is cited because it showed that teachers did not plan lessons on the basis of objectives. The thesis of the third paper is that conflicts in terminology present a barrier to effective teacher education. A comparison of taxonomies is offered, and the DPA paradigm of instructional processes is introduced. References follow each of the papers. (FG)",

The first section presents an overview of non-research professional literature published on the beginning teacher in the United States from 1930 to the present. Books, journal articles, and ERIC documents are considered in four overlapping categories: (1) reflective interpretations of beginning teachers' experiences; (2) advice on the first year of teaching; (3) scholarly essays about the beginning teacher and the process of beginning to teach; and (4) reports of beginning teachers' own experiences. In the second section, research on the beginning teacher is reviewed. Induction practices, induction programs, and induction strategies are examined to deliberate actions designed to provide entry level support  for beginning teachers. This research is considered in five clusters: (1) the problems of beginning teachers; (2) the psychosocial aspects of beginning to teach; (3) evaluation of preservice and inservice induction efforts; (4) discipline and the beginning of school; and (5) qualitative studies on beginning to teach. Current induction efforts are considered in relation to research on the beginning teacher. In the final section of this paper, an agenda for research on beginning to teach is proposed. (JD)",

An introductory chapter identifies characteristics of successful staff development efforts, based on participatory decision making, the needs of teachers, students, and the community, and cooperation between the university and the school. The first article describes the planning of school-community resource centers in a high school and in two middle schools. Each resource center is &quot;owned&quot; by its creators because of the collaboration between parents and teachers in planning, staffing, and policy making. Another focus was adopted in a Lowell high school, where a Teacher Corps needs assessment pinpointed several problem areas, but found that the teachers did not want to accept  responsibility for complex curricular issues. With the approval of the principal, a committee of six department heads was empowered to address not only curricular and instructional improvement, but also teacher evaluation, thereby broadening their leadership role and improving their relations with each other. The third article describes the development and effects of a credit-bearing administrative practicum offered through Boston State College to faculty at three high schools. A case study of the actions taken by teachers participating in the practicum illustrates the positive steps involving parents and students in school events. A concluding commentary points out the distinguishing characteristics of staff development, comparing it to continuing education, professional development, and  personal development. It is suggested that, through effective planning and goal orientation, staff development success stories will be common. (FG)",

Typical of concerns expressed is the fear that children under the age of thirteen are not mature enough for contact sports and risk permanent bone and joint damage. There is agreement that children need vigorous activity, but controversy exists over whether the values and benefits of competitive sports are great enough to outweigh the hazards of physical injury and emotional damage. Many believe that permanent emotional harm can be caused through the creation of \"heroes\" and \"failures.\" Overemphasis on winning interferes with the school's physical education program for all children, and existing sports programs are too often designed to please parents and other spectators.  Individuals intensely involved in athletic programs in their early years may tire of these activities before they reach an age where their full potential can be realized. Coaches are often preoccupied with winning extramural games, to the detriment of the general physical education program for all students. Too often the middle school team may serve as a resource pool for the senior high varsity team, diminishing opportunities for all students except those with high ability for the sport. The nature of the majority of physical education and sports programs at the middle and junior high school levels reflects an alarming gap between what is known about the characteristics and needs of these students and actual practice.

The students were taught using a self-instructional (field-independent) approach or a cooperative (field-sensitive) approach. At the same time, both groups were learning to combine field-sensitive and field independent activities within their own lesson planning. Participants were undergraduate Spanish-English, Puerto Rican, bilingual teacher trainees. They were required to write lesson plans that incorporated behavioral objectives, Puerto Rican cultural elements, a variety of instructional strategies, and field-sensitive/field-independent elements in English and Spanish. During the training sessions, the self-instructional treatment group  used a self-teaching package. The cooperative treatment group was presented with the same training material through the use of scripts and materials that encouraged teacher-student interaction. In comparing the cooperative group with the self-instructional group, it was noted that the cooperative group scored significantly higher on its ability to write behavioral objectives, to include Puerto Rican cultural elements in the English language, and to plan for a variety of instructional strategies. It is suggested that the learning styles of adult, Spanish-English bilingual teacher trainees tend to be field-sensitive. A recommendation is made that trainees with Hispanic backgrounds should be given specific training before starting a field-independent module, since this popluation seems to  learn more effectively in a cooperative atmosphere.

        "description":"The relationship between athletic awareness and amount of exposure to sports is examined. Levels of organization theory assumes that a single situation can be experienced at different levels and that a given level cannot be mastered until competence has been achieved at the preceding lower level. For this study, it was hypothesized that basketball players with greater experience and skill would perceive their sport more accurately and at higher levels of organization than those with less experience. The subjects were 48 male undergraduates who had varying amounts of experience with organized basketball. They were shown a videotape of a basketball game without sound and asked to respond to a 57-item questionnaire divided into questions concerning four levels of organization.  Questions at the first level concerned form and technique, while those at the second level dealt with positioning or shot selection. Third level questions asked about individual plays and types of offenses and defenses, and questions at the fourth level dealt with manipulation and aspects of strategy. Answers were scored on two dimensions: whether they were correct, and the level to which the answers corresponded. As expected, differences in athletic awareness varied directly with the subject's exposure to basketball, supporting the general levels of organization theory. Another supporting factor was that the subjects in the lower three skill levels did not score highest at the most fundamental level, but at the next level above that, which is consistent with developmental research. The  results suggest that a major component of skill lies in \"knowing the game,\" and that highly skilled individuals see a different game than do their less experienced counterparts. (FG)",

        "description":"The development of a program of self-help support groups for teachers experiencing stress in Chicago public schools is described. These support groups attempted to alleviate stress-related illness by reducing teacher isolation and by enabling teachers to help each other cope with problems and fears. The support groups were led by teachers who volunteered to attend 36 hours of training sessions. Training emphasized generic listening, communication, and feedback skills. Experts in hypnosis and relaxation, nutrition, and exercise made presentations to the trainees and discussed how these topics are related to stress. The support groups focused on stressful conditions which members faced when teaching. Everyone in the group briefly described a current problem, and the group decided  which problem to discuss. Methods of coping were discussed by the group under the leadership of the trained volunteer, and possible solutions were considered. The member with the problem chose a solution to try in the upcoming week and selected a partner with whom to share progress and discuss difficulties. During the school year, 159 teachers contacted the program staff, and 128 were assigned to a support group. Evaluation of the program proved to be difficult. This is attributed, in part, to the fact that volunteer facilitators were not sufficiently committed to the research design of pre- and post-test evaluation methodology. Several changes are being made in the program for next year in an attempt to increase the number of participants and to obtain a systematic evaluation of the  program. (JD)",

By encouraging the students to take responsibility for certain facets of instruction, flexibility can be built into courses, adapting to individual pace, interests, and learning style. Three types of fully adaptive systems have become well-known, each with advantages. In each of the instructional systems, the instructor arranges the conditions for learning but, to some degree, leaves the major decisions about when, where, and pacing, up to the student. Programmed Instruction (PI) was  developed by B. F. Skinner in the 1950s. It is characterized by learning frames, teacher-developed units of instruction that use positive reinforcement and immediate feedback. F. S. Keller, a follower of Skinner, developed the Personalized System of Instruction (PSI), which has the following components: (1) self pacing; (2) unit perfection; (3) former students as proctors; (4) emphasis on written materials; (5) criterion-referenced testing and grading; and (6) retesting for achieving mastery. Although student procrastination is a problem in PSI, studies comparing this method with conventional classes overwhelmingly favored PSI. The third adaptive instruction model is computer assisted instruction, a system that demands knowledge of equipment (hardware) and programs and methods (software).  Depending on the program, computers are interactive and flexible, have infinite patience, and can be prescriptive--an excellent method for drilling and practice. All three methods can be successfully incorporated into an existing mode of instruction. (FG)",

        "description":"A series of weekly seminars were conducted in which 15 elementary and secondary teachers were encouraged and helped to investigate, in some depth, topics related to their current practice. The project was designed to help teachers develop and carry out research investigations in their own classroom. Another project objective was to get the findings published. The rationale was that there should be more efforts to develop and disseminate educational theory from successful pratice. Within this forum, the teachers were encouraged to identify and initiate research into classroom problems and practices that should be investigated. Included in this report are: (1) notes and tapes of the seminar sessions; (2) excerpts from journals kept by the participants; (3) selected responses by  staff members to the journal entries; (4) periodic interviews; (5) the director's agenda notes and personal notes on the projects; (6) participant's reports; (7) consultants' reports of observations and interviews done at the request of participants; and (8) staff meeting notes. It is concluded that the project was an effective professional development activity and that the structure of the seminars enabled the group to start building on each other's knowledge. It is questioned, however, whether a contribution was made to systematizing and developing a cumulative body of practitioners' knowledge which requires publication in order to be widely accessible to teachers not in the group. Recommendations are given for changes that would make it more likely that teachers would write reports of  their investigations and get them published. (JD)",

It is oriented toward the solution of educational problems and demonstrates how to use ERIC for this purpose. It consists of both an instructor-directed learning unit and an independent learning unit, which provides the student with an opportunity to work on a particular problem using ERIC resources. Part I, the Instructor Guide, contains descriptions of information available in three ERIC publications: Resources in Education (RIE), Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE), and the Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors. A step-by-step description is given of how to conduct an ERIC manual search and of how to  work with an information specialist to complete an ERIC computer search. The unit is designed so that information may be presented via transparencies and group lecture methods. Complementing this unit are a script for transparency presentation, two participant tests, and a simulation exercise. Part II, the Instructor-directed Learning Unit, contains masters which may be duplicated for participant use. These include a participant guide called &quot;Securing Information Through ERIC&quot;, participant tests and unit evaluation forms, and masters from which transparencies may be made. Part III is an Independent Learning Unit which may be used through a self-instructional, individualized approach. Included are masters for the participant guide of the Independent Learning Unit and a participant  evaluation form. The fourth part of the module contains information on directories of ERIC search services, bibliographies, and other resources. (JD)",

        "description":"The University of Arizona College of Education and the Tucson (Arizona) Unified School District have cooperatively developed a staff development program that addresses the needs of teachers who are implementing bilingual and multicultural curricula. The Tucson Model for Effective Staff Development is based on the belief that successful integration of diverse students begins with the belief systems of the educator. A three-week summer training institute provided opportunities for workshop activities and feedback through the initial daily meeting of all participating staff. School-centered special interest projects met in the afternoons and were the responsibility of the school principals. A followup program, consisting of six Saturday workshops, is planned to reinforce the skills  taught in the summer institute. An illustration of two components of the model are the workshops on learning and teaching styles. The rationale behind the workshops is that, if teaching is interaction, then, to improve teaching, the interaction must change. Teachers should understand interactions that can result from supportive behavior patterns such as proximity, listening, touching, and asking a higher level question. Another useful tool for teachers is the Hill Model of Cognitive Style Mapping, which is an inventory designed to personalize instruction for students having difficulty in achieving academic success.

        "description":"A study was made of techniques used by teachers of children from widely diverse ethnic backgrounds. Thirty-two classrooms with children from ages four to eight years were observed and the teachers were interviewed. Most of the children were non-English speaking Vietnamese, Hmong (Laos), and Mexican Americans. Observers assessed the broad areas of classroom organization, social interactions in the classroom, rules and routines, cultural continuity in the classroom, and innovative strategies used by the teacher. Few innovative strategies were observed. Classrooms, for the most part, were conducted much as any other kindergarten through second grade classrooms. From the observations, a profile was drawn of the type of teacher who would be most effective in an ethnically diverse  classroom. This model teacher individualizes the entire curriculum for each child and interacts in a positive and supportive manner with each. Much praise and encouragement characterizes this teaching style. The classroom decorations reflect the ethnic background and heritage of all the children, and the teacher refers to aspects of the childrens' culture during learning activities. This teacher maintains close contact with parents, and attempts to learn a few words of the languages the children speak. The classroom of the model teacher is arranged so that children work face to face, and children are not stereotyped by ethnic or racial identity or academic ability. Of the teachers observed in this study, at least seven displayed all or nearly all of these characteristics and behaviors.  The Multicultural Classroom Checklist used for observation is included in this report as well as a copy of the questionnaire used in the interviews. (JD)",

After a field-based research study was conducted, a system was devised by which the SPI can improve coordination of staff development programs and resources among the major agencies involved: SPI, educational service districts, institutions of higher education, teacher centers, Teacher Corps, local school districts, private schools, and professional organizations. The system is designed to: (1) facilitate the sharing of limited staff development resources; (2) establish a statewide communication and information channel; (3) link providers and users of staff development in  program planning; (4) provide training for those responsible for staff development; (5) improve the quality of needs assessments, evaluation, and implementation; and (6) gather information for use in statewide planning, policy making, goal identification, and priority setting. This voluntary communication and support system would consist of local level collaborative units (Staff Development Compacts) linked by a formal communication channel, the Staff Development Compact Council. This council would also provide specific support and training activities. Supporting components of the system are a state level interagency advisory committee, a committee to coordinate staff development activities for the system, and a coordinator serving as liaison with the SPI. In this report, an analysis is  given of current coordination activities, factors which impede or facilitate coordination, and a proposed three-year implementation process. Recommendations are made for generating a sound system of coordination. (JD)",

The quantity of schooling is defined by length of the school day and year, and pupil attendance. The allotment of time for subjects in the curriculum relates to achievement levels in such subjects as math, language, and reading. The pattern of time allocation for various subject areas is an important  consideration when planning and implementing instruction. Pupil involvement is particularly important in achievement and consists of attention, task persistence, active learning time, and engagement on task. Constant and supportive feedback from the teacher is a factor in improving pupil involvement, comprehension, and achievement.

In fact, the principal evidence reported by Nairn comes from a series of reports developed by ETS and published by the College Board. The relationship between test scores and family income is far more moderate than Nairn suggests; students from each income level obtain the full range of SAT scores. Finally, it is doubtful that the cause of social equality will be furthered by  eliminating evidence of unequal educational preparation. History indicates, in fact, that admission to higher education was far more a matter of class and economic status prior to the use of national admissions tests than it has been since. (Author/BW)",

Nairn's claims that the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is a poor predictor of performance in college and are based on faulty statistics. He uses an incorrect value for the characteristic validity of the SAT (.345) since he mistakenly averages the separate validities of the two parts of the SAT, rather than considering the validity of the whole test (.41). Predictions based on valid information will be better than random predictions. The best predictor of college grades is the high school record, but the SAT is  nearly as good, and the two together are better than either alone. The tests administered by ETS are sponsored and controlled by associations of colleges that use scores on the tests as one factor in admissions decision-making. They are designed to provide a common basis for evaluation, to supplement students' academic records, and to permit students to satisfy admissions testing requirements through taking a single examination.

The schools, however, give grades on a scale from 70 to 100, regardless of the difficulty of the school curriculum. This means that a score of 82 in a G40 school is recorded the same as an 82 in a G80 school although the scores in a G80 school must indicate a higher level of performance than the same score does in the G10 school. This study is an evaluation of a method of adjusting technical school grades issued by schools of varying difficulty so that a new  criterion is formed with all school grades adjusted to the same metric. This new criterion was then used to recompute aptitude indexes, which were compared with aptitude indexes computed in the conventional manner. The new aptitude indexes predicted school grades in a cross-validation sample better than did conventional aptitude indexes. (Author/BW)",

The basic question addressed was, &quot;Is performance on multi-component tasks predicted by performance on the individual components performed separately?&quot; In the first series of experiments, a dual task involving memory and verbal processing components to predict a psycholmetric measure of verbal ability was used. The two types of measures predicted performance on the criterion verbal ability measure equally well. In the second experimental series, ability to detect visual and auditory targets in single channel, focused attention, and divided attention conditions were compared. Performance in the single channel conditions predicted performance in focused and divided attention conditions. Performance on a simple  secondary task executed during an easy primary version of the primary task. Dual task performance provided information unavailable from the single task counterpart. The theoretical basis of this research was provided by a &quot;general resource&quot; theory of attention, in which all mental processes are seen as drawing on the same pool of attentional capacity. The Production Activation Model, a more explicit model of inter-task interference, was developed. (Author/DWH)",

        "description":"Levels of Use (LOU) interviews can be used for formative evaluation purposes in an intermediate education agency. Programs and services for training teachers provided to districts are evaluated. LOU interviews give program staff unique information for improving programs. Program improvement is aided by LOU interviews because information is provided that program staff cannot obtain on their own. The information corroborates whether programs are proceeding according to plan. Evaluation and program staffs develop a stronger working relationship and both gain an understanding of the program. Well defined relevant criteria is the goal of the process. Survey instruments do not reveal the same kind of information. The interview technique allows communication and effectively identifies  how teachers are using the innovation. A wealth of formative evaluation information is provided by the interviews in the areas of student characteristics, materials, objectives, testing, and classroom management. The information proved useful in identifying areas of need and allowed project staff to make decisions for program improvement. It is especially valuable in its application to the purposes of formative evaluation by practitioners responsible for effective change in schools. The major limitation cited was the cost to execute valid evaluation. (DWH)",

This address focuses on an empirical evaluation of the cultural test bias hypothesis, especially emphasizing the construct validity and criterion-related validity of these tests. A considerable body of literature exists failing to substantiate cultural bias against native-born American ethnic minorities with regard to the use of well-constructed, adequately standardized intelligence and aptitude tests. With respect to personality scales, the evidence is far more preliminary and thus considerably less conclusive. Despite this evidence, psychologists need to  keep abreast of new findings in the area. As new technioues and better methodology are developed and more specific populations examined, the now seen as random, infrequent findings of bias may become better understood and seen to display a correctable pattern.

The experiments described here provide estimates of both developmental and aging differences in visual backward masking under conditions which maximize interference in the central visual system. The results indicate that when no-mask recognition performance is at 100 percent, significant Age X Stimulus Onset Asynchronies interactions can be detected. However, the absence of this type of interaction when no-mask recognition performance is adjusted to the 70 percent level suggests that these interactions are caused by factors other than rate of processing differences.

The representativeness of children referred for Committees on the Handicapped (COH) evaluation; social-demographic and administrative variables related to referral rates at the school level; and representativeness of the population of pupils placed in publicly funded private programs for the handicapped were examined. Hispanics and blacks were found to be discriminated against in public funding for private school placement. Examination of the policies that determine a student's qualifications for public funding would be the most cost effective remedy to reduce representational discrepancies in the REP  process. Referral to COH was found to be predominantly disciplinary among blacks, while for whites it was learning problems. The existence of remedial and supplementary programs at the local school level would reduce non-essential labeling and segregation of children. The addition of bilingual staff would reduce representational disparities in public school special education. Ethnic disparity in granting of contract aid accounted for the discrepancies in ethnic representation of public school handicapped programs. (DWH)",

Extensive improvement in instructional programming was achieved for one-third of the students served, with modest benefits for another third, and negligible effects for the last third. These benefits were limited by factors external to the Vocational Evaluation Center. For three of five districts studied, important spinoff effects on the secondary school special education program were identified. Educators discussed the vocational evaluation reports; the only possible area for improvement might be debriefing. More than twice the number of students expected were served. Sixty  percent of the students were learning disabled; 18 percent were emotionally disturbed; other eligibilities accounted for relatively small percentage. Besides achieving its objectives, this project demonstrated continuous improvements in its procedures; conducted outreach activities; and performed over 100 group-based prevocational skills screenings.

Magnet schools are intended to promote desegregation by permitting parents to make voluntary choices among schools, rather than through bussing or other student assignment plans. The present study sought to trace the workings of the magnet schools concept in the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) from its design in the planning stages, through the implementation of quality educational programs, to the response of parents to the program, and finally to how this complete system influences desegregation within the seven elementary schools of the Takoma  Park Cluster. Thus, the report contains the following sections: (1) Design of the Magnet Cluster; (2) Description of the Magnet School Program; (3) Program Comparisons with Nonmagnet Schools; (4) Parents' Knowledge of and Response to the Program; (5) Pupil Achievement; and (6) Desegregation Effects. Findings showed that the educational features prescribed for each of the magnet schools are functioning, and the magnet school programs appear to have higher levels of several educational quality factors.

        "description":"For various well-documented reasons, the feminist social movement has been critical of academia as a worksetting and of the social sciences as a set of disciplines. For these reasons, feminists claim that the assumptions underlying several research designs and procedures are sexist. They have developed a feminist methodology to examine these assumptions and advocate certain methods which they believe to be more consistent with feminist principles. This paper defines sexism, feminism, method and methodology in order to illuminate this body of criticism. It then elaborates the different stances taken by feminists in response to the questions: Is there a feminist method? And, if so, what are its characteristics? The three methodological positions taken in response to these questions  are explained. These positions are then shown to produce four distinct types of feminist researchers which can be labelled: careerists, adopter/adapters, alternative paradigm developers and triangulators. Definitions of each type are offered and representative literature is cited. In conclusion, the paper notes that feminist methodology is currently pluralistic and that an intense debate is in progress among these positions. (Author/BW)",

First, techniques to assess the educational value of life experiences (especially adults contemplating new educational or work experiences are described). The work of Ruth Ekstrom stresses deriving the dimensions of accomplishment to be assessed from the interests and background of the individual, rather than from a predetermined list of characteristics to be measured. Secondly, an attempt should be made to provide more complete and analytical information to examinees about the nature and quality of their test performance. The results of assessment in learning, whether formal or non-formal, must be communicated clearly to all students, together with aids necessary for  interpretation of those results. The purpose is not to analyze the possibilities that are available in an automated society, but to fully utilize techniques that minimize high technology, which are readily available and are now being applied.

The FPAIS is a comprehensive system for managing curriculum, intended to improve instruction for students. The Assessment Component includes the gathering and analysis of information for evaluation purposes. Assessments are conducted to determine the extent of student attainment of specified objectives, certify mastery of competencies, review the curriculum to determine whether intended learning is occurring, review instructional materials and approaches, and determine student readiness. Nine steps occur in planning any assessment: determine assessment needs, determine assessment parameters,  obtain data collection instruments, determine data collection procedures, determine reporting requirements, determine data analysis procedures, determine data synthesis and presentation procedures, collect the data, and analyze the data. The appendix includes a listing of selected assessment resources. (Author/BW)",

The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, English and Spanish versions, was administered to preschool participants twice during the school year. A teacher's interview was conducted to survey the concepts, attitudes, and opinions of Title VII teachers. The interview included commentaries about the class, training activities, parent participation, curriculum, and interaction with the administration. The teachers made suggestions for improvements in the program.  They were satisfied with the program and believed it had an essential role in the language development of the students. Classroom observations were conducted and recorded by evaluators. Instruction time was classified and evaluated. A parent's questionnaire, written in English and Spanish, was administered. The major topics in the questionnaire were parental involvement, at-home activities, recruiting, and suggestions. Documentation from the bilingual education department was used to decide upon the components which needed modification. The costs associated with the program were determined from this information.

Historically, the members of some groups, notably the poor, have seldom had that chance because they have lacked effective instruction in the skills needed to advance within the culture. The issue of access includes a succession of opportunities, with each success making the next one more likely, and each failure a barrier to further progress. &quot;Student-centered assessment&quot; is proposed as a means of substantially improving the chance of all students to develop as far and as fast  as they can. It emphasizes immediate feedback to both the student and the teacher. Examples from the classroom and from the guidance process are used to illustrate this model of assessment. Its implications for admission requirements for higher education are discussed. (Author/BW)",

A presenter's guide provides detailed information for the workshop leader. Specific objectives for participants include description of meaning of NCE gain, conversion to a percentile change,  construction of confidence bands around gains and use of them to guide interpretations.

A study was made of NES operations during the presidential election year of 1980 to determine (1) the nature of the structural organization of NES and how that organization enhanced or inhibited information dissemination, (2) how election returns were disseminated on election night, (3) how accurate those returns were, and (4) the potential impact of NES on the electoral process. Data were gathered through participant observation of NES activities and through interviews with NES executives and managers in three different locations. The resulting  data revealed that NES is a complex organization that seems to be essential to election returns dissemination. While the television networks and wire services that comprise NES all use its service, they each rely on other means of making early projections of winners in specific races. Although NES strives for complete accuracy, its figures are not always the same as those released by official agencies--largely due to the large number of possible error sources. The NES system raises questions pertaining to influences on reporting that the elimination of competition in data collection has caused. (FL)",

With each grade level the number of total words produced in response to the assigned task increased significantly. The calculated rates of exophoric references, however,  were not significant for either grade or socioeconomic status, although the rate of exophoric reference appeared to stay the same or decline slightly across grade levels.

For a number of reasons, many English teachers regard global education as part of the social studies curriculum. However, global education also should be part of the English curriculum because (1) the field of English is so broad that no attempt to organize or relate the subdisciplines can be without merit; (2) facility in language is fundamental to every discipline; (3) literature is a reflection of the universal problems, values, and activities of all humankind; (4) the skills of reading, writing, speaking, and listening can be taught in many contexts of usage; (5) the benefits of comparative approaches in literature,  humanities, and languages are potentially even greater than hitherto represented; (6) divergent points of view can be fostered especially well in the English classroom; and (7) myths, symbols, metaphors, translations, and forms of expression are all culture oriented. A multidisciplinary approach to global education developed by the Livonia Public School District in Michigan offers students three sequences. The first sequence deals with the deep past from the creation of the cosmos to the middle ages in human history; the second sequence concerns the present--the discovery and colonization of the United States in relation to the rest of a developing world; and the third sequence deals with the skills, attitudes, and facts needed to face a future filled with alternatives.

No statistical differences between the groups were revealed by the attitude surveys or the objective posttest of cognitive achievement.

The work of William Perry, a developmental psychologist, can contribute to an understanding of that development. Based on an analysis of interviews of undergraduates during four years at Harvard University, Perry identified a developmental sequence of student attitudes toward their college experiences beginning with dualism, moving through multiplicity and relativism, and arriving at commitment within relativism. The Perry scheme gives college composition teachers a way to describe their students, to understand what intellectual or cognitive operations they control, and to determine  what kind of writing assignments would best serve their social and intellectual development. It also suggests the use of two pedagogical techniques that foster growth rather than inhibit it, expressive writing and collaborative learning. (AEA)",

        "description":"The latest perceptions of writer-audience relationships have not been applied to what teachers actually do in the classroom. When the idea of audience is applied at all, it is often misapplied, resulting in classroom activities that fail to facilitate learning and many, in some cases, that force students to perform tasks so unreal that credibility is destroyed. If it is true that the basics of generating and organizing material can be learned from any kind of writing as long as enough is performed and enough of the right kind of feedback is given (the assumption that justifies the use of belletristic models and expressive writing assignments), then the important thing is to provide students with as much feedback as possible on any kind of writing. The ideal would be a writing  course paired closely with a content course and team taught by a composition and a content area instructor. If this is unwieldy administratively, then instructors should provide writing assignments that are related to the types of writing the students will likely encounter in other disciplines. The specific differences between assignments in various disciplines are mostly a matter of external format and should be learned in the relevant content courses. Composition instructors should teach general writing strategies, including a sensitivity to audience.

Their papers are foredoomed to mediocrity or worse. By overstressing the dichotomy between critical and creative writing, teachers have overlooked the creative dimension of doing research. Overcoming students' feelings that their experiences cannot possibly yield insights valuable enough to write about is an essential step toward having them take a more active command of their material. The following techniques can help students see themselves as creative researchers putting information together in new ways for specific purposes and  audiences: (1) introducing students to media models that combine personal voice and experience with secondary sources; (2) asking students to take stock of their prior knowledge on a subject and incorporate their personal experiences into their research papers; (3) heightening their awareness of the malleability of facts by designing exercises to show that the same facts can support different, even opposing, points; (4) encouraging them to use interviews as a source of information; and (5) having them cope consciously with their audience.

Analysis of data revealed that students who entered a composition class with below mean levels in syntactic maturity made gains in both treatment groups, with students in the one-to-one treatment classes making the larger gains in writing proficiency. However, students who were above the mean level when they entered a class were likely to exhibit loss of syntactic fluency, sometimes drastically.

Today composition theory is often demeaned as being only pedagogical while literary study is granted the status of a self-fulfilling academic pursuit. What is needed is a model or matrix that could establish scholarly interaction between the two fields. Such a model would have to address (1) the nature of a written text--its capacity for analysis as both a product of a prior activity and the reflection of a human process; (2) the nature of a writing event, whether defined as an act of recording meaning or as a unique, individual, indeterminate event; (3) the relation of both individual texts and discrete writing events to  intertextuality--the history of texts and their conventions; (4) the relation of the individual writer to a particular text, to a particular writing event, and to the history and conventions at a particular moment of writing; (5) the relation of the public impact of writing to the individual writer; and (6) the propriety of research questions, evidence, or methods within the study of the foregoing issues.

Responses were returned by 134 writing program directors and 135 composition instructors from publicly or privately funded institutions, two-year colleges, four-year institutions, or universities with substantial graduate programs. A composite list of items was created for each response, which was then coded and keypunched for computer analysis. The results showed only two goals that were mentioned by both program directors and teachers: writing mechanically correct prose and writing coherent prose, both to which were mentioned as real goals and as ideal goals. In addition, directors and  teachers perceived these to be goals for their department, their institution, and society at large. While there was a high correspondence between societal goals and real goals on the issue of writing mechanically correct prose, no such relationship appeared on the issue of writing coherent prose. The results indicated differences between the directors' and instructors' perceptions, suggesting that any attempt to evaluate freshman writing programs must begin by addressing those different perceptions of real and ideal program goals for their departments, institutions, and society.

Half of the subjects identified, in rank order of frequency, behaviors on the checklist associated with successful relationships, while the other half used the same checklist to identify in rank order those behaviors indicating the end of a relationship. The results were generally consistent with those reported in previous literature in  nonverbal communication. The power of negative nonverbal affect as a discriminator between distressed and nondistressed couples was a major finding, particularly with regard to decreases in eye contact, smiling, and laughter. The data revealed some modest sex differences, mostly in the sequencing of cues for deteriorating relationships. For males, expressions of affect disappeared before displays of affection. (RL)",

Variables that were studied included message, channel, and source uncertainty; demographic variables; role description variables; and worker satisfaction. The results of the study revealed that, (1) similar to other organizations, satisfaction was significantly correlated with task, human, and maintenance message uncertainty. Human uncertainty accounted for the largest amount of the variance in satisfaction, nearly 17%. (2) The hospital used in the case study was different  from the other organizations analyzed in that there appeared to be problems involving written channels and immediate supervisors.

The subjects, 103 students enrolled in a basic course in public speaking, were asked to complete the CAG immediately after their third assigned speech in the course. An analysis procedure was used to provide a visual comparison of speaker apprehension levels during different points in the speech occasion. Results showed that communication apprehension ratings were at their  highest immediately before and during the first two minutes of the speech itself.

Each dyad was told that the experiment was to measure verbal interaction and that they would be left alone in a room to get to know as much as possible about each other in 5 minutes. An observer behind a two-way mirror measured  the physical distance established and noted the kinesic behavior of each pair. Results showed that communication apprehension predicted proxemic establishment, with the level of apprehension increasing as the amount of distance between dyadic members decreased. In both high-low and low-low apprehensive groups, the black dyads established closer distance patterns than did whites. Apprehension also affected kinesic behavior, with body orientation in dyads tending to be more front-to-front as apprehension increased. Finally, no differences were found in the kinesic behavior of the dyads when examined by race alone. (FL)",

It describes chronemic behavior in the United States as linear, formal, and precise--reflecting a cultural emphasis on newness, progress, and efficiency--and in Iran as marked by temporality and interpretable in terms of a complex mixture of Persian lifestyles, foreign interference in Iranian history, Islamic &quot;instantaneism,&quot; and Shi'ite mysticism.

That is, funds generated from state and local sources cannot be decreased and the slack taken up with the federal moneys. The Rand Corporation study reported in this document found that, due primarily to economic and demographic changes, the rate of noncompliance with these requirements has begun to increase and will probably continue to do so. A trend toward tightening the requirements and centralizing the overseeing authority during recent years has made the situation even more difficult. Drawing on documentary data and interviews with officials of the U.S. Office of Education and of state  education agencies in 10 states facing compliance problems, the study reveals that a review of the requirements may be in order. The study team offers five alternative policy approaches for consideration: (1) continue to enforce current requirements; (2) grant discretionary waiver authority to the Secretary of Education; (3) return waiver authority to the states; (4) modify the requirements and the penalties for noncompliance; and (5) develop a unified intergovernmental aid policy at the federal level.

        "description":"As part of a study of programs offering alternative educational choices in public school systems, the Rand Corporation assessed teacher reactions to programs in four districts: Alum Rock (California); Eugene (Oregon); Minneapolis (Minnesota); and Cincinnati (Ohio). It was found that teachers tend to evaluate a program on the basis of its advantages and disadvantages to students, parents, and the teachers themselves. While teachers generally favored parental choice, they were skeptical about parents' capacity to choose effectively as well as about the degree of impact alternative programs could have on students. Teachers were reluctant to assume the added managerial duties associated with alternative programs. Teachers responded positively to working in buildings housing only one  program at a time, to effective district leadership, and to having a voice in program control and the admission of students. The four districts sampled are compared and relationships between teacher response patterns and district policies are drawn in this report, which concludes with three recommendations: districts should more effectively inform the public about alternative programs; district plans should balance the needs of consumers, teachers, and the school organization; and the maintenance of financial equity among programs should be stressed.

Originally an experimental educational voucher system within the public school system, the Alum Rock project never became a full-fledged voucher program but did enable researchers to examine the relative cognitive and noncognitive impacts of several variables in educational programing. Neither the experimental group of students (those in alternative programs) nor the control group (those  remaining in regular programs) was a random sample, information was lacking concerning the motivations behind parental choices, and test data were imperfect, so researchers had to modify their information to accommodate sample biases before applying analysis of covariance. Over 9,000 students were involved in the study, 60 percent of whom enrolled in alternative programs. The results, presented with caution, indicate little difference in the benefits to students of alternative and regular programs, but show a marked relationship between student outcomes and teachers' perceptions of themselves and their programs.

        "description":"An educational voucher demonstration program begun in 1972 developed into an experiment in alternative education within a public school framework and served as a springboard for a study of the nature and effectiveness of alternative programs generally. By the time the data gathering was completed in 1977, four middle- to large-sized school districts had been studied and compared: Minneapolis (Minnesota), Cincinnati (Ohio), Eugene (Oregon), and the Alum Rock district of San Jose (California). The results were published in six volumes which this seventh volume summarizes along with a discussion of policy implications. The issues addressed in the six reports were (1) the effect of district policies on implementation of alternatives, (2) how school principals influence the success of  alternatives, (3) how alternative programs affect teachers, (4) how families choose among educational alternatives, (5) whether alternatives achieve diversity in the classroom, and (6) how alternatives affect student outcomes. In concluding remarks the study team discusses the advisability of thoroughly evaluating district needs, anticipating difficulties, and adopting procedural formality at the local level when alternatives are implemented. They suggest further that the federal role should consist of financial support for innovation. (Author/PGD)",

The 52-item survey instrument was administered to 651 students in grades 9-12. Followup interviews of students were held in the four schools scoring highest and lowest on the measure. The questionnaire was designed to provide information concerning the students' general satisfaction with their schools, their perceptions of positive and negative qualities of their school environments, and their opinions concerning the schools' effectiveness in encouraging personal and social development, useful learning, and the acquisition of technical competence.  Responses were compared by institution, grade level, and sex of respondents. The study results were mixed, failing to provide clear-cut guidelines for designing a school with optimal quality of life. Only the attitude of teachers to students stood out as having a universally critical effect. Measurable but less consistent effects were related to curriculum, peer attitudes, facilities, and school rules. The study indicated the instrument could be useful with minor modification. A copy of the survey instrument is appended. (Author/PGD)",

        "description":"Analysis of changes in federal education policy in the 1960s, based on archival research and other sources, suggests a reinterpretation of the causes of the success or failure of the new federal programs. A review of the literature on these &quot;Great Society&quot; educational policies finds that most authors feel the policies sprang from a coalescence of legislative, racial, religious, and presidential factors in the mid-1960s. Archival evidence on that period, however, points to three further factors: the activist role of the federal budget bureau on task forces formulating educational policy; federal economic advisors' call for an expansionary budget in 1965; and President Lyndon Johnson's practice of proposing new Great Society programs while underfunding the old ones. The new  policies also created &quot;iron triangles&quot; of educational interest groups that helped replace old federal education bureaucracies with new ones. Based on a perspective from the 1980s, an evaluation of the Great Society educational programs concludes that most have worked poorly, been underfunded and over-ambitious, and tended to resegregate some of their beneficiaries. Evaluation from an even longer perspective, however, may show that the programs worked. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"Researchers used school district data and an attitudinal survey to assess an incentive pay plan for teachers instituted by the Houston (Texas) Independent School District for the school years 1979-81. Called the Second Mile Plan (SMP), the scheme aimed to improve student academic achievement and teacher attendance, lessen teacher turnover, fill teaching vacancies, and provide extended instructional programs. The SMP rewarded teachers in seven areas, including student gains on standardized achievement tests, teaching assignment location, certification in critical curriculum areas, professional development, attendance, extended instructional time, and recruitment of other teachers into the district. Data on teacher pay show the incentive stipends added $6.5 million to total teacher  salaries in 1979-80, or about 6 percent of average teacher salary. In 1980-81 stipends added $4.5 million. The data further show that for both years teacher attendance and student test scores improved and teacher turnover and vacancies decreased. Extended programs were added in 1979-80 but this part of the SMP was dropped in 1980-81. Random-sample surveys of district teachers indicate, however, that neither recipients nor nonrecipients of stipends felt the SMP influenced them to work harder, come to work every day, or develop themselves professionally.

        "description":"An exploration in the context of feminist science of one theoretical basis of educational administration--Abraham Maslow's theory of human motivation and self-actualization--finds an androcentric bias in Maslow's methodology, philosophical underpinnings, and theory formulation. Maslow's hypothetico-deductive methodology was based on a conceptualization of human needs that found male qualities most desirable and that identified chiefly masculine goals as the goals of self-actualization. Women were seen as becoming self-actualized by achieving male goals. Maslow's sampling of self-actualizing people was biased since his sample was predominantly male. The validity of his data is difficult to assess because the data came from observation and from interviews for which there are no  transcripts. The generalizability of Maslow's findings is suspect because his sample was biased. Maslow's interpretation of his results creates a model in which male values predominate, the ranking of human needs (affiliation, self-esteem, and self-actualization) is male-oriented, and most characteristics of the self-actualizing person are masculine and centered on the individual. An alternative view of female self-actualization, based on histories of two women's communities, emphasizes such values as group orientation, affiliation, emotional maintenance, development of self and individual talents, and empathy.

One hundred fourteen doctoral dissertations on women in educational administration completed and abstracted from January 1973 through January 1979 were studied. The author of a typical dissertation is a female feminist working with a male advisor. The typical dissertation investigates the profile of the woman administrator, is approximately 175 pages in length, and tests no hypotheses. The paper and pencil questionnaire survey is the primary method of data collection, with the  results analyzed according to descriptive methods. The overall quality of the dissertations is not high. The lowest quality is found in the sampling plans and the highest quality in the reviews of the literature. Only 35.86 percent of the studies make an overall contribution to the literature. The only variables to have consistent relationships to the quality of the dissertations are research issues, data collection methods, and the feminist standing of the researchers. (Author/PGD).",

The researchers then examined five aspects (comprising 19 variables) of each of the articles: (1) research problem selection and formulation, including such variables as the article's conceptualization of roles, the significance of the problem for women, and the exploration of gender as a variable; (2) review of previous research, including the gender of authors reviewed; (3) specification of the population and sample selection, involving the gender balance of samples and the  justification of sample imbalance; (4) validity of methods and instruments, concerning sex-biased research instruments and surveys and interviewer-interviewee genders; and (5) interpretation of results, including generalization to gender groups and explanations of gender differences. The results of the analysis indicate that androcentric bias exists in all phases of research reported in the ten EAQ volumes. A copy of the data collection instrument is appended. (Author/RW)",

In the courses--one with 13 students, the other with 18--the decision seminar was used as an instructional framework within which planning and problem-solving simulations were conducted. The decision seminar is a social planning and problem-solving model comprising five components: (1) the management framework or setting for decision-making, (2) five problem-solving tasks, (3) a model identifying seven social process elements, (4) eight community value categories, and (5) a decision phase analysis that identifies six implementation and evaluation steps. Course  observation and interviews with course participants indicate that four types of learning outcomes in the classes could be attributed to the decision seminar framework. The first two types included prescriptive (or normative) learning about the way decision-making should be structured and descriptive learning about the process by which decisions are made. The second two types involved prescriptive and descriptive learning about the collection and use of information needed for making a decision. (Author/RW)",

Ego development levels were defined as either conformist or conscientious or a transitional conscientious-conformist level. Principals have seven power bases to rely on: rewards, coercion, legitimacy, others' feelings of \"oneness\" with the principal, expertise, information, and connections to powerful others. The 70 principals' ego development level was tested using the Loevinger Sentence Completion Test. A survey of 308 teachers in the 70 schools used the Richardson Power Profile, developed by the authors, to measure each principal's reliance on different power bases. Correlation of the  results showed there were no statistically significant differences in the patterns of power base use by principals grouped according to levels of ego development. These findings indicate that principals are psychologically able to vary power base use depending on situational factors. (Author/RW)",

Sugarman's advancement, in their book \"Education by Choice: The Case for Family Control,\" of the benefits of allowing parents to choose their child's education. Other support for the voucher system has come from James Coleman and some prominent civil rights leaders who suggest that educational vouchers are an attractive alternative for black families. The second category, recent shifts in the political climate, encompasses Reagan's emphasis on a competitive  market place, evangelical religious groups with political leanings like the Moral Majority, and taxpayer-rights groups. The third category of changes, social and demographic trends, includes the lack of support for public schools; an aging population paying an increasing portion of property tax revenues; and the white population's declining proportion of public school enrollments in the 1980s.

Chapters 4 and 5 deal with specialized classes and athletics, from which come the preponderance of tort suits. Chapter 6 reviews cases concerning corporal punishment or assault and battery, while chapter 7 looks at several cases  involving defamation of character. The malpractice suits presented in chapter 8 are very new but according to the author may be the most damaging of all tort suits in education.

        "description":"During the spring of 1980, 59,000 students from over 1,000 public and private high schools were surveyed to obtain base-year data for a projected longitudinal study entitled &quot;High School and Beyond.&quot; Intended to provide background information for making policy decisions, the study focused on four specific policy concerns: discipline, Hispanics, work, and private schools. This document is a verbatim transcript of an April, 1981 conference at which James Coleman, the project's principal investigator, presented his draft report on private schools. The report focused primarily on whether or not the data bore out the claims made favoring or opposing federal support for private education. The central issues in this debate are whether the quality of cognitive and affective learning is  greater in private schools than in public schools, and whether private schooling is a divisive force in our society. The conference also included a report by Andrew Greeley of his work on the impact of Catholic education, based on the same survey data. A discussion of both reports by eight experts and responses to questions from the audience, concerned particularly with methodological matters and with the findings' implications for federal educational policy, concluded the conference.

Establishment of an evaluation team early in the program development process proved beneficial in that the evaluators helped develop measurable program objectives, and were able to assist in needs assessment and in the measurement of the base-line conditions prior to the program's implementation. A comparison of the nutritional knowledge and nutritional practices of students in 48 elementary schools revealed that, in a majority of the grade levels evaluated, students who had participated in the program less than a year  exhibited greater knowledge and better practices than did students in schools where the program had not been implemented.

        "description":"The belief that the similarities between business administration and public administration are more significant than the differences led in the 1950s to the development of schools teaching administration as a generic process. This paper reassesses eight tenets underlying the generic model for administrative education, drawn from the work of early advocates and developers of the concept. Directed toward both the nature of the concept and its implementation, these eight tenets hold that (1) significant phenomena and problems are common to the many fields of administration; (2) a common body of knowledge and methodological approach exists; (3) many administrators will work in the business, government, and education sectors in various combinations during their careers, and can be  trained in all simultaneously; (4) the allocation of faculty resources is based on the programmatic integrity of both the core and the institutional areas; (5) recruitment of students and placement of graduates need not be differentiated among client groups; (6) the academic experience facilitates preparation for private and public management equally; (7) the commonalities of the generic ideal can overcome traditionally differentiating forces in the university environment; and (8) generic schools are efficient vehicles for education in public and private management.

        "description":"The effectiveness with which research findings are disseminated to policy makers in education, particularly at the state level, is explored in the four chapters of this report. In chapter 1, Linda J. Nelson reviews the literature and determines that policy makers do make important, but indirect, use of research. She suggests that research institutes can adopt a number of strategies to make research more useful. The second chapter, by Eugene Bardach, proposes a theory of how the process of research dissemination works. Bardach argues that the cost of consuming social science research is high while the specificity of the contexts in which the research can be used lowers its average value, especially as compared with research in the natural sciences. Low rates of research use may  result more directly from this situation than from problems in dissemination. Chapter 3, by Nelson and Michael W. Kirst, reports on a survey of 266 policy makers in California, Virginia, and Maryland conducted to determine the informational needs and disseminational preferences of educational policy makers at the state level. The final chapter, by Christopher Bellavita, discusses the strategies used for dissemination by information-producing organizations, as well as their recommendations and cautions. (Author/PGD)",

As hypothesized, trained teachers used a greater variety of instructional patterns, asked more higher cognitive level questions and responded more facilitatively. Students in these classes gave more higher level responses and initiated interaction more often. Unexpected results included an indication that the most higher cognitive level activity occurs in small group settings. Results indicated that a teacher's  qualifications for facilitative classroom interaction lie in use of a variety of grouping patterns, spontaneous use of higher level questions, and facilitative responding rather than correcting or praising comments.

Ss were administered three forms of the referential communication task. Their activity was recorded by a motion recorder strapped to the Ss' nondominant wrist and by observation. Transcriptions of the Ss' verbalizations during tasks were made according to productivity, dysfluencies, impulsive responses, commentary, nonwords, questions, and self guiding comments. Hyperactive Ss were more verbally and nonverbally active than control Ss during transitions between tasks and during the performance of listening tasks. However, task related movements failed to differentiate population groups. Results suggested that verbal activity was a supplementary form of  self-generated stimulation. Verbal behavior of hyperactive Ss was characterized by proportionately more of the nonelicited language unrelated to the task and by greater dysfluency, but only during the referential communication tasks and training.

Among the findings discussed in the executive summary are the following: although the results of the  evaluation permit a precise definition of a student's learning disability, parents often did not understand what the definition meant; the STP parents viewed the IEP document with skepticism but valued the IEP conference as an opportunity to discuss other issues related to the student's total educational program, such as possible careers and post high school education; students in self contained classes perceived stigma associated with their placement although not directed toward them personally; the successful integration of the STP students into regular classes depended on type of class, academic ability and skill of the student, and motivation of the student; and disputes between parents and the school were usually resolved through an informal meeting.

        "description":"The document contains the second annual report of findings from a longitudinal study of 17 local education agencies (LEAs) on the implementation of P.L. 94-142 (the Education for All Handicapped Children Act). An introductory section describes the content of the report and design of the study. Chapter II considers the observed changes in the special education delivery systems in terms of strategies to decrease backlogs in children awaiting evaluation or placement; expansion of services to the preschool, elementary, and secondary student populations; changes in personnel and roles with particular emphasis on the boundary crosser role between special and regular education; and issues pertaining to borders of LEAs' responsibility. A third chapter discusses the responses, primarily  at the school level, to those requirements of the law that directly affect the extent to which the needs of individual students are met. Discussion focuses on criteria for determining who receives special education and procedures from evaluation to placement. Included among the summary of findings in a final chapter are that LEAs had either tightened eligibility rules for the mildly handicapped or they expanded services allowing an increase in special education placements; that inservice training for regular education and administrative personnel remained minimal; and that there was continued progress in implementing procedural requirements at the school level. Appendixes present the study's conceptual framework and method of approach. (SB)",

An introductory chapter outlines the content of the report and the study design. Section II describes implementation of P.L. 94-142 in 16 special education service delivery systems in terms of resources of and demands on the special education delivery system, legal pressure of court cases and due process hearings and procedures, status of interagency coordination, and changes in services and beneficiaries. A third chapter focuses on services at the elementary and secondary levels in the areas of prereferral screening and intervention; evaluation and reevaluation practices; individualized  education program practices and parent involvement in decision making; the least restrictive environment; and personnel, roles, and inservice training. Program options, graduation requirements, and postsecondary opportunities are considered in Section IV. Among conclusions cited in a final section are that provision of mental health services remained an issue because no clarification has come from the Office of Special Education; that reevaluations every 3 years continued to be of low priority except in districts where external factors created pressure to attend to them; that the majority of LEAs targeted more resources to gaps at the secondary level than to any other level of the local special education service delivery system; and that school systems did not generally include  postgraduation opportunities in their domain of concern.

        "description":"To determine whether mainstreaming affects the nonhandicapped student's cognitive schema of the handicapped, a story about a physically handicapped boy was read to 28 fourth grade children in a mainstreamed classroom and 29 nonmainstreamed children. The 10 characteristics attributed to the handicapped boy in the story (acquisition items) and 8 novel characteristics (distractor items) were included in the subsequent recognition memory task. The number of errors made in the memory task reflected the extent to which the acquisition and distractor items were compatible with the Ss' handicap schema content. The closer the Ss' schema content approximated the social stereotype of the handicapped, the more errors they committed. The mainstreamed Ss made significantly fewer errors on the  recognition memory test, thus confirming the prediction that mainstreaming results in a less stereotypic handicap schema among the nonhandicapped students.

Insights from group dynamics and adult education methods are brought to bear upon the various methods and activities presented, with reference to determined  learning objectives. The activities have to do with students' preparation for communication activities that allow the student to reinforce the expressions, vocabulary and techniques for effecting communicative acts which were learned during the preparatory phase, and activities to improve communicative competence, such as correction of errors, grammar, listening comprehension exercises, and pronunciation exercises.

The literature review explores research on job satisfaction generally, teacher job satisfaction specifically, and studies concerning teacher attitude and the personal and situational factors acting as curricular influences. Initial analysis of a questionnaire provides a description of the sample (365 teachers), measures of job satisfaction, and rating for each of the curricular influence items by their means. The analysis discloses four correlations between job satisfaction and personal factors. Female teachers were generally more satisfied than male teachers.  Non-foreign language specialists were more satisfied than foreign language specialists. Significant positive linear relationships existed between job satisfaction and age, and between job satisfaction and total years of teaching. The responding modern language teachers showed a high level of job satisfaction and their overall response indicated concern with specific curricular influences, significantly related to job satisfaction for three-fifths of the items, and identifiable by factor analysis.

        "description":"The majority of Latin American immigrant students in ESEA Title VII Spanish/English programs that have been evaluated seem to suffer from inexperience in taking tests like the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS). This study was designed to assess test familiarity, language of the test, and literacy, and to examine whether certain alterations in the testing procedure might allow for better estimation of students' ability and program benefits. Limited English proficiency students in grades four, six, and eight participated in the study. Instruments used were the English and Spanish versions of the CTBS. Testwiseness training was developed and administered to half the groups. An oral administration procedure for students with limited native language literacy skills as well as  limited English proficiency was also developed. A sociolinguistic analysis and a psychometric analysis of the tests were developed and testwiseness materials were designed. The history of the development of the procedures, as well as the tryouts and revisions, a description of the teacher training, and a detailed analysis of the testing data comprise the greater part of the report. Attached to the study is the English version of a teacher's manual for training in testwiseness, a program adapted for use with the CTBS. (AMH)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to examine writing skill, particularly maintenance of coherence, in an environment where the information load was heavy and students would be expected to have problems organizing it. The students, all proficient in English, were enrolled in a postsecondary biology class. Two of the six students in the study had high objective test scores in the course, two had borderline and two had failing scores. Discussion and results of the study are presented in three parts. The first of these is a descriptive case study of two students whose learning of biology information got in the way of their coherence in writing. Under pressure to be relevant to the lead-in sentence assigned, the students began producing prose which, although clumsy, was shaped to follow logically  from the lead in sentence. The new structure, termed here \"predication load,\" carried more information and more types of information than their previous structure. In a second part, samples of six students' work were analyzed for predication load in order to compare essays written two months apart. The high predication load brought with it the possibility of increased errors and awkwardly constructed sentences. The final section explores the implications of the study, especially the hypothesis that predication load in writing is a function of the task. (AMH)",

        "description":"Some features of the American research university that might account for its success in facilitating research are suggested, and the philosophical foundations of the modern American research university and issues for the future are considered. The major universities of the United States have based their development during the 20th century on the principal that instruction and research belong together. There are roughly 100 research universities in the nation, and the faculties of these institutions have a major commitment to the performance of research and the training of new researchers. With the support of both internal resources and federal aid, the research universities account for the majority of the national output of basic research. The faculty researcher commonly comes to  the university through a long selection process. Among the vital characteristics sought in that process, beginning in the undergraduate years, are intellectual power accompanied by independence, courage, honesty, and &quot;taste,&quot; or the ability to choose from many possible paths. The research university commonly has a research structure that specifically appears similar to that of a business firm or a government agency. Future concerns are demographic changes, including the decreasing number of college-age persons, which will have effects on both the supply and demand sides. Other concerns are government regulation and direct intervention and the relationship between the research universities and other researcher environments, particularly industry. (SW)",

        "description":"Transcripts of three conversations on liberal education, recorded at a 1977 conference at St. John's College, Santa Fe, are presented. The idea that great books are the best instruments for liberal education is addressed, and it is suggested that great books demonstrate to the student what is possible in the way of inquiry and expression, and that a great book is one that proposes a possible truth. Opinions are voiced regarding whether a book that raises important questions should be included in a curricula, and generally the criteria that are used in determining great books. Attention is directed to the kind of ordering principle that is possible and appropriate for a curriculum of liberal studies, and the question of art and method is raised. The broader issue of the relation  of the undergraduate college of liberal arts to the modern university is also addressed, and it is suggested that the student should be taught the habit of inquiring into the foundations of the special disciplines. One view is that each discipline has its own proper methods and that a liberally educated person possesses the methods of the primary disciplines. Another topic of discussion is the purpose of studying works that represent the human figure acting and suffering. It is suggested by the editor that two main educational principles seem to underlie the conversations: the purpose of undergraduate study and the nature of learning. Participants took the position that the proper activity of undergraduate study is liberal education, or general education, and that learning is an activity  of the student in which the teacher may be helpful. Liberal education is concerned with the whole range of human knowledge and experience. (SW)",

        "description":"Testimonies on H.R. 1400, the Veterans' Education Assistance Act of 1981, which calls for a new GI bill education and training program for the All-Volunteer Force, are presented. The nature of the GI Bill is reviewed both historically and within the context of the present needs of the All-Volunteer Force. H.R. 1400 is designed to provide education assistance to accomplish three basic goals: readjustment assistance, recruitment incentive, and retention capability. The bill would allow a person with a high school graduate diploma to come on active duty and, for each month of good service, be eligible for $250 of educational benefits. In addition, after 6 years, a person would be eligible for $550 a month for 36 months. An important part of the bill is the transferability of these  educational benefits by the individual in the service to a spouse, or to children, after serving at least 8 years. In addition, the bill would establish a preservice education program, which would have discretionary authority to allow an individual to complete his or her education and training program prior to coming into the service, and the individual would be obligated to pay back 1 month of service for each month of educational benefits provided. Among the 32 witnesses offering testimony were leading experts from the military, reserve and active duty associations, veterans organizations, military dependents, representatives of the education community, and leading experts in the field of recruitment and retention with the Armed Forces. Statements submitted by AMVETS and the Paralyzed  Veterans of America are included. (SW)",

        "description":"The influence on freshman student attrition of the group with whom a student lives (i.e., the composition or contextual character of the collegiate residence unit) was investigated. Based on Tinto's (1975) model of college student attrition, a longitudinal study was conducted at a large, independent, residential university in New York State having a total undergraduate enrollment of approximately 10,000. Responses from 1,457 students to an initial questionnaire were evaluated in the summer of 1976 to assess students' expectations of a variety of aspects of the college experience, as well as selected background information. During the spring semester of 1977, a second questionnaire sought information on the reality of college experience. Usable responses were received from 763  freshmen. After controlling for students' precollege characteristics and individual levels of academic and social integration in the institution, the residence unit context was found to be reliably related to attrition/retention among men, but not among women. For men, those living in a residence unit characterized by comparatively higher levels of occupant commitment to the institution and to personal goals were significantly more likely to enroll as sophomores than were freshmen in units with lower levels of commitment among the residents. The results suggest that in assessing the influence of residence arrangements on attrition (or on any other educational outcome), the influence of the context of the residence can be differentiated (at least for men) for the influence of the unit's  type (e.g., dormitory, fraternity/sorority).

In addition, the academic program review process used at Ohio State University is described in detail, and the elements of loose coupling evident in that process are examined. Loosely coupled systems are organizations or organizational elements that are tacitly related to one another. Loosely coupled review processes typically have comprehensive purposes, variable review procedures, and program specific review criteria. Distinctions between tightly coupled and loosely coupled review systems are summarized. Program review at Ohio State University is a comprehensive,  faculty-based process; all aspects of academic programs are reviewed: teaching, research, and service activities, and graduate and undergraduate components. There are commonly four parties to each review: the program itself (faculty, students, and program administrators), the college to which the program reports, the graduate school, and the Office of Academic Affairs. A coordinating committee composed of senior faculty members outside of the program being reviewed assist self-study committees plan the review, manage the external review, and bring reviews to closure. Nine characteristics form the conceptual bases of program review at the university: flexibility, program definitions, self-study, parties to the review, openness, feedback, external review, peer coordination, and closure. It  is concluded that when program review is structured so that the process accounts for the university as an &quot;organized anarchy,&quot; the functions of loose coupling are apparent. (SW)",

The main objective was to seek information about alternative strategies to achieve educational equity, and to construct a frame of reference that could be used universally to organize efforts to improve the quality of educational programs as they relate to female administrators, faculty, and students, and to curriculum content that addresses distinctive needs of women. After briefly providing a historical perspective, a summary is presented of 226 responses to the first part of a questionnaire seeking information from social work programs about curriculum content on women in required and elective courses, and about extracurricular  activities that pertain to women's concerns. A summary is also presented of 131 anonymous responses to the second part of the questionnaire, which sought information about barriers to achieving equity for women. Barriers that were reported include barriers in curriculum planning and teaching, and noncurriculum barriers that relate to the profession, to the institution, to administrators and faculty, and to students. The development of five specific plans to achieve educational equity are institutional factors, consultant's relationship to program, organization of work group, focus of change efforts, selection of strategies for change, projected outcomes, monitoring and evaluation, and institutionalizing the gains. Limitations and problems encountered at program sites, and guidelines for  achieving equity are examined. (SW)",

Students routinely record their daily activities on preprinted pages. Quality control is maintained through weekly reviews by designated faculty and students' preceptors. Once reviewed, the data are entered into a computer in time for midterm  and final student evaluations. Output reports indicate availability and frequency of student participation in activities, both individually and as a group. This information is especially useful at mid-evaluation, since it highlights student experience voids in time to resolve them within the second half of the clerkship. Scheduling during the clerkship is planned to provide a sufficient number and variety of patient management experiences. A continual assessment of student activities is crucial to measuring curriculum goal attainment. The logbook provides quantitative data on the activities of students and the type of clinical skills that each student observes, performs, or assists with during the clerkship. It also indicates the number of patients worked up and followed through to  surgery and whether each student has had adequate experience in conducting histories and physicals and in making oral or written case presentations.

Specific topics include: the continuing education directors and staff; the continuing education program (CEP) as an organization; the CEP's programming, funding sources, and patterns; the CEP and linkages to its environments; the CEP's status and integration into social work education; flexibility versus standard setting and the need for institutionalization of the continuing education function; the evolving functions of the CEP; the emerging array of continuing education consumers; teaching modalities; and the CEP and its regulatory environment. By comparing current data with previous surveys, projects, and  literature, an attempt is made to depict the extent of growth, institutionalization, and integration of continuing social work education in relation to social work education and practice in general. Projections for the future are included, and emerging themes and pressures for continued growth of continuing social work education are addressed. Data were derived from five sources: the 1978 Continuing Education Directors' Survey, which is appended; site visits to CEPs connected with social work education programs; interviews and discussions with continuing social work education from the project advisory committee; and a literature search.

        "description":"Opinions of 162 University of Pittsburgh faculty concerning the basic academic skill levels of undergraduates now attending the university were surveyed in 1981. A majority of the respondents felt that the 1980 undergraduates possess basic skills levels that are lower than the comparable cohort of 1970. They felt the greatest losses were in writing ability, spelling, and reading. The predominant opinion for a decline in the basic skills levels of entering students was that their high school preparation in the basic skills was inadequate. Nearly one-third of the respondents felt that there was a deemphasis on basic skills mastery in modern society. Most of the respondents stated that developmental courses and services should be offered by institutions of higher education, and  about 58 percent favored not granting credits toward graduation for basic skills coursework, while about 42 percent favored the granting of credit to some degree. Just under half of the respondents would consider assigning a text that integrates traditional course content with learning aids to benefit students with deficient skills, while the majority favored assigning a study skills textbook that teaches undergraduates the specific reading, writing, and study skills required for the successful mastery of the subject matter in a specific discipline. If the university were to offer an inservice education program to help faculty in working effectively with students who have inadequate skills, about 51 percent of the respondents would be interested, and about 47 percent would not.

While one part of the projection deals with student headcount, total credit hour enrollment, and credit hour enrollment in different academic areas, the second part projects faculty instructional equivalent semester hour (ESH) or workload and faculty average ESH, the  number of course sections, and instructional ESH to be taught by part-time faculty members. Student headcount enrollment is projected as resulting from yield rates from various populations from which the college student is drawn. Total credit hour enrollment is regressed from the relationship previously established between headcount and total credit hour enrollments, and that between headcounts and student average load. Credit hour enrollment in each academic area is projected from the past trend using regression or moving average, and adjusted after consultation with academic deans and their staffs to incorporate new developments to improve the accuracy of the model. Credit hour enrollment for each academic area and all areas combined has been projected for two years and the results to  date are encouraging. The second part of the model is still in development.

        "description":"Need-based theories of work motivation are considered with particular reference to university faculty; it is hypothesized that three different types of people are attracted to the academic setting: (1) those who want to teach, (2) those who want to do research, and (3) those who want to do both. According to need theories, certain fundamental wants and desires over which people have little control are the activators and directors of all human behavior. Academic institutions, through the opportunities they provide, can facilitate or frustrate the gratification of these wants, and by doing so attract, retain, and motivate particular kinds of academic faculty. It is hypothesized that faculty as a group would tend to fit Maslow's higher order need structures and to be more mature in  the sense of that word as used by Argyris and McGregor. For most the the need theories, unsatisfied needs are thought to be the activators of behavior. It is suggested that college faculty are probably high on the need for self-actualization, growth, and achievement. As such, they will be attracted to moderately risky settings that offer them the opportunity to be autonomous, to be investigative, to be challenged, and to be successful. It is suggested that faculty who have their needs relatively satisfied are likely to take on a mentoring function while those who are frustrated are more likely to redirect their energies away from students and research. It is proposed that in order to effectively deal with the particular profile of the needs the typical academic may bring to the academic  environment, academic institutions must develop and maintain environments that permit gratification for a researcher and teacher by providing a specific combination of attributes.

        "description":"The meaning of terminology in higher education, particularly terminology that is multinational in its use and often confusing or misunderstood, is examined. It is suggested that graduate students as well as other scholars and researchers need to define terms. A term used in a statement of a problem or in a dissertation that may be variously interpreted must be defined in the way it is to be used. If a term is unfamiliar to the reader or if there is not a standard definition, or if there are many definitions, or if a term is used in a very specific meaning, the researcher is expected to define terms. For example, writers tend to use terms (e.g., civic university) that are not widely understood outside of one cultural context. Other terms are familiar, but misunderstood across  cultures (e.g., bachelor's degree). Some terms are so ethnocentric that they communicate nothing to others (e.g., accreditation). The confusion hinders communication, obstructs the translation of academic work across national systems, and makes it difficult to appropriately place foreign students in reputable institutions of higher education. It is concluded that it is possible to be precise about terminology in higher education, even when studying the subject comparatively and using concepts from a number of different national systems. Works in the field of comparative education that would be helpful to the researcher seeking to understand or define terms or concepts are identified and described. Specialized dictionaries, guides to the education systems of foreign countries or regions,  classification schemes, and other sources of information are identified. (SW)",

Participants in a public policy decision involving early childhood education were mapped onto four frequently used models of decision making: the rational, the bureaucratic, organizational process (Allison, 1971) and the garbage can or organized anarchy model (Olsen, 1975). Participants were employed by higher education institutions and were evenly divided by sex. Decisions involved the classification of child development programs and courses in the California numerical coding system and articulation between schools within the state system. Each of the four models can be described in terms of 15 key concepts, which provided the content of the test presented to participants, who could  associate their experience with one of the theoretical decision-making models by choosing statements that related to that model. Sixty Q-sort items were used to create four scores for each respondent, each of which represented the relative weight that the respondent attached to each of the four theoretical models. Participants had quite different impressions of what they were doing. While they all saw themselves as organizational actors, they divided equally over their rationalistic and political perceptions. Those who saw the situation as rational tended to be state employees, office of education workers and representatives of the university chancellor's office. Those who saw the situation as political tended to be campus-based program leaders who supported the growth of early child  education programs, particularly the ones that they had initiated.

Based on administration of the Student Information Form (SIF), data are reported separately for women and men, and for 38 groups of institutions. The major stratifying factors are institutional race (predominantly black versus predominantly white), type (two-year college, four-year college, university), control (public, private and nonsectarian, Roman Catholic, and Protestant), and the selectivity level of the institution. The normative data are based on responses from 192,248 freshmen entering 368 institutions. Data were collected by administering the 1981 SIF during registration, freshman  orientation, or the first few weeks of classes. The SIF is designed to elicit a wide range of biographic and demographic data, as well as data on the student's high school background, career plans, educational aspirations, financial arrangements, high school activities, and current attitudes. Weighting procedures for the SIF are described, along with an estimate of the total student population of first-time, full-time college students. The norms are also presented for the four geographic regions. Appended materials include: a list of participating institutions, the 1981 SIF, region categories and coding scheme for father's and mother's occupations; guidelines for judging the precision of the normative estimates and their comparisons; and a sample report furnished to a participating  institution.

The respondents were members of the Association for Institutional Research and they included seven institutional researchers and planners, three faculty members, four academic administrators, three nonacademic administrators, and three senior state board staff members. With regard to background, two factors were widely perceived to be valuable in most academic professional roles (excluding nonacademic administration): a doctorate and experience as a faculty member. The dominant theme among the responses from the seven institutional researchers was the need for an analytical  background or a background in policy analysis. Overall, responses suggest that the most important professional skills (in order) are (1) interpersonal, (2) writing, (3) analytical, and (4) management. The more technical skills (computer, research design, and statistical) received somewhat lower overall ratings. The faculty members placed more emphasis on research, and the two categories of administrators placed more emphasis on management skills. Many of the respondents viewed all of their professional activities as job-related, and they viewed the primary career options for institutional researchers as teaching, nonacademic administration, state-level administration/research, and institutional research. Several respondents suggested avoiding long-term careers in institutional research  and advocated a variety of experiences.

Norms and formulas included: student load formulas and weightings for level of study, academic staffing levels and staff/student ratios, and technical support staff ratios. It is hypothesized that expenditure on academic and related departmental staff will tend to cluster around the average more closely than will other expenditures.

Questionnaires were sent to 2,224 female graduates of 15 small, private, liberal arts colleges in the northeastern United States. An overall response rate of 53 percent was obtained. Analyses of variance indicate that there are no differences in aspiration level between graduates of women's colleges and coeduational colleges. For graduates of the two types of colleges, no differences were  found in the level of the organizational ladder aspired to, plans to enter male-dominated careers, or plans to pursue graduate or professional education. Innovativeness of chosen career was found to be related to selectivity; the more selective the college, the more nontraditional the occupation selected. A bibliography is appended. (SW)",

        "description":"The economic, social, political, and pedagogical issues that surround the notion of democratization of higher education are considered, based on various approaches being undertaken around the world to open up higher education to new population groups. Conservative, liberal, and radical interpretations of democratization and the role of education are reviewed. Four criteria for evaluating the extent of higher education opportunity in any national or regional context are: equality of access to higher education, equality of participation within the higher education institutions, equality of education results (success in completing once there is access), and equality of education effects in life changes in the future. Examples of democratization efforts are outlined under the  following categories: the expansion of facilities, reforms in admission policies, physical and/or temporal divorce of teaching/learning, different types of courses, and structural changes, including comprehensive reform. Major concerns of the highly developed countries and the developing countries with regard to educational opportunity, educational demand for higher education, and economic and social goals are addressed. Key issues cited in pursuing democratization of higher education include: equality and value judgments, whether equality of opportunity is an appropriate goal, equal versus maximum development, democratization within the university and in relation to society, and the equality equality-meritocracy dilemma.

Federal sponsorship of research is directed to better inform policy-makers who share responsibilities for the national interest in higher education. Attention is directed to the following concerns: assumptions about the role of higher learning in American society; the national interest in and state responsibilities for higher learning; the strategies that could be proposed for exercising federal responsibilities; the possible contribution to those federal responsibilities of an increased understanding brought about through federally sponsored research; and the most desirable information reporting and research strategy that could be  pursued from a federal perspective. Four of the roles that higher learning plays in American society are: the formal learning of the individual; the creation, organization, and dissemination of new knowledge; the socialization process for American adults; and a holding pattern for workers unable to fulfill employment aspirations. Federal responsibilities appropriate to higher learning include: insuring that the market environment of higher learning exhibit certain properties (e.g., equal access to higher learning); and providing opportunities for basic research. State governments are responsible for the creation and charter supervision of colleges and have some authority over the provision of education. Possible ways the National Institute of Education could promote federal and state  effectiveness in higher learning and policy oriented research are suggested identifying every several years topics it wishes to emphasize.

Participants included 60 college presidents, deans, faculty members, government officials, and business and foundation officials. Recommendations are as follows: (1) a collaborative effort should be taken to develop articulation of the humanities curriculum from the elementary to postsecondary level; (2) colleges and universities should review the quality of teaching in humanities in the general education component, and should encourage collaboration across the disciplines and the integration of education in the humanities on their campuses; and (3) colleges and universities should review graduate education in the humanities to  determine how it can better prepare young scholars in the humanities for teaching careers in the undergraduate classroom as well as for continued research activities. Conference participants agreed that the ultimate value of the humanities, beyond their intrinsic value as a form of knowledge, is in the development of practical wisdom in private life as well as in the conduct of thoughtful membership in democratic society. The humanities can also strengthen the quality of the public, professional, and intellectual life. Participants considered that the current difficulties of the humanities result, in part, from the vast changes in higher education during the past 20 years. They also discussed the isolation of the humanities, the needs of current humanities faculty, and the need for  connections between the humanities and the sciences, social sciences, career disciplines, and other curricula.

Methods of disseminating research results on the role of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada were also examined. Research on PSE covers reflective inquiry and scholarship, empirical investigation, and critical analysis. Within the universities, such research is undertaken by academics and graduate students in faculties of education, especially in centers for the study of PSE, but much more is done in other faculties and departments, notably economics, sociology, psychology, and history. It is  estimated that throughout Canada there are roughly 750 individuals engaged in research on aspects of PSE, about a third of them full time. The full-time researchers are primarily analysts in university and college institutional research groups or government departments and agencies. Almost all of the academics involved are part-time PSE researchers and for the majority of them, PSE is an area of secondary interest. The only scholarly association for which PSE is a matter of central interest is the Canadian Society for the Study of Higher Education (CSSHE). More long-term studies are needed and more that are interprovincial or national in scope. A lack of agreement on major themes and a lack of an integrating agent is noted, and it is recommended that CSSHE serve as a integrating agent.  Recommendations to the CSSHE and to the SSHRC are included. The questionnaires and a list of respondents are appended. (Author/SW)",

Role conflict for academic deans is related to clashing constituencies, role ambiguity, lack of correspondence between organization requirements and the personalities of incumbent deans, changing organizational needs over time, and historical trends in the definition of the deanship. Less than half the deans are evaluated annually, usually by presidents, chancellors, vice-presidents, or provosts. While satisfactions of deans have been reported with respect to the raising of academic standards at an institution, contributing to curriculum development, and hiring qualified faculty, dissatisfactions pertain to situations in which the dean is the initiator of  conflict, the dean is the defendant in an attack on the administration, or the dean is the conciliator. It is suggested that the role of the dean needs to be clarified with respect to planning, evaluation, resource allocation, and other administrative functions. Knowing what attracts individuals to the deanship and how the balance of satisfactions and dissatisfactions leads to the resignation of deans after a time would also be valuable. Mechanisms that would enable deans to maintain their scholarly interests so that they may return to teaching later in their careers may be important, along with research on the wisdom of retaining deans in their administrative positions. Since teaching is the primary activity overseen by deans, it is necessary to know more about how they might manage  resources of all kinds (including symbolic resources) to stimulate and maintain teaching excellence in their academic units.

The survey is a followup of a 1974 survey pertaining to collective bargaining and a 1971 survey concerned with general governance issues at the 240 representative schools. Attention is directed to: the impact of collective bargaining on governance and especially academic senates and administration at both the local campus and system levels; the likely beneficiaries of academic collective bargaining and the overall consequences for faculty, students, and higher education in general; the formalization of personnel relations, and tenure processes and  retrenchment at unionized and nonunionized institutions. Perspectives on the impact of the Yeshiva Court decision and the future of faculty collective bargaining are also presented. Of the 1,400 questionnaires mailed to college presidents, local faculty union chairpersons, systemwide administrators, and union leaders, 52 percent responded. More than 95 percent of both presidents and union chairpersons believed that bargaining has caused greater specificity of rules and regulations. Respondents believed unions have been least effective on their campuses in strengthening existing faculty governance (such as senates) and enhancing professional standing. Administrators said that unions have actually hurt in these areas. Overall conclusions of the three surveys include: some union chairpersons  are disillusioned with the outcomes of bargaining; and faculty personnel issues are at the heart of collective bargaining.

Teams from all public postsecondary education institutions in the state reviewed the basic concepts of strategic planning; critically analyzed the environment external to their institutions; observed a method to evaluate certificate and degree programs based on the criteria of quality, centrality, and viability; and listened to a presentation on various aspects of integration related to strategic planning. Materials and articles distributed to seminar participants contained detailed information about a broad range of demographic, social, political, and economic forces, trends, and their effects and impacts.  Projects started by national organizations and the results of implementation in two- and four-year colleges and universities were also examined. Tools for external environment assessment were needs assessment, trend analysis, environment scanning, and market analysis. Data gathering and analysis, which are designed to reveal the options for an institution, were addressed. After review of resources and examples, tools, and options, campus teams participated in a SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity, threat) analysis: an exercise to assist institutions to capitalize on strengths, minimize weaknesses, take advantage of opportunities, and eliminate or reduce threats. Lists of these concerns along with demographic, social, political, or economic factors, are included. It is recommended that  there is a need for: institutions to be versed in the strategic planning literature, guidelines for data collection and analysis, and additional workshops.

Variables were selected from a theoretical causal model of student attrition (Bean, 1981), a review of the literature (Bean, 1978), and five empirical investigations conducted by Bean. Nine main variables were: parents' educational attainment, performance in high school, absenteeism, the practical value of one's education, confidence in being a successful student, intent to leave, university grades, informal contact with faculty, and course attractiveness. Responses to a Likert-scale type attitude measure and information about the students were analyzed using stepwise multiple regression analysis. Intent to  leave was the strongest indicator of attrition. The nine variables and the interaction of five of these with grade point average were found to account for 62 percent of the variance in attrition. Students with different levels of academic ability withdrew from the institution for systematically different reasons. The effects of the variables (particularly practical value, absenteeism, confidence, faculty contacts, and courses) differed depending upon academic ability. Academic performance is not only an important predictor of student attrition, but interacts strongly with other variables affecting decisions to leave school. The importance of studying small, homogeneous groups in order to accurately describe a selected group (e.g., agricultural college students) is noted. A bibliography is  appended. (SW)",

        "description":"An overview is presented on one series within a set of higher education indicators being developed at the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS): a series dealing with the prices of tuition, room, and board. A Laspeyres-type index and a moving average are used to track tuition, room, and board prices for a sample of 2,488 institutions over the period from 1972-73 to 1979-80. The primary source of data was the annual Higher Education General Information Survey, the Institutional Characteristics Survey. Findings are disaggregated by type of institution (NCHEMS classification), public versus private control, and region of the country. Persistence, though not uniform, increases in average prices were found for all types of colleges and universities. Tuition  increases typically did not keep pace with inflation over the period as a whole, but did so during the last few years of the period. The tuition gap between public and private institutions became larger. On a percentage basis, tuition increases at public two-year colleges were relatively high, but those institutions still enjoyed a substantial price advantage at the end of the period. Average tuition at North Atlantic public institutions increased more rapidly than that of public institutions elsewhere in the country. Increases in room and board prices lagged significantly behind increases in the price of rent and food at home. As a group, public two-year institutions also experienced a substantial enrollment growth during the period. Data are presented on tuition prices at  doctorate-granting institutions, other four-year institutions, and by region, and other student expenses by living arrangement. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"A causal model of faculty research productivity was developed through a survey of the literature. Models of organizational behavior, organizational effectiveness, and motivation were synthesized into a causal model of productivity. Two general types of variables were assumed to affect individual research productivity: institutional variables and individual variables. Twenty propositions concerning individual research productivity were examined for both types of variables. Institutional variables are as follows: level of research emphasis at the institution, granting of advanced degrees at the institution, institutional reputation, size, degree of affluence, degree of centralization, and degree of autonomy of the institution. Individual variables are as follows: level of research  goals, number of research colleagues, degree of undergraduate teaching responsibilities, level of research resources, level of perceived equity of rewards, level of alienation, perceived level of legitimacy in one's research, level of expectancies, level of need for personal growth, level of publication in graduate school, period of time as a faculty member after beginning as productive in research, academic rank at an institution with a research emphasis, and level of individual autonomy for individuals with high levels of research goals. Several variables that have received mixed support in empirical research, and which are not included in the model are ability, sex, field, career stage, and prestige. A bibliography, summary information on empirical studies of faculty research  productivity, and a diagram of the causal model of faculty research productivity are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"In May 1980, the 1973-1979 minority graduates of the University California at Davis were surveyed about their employment, graduate and professional school training, career progress, and university experiences. The response rate was 33.7 percent. Minority groups included were American Indian, black, Chicano, Latino, and Filipino. Most had taken graduate level coursework, and felt well-prepared by undergraduate work. American Indians were most likely to have undertaken graduate work, be currently enrolled, and be full-time students. Eighty-three percent of the respondents were currently employed, most full-time, and in a broad range of occupations. Fifty-three percent felt their occupations were highly or moderately related to college major, with Filipinos most likely to feel them  highly related. Median annual salary of full-time workers was $16,500. Job satisfaction was generally high. Respondents also reported on their feelings of personal, intellectual, and social growth as a result of their college experiences. In each area, respondents reported that the university contributed very much or somewhat to their growth. Over three-quarters would definitely or probably choose to attend the university again if they could start college over. Filipinos were least likely to choose the same university again. Attitudes toward choosing the university again were related to feelings about preparation for current occupations. Comparisons with a similar survey of all graduates from 1973 to 1979 show great similarities between the groups. Results of both surveys are illustrated  in tables and graphs. The survey instrument is appended. (MSE)",

        "description":"Institutional vitality in higher education and measures of vitality are considered. Vitality may be viewed as the capacity of a college or university to incorporate organizational strategies that support the continuing investment of energy by faculty and staff both in their own careers and in the realization of the institution's mission. Institutional vitality in the 1980s must be understood in relation to the organizational consequences of both steady-state and decline. Organizational theories, institutional histories, and biographies of important academicians are cited that may illuminate the issue of vitality. An important idea pertaining to institutional vitality is Kanter's (1979) view of opportunity structure. Kanter argues that when times are not prosperous, the  institution must pay attention to its quality as an organization. Kanter addresses ways in which opportunity and power related to jobs and organizations are critical to motivation and leadership effectiveness. Peterson's (1980) emphasis on faculty response to decline and the ability of individuals in the organizations to lead effective professional lives leads to an emerging literature on faculty careers, including Rice's (1980) investigation of the professorial careers of former Danforth fellows, and Furniss's (1981) challenge to the &quot;one life-one career&quot; model. Indicators and scales for measuring vitality include: the Institutional Functioning Inventory (Peterson et al., 1970), Likert's Organizational Survey Profile (1976), the International Communication Association's Communication  Audit, and Scott's (1980) institutional indicators.

It systematically used the parties interested in policy development to identify the specific policies within their domain that are in current contention and also identify the arguments and claims on all sides of the policy in question. The report begins with a discussion of the research, and focuses on pluralistic research, which intends to inform all interested parties as well as the policy-makers. The second section describes the results of a three-phase investigation into policy-making. The first phase involved an extensive review of Congressional hearing begun in 1978. The second phase included interviews with Illinois legislators, legislative  assistants, and other state officials in state-level policy formation. The third phase consisted of interviews in Washington, D.C. with national organization representatives, Congressional staff, and other federal officials. From these sources were drawn the structure of interests surrounding policies, the content of issues being contested, and information of interest to parties to the policy process. Three segments of education policy are examined separately: secondary education, postsecondary noneducational activities, and higher education. Research problems and instrument design are discussed. A discussion follows of the pluralistic use of policy research, and data from a survey of the 1972 high school senior cohort (&quot;High School and Beyond&quot;) are used to examine three policy questions  of current interest: minimum competency testing, vocational education, and student loans. A list of references is given, and survey questionnaires and booklets and supporting forms are appended. (MSE)",
